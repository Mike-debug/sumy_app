4376666,25120,2020-09-28T14:05:21-04:00,"R. R. Donnelley has sold the remaining part of its logistics business to TFI.The significant transaction will cut net debt quite a bit, as the leverage situation continues to cause a real overhang with a soft core business.While the move is welcomed, the company still has a mountain of debt to take care of, as I see no imminent appeal here.","R. R. Donnelley & Sons (RRD) has reached a deal to sell a business unit, much-needed given the troubled state of the business and its finances. The company reached a second deal this year with TFI International to sell logistics assets and while the proceeds are much-needed and welcomed, the deal is not a game-changer with the already challenged remaining core business having seen another hit from Covid-19.Despite the very modest market capitalization in relation to the sales base, debt remains a big issue as continued losses makes that the debt overhang remains very significant, causing too much uncertainty to create any appeal or a compelling risk-reward situation.R. R. Donnelley reached an agreement to sell its DLS Worldwide Logistics business to TFI International in a deal valued at $225 million, with the deal being paid for in cash. Note that the deal does not include RRD's International Mail and Parcel Logistics business.DLS is a non-asset-based platform which provides logistics services through a third party network of sales staff, sales agents and agent stations. This includes LTL, truckload, forwarding, expedited, parcel and intermodal services. The business unit generated sales of $530 million on a trailing basis until the end of the second quarter.R. R. Donnelley furthermore reported that the deal is valued at 9 times EBITDA, already including stand-alone expenses and some corporate overhead allocation. Based on that information, the unit is set to generate about $25 million in EBITDA on little over half a billion in sales. Note that both R. R. Donnelley and TFI know each other very well after TFI already acquired the Courier Service business early in March.Investors have reacted with cautious optimism to the deal after shares have seen dismal trading action of course in recent years. Shares jumped from $1.17 per share to $1.37 per share overnight in response to the deal, although at these levels, the market capitalization stands around a hundred million!Hard to remember, but R. R. Donnelley was actually a $60 stock in 1998 and traded at $70 in 2007, and ever since shares have only come down, amidst a demise of the underlying business. The company continued to make acquisitions over time, only adding to the debt load while creating a diversified conglomerate without sufficient focus. This former parent company actually split up two other businesses in 2016.In February of this year, the company reported its 2019 results, with revenues down 7.7% to $6.28 billion, as organic growth came in at minus 2.3%. The business service unit generated $5.0 billion in revenues, comprised out of commercial print, logistics, packaging, statement, labels, supply chain management, forms and BPO. The marketing solution segment is a bit smaller with $1.3 billion in sales yet was showing growth, notably in direct marketing and digital print & fulfillment.The company reported $99 million in operating earnings, yet at the same time reported a net loss of $1.31 per share. Adjusted operating earnings came in at $246 million, for adjusted earnings of $0.66 per share. Most of the discrepancy stems from restructuring charges and alike, as net results took a beating as a result of the heavy debt load and associated interest expenses.Net debt at the end of the year stood at $1.63 billion, down a bit compared to 2018. The trouble is that organic sales declines and $434 million in adjusted EBITDA, is not only a very adjusted metric, it furthermore translates into 3.8 times leverage as the business continues lo lose money. By February, shares had already fallen to $3, thereby valuing equity at just over $200 million.The company guided for sales of $5.95 billion and adjusted earnings between $0.65 and $0.95 per share, yet that guidance was of course ahead of Covid-19. With Covid-19 obviously having a big impact in the first half of the year, this does not really allow for much deleveraging, in fact, net debt stood at $1.69 billion by the end of the second quarter, up a bit compared to 2019. This is disappointing as the company closed on a small divestment in the second quarter.With 72 million shares now trading around $1.40 per share, a market value of $100 million implies that the business is valued at $1.80 billion, of course assuming that bonds trade at par and will be repaid in full, as reality is that equity is just a call option here.The $225 million cash deal to sell the DLS Worldwide business will make a meaningful dent in addressing leverage, but the remaining operations of course will shrink in size as well. Net debt will fall to $1.47 billion and with $25 million in EBITDA leaving the door, leverage ratios should drop to 3.6 times if we look at the EBITDA numbers as of the end of 2019. Of course, these numbers have been taking a big beating in the meantime. Furthermore, the company continues to lose money based on GAAP accounting as the business environment remains utterly challenged, as undoubtedly taxes and/or transaction costs will make that net proceeds are a bit disappointing.While I am inclined to situations of low expectations, the situation does not look very good with the core business posting organic sales declines as a result of poor positioning, and the company furthermore shrinking as a result of continued divestments. While the deal helps in tackling the debt load to some extent, debt remains very high in absolute terms. All of this prevents me from getting too upbeat with Covid-19 putting another layer of pressure on the shares. Despite a welcomed divestiture, I see no compelling reason to get involved in this multi-year troubled story."
4312829,95266,2019-12-16T21:21:39-05:00,"Occasionally, as opposed to assessing the potential of a company by looking directly at it, it’s worthwhile to look at what’s coming at them through their supply chain.As early as the mid-nineties, the plight of R.R. Donnelley, a venerable commercial printer, may have foretold issues that are now beginning to face Iron Mountain.Therefore, it’s time to consider Iron Mountain as a low value-add landlord, and whether your funds are better invested in businesses who might rent from them.","If you’re like me, every so often you have trouble looking directly at an investment opportunity and deciding whether it is a good or bad idea at that moment in time. This is to be expected in markets where for every buyer there is a seller within a penny or two of where the stock is trading.How can I possibly be smarter than the guy whose stock I’m buying, or the gal who’s after the stock I’m selling? In addition to looking directly at the idea, important clues for answering this question may come from looking at companies on one side or the other of the subject’s supply chain:Years ago when I served some of the largest financial firms in North America, there wasn’t one that didn’t rely on Iron Mountain as the warehouse of their records. Their trucks with that immediately recognizable blue mountain logo were seen weekly rounding street corners to pick up blue bar, bankers’ boxes, what have you. Iron Mountain was well-known and highly regarded, including by me.But, in the mid-90s, information systems and process reengineering began to dramatically change document storage, retrieval, and management. Then, operations folks wheeled in and set up banks of equipment to scan and index records – account opening forms, letters-of-authorization, and so forth – using, for example, FileNet, later acquired by IBM (IBM). Once digitized, source paper documents were taken out to the curb and handed over to Iron Mountain. Remember all the walls lined with file cabinets; gone.As for “production copy,” I called the process, “mainframe to mail truck.” Computers would electronically produce confirms/ statements/ 1099’s/ payroll reports, in nightly/ monthly/ annual batch cycles, before we transmitted those files to big shops for printing and mailing. Donnelley was one such provider, an extremely reliable company with redundant facilities in case a disruption took down their Heidelbergs.Paper continued to be used because regulators didn’t completely trust financial companies with electronic images and, frankly, neither did these firms themselves. However, over time, confidence grew in the trueness, permanence, and reliability of electronic output processing. Paper production was limited to the fewer and fewer clients who wanted it; more and more preferred to go online for lookup and printing if necessary (I can’t remember the last time I received a confirm in the mail). In the nineties, to clear the clutter, shredders came into vogue including at the retail level. My wife and I bought our first ‘spaghetti-cut’ Fellowes and kept in the back hall; later, we upgraded to a cross-cut model.Ironically, the rise in popularity of shredders was the beginning of the decline for Donnelley. As the printer's revenue and income eroded, so did their stock price as shown in the graphic below. The transformation from printing and mailing paper to electronic imaging and distribution was not kind to Donnelley. Within a decade, RRD began to shimmy before collapsing. One only needs to toggle here on SA to see a company still struggling.Data by YChartsChange affected Donnelley relatively quickly. Why? Because, as noted above, print cycles occur daily, monthly, and annually. Once a client changes out a component of their cycle, they need only wait one period before dropping a previously involved vendor; paper cum electronic production is generally not the stuff of parallel conversions. There is handling and postage to save.But the transformation wasn’t quite yet complete. Printing and paper gave way to tape and disk storage; remember seeing reels spin or hearing your own drive whir? As we learned, these storage media had their own problems with speed and stability. They eventually gave way to solid-state including today to someone else’s solid-state, “the cloud.” Peripherally, software such as DocuSign (DOCU) is helping to deliver the coup de grace to paper records.But the specific storage medium should not be confused with the need for any of it. Documents often must be retained for many years; i.e., for the look-back on tax filings, or through the end of a long-term contract such as a licensing agreement, lease, or mortgage.With every addition and change in storage medium, Iron Mountain tunes their business model. It keeps up, but not ahead. When there was paper, Iron Mountain stored paper. When shredding rose in popularity so did those services offered by the company. When things went to tape, yes, Iron Mountain would safekeep yours. And, with data centers now in the fore, voila, they’re in the co-location business, a.k.a. ""co-lo."" Look at Iron Mountain’s website and you’ll gain some perspective on this. Look at these numbers right off SA and you will see that rent is gaining over other revenue:All this signals two problems for Iron Mountain. First, the company is not, never has been, and never will be, a primary data processor. Secondly, the functions offered by primary DPs are now almost completely electronic and seamless. No hand-offs are required, for example, between monthly statement production and cloud storage because it is all integrated into one continuous electronic job stream.Therefore, Iron Mountain is a landlord and an undifferentiated one at that. Yes, it can be in the data center business, but it will never operate what’s in those buildings, not the guts of end-to-end solutions – hardware/servers, system software and tools, application programs, and so forth. Moreover, in this end of real estate, location, location, location, doesn’t matter (except that you don't want them in a floodplain or on a fault line, duh); very few people need to go, much less are allowed, into a co-lo. Beyond that, there are dozens of competitors in the field with hundreds of facilities, including the likes of CenturyLink (CTL) that is somewhat differentiated insofar as they at least own/control the communications infrastructure into and out of their data centers whereas Iron Mountain does not.(FYI, I oversaw the contracting and move of a global hedge fund’s data center into co-lo with disaster backup/recovery in a separate facility, with a different provider, on another power grid, two states over, hundreds of miles away. Getting bids from a sizable number of local, ubiquitous, providers was no problem whatsoever. Within tier levels, the business is commodity-like.)If buildings connected to public utilities and a backup generator are where you want your money, go for it. Perhaps Iron Mountain or Digital Realty Trust (DLR) is for you. Give me the business end of the equation any day. I’m talking about companies like Accenture (ACN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) (who partner with Iron Mountain) steeped in all things I/T and process engineering where data centers are important but hardly their reason for being. Internalize this chart:Data by YChartsKnowing how information technology and process reengineering unite and evolve is often more important than numbers and financials in understanding the promise of stocks in companies such as Donnelley, and now Iron Mountain. Whether in storage, shredding or, now, data centers/co-lo, this REIT landlord is the trailer behind the tractor, the drooping tail behind the eager dog. While many investors seem satisfied with inanimate buildings, count me among those who prefer what's in them... including intellectual property.PS. I am not a short."
4226138,97936,2018-12-04T10:31:25-05:00,"PYS is a third-party trust that has YTM of 13.6%, while its underlying bonds have the same metric at 7.7%.The product in question trades at 30% discount to the NAV of the trust.The credit risk of PYS is exactly the same as the risk of the underlying bonds and is rated ""B-"" by S&P.The large arbitrage spread allows a long-only approach with a hedging reaction.","As the holidays are approaching, it is time to share with the public one of our top ideas for the new year. Our readers are probably familiar with this arbitrage trade, but the arbitrage keeps on widening. The undervalued product in this arbitrage is ML Depositor PPLUS Trust 6.30% R.R. Donnelley Certificates RRD-1 (NYSE:PYS), while the overvalued product is the 6.625% bond of R.R. Donnelley (NYSE:RRD) maturing on 4/15/2029, CUSIP 257867AG6.The Third-Party Trust Preferred Securities (TRuPS) are actually debt instruments masquerading as a stock.If we may break it down:ML Depositor PPLUS Trust 6.30% R.R. Donnelley Certificates RRD-1. Let us quickly go through the details surrounding this product coming into existence before delving into further details:Source: SEC.gov - Form 424B5 by PPLUS Trust Series RRD-1Now, you might notice a slight discrepancy in the Nominal Yield between the Underlying and the Trust Preferred - PYS - and you are correct to wonder what kind of financial engineering has occurred.Apparently, a 'commission' in the form of PPLUS Class B 0.325% Callable Trust Certificates Series RRD-1 has been snatched by Merrill Lynch.And last but not least, we should note that the bonds in the trust are part of a $200M issue, of which, $158M is still outstanding, while the Trust holds only $60M of the aforementioned, which essentially are the underlying product of PYS.Having covered the important facts related to this product let's have a look of the basic parameters of PYS itself:Source: subscribers' spreadsheet.To prove this, I will post several facts:Source: Standard and Poor's.And, of course, a quote from prospectus:An SEC filing:Here, one can see how PYS interest is earned. We explained it at the beginning of the article and here is the actual payment received from the underlying bonds. $60 mln of nominal value held in the trust pays 6.625% * $60 mln / 2 = $1.9875 mln semiannual payment. 6.30% out of 6.625% goes to PYS holders, which is $1.890 mln and the remaining 0.325% out of 6.625% goes to the class B holders. There is a 300 mln and the remaining 0.325% out of 6.625% goes to the class B holders. That's it, no fancy mathematics here. If the underlying bond pays its interest, PYS pays interest.Based on all these facts, one would really expect PYS and the underlying bonds to trade at similar YTM.Once we have some certainty about the relation between PYS and the underlying bonds, it is time to examine the whole family of the underlying bonds.Source: Finra MorningstarYield curve of all the callable bonds:I have separated the bonds that are callable because they have a more ""normal"" yield curve. Looking at this curve, it seems that market does not treat them as extremely toxic. I bet one can find a General Electric (NYSE:GE) bond with a higher YTM. I don't know if the market is correct in pricing RRD bonds, but I know PYS has a yield to maturity of 14%. On the next chart, I have included the other bonds of RRD and PYS.Yield curve including all bonds and PYS:Source: author's spreadsheetFor some reason, the non-callable bonds of RRD have higher yields. I will not dig further into this because, for me, the fact that is interesting is how much PYS had deviated from the company's yield curve. The arbitrage here is superior to any other arbitrage inside the curve.If we leave all the management talk and look at the numbers alone, RRD is a highly leveraged company that operates in a business with low margins. They have almost $7 bln of revenue and fail to be constantly profitable. The company has been losing market value as well for the last several years:Source: Google search.It seems that commercial printing used to be quite profitable in the last century. Currently, the margins are not that great as seen here:The cost of revenue is constantly around 80% with selling/general/administrative expenses constantly around 12%. Add to this $2 bln of debt that eats around 2% of the revenue only for interest expenses. From a bond perspective, the revenue stream is not disastrous and bond yields prove this. The business seems to have very stable revenue stream and expenses are not deviating a lot either. All the nasty accounting surprises as the one in 2016 are related to goodwill impairments:Impairment of goodwill is not something that means much to bondholders in terms of credibility. In fact, it can be positive for not paying taxes when the company is profitable in the future. Even if the business does not improve in the future, the company looks like it is capable of meeting its debt obligations.There was some recent refinancing, which shows that the company is somehow managing its debt and is trying to extend maturities even though at quite a high price......and here is the data related to the term loan:Source: SEC filings of the companyI will leave (for now) to the reader to decide if the whole yield curve of the company's bonds is overvalued compared to the term loan at LIBOR+5%. What is the reasoning behind this refinancing is something we can only guess. Extending maturity, improving the term structure of the obligations at a high cost might not be quite profitable and of best interest to common stockholders, but is without a doubt showing that the company is managing its debt with its vision of the future. The term loan gives more flexibility, but at some point may be a large negative to bondholders. One should never consider any kind of financing positive for the company without looking at its price, ranking, and restrictions. What should really worry any long-term holder of PYS and its underlying bonds is that the term of this loan is shorter than the term of PYS underlying bonds. The bonds being redeemed with the money from the loan were the same rank while this new obligation is above in the capital structure.Market capitalization of the common can usually act as a buffer to bondholders, but that is not the case with RRD. As of the last report, the debt of the company is $2.18 bln while the market values the company at around $440 mln. This is a 5-to-1 ratio. On top of that, the common stock is quite volatile and a secondary offering will be very hard to price and execute and will not bring much fresh capital unless the company decides to hit its stockholders with massive dilution.To summarize my view of the company, I will split it into 3 parts:Now the picture is getting clearer and is time to look at similar to PYS products.Once we understand what PYS is and have had our look at the company and its bonds, it is time for my favorite part - relative value. There are several third-party trusts we can compare with PYS:Source: our preferred stock databaseAll of these securities are structured almost identically and carry the risk of their underlying bonds. Here we can see the underlying bonds and their yields:Source: IB platformOn the next picture, I want to examine the relation of the yield to maturity of a third-party trust and its underlying security. What you see in the chart below is the first divided by the second:Source: author's spreadsheetGuess what, we have a champion! PYS YTM is almost 2 times higher than the yield of its underlying security. J.C. Penney (JCP) third parties are the biggest competitor, but, in this case, the underlying bonds trade at 20% yield to maturity. It is kind of normal to panic in this situation being a holder of the third-party trust. Lehman ABS Corp Bkd Trust Certs 2004-06, Floating Rate Goldman Sachs Cap I (JBK) is also high in the chart, but this one should not be in the group even. His life story is that it is redeemable while the underlying bond is not. On top of that, it became floating while the underlying remained fixed. I have included it in the chart just to explain this and to show that when there is a significant deviation, there is a reason.As explained in the article, these third-party trusts have assets in the trust. These assets have their market price, and it is not hard to calculate at what discount or premium a certain third-party trades. This is exactly what you see in the chart below:The only competition PYS faces is Synthetic Fixed-Income Sec STRATS 2006-04, 7.00% News Corp (GJV) and here the story is totally different. The underlying bond trades well above par, because it is not callable, while the third-party trust is callable and is pinned to par. You can see that all the stocks in the chart that have low-yielding underlying instruments trade above 90% of NAV. What I find really surprising is that ML Depositor PreferredPlus 8.375% Citizens Commun Certificates CZN-1 (NYSE:PIY) is trading also higher than 90% of NAV. The only difference here is that when PYS was issued, Class B trust certificates were also issued to eat some small part of the underlying assets distributions. This does not change the picture that much:And we have already shown how much value the Class B trust certificates have. They will receive roughly $200,000 per year until maturity. Even if we take into account all future payments for Class B holders and pay them today, the amount will be around $2 mln. This in no way can explain the 30% spread in discounts between PYS and PIY. There is absolutely nothing that is available to the public that can explain this.First, let's take a look at how arbitrages work in low volume products:At first, there is a small arbitrage that even traders don't pair trade. Then the arbitrage widens and traders are in for the fast easy money. But surprisingly no one big is willing to participate, because it is not worth the effort for them. This leaves the small trader wondering ""what I missed this time"".Very often, it is just a matter of time for logic to prevail and it is all about timing. PYS is a fairly low volume instrument. The same applies for RRD common stock and all of its bonds. Bonds are not being traded actively by the general public. Too many people don't care at all about such low volume products as PYS. There is quite a big chance 70% of the readers of this article have never even heard about PYS. So we are in a situation that there is not much money on the table for the big players and the small traders are not really familiar with the opportunity. A low volume product like PYS catches a bad trend, some panic in the common stock and the next 50 K shares sold have the price dropping significantly. The big question that remains is if it is PYS that is undervalued or the bonds that are overvalued. One can never be certain of the direction of any financial instrument in the future and if you are sure about something, market will surprise you.The only market participant who is short the underlying bonds of PYS by default is the RRD company. It definitely makes sense for them to be buying PYS at the open market. Depending on their execution they can lock all the arbitrage potential as profits and by looking at their quarterly reports, they are not in a position to pass on this opportunity. At current prices, there are at least $15 mln on the table, which will, of course, be very hard to lock as profits even for RRD. Once they start buying heavily the arbitrage will be gone. What they can do is to constantly buy small amounts of PYS while there is a stubborn seller. If there is no one at the company who can do the job, I am certain they can outsource this duty to any trader there is out there. I am buying PYS for my own account but will have no problem buying it for RRD as long as it is not a conflict of interests. The joke aside, it is a real opportunity for the financial management of the company to retire some part of its debt at a very low price and in a very fashionable way that can earn them some financial novelty award.Long only PYS with monitoring the bonds is the best strategy that comes to mind for the people who are not actively trading. The risk reward in this one and the potential price appreciation is quite attractive. The strategy will be to hold PYS until there is a significant narrowing in the arbitrage. If lucky enough the arbitrage will narrow by PYS moving higher. For the active traders - you know what to do.My personal price target at the moment of writing is $20.31, but keep in mind this target changes as the price of the underlying security changes.PYS is the biggest fixed income arbitrage I see at the moment. There is no public information available to defend the deviation from NAV. The arbitrage is so large at the moment that even an only long position can be initiated. The RRD company is highly speculative, but if earnings do not surprise us in the future, bonds may end up being just fine. While I think that the company's bonds are overvalued PYS is a strong buy for the following reasons:"
4167426,97936,2018-04-30T07:00:00-04:00,Real 10% yield to maturity compared to the usual dividend yield promoted widely on Seeking Alpha.30% discount to net asset value from a third-party trust holding a single bond.An opportunity to take the risk of a 6.7%-yielding bond and receive 10+% yield.,"The idea of ML Depositor PPLUS Trust 6.30% R.R. Donnelley (RRD) Certificates, RRD-1 (NYSE:PYS), is probably clear to all of my readers, but here is the summary.In short, PYS is a third-party trust that holds RRD bonds. The yield to maturity of the bonds is 6.7% at a price of 97.5% of Par, while the yield to maturity of PYS is around 10.30% at a price of 18.60. The trust holds $60 mln nominal value of the bonds currently valued at $58.5 mln. There are 2.4 mln shares of PYS outstanding, so the simple calculation of net asset value per share is $24.37. PYS currently trades at $18.60, and we have been trying to find the reason for the last several months. Well, we failed.Before starting with PYS, I want to share with my readers some very profitable pair traders we did recently based on articles or ideas published on SA. The idea here is not to show off (because we have losing picks as well), but just to remind the public that financial logic sooner or later prevails:Arbitrage in baby bonds vs. preferred stockResult so farThis one was really profitable for arbitrage trading:Preferred stock vs. preferred stocksThe resultThis one was not profitable for arbitrage trading because of very high hard-to-borrow fees even though the idea looks perfect on the chart.And a one that includes a third-party trust vs. underlying bonds that was available only to my chat subscribers:And the yield comparison to underlying bonds posted on the same date:And the resultAfter showing you that some of the arbitrage ideas work sooner or later, it is time to start with the current one.What I am doing currently is to compare the two instruments statistically.I have no historical bond data, but I have the charts for the two instruments and will do the comparison as if it is the prehistoric era.Here is a five-year price chart of the underlying bond and PYS that compares them at least visually:I cannot use my statistical software to show all the deviations, so my method is to see where PYS was trading when the underlying bonds were around their lows marked with green numbers in the chart. In the last five years, there was one similar deviation like the current one, but surprisingly it was in favor of PYS. Bottoms 3 and 4 saw the bonds falling much more than PYS. When the bonds were trading near Par value, PYS has also traded close to Par until recently. The behavior of PYS in 2015 and 2016 when it did not respond to the sell-off in the bonds has made me biased, and I was thinking that it is always overvalued. In fact it has been fairly valued most of the time, but the arbitrage trade handles volatility poorly. In fact, this is the only time in the last five years when PYS makes a low while the underlying bonds make a high.I also looked at the last distribution report by the trust:And it is business as usual. Class A holders (PYS) receive their $1.987 mln in distributions and Class B holders receive their $97,500. There is nothing so hard to understand in the trust. As long as the underlying bonds pay their interest and mature normally, PYS holders will receive their distribution as in prospectus and eventually their principal at maturity.The credit rating of PYS is exactly the same as one of the underlying bonds. I understand that the broad public has some concerns about credit rating agencies, but these guys can read 50 pages of prospectus and understand what a third-party trust is. PYS has around three SEC fillings per year, and if the analysts at S&P miss a credit event here, it would be really suspicious. I personally believe them when they treat PYS credit rating as exactly the same as the underlying bonds.In an event of default, Class B holders want to take part of their future payments. There is an allocation ratio and so on. In this case of a default, we can assume that the maximum Class B holders will get is their full amount of future payments. This equals to roughly $2mln, which is around 80 cents of distributions stripped from PYS. This is a very exaggerated amount. A default would probably hurt our PYS position a lot, but the underlying bonds trade at a yield of 6.7%. Yes, they are not AAA, but it is not like bond holders are in panic. We currently have a lot of reaction if a default does not happen in one day. It is very hard to protect yourself from catastrophic events. This is true for any bond you are holding. RILYG trades at a higher yield than the underlying bonds, but is among our favorite holdings.Of course this looks funny when we see the big picture:Definitely not a stable chart, but here the point is not to look at the credibility of RRD. We assume the bond market knows its job and the bonds of RRD trade at lower yields than many of my positions. For example, SSWN matures in one year and traded at close to 5.7% at some point before its ex-dividend date.This is a three-year bond of RRD that trades at 5.8% yield:So basically the bonds and the company can do whatever they want to do, but we can virtually just buy one of the bonds 30% cheaper than its current market price.I am scared to write the price target on this thing, but it has to have the same yield to maturity as the underlying bonds. The theoretical price target on PYS is $24.39. This is the price where its YTM is around 6.70%. This is the price where $24.39 (Price of PYS) * 2,400,000 (shares outstanding) equals 0.9759 (price of the bonds) * 60,000,000 (nominal amount of bonds held by the trust).This gives us 31% capital appreciation potential. This is insane for fixed income arbitrage. What can we be missing?I have read any recent documents there are in SEC, I have read the prospectus numerous times, and even though my understanding of financial law is very limited, I personally continue to consider this mispricing as a great trading opportunity.Here is a statement that gives further confidence there is nothing wrong with the trust:There is even a statement in prospectus that a holder of PYS under some conditions can exchange it for the underlying bond. I am not such a large player, but it is only a $5 mln holder, so who knows when will this one get the interest of a large buyer. They might be already accumulating their position. If I had client money, I would be doing this arbitrage for them for sure.The stock market is not built in a way so that there are many undervalued assets. This is why most of the research everywhere is based on relative value. Stock ""X"" trades at 300 times P/E so Stock ""Y"" at 200 P/E ratio has to be undervalued. This is a primer on what market participants view as undervalued in the recent years. In the example of PYS, we are talking about a real arbitrage opportunity that large holders can capitalize on. Here is a quote from prospectus:And more explanation on page 30 of the prospectus:What all this means is that there are PYS holders who can capitalize on the proposed arbitrage in the article. As long as someone is willing to sell PYS below 72% of Par and the bonds are trading at 97% of Par, it is just a calculation of ""can we really execute the arbitrage without affecting the potential profit"". A large player can probably bid the whole issue of the trust at these prices and convert to the underlying bonds. The big question is how much of the spread will be gone. For me personally, it does not matter. Sooner or later the mispricing will be gone. Whether it will be a large arbitrageur interested in converting to underlying bonds or just the not so clever market, PYS will at some point be again overvalued compared to the underlying bonds.PYS is the same thing as the underlying bonds and has to trade at the same yield to maturity as the bonds because:Default for the RRD bonds is the real risk that any holder of PYS faces. If the credit situation at RRD worsens, we have a lot of time to react and to sell our PYS position while there is still a hedging reaction with the underlying bonds. This is a very low volume product, and it can do whatever it wants to do regardless of its fundamental logic, so the trade cannot be taken without consideration of its low volume. Based on financial logic and all available data, PYS is a strong buy with 30% capital appreciation potential. In short, it is a 6.7% bond substitute that gives you 10+% yield to maturity. Arbitrage does exist... again."

Donnelley & Sons Company is an integrated printing, logistics and supply chain and digital marketing company, with revenues of about $7 billion.Despite a large revenue base, the company is currently free-cash-flow negative and margins are tight (and worsening).While it is generally worth avoiding RRD stock, my bias is to the downside, and it might be worth investigating the potential for an options play.","R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (RRD) is an American commercial printing, logistics and supply chain and digital marketing company. It describes itself as a ""global, integrated communications provider enabling organizations to create, manage, deliver and optimize their multichannel marketing and business communications.""This publicly-traded company is actually the remains of what once was a larger business with well over $10 billion in annual revenue. However, in August 2015, the company announced that it would spin off two other assets that would effectively create three different companies (the other two are LSC Communications, and Donnelley Financial Solutions).What remains, and as represented by RRD stock, is basically a global, commercial printing business.R.R. Donnelley is one of those companies that tends to turn up on stock screening tools when searching for ""cheap"" companies. The company's EV/EBITDA multiple is currently approaching just 5x. The price-to-sales ratio is less than 10%. And even price-to-free-cash-flow is less than 6x.The stock's prevailing dividend yield is also approaching is 8%.However, multiples are myopic and give no explicit consideration for the underlying prospects of the business. In the next section, I will quickly examine whether or not the ""cheap"" multiples are deserved or not.In terms of revenues, the company currently generates about $7 billion. The top line is also apparently growing. However, fundamentally this is not a growth business. Restated revenues (i.e. adjusted for spin-offs) for this business were about 2-3% higher in FY 2014 than they were more recently in FY 2017:Over the long term, revenues are basically growing at 2-3% at best, and marginally falling at worst (depending on which base year you use). Nevertheless, for a conservative model, we could price in 2% long-term organic growth to perpetuity (even if we shouldn't be counting on this).Further, the company's EBIT margin is currently just 3% with respect to the trailing-twelve-month, or TTM, period. EBIT (Operating Income) was $211m, as compared to revenues of $7,015m. Meanwhile, gross margins fell to almost 18% (from closer to 20%).Still, to be conservative, let's say that the management team is able to stabilize margins at 5% gradually over the next 10 years. (The company last saw a 5.0% EBIT margin in 2014. That was across the entire business at that time, which included the now spun-off businesses.)The range of outcomes based on these assumptions differs quite a lot based on the discount rates used. If we use a discount rate of just 8% (which is obviously far too generous for a business as risky as this), this would imply upside of 258% (to $25.59 per share). However, with a more appropriate discount rate of 15%, you are looking at further downside of -21% (or $5.65 per share, compared to the current $7.15 per share).See the table below for a mix of different assumptions and their implied upside/downside outcomes. (Note: I have highlighted each changed assumption as you read the table from left to right, to make it easier to read.)(Note: I have simply kept tax rates at 27%. If we took into account the tax-value of past losses accrued, this would boost some of the upside cases by up to a dollar per share.)The 100% downside outcome is actually a possibility. This is basically signifying that the value of the company's debts exceeds the enterprise value of the company, thus wiping out the equity value.The problem with going short is that a turnaround story could occur. RRD stock has basically fallen through the floor; it has fallen by 40% over the past year, and its stock remains in a strong downward trend. Nevertheless, if the moving averages were to break, and better financial releases encouraged a more optimistic investor base, the stock has the potential to pop.My bias is to the downside, since gross, EBIT and net income margins have all fallen, TTM free cash flows are negative, TTM dividends were over 6x TTM net income (hence the high dividend yield which is not to last), and the fact that interest expenses are sucking up practically all earnings before interest and taxes. (TTM interest coverage is about 1.22x.)Also, reported shareholders' equity has been negative for about six quarters now. That means the debt-to-capital ratio has been over 100% over this period. It is also increasing. The company's debts now run at about $2.2 billion.It looks like it would be worth avoiding RRD stock entirely. However, this sort of situation may be interesting from an options standpoint.One could potentially consider buying out-of-the-money call options (as far out as possible) to capture any freak upside over the long haul, while also buying out-of-the-money put options to capture any downside in a major downside scenario (i.e. a price crash of -60%, and/or even worse: an insolvency event that wipes out equity entirely)."
4149499,97936,2018-02-22T13:42:58-05:00,"As we have discussed in our previous article, this third party trust is providing us with an opportunity for arbitrage.We have used calculations and graphs in order to support our thesis, which clearly evaluates the potential trade.Equal YTM for equal credit risk is the main concept here.","We have provided an interesting arbitrage opportunity in our previous article about R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) posted on 01/18/2018. The current situation implies that the arbitrage is widening. We do not seek to defend any losing strategies, and we will provide you with an exact explanation of our current idea. In arbitrage trading, any deviation without a fundamental reason is a movement on the demand curve of the arbitrage. Contrary to just averaging down, here the logic is really:The more it widens, the more you want to take the arbitrage trade. This skews the risk/reward in your favor.The idea remains the same. Holding ML Depositor PPLUS Trust 6.30% R.R. Donnelley Certificates RRD-1 (NYSE:PYS) is actually like holding the underlying bonds. There is no reason for the two products to have such a large YTM spread.At present, we have a weak market, weak TLT and weak common stock - which might be the reason for the selling in PYS. This can be clearly seen in the graph provided below:Source: Yahoo FinanceHowever, our buy signal is still valid, since the underlying asset 6 5/8% Debentures due 2029 Issued by R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company price is hovering at almost same levels, while the price of PYS is falling. This is illustrated on the charts below:Source: MorningstarOn the left side, we have the price of the underlying asset (CUSIP: 257867AG6) which is currently trading at $92.61. On the right side, we have a chart that shows the price of PYS as a percentage of par value. We can clearly see the deviation and the arbitrage opportunity that persists at present since PYS trades at a huge discount in comparison to its NAV (the underlying bonds). PYS currently trades at 70.64% of par or 17.66 at the close of 09.02.2018. In order to match its NAV, the price needs to go up.We will use the yield-to-maturity as a best comparison between the two products. The financial logic shows that the YTM needs to be the same.Underlying Bonds (RRD3673769): 7.42% YTM at a price of $92.61.PYS: 11.64% YTM at a price of 17.66.In order to match its NAV, the price of PYS needs to be 22.89.Our further research, going through the prospectus, revealed that in case of default, the series B holders of the trust have some rights. For the worst-case scenario, we assume that if the bonds default, series B holders are paid in full as if they are senior. This will strip around 3.5% of nominal value or roughly $1. So, our worst-case scenario (exaggerated) is for PYS to be always trading $1 lower than what is equal YTM with the underlying bonds. With a target price close to 22, PYS is still a bargain.Despite the above-mentioned arguments, we must consider all the risks that arise at present. We have the market risk and the specific risk about the company. We need to be careful, check the bonds price, and evaluate if there is any panic that can reduce the potential of the arbitrage. A way to hedge the trade is to short the bonds, but this can express some difficulties for the retail investor. What is more, we have provided a chart that clearly shows the huge deviation of PYS as a % of PAR after the financial crisis.Here, you can clearly see that a 2008 scenario would be disastrous for the trade. PYS went to 25% of par while the bonds lost to only 50% of their nominal value. Is 2008 to happen again and when? You never know, unless you know.We must take into account that the product is not very liquid, which makes a potential entry/exit a little bit complicated. The way to hedge the trade (short the bonds) could be extremely hard to do because these products can only be shorted if you take 100,000 USD nominal value position (per Interactive Brokers). One way to trick the system is to spot a bid lower than 100K in size and place an order of 100K to ""hit"" that bid. Once the order is filled with a lower quantity, you just cancel the remaining order size.Currently, I am fully hedged, but I deviate around this by taking more size in PYS when extreme valuation occurs. I will hold this one for the nice profit it may give us once the market calms down."

That's all.,"In case you didn’t catch the movie when it flitted across movie screens in 2012, Trouble with the Curve is a sports-drama star vehicle for Clint Eastwood. He plays Gus, a geriatric baseball talent scout whose failing eye sight gives estranged daughter Mickey reason enough to tag along as the assistant on what could be Gus’ final scouting job. With dialogue as stilted as the snippet quoted above, I wouldn’t suggest renting this one. But that justification from Gus for child abandonment still sounds every bit as disingenuous as the justification R.R. Donnelley & Sons (RRD) gave when it broke with its own family a year ago.This really did begin as a simple exercise, a review of RRD to see why the stock is dropping 44% year to date and RRD bonds are at stressed levels with spreads north of 500 basis points over Treasuries. I tracked the impact of the spinoffs from RRD over the past year and, well, no pun intended, got dizzy looking at the graphs. And while the next several paragraphs may indicate that yet another analyst has fallen down a rabbit hole of detail, I would encourage you to stick with it for two reasons. First, I will offer up my best trade ideas to help limit the damage from what has thus far been a nauseating ride for RRD shareholders. Second, the issues raised by RRD’s corporate dismemberment go well beyond the one company to larger issues about recent spinoffs in general. The tail end of this review includes thoughts about how to steer clear of something like this in the future.RRD is a printing services company whose equity sometimes lands in my sieve for LBO candidates (e.g., low valuation multiples, high tangible assets, modest forward capex, reasonable liquidity, stable cash flows) and whose debt periodically bleeps on my credit stress radar screen (e.g., 5-year CDS prices or Z-spreads above 500 basis points, bond yields a lot higher than comparable credits). In September 2014, I bought RRD common stock because of its then relatively low P/E multiple and, if my memory is correct, some notion that RRD was about to strike it rich in 3-D printing. Crazy, no…? In any case, I was rescued from this daydream in February 2015 when insiders tipped me off by selling their own shares. I followed their lead and sold too, booked a profit and, candidly, didn’t think much further about RRD or the printing business for many months afterward. Then I went looking recently for investment ideas in the land of spinoffs – it’s another event, after all.Six months after I exited my investment, in August 2015, RR Donnelley announced it would split into three independent publicly-traded companies through the tax-free spinoffs of Donnelley Financial Solutions (DFIN) and LSC Communications (LKSD) in transactions valued at $608.9 million and $890.4 million, respectively. As detailed below, DFIN focuses on financial services clients and LKSD on publishing/retail and office products. The rest of the old RRD, the huge, diversified communications company I knew in the past, was turned into a much slimmed down but still “leading global provider of multichannel solutions for marketing and business communications”. It was left with two key activities: product promotion/logistics and variable print. By way of comparison to DFIN and LKSD, as of the announcement date, the remaining RRD had a separate equity market cap of $660.8 million.R.R. Donnelley completed the transaction by issuing 1 share of DFIN and 1 share of LKSD for every 8 shares of RRD held by each RRD stockholder and the DFIN and LKSD shares began trading separately on September 28, 2016. In connection with these transactions, on October 3rd, 2016, RRD completed a 1 for 3 reverse stock-split for its own shares (leaving RRD with 70 million common shares outstanding today). Existing bonds remained with R.R. Donnelley while proceeds from DFIN and LKSD financings were earmarked to be used to reduce debt at RRD. R.R. Donnelley initially retained a 19.25% equity stake in each of DFIN and LKSD for further deleveraging within one year of the spinoff. The former parent’s LKSD stake was sold in Q1’17, and the DFIN stake was disposed of in Q2’17 with the proceeds used to reduce RRD debt.Management asserted strategic and financial benefits would accrue from the spinoffs which included, respectively, the creation of three industry leaders and clearer valuations. With regard to the strategic benefits, shareholders were told that separate managements at each of the newly listed public companies would be more focused on and better able to:The strategic rationale was summarized in management’s September 2016 presentation. As shown below, the assertion was that the old R.R. Donnelley actually contained within it three types of business with different sets of clients and different strategies necessary for their individual success. Hence, in response, DFIN was created to be a software application company focused on providing both content and analytics to the financial services segment. LKSD, on the other hand, was designed to be a low-cost printer of magazines, books, and office products. Management assumed LKSD would be a consolidator within those segments. What remained of RRD would focus on cross-selling the variable commercial printing, product promotion and logistics business it was already booking with a large, existing customer base spread across the globe:The primary benefit which management said would accrue to shareholders was that each company’s post-spin valuation would more accurately reflect each its particular business characteristics and prospects. Each company would also have greater flexibility to optimize its capital structure and investment policies. Last, each would be able to better tailor corporate policies to its own specific situation. The success or failure to deliver financial benefits from clearer valuations post the spinoffs are easier to see than the strategic benefits because they should have materialized within the year after the spinoff date.Here’s the quick recap of the history of the presumed financial benefits from clearer valuations. The DFIN and LKSD shares began trading publicly at the end of September 2016. The graph below shows the normalized performance of the three securities and of the S&P 500 since then. As you can see, it’s not a pretty picture. Through last Friday, DFIN is down 9.6%, LKSD about 53.4%, and RRD some 66.4%, while the S&P 500 has moved up 12.6%. What the spinoffs really clarified is that each of these three entities has become worth a good deal less via separation than they were prior to the spinoffs:Not helping shareholders was the significant change in corporate policies concerning dividend payments after the spinoff date. While the old RRD had paid regular quarterly dividends of $0.78 per share for the past decade, the deconstructed RRD began paying dividends of $0.14 per share after October 2016, an 82% drop in the dividend yield to today's 6.02% rate. Shareholders who looked at RRD as primarily a stable yield play found themselves tied up in a declining business with a lower payout. The two new entities didn’t provide much in the way of dividend support either. LKSD declared its first dividend payment of $0.25 per share in October 2016, providing a similar 6.21% dividend yield. DFIN has not declared or paid any dividends since birth. These dividend policies were not what the old RRD shareholders had in mind as a financial benefit when they approved spinoffs they thought were told would “optimize” each company’s capital structure, investment, and corporate policies.This month marks the one-year anniversary of the spinoffs. Given the financial performance of the three companies over the last 12 months, it is arguably the case that shareholders might have inevitably been forced to accept a significant cut in dividends even if the corporate structure was not unpacked into three entities. That may be cold comfort to retail investors who had become accustomed to looking at RRD as a yield play rather than a valuation play, but it would justify painful dividend cuts if they weren’t caused by the spinoff transactions. Instead, management could claim they were a rational response to lower expected cash flows. The problem with that argument is that the strategic benefits peculiar to each business were supposed to grow, not detract from, cash flow, at least within the spinoff presentations made to shareholders.Management is accountable for the execution of strategic plans and should be held accountable for the delivery of results on same. Here’s a one-year review of each company’s strategy and management’s success or failure at executing on that strategy:Upon separation, RRD had a $7.86 billion top line and $993 million in run rate Adjusted EBITDA. When it next reports results through Q3’17 those figures are expected to drop to $6.89 billion and $485 million, respectively.During this past year, RRD management said it would focus on executing its strategy of becoming a leading global provider of integrated multi-channel communications, per the slide below from management’s September presentation. As shown, there are four elements to this strategy: communications services, marketing and brand execution, customized business communications, and supply chain/logistics:There’s nothing like a PowerPoint slide to make every bullet point and box seem logically put together. The presumption made by management on this slide and elsewhere within the presentation is that winning more marketing and brand execution assignments will lead to more customized business communications printing assignments which have to be delivered with help from RRD’s logistics business. More logistics business is supposed to then generate a greater number of content creation, management, and distribution deals. Alas, it sometimes happens that the weaker the assertion, the more a PowerPoint slide helps make the case.The quarterly results of that strategy broken down by segment are shown below. Commercial and digital printing, direct mail, labels, and forms are the key activities within RRD’s Variable Printing business, shown here as a single segment. The International and Strategic Services segments are housed within RRD’s Product Promotion & Logistics division. RRD’s printing business is seasonal - revenues and cash flow run higher in the second half of each year and the lower sequential trend lines in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA shown below are less instructive than the year over year changes. In Q2’17, RRD revenue was up just 0.8% year over year and Adjusted EBITDA was flat at 5.5%. There were some bright spots. For example, while Variable Printing revenue, the largest of the three business lines, fell 0.9% year over year in Q2’17, International revenue was up 2.8% and Strategic Services revenue was up 1.5%:These operating results don’t jibe with the purported strategic benefits for pursuing separation of these activities into a different business unit. First, management claimed at the time of the spinoff that global commercial printing should be expected to keep growing at a 1.9% compound annual rate. That’s slow growth, but not the kind of flat or sporadic growth shareholders have seen to date. Second, a slow growth business should be low-cost and stable enough to support paying dividends.Management claimed that a post-spin RRD would “start in the lead” with a steady list of 52,000 global customers (including 90% of the Fortune 1000). The assumed key to RRD’s success is to provide these clients with a one-stop shop for brand execution in their marketing and business communications. If that’s the case, the execution of that strategy hasn’t shown up in these numbers. One reason why is that some of RRD’s Fortune 1000 customers are having significant issues of their own. For example, its top customers include Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD), Avon Products (AVP), and News Corp. (NWSA). SHLD is 3.1% of RRD’s revenue, AVP is 2.9% and NWSA is 2.1% of same. SHLD’s sales were down 22.9% in its latest quarter ended July, AVP was -2.7% in Q2’17, and NWSA ran -6.6% in its June quarter. Increasing penetration through brand extensions in sales to declining businesses would be a challenge for any management team.If you believe management, the mixed year over year results are not permanent and reflect a delay in implementation rather than a failure to execute the strategic plan. Management guidance figures for this year assume $6.8-7.0 billion revenue and $475-505 million Adjusted EBITDA. Consensus expectations fall within those ranges too. The implication is that there will be improvement in the Company’s top line (and margins) when it reports Q3’17 results on November 1st. This is reflected in the summary financial information below. Should guidance/consensus prove correct, RRD will end up generating roughly $6.9 billion revenue, $490 million Adjusted EBITDA, and $170 million free cash flow (if capex keeps coming down). It will not, however, have brought total debt leverage within management’s target range of 2.25x-2.75x as even net leverage should stay above 4.0x based on existing debt and cash levels as of the June quarter:It is true that RRD common looks cheap to U.S. printing service comps like Brady Corp. (BRC), Deluxe (DLX), Ennis (EBF), and Quad/Graphics (QUAD). RRD’s blended forward P/E multiple is 7.5x and its blended forward enterprise value to EBITDA multiple is 5.4x. Those four comparables average a 14.1x blended forward P/E and a 7.3x blended forward enterprise value to EBITDA multiple. But the RRD discounts to those multiples can also be interpreted as a certain lack of faith among RRD equity holders that management will deliver on the promised strategic benefits from multi-channel offerings to its global client base.RRD should be positioned as a yield investment paying higher periodic payments rather than a growth vehicle which remunerates shareholders with future deals. Instead, shareholders find themselves in a modestly higher yield equity investment with limited upside. Keeping that in mind, shareholders might consider swapping out of the RRD common (with a 6.05% dividend yield) and into the RRD 6 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 (with a 7.06% yield, about 100 basis points higher). The senior notes are rated B2/B+ by Moody’s/S&P and, with $400 million outstanding, are the most widely traded issue within the debt complex. At +520 basis points of Z-spread, these are at the top of the range for comparably rated, similar maturities within the media space. They are also not restricted by 144A status, they are public – the CUSIP is 257867BB6.This trade would return RRD investors to a yield instrument that’s higher up in the company’s capital structure while picking up spread and provide entry at a discount to par – the last print price was $94.50. Even if RRD doesn’t exactly hit its revenue or Adjusted EBITDA guidance, the company will be free cash flow positive with the intention to deleverage. The senior notes are likely to be much less volatile than the common stock should guidance prove erroneous. Thirty-day volatility for the senior notes is 10.7% versus 63.1% on the RRD common stock. Unless a holder is convinced RRD will report a 5.7% sequential improvement in its top line and 4.7% improvement in its Adjusted EBITDA on November 1st, that’s a swap he or she might consider executing this month or next.LSC Communications’ business strategy is summarized in a fairly anodyne slide which management has used in presentations to investors. Per the graphic below, LKSD is supposed to create value for the equity holders by leveraging its scale, improving operational efficiency, growing the company’s existing revenue streams, finding new revenue sources, and making select acquisitions:Again, this all seems very logical, but how did it work out in practice since the spinoff date…? Has LKSD management been successful, for example at improving the company’s operational efficiencies…? That would be true if there were increases in LKSD’s operating margins. Has LKSD management been successful at consolidating similar businesses into the company via M&A…? That would be proven by closing multiple M&A transactions within the past year. Let’s have a look.Recall that LKSD is basically pursuing two sets of activities – printing and office products. The Print segment includes production of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, and directories. The Office Products segment includes filing products, note-taking products, binders, tax and stock forms, and envelopes.Per the segment table below, Print segment revenue has been sequentially declining. However, operating margin within the Print segment staged a comeback between the first two quarters of this year, recovering from a low of 1.69% in Q1’17 to 3.04% in Q2’17. That’s still below where the segment was a year ago but it’s better than further deterioration. The Office Products segment revenue has bounced up, down and up over the past 12 months and the same can be said for its operating margin. The latter improved from 8.11% to 9.60% over the first two quarters of this year:Like RRD, the business activity at LKSD is seasonal. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products rises in the second half of each year, a function of increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. But even with that seasonality in mind, LKSD management’s track record for obtaining the promised operating efficiencies post the spinoff is poor. Although management expected traditional print markets to decline between 1% and 4% annually over the next 5 years, recent declines have exceeded that projection. In fact, year over year, during the second quarter, Print sales were down 5.4% and operating margin dropped from 4.5% to 3.0%. LKSD management has been projecting a flat to minus 3% decline in Office Products, but Office Products fell 12.0% year over year in Q2’17. The main positive was that Office Products’ operating margin improved marginally from 9.2% to 9.6%.If that side of LKSD’s strategic equation is discouraging, the M&A side is indeterminate because of its timing. Management completed three commercial printing acquisitions and one equity investment over the past year starting in December 2016, when LKSD acquired Continuum Inc., a print procurement and management business, from a subsidiary of Central National Gottesman. The other three transactions, however, were closed just this past month. These deals include an equity investment in AUTHORS Inc. (artificial intelligence application software); the purchase of Creel Printing & Publishing (an offset and digital printing company whose capabilities include full-color web and sheet-fed printing, regionally distributed variable digital production, and large-format printing); and the acquisition of Fairrington Transportation Corp. (a delivery company with full service mailing and logistics, including freight management and postal optimization). There has been no disclosure of the prices paid by LKSD in these deals and while Continuum Inc. is incorporated within the Q1’17 and Q2’17 figures shown above, the rest are prospective.Like RRD management, LKSD management provided guidance for the balance of this year that indicates better times ahead. See LKSD financial summary table below. With the release of Q2’17 numbers, LKSD management clipped the top end of revenue guidance for this year from $3.55-3.65 billion to $3.55-3.60 billion but otherwise left the range for free cash flow at $125-155 million and stuck with a $60-65 million estimated for full year capex. Running the numbers, if you assumed management’s revenue guidance is correct – as opposed to the more modest numbers from consensus estimates in the table below - operating margin would then by back up from a low of 2.2% in Q2’17 to 5.6% by Q4’17. That would be impressive. But given LKSD’s mixed operating performance and the lack of contribution from its acquisitions so far, that type of improvement requires at least one quarter of demonstrated results to be convincing:At 7.4x, LKSD common stock trades at virtually the same blended forward P/E multiple as RRD. Its 3.5x blended forward Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple is even lower than RRD’s 5.4x which places LKSD at an even greater discount to its printing service company peers. On the other hand, its operating results are arguably poorer and there’s little to show for the four acquisitions closed so far. Since it’s been set up to be a consolidator of other printing companies rather than a target of same, there’s no reason to assume any alpha-creating event is on the horizon for its shareholders.LSC Communications Inc. also issued high yield bonds in conjunction with its spinoff. Of the three entities, LKSD has the lowest targeted range for gross leverage, 1.75x to 2.25x, and net leverage is already within that zone. The company provides one alternative to investors to recreate what had been a yield investment. There are $450 million outstanding LSCCOM 8¾ Senior Secured Notes due 2023 rated Ba3/B which last traded at $103.25 or a 7.96% yield to worst in October 2022. That’s about +623 basis points in Z-spread which, like the RRD notes, runs near the highest spread among media comparables averaging +462 basis points in Z-spread. Also, like the RRD situation, there is little correlation between the LSCCOM notes and the LKSD common stock and the LSCCOM notes are much less volatile instruments than the LKSD common. Thirty-day volatility is 4.9% for the notes and 46.1% for the LKSD common stock.The difficulty retail investors will have in making such a switch is that the LSCCOM secured notes are a 144A instrument (CUSIP 50218PAA5) which non-QIB investors cannot buy. Hence, recreating the yield investment former RRD equity investors once held within the separate LKSD capital structure will be tough for retail investors. That’s unfortunate because the 6% type dividend yield on the lower asset class LKSD common stock is not nearly as attractive as the 8% yield on the secured notes.Investors unable to recreate the yield investment with LSCCOM notes might consider swapping into the RRD notes. That still moves an LKSD equity holder into a higher asset at a bigger enterprise, and picks up 100 basis points of yield. The downside is that RRD is higher net leverage and the RRD notes are lower rated and unsecured.If RRD had a reason for spinning off one or more of its entities, Donnelley Financial was probably its best case. DFIN was de-merged to take the financial printing services business within the old RRD and presumably turn it into a higher growth, higher margin application software company. Kudos to former R.R. Donnelley CFO Dan Leib for moving into the CEO slot at DFIN.Per the slide below, DFIN supports the compliance and transaction needs of global capital markets companies and their advisers (e.g., investment bankers, law firms) and the compliance and analytics needs of global investment managers (e.g., mutual fund companies, variable annuity providers and broker/dealers like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)). This means it provides printing and digital services to companies like AIG (NYSE:AIG), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley with the idea of increasing revenue by offering content management, multi-channel content distribution, data management, analytics services, collaborative workflow, business reporting tools, translation services, and other language services:To accomplish this, DFIN was given a set of strategic priorities. First, management was tasked with driving new recurring sales through product extension (in order to smooth cyclicality). DFIN management also promised to selectively expand into new markets, transform operations to more effectively manage its costs, provide clients exceptional service on a global platform with a local service culture, and keep a disciplined approach to capital allocation. So how has DFIN management done so far in terms of executing on these priorities…?The company reports in two segments, US and International but has also released information about the revenue performance of its Global Capital Markets, Global Investment Markets and Language Solutions individual business lines since the start of this year.Per the table below, year over year performance of its largest segment, Capital Markets, has been up and down the past two quarters while Investment Markets and the much smaller Language Solutions business have both been up. The company’s International segment has moved from a 4.5% drop at the end of last year to a 34.7% increase year-over-year in the latest quarter. However, consolidated year over year change in revenue was -2.6%:On a consolidated basis, revenue has improved sequentially quarter to quarter which is one sign of success at dealing with the printing services cyclicality issue. Unlike RRD and LKSD, there have not been the typical drops in Q1 and Q2 top line. The year over year performance, however, has been a more mixed story, with the Capital Markets business line dropping sharply last quarter. If the thesis was that switching the location of the financial services business out of RRD and into DFIN would instantaneously result in a high growth application software concern that should be valued more highly in the market place, that thesis is questionable. The growth is there in spots, with International business leading the way.Management’s main success with DFIN has been at raising its overall profit margins. Per the summary financial table below, while operating margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin both dropped initially post-spin to lows of 2.9% and 12.5%, respectively, since the December 2016 quarter, both rebounded in Q2’17 to 14.0% and 22.8%, respectively:DFIN management has guided toward $1 billion revenue for the full year, indicating a relatively mild top line improvement in second half numbers. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is $175-180 million and free cash flow guidance is $50 million to $60 million. That doesn't turn DFIN into a high growth investment vehicle. And even if DFIN were to begin declaring dividends, the company’s Credit Agreement limits such payments to a mere $15 million which implies that DFIN should be positioned as a value play. The question is whether the DFIN common stock is a bargain relative to other application software companies which specialize in serving financial concerns.Holders would no doubt prefer to compare DFIN to high revenue growth tech companies in the data analytics or transaction processing space like Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR), DST Systems (DST) or Gartner Inc. (IT) which have blended forward P/E multiples of 20.5x, 15.3x, and 30.7x, respectively. DFIN’s blended forward P/E multiple is a paltry 12.1x by comparison. But DFIN hasn’t yet shown a consistent growth pattern which makes the argument in favor of a higher valuation harder. BR’s top line increased by more than 38% year over year in each of the past four quarters. DST, which sold BR some $410 million worth of assets in Q3’16 to help with that just amped up its own sales by buying Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and International Financial Data Services Limited in Q1’17 – two transactions which help explain the 68% year over year hike in DST’s June quarter. In January of this year, Gartner paid $3.25 billion to buy consulting services company CEB Inc. (NYSE:CEB), which is why Gartner is expected to achieve run rate revenues north of $1 billion by the end of this year.DFIN is not in the same camp as BR, DST or IT. It is an enterprise software company that specializes in reporting and data analytics for financial services clients, most of whom remain under pressure to cut costs. The company has been active in the M&A market, buying Soxhub Inc., a commercial services company, this past March but there’s no anticipated spike up in the top line this year from closing that deal.DFIN’s main success from an investment and valuation perspective to date has been at improving its operating margins. Still, at a 6.8x blended forward Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple, even without M&A-related or much organic growth and relying on just margin improvement to increase its cash flow, DFIN common stock looks relatively cheap. A broader group of comparable companies in its space would be valued at an average Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple of 17.3x.DFIN has reduced leverage since the spinoff date and is on track to bring net leverage within its targeted 2.25x to 2.75x range. The company issued $300 million DONFIN 8¼ Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 in conjunction with the spinoff. Rated B2/B by Moody’s/S&P, these last traded at $107.75 where they yield 6.44% (a Z-spread of +465 basis points). They are a public issue purchasable by retail (CUSIP 25787GAC4) and they do spread wide to other high yield tech sector comparable bonds which have an average Z-spread of +331 basis points. But given the high premium and the equity’s valuation discount to comparables, the better position in this case is to stick with or add to the common stock rather than swapping back into the bonds for its coupon payments. I don't see a reason to switch back into a related DFIN yield investment since it wouldn’t take much to get an 8% or better annual return from Friday’s $21.50 per share close. DFIN common shares just need to move up to $22.25, which still leaves the company’s valuation well beyond a 50% discount to peers.Since the spinoffs were effected one year ago, the stockholders of DFIN, LKSD, and RRD have suffered increasingly lower common share prices. To place the overall drop in perspective, the chart below provides a stacked graph of the enterprise valuations. As shown, there’s been a steady decline in the valuation of the entities, separately and combined. DFIN’s enterprise value was $1.31 billion one year ago and has since declined to $1.23 billion. LKSD’s enterprise value has moved from $1.69 billion to $1.20 billion in that time. RRD’s pre-spinoff valuation was $6.71 billion. It’s separate post-spinoff valuation began at $5.16 billion and has since fallen to $2.68 billion. Overall a $6.71 billion enterprise value one year ago has fallen to $5.06 billion today:Companies can either sell parts of themselves directly to an acquirer or to the public via an IPO or to their existing shareholders via a spinoff. It is investors that typically push managements toward divestitures via spinoffs, not the other way around. One investor objective is to force management to focus on their core competencies by selling ancillary businesses which have become more of a distraction than a source of profits. The disposition becomes a way to create value by removing inefficient expenditures of time or resources. Relatively high equity market valuations and the availability of historically low-cost debt financing further reinforce the impetus to divest. High multiples justify asset sales and low financing costs improve the odds of a divestiture’s future prosperity. Spinoffs usually do result in higher than average investor returns. Although divestiture via an IPO or sale sends proceeds to the company, capital markets almost always value spinoffs more highly than sales to outsiders. In fact, spinoffs provided superior returns versus the S&P 500 not just this year but for most of the past decade. Per the graph below, the normalized return on the S&P Spinoff Index outstripped the S&P 500 Index by multiple points over the past 5 years. You would have to go back to the year 2009 to find a period in which spinoffs under-performed the broader stock market:RRD is just one of 139 companies worth more than $100 million apiece that pursued a spinoff (or two) over the past 5 years. The deals add up to a collective $535.1 billion in completed transaction value and included an across-the-board representative mix of businesses: consumer non-cyclical, communications and financial companies accounted for 13.1%, 8.5%, and 5.6% of the total volume with the rest spread out across 5 other sectors.The number and volume of U.S. company spinoffs have declined since 2014 but that may be a function of a mixed performance recent transactions produced for shareholders. As shown in the table below, while some of the deals look fairly stellar in retrospect (e.g., DXC Technology Co. (NYSE:DXC) up 56% and Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) up 76%), others have been pretty bad. The recent Brighthouse Financial (NASDAQ:BHF) spinoff from MetLife (NYSE:MET) looks particularly nasty when annualized and Navient (NASDAQ:NAVI) holders suffered an 18% compound annual decline since that company was spun off from SLM (NASDAQ:SLM) in 2014:For deals consummated over the past 5 years, the average equity market cap improvement ran 14.6% and the median market cap increased by 10.0%. The R.R. Donnelley spinoff performances - which ranged from DFIN (poor) to LKSD (ugly) to RRD (dreadful) - are not uniquely disastrous. There have been other failures. However, given the average and median historical success rates with spinoffs in the market, I can think of a better explanation for what made the RRD transactions work so poorly.There are only three good reasons to pursue a spinoff. The first is if the synergies between existing businesses within a single company are so few or so unachievable that separation is inevitable anyway. Management has to have a set of businesses whose activities fit better and can be done more efficiently together than separately. The second is that the businesses are so unique or growing at such different rates that arranging new managements and costs still adds value. The third is when company resources have been thrown out of balance by too much diversification. Dispositions can make sense when particular businesses eat up too much company time, funding or assets relative to other businesses within the portfolio. Away from these three reasons to separate companies out from under the same corporate center, the rest is noise.To recap, RRD management claimed the DFIN and LKSD spinoffs would benefit existing shareholders by providing strategic business flexibility, more accurate valuation of the separate businesses, optimization of each company’s capital structure and financing, and corporate policies tailored to each business. Unfortunately, these four excuses didn’t equate to the three valid reasons cited above, which is what was really needed to justify the transactions.Management never showed why there were no synergies between the businesses it wanted to separate or why those synergies were not achievable within the old structure. True, there were margin differences between the different business activities, but their growth rates (or, better, deceleration rates) were fairly comparable. There was little justification for establishing separate administrative centers (and incurring separate administrative costs) and there was no argument made that one or another business was chewing up extra time or resources at the expense of other businesses within the group.RRD is a cautionary tale for investors looking to achieve market-beating returns from spinoffs. Holders can, in some cases, undo part of the damage by swapping out of the equity and into the debt instruments at the different companies. At least that might recreate the previous yield investment within a higher asset class.There will be other corporate breakups to look at and make money on going forward despite a recent drop-off in the deal count. One shouldn’t expect managements seeking better opportunities and investment bankers hunting fees to suddenly stop pitching spinoffs with superficial strategic rationales. Investors can use RRD as a lesson learned – avoid these deals or just vote no.In Trouble with the Curve, Gus isn’t only guilty of providing a poor justification for separating from his family. He's also guilty of professional ignorance when he dismisses computerized analysis of baseball players by saying, “Anybody who uses computers doesn't know a damn thing about this game.” That comment is not only false when looking at players for a winning team but also false when it comes to looking at investments for a winning portfolio. Spinoffs have to work from both a strategic and financial perspective. Investors need to analyze both in detail."

Donnelley is hoping to sell both print & digital media services to its customers.It will have to master the digital marketing domain to succeed.,"R. R. Donnelley (NASDAQ:RRD) is looking to become a multi-channel communications company. It's trying to reduce its dependence on printing, as digital marketing and communications are more important than ever. Its strategy comes with inherent advantages and risks. R. R. Donnelley is hoping to leverage its existing business relationship with the biggest companies in the world and extend into providing marketing services to those companies. Along the way, R. R. Donnelley would have to build expertise in digital marketing and build new relationships with marketers within its customer base.R.R. Donnelley is a giant in the printing industry. In fact, it is the largest printing company in the U.S. by revenues. R.R. Donnelley has been around for about 150 years, so it has a rich history of navigating changes in the economy, its business and technology. The increasing role of digital technology in every aspect of business and life has caused a drop in demand for paper and printing. The great recession of 2009 led to a steep drop in consumer demand and print industry may have suffered from that too. Both these trends have caused an overcapacity in the print industry. Federal Reserve data on capacity utilization in the printing industry shows that utilization stands at 68%. To put that number in perspective, the average total industry utilization rate between 1972 and 2015 was 80%. The lack of demand in the printing industry had its effect on R. R. Donnelley. It saw declining revenue growth in all of its reporting units under variable print business segment.Variable Print Division Annual Revenue Bolstered by Acquisitions(Source: Company Filings)In some years, acquisitions helped grow revenue for the variable print segment. For example, in 2014, commercial print reporting unit saw a jump in revenue driven by the acquisition of Consolidated Graphics and Esselte. In 2016, its direct mail business saw a boost driven by the acquisition of Precision Dialogue.In a bid to grow its business, gain competitive advantage and potentially boost margins, R. R. Donnelley has been looking at gain expertise in digital marketing and communications. In 2010, it had acquired Nimblefish Technologies to expand its multi-channel marketing capabilities. Nimblefish provided the ability to integrate direct mail, email, web and video into a 360-degree customer prospecting and engagement program. R. R. Donnelley also acquired an analytics-driven, multi-channel customer engagement company called Precision Dialogue in 2016. Besides its capabilities in analyzing customer or prospect data, it offers services such as strategy consulting, journey map generation, creative services and response measurement.R. R. Donnelley's strategy of transforming itself into a multi-channel communications company rests upon it mastering the customer insights, digital marketing, and communications domain. There are numerous firms competing in those segments. It is a segment marked by rapid changes in technology and in the digital and social media landscape. Also, each firm in that segment have their distinct strengths and weaknesses.Many Large and Small Vendors in the Customer Insight Space(Source: The Forrester Wave: Customer Insights Services Providers, Q4 2015)Constantly updating its digital marketing technical capabilities, product and service features will be a challenge for R. R. Donnelley. R. R. Donnelley would also have to integrate its sales force to sell the complete array of printing and marketing services to its existing customer base to grow its revenue from each customer. There's a risk that customers may choose to work with a different vendor for their digital marketing needs while working with R. R. Donnelley on their printing needs. R. R. Donnelley's sales teams may have to develop new business relationships with different divisions within a company. For example, the person in charge of procuring print materials for marketing purposes and the person responsible for customer insights and engagement strategy may be two different decision makers.Yes, digital technologies have gained market share in marketing, but print media is not going away. In fact, print media may never go away. Direct mailing and use of catalogs still deliver a return on their investment. So, print and digital media can and will co-exist. R. R. Donnelley is betting that there is great advantage in the market place to be the largest and potentially only player with end-to-end capabilities in both print and digital media. The question on investors' minds is whether R. R. Donnelley can master the digital domain and successfully sell both print and digital services to its customers."

        The idea presented here has been tested before and this time we felt like sharing it.
        Avid followers will notice a similarity with our article related to Frontier Communications from a few weeks back, as a similar process is applied.
        The Trust Preferred Stock in question has been undervalued for a while now.","IntroductionWhenever a certain company is seemingly in turmoil, from the market's perspective, we tend to look for opportunities in products which many would neglect or simply are not acquainted with. In this regard, we expect most of our followers to be rather familiar with the instruments we will discuss, but will do our best to provide a decent explanation for any 'beginners.'The company in question is R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE: RRD) whose common stock has been in for a roller coaster ride, with a focus on the downside. Our area of expertise most certainly is not related with a fundamental analysis of the stock, or anything like that. Instead we will bring to your attention a product referred to as TRuPS - Third Party Trust Preferred Securities.You will find similarities between this article and the one about Frontier Communications's (NASDAQ: FTR) own funky trust preferred - 'Frontier: The Alternative Way To Be Involved.'The CompanyAs per the company's website:Source: The company's websiteWe probably lack the capacity to judge the company's performance and tell you whether it is a bargain, overvalued, or whatsoever. Supposedly the market price is a good indicator of performance, thus we will trust it: Source: Barchart.com - RRD Daily Chart (1 year)Does not seem pretty over a 1-year time frame, but it makes absolutely no difference for the trade idea we are about to present.The Product - TRuPSThe Third Party Trust Preferred Securities - TRuPS - are actually debt instruments masquerading as a stock.If we may break it down: The star of this article is ML Depositor PPLUS Trust 6.30% R.R. Donnelley Certificates RRD-1 (NYSE: PYS). Let us quickly go through the details surrounding this product's coming into existence before delving into further details:Source: SEC.gov - Form 424B5 by PPLUS Trust Series RRD-1Now, you might notice a slight discrepancy in the Nominal Yield between the Underlying and the Trust Preferred - PYS - and you are correct to wonder what kind of financial engineering has occurred.Apparently a 'commission' in the form of PPLUS Class B 0.325% Callable Trust Certificates Series RRD-1 has been snatched by Merrill Lynch.And last but not least, we should note that the bonds in the trust are part of a $200M issue, of which $158M are still outstanding, while the Trust holds only $60M of the aforementioned which essentially are the underlying product of PYS.Having covered the important facts related to this product, let us look at ML Depositor PPLUS Trust 6.30% R.R. Donnelley Certificates RRD-1 (NYSE: PYS) itself: Source: Author's spreadsheetThe Current Yield and Yield-to-Maturity stand at 7.56% and 9.21%, but since the dividends are not qualified for the 15% tax rate, the respective equivalents stand at 6.30% and 7.68%.The issue has been Callable since 4/15/2011 and matures on 4/15/2029. It carries a S&P Rating of B, while the Underlying Bonds carry a S&P Rating of B+ (as of 10/06/2016). If for any reason the underlying bonds have a higher rating the YTM spread is too high for one ""+"" difference.Let us see how the market has been treating PYS and then make a comparison with the underlying securities: Source: Barchart.com - PYS Daily Chart (1 year)As you will notice from taking a glimpse at the two charts, there does seem to be a rather obvious divergence. But before rushing to any conclusions we must examine the numbers themselves.Source: FINRA.org - RRD3673769 (PYS Underlying)Taking into account PYS's Accrued Dividends of $0.86 per share, the Stripped Price stands at $20.04, which seems rather cheap but would be an overstatement before we examine the underlying products. The recent disconnect between the charts is something we already mentioned. The underlying Bonds retraced back to their highs while PYS remains at the lows. The usual behavior of these 3rd party products is to be overvalued not undervalued...The Underlying BondsAs will be clarified in the calculations behind the trade, the best way to understand the trade is to think of the bonds' value as the Net Asset Value of PYS itself. Meaning that they are the point of reference when we are doubting whether the TRuPS are fairly priced in certain scenarios. Yet the metric we prefer to look at, unless the company gets in real trouble, is the Yield-to-Maturity of PYS and the Underlying respectively, because if no danger is on the horizon - yield is what we are interested in. Source: FINRA.org - RRD3673769 (PYS Underlying)Again, bear in mind that only $60M of this issue are held in the trust which issued PYS. But the highlight should be the 'Last Trade Price' - as seen in the screenshot above - which is at $95.65. What does this mean to us?PYS is likely trading at a Discount relative to the bonds which stand behind it and this increases the likelihood that it is a bargain from a YTM perspective.The ConceptThe way I interpret this is that we have $60M nominal value of the underlying bonds (The Trust) and the only place where holders of the trust can look for value and safety is in the value of the underlying bonds. For me, this means that any deviation in PYS (The 'Preferred Stock' which represents interest in the Trust) below the value of the bonds offers a buying opportunity with a hedging reaction. - Brief Calculations:- Yield-to-Maturity:If we deduct the 0.325% Nominal Yield (the Merrill part) => Nominal Yield of 6.30% -> YTM = 6.86%- NAV of the Trust vs. PYS:What does this final number mean to us? The big difference in Yield-to-Maturity means that PYS is undervalued in comparison to the Underlying Bonds. The Discount calculated above kicks in as a factor if, say, the company's Credit Rating deteriorates and suddenly their ability to pay the interest can be questioned.The TradeIf our calculations show that PYS is cheap relative to the bonds, then clearly we are offered an opportunity to purchase it and have a hedging reaction using RRD3673769 (Underlying Bonds).Not all of us, referring to some of my team members as well, have access to the Bonds themselves, therefore the most basic way to act on this mispricing is to have a naked Long position in PYS and keep an eye on the bonds' last trading price. The Trade: Our TargetThe logic in PYS is valid till a point in which the YTM spread narrows. The easiest way to see this would be by simply comparing the price charts of the two instruments.A price target for PYS going back to its recent highs means we will see it at $22-22.50 soon as long as the bonds are as calm as they are now.I have participated in only one such occasion and it was the redemption of FJA.Info can be found here.At current prices even if one ends up with the underlying bonds, the third party trust holder has no risk of losing value.ConclusionThere are not many products like PYS in the preferred stock universe and as you can see from this article, and the one referenced in the beginning, there can be interesting setups in them.The calculations are nothing complex and anyone interested can easily keep track of the underlying while trading PYS itself.As this is the second article of this type, any feedback on what could have been clarified better is welcome!Author's note: PYS is not a preferred stock, but we just love to call all these products 'preferreds,' because we really prefer them."
4056050,63883,2017-03-17T03:31:56-04:00,,"By Nicholas McCullumWhen high-quality companies trade at relative lows, it is often worthwhile to assess why the stock price is depressed.If the company's long-term investment prospects remain strong, then buying the dips can be rewarding for shareholders.R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) is currently trading at a 52-week low. In the past year, this stock has traded as high as ~$23 and currently sits at $13.66.Source: Yahoo! FinanceUpon further investigation, it appears that the cause of this low stock price is a substantial business reorganization that RRD completed last fall.This article will examine whether RRD’s current stock price presents a bargain for investors.Business OverviewRecently, RRD has gone through some significant restructuring.Effective October 1, 2016, the company has spun off two large business units which will now trade independently on stock exchanges:Existing RRD investors received one share of LSC Communications and one share of Donnelley Financial Solutions for every eight shares of RRD held at the close of business on September 23, 2016.Immediately following the spinoff, RRD’s common stock completed a reverse 3-for-1 stock split. This means that every 3 shares of RRD before the event became 1 share.For both the spinoffs and the reverse stock split, fractional shares were not issued – investors received cash instead.RRD holds a 19.25% stake in each of the new corporate entities, which is must-sell within one year of the spinoff to maintain the tax-free nature of the divestitures.Here’s what RRD’s CEO has to say about the spinoff in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release:The new RRD will operate in three business segments:More information about RRD’s current corporate structure can be seen below.Source: R.R. Donnelley Fourth-Quarter Investor Presentation, slide 4Qualitatively, one might assume that RRD’s growth prospects would be poor.Commercial printing could possibly be experiencing a decline as more consumers switch to electronic methods of communication.This is not the case. The following image presents the actual and expected growth of the commercial printing industry from 2014 to 2019.Source: R.R. Donnelley Fourth Quarter Investor Presentation, slide 7The commercial printing industry is growing, particularly in international markets.This international growth is a trend that RRD has taken advantage of. The company has very globalized operations, with 377 locations in 28 countries. RRD also has a substantial (42,000) international employee base.Source: R.R. Donnelley Fourth-Quarter Investor Presentation, slide 11While this international presence exposes them to other risks (such as fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar), it allows RRD to leverage the growth of the international commercial printing industry to drive business growth.Looking ahead, RRD’s future will be largely influenced by the company’s recent business restructuring.The spinoffs of Donnelley Financial Solutions and LSC Communications were expected to unlock shareholder value. This has not yet occurred.The following diagram shows how the current value of RRD’s spinoffs compares to the pre-spinoff stock price. This diagram was created by dividing LKSD and DFIN’s stock price by eight (to account for eight shares being received for each share of pre-spinoff RRD) and dividing post-spinoff RRD’s stock price by 3 (to account for the reverse stock split).Source: Yahoo! FinanceThe cumulative value of the three spun-off entities is substantially less than the per-share market value of pre-spinoff RRD. Keep in mind that the above diagram does not account for dividend payments from the three separate entities.Investors need not be immediately alarmed, though. We are only ~5 months since the spinoff and financial markets are still adjusting to the new corporate structure.When the company originally announced the spinoffs back in 2015, they forecasted positive revenue growth for two of the entities. While they were unnamed at the time, these two entities ended up being the new RRD along with Donnelley Financial Solutions.Source: R.R. Donnelley Best Ideas Conference Presentation, slide 14The company with negative expected revenue growth is LSC Communications.Competitive Advantage & Recession PerformanceRRD’s competitive advantage stems from their market leadership in the commercial printing industry. The company has a very large global customer base of 52,000 corporations, which includes:Some of RRD’s more iconic companies can be seen in the following slide.Source: R.R. Donnelley Fourth-Quarter Investor Presentation, slide 10In the past, RRD has not performed well during recessions. Their earnings per share during the 2007-2009 financial crisis can be seen below:RRD’s adjusted earnings per share fell by ~65% during the depths of the financial crisis.While the company managed to remain profitable, this type of earnings-per-share dropoff does not inspire confidence among the company’s investors.This per-share earnings decrease severely affected the safety of the company’s dividend. Although RRD did not raise their dividend payments between 2004 and 2015, the loss of profits during the financial crisis pushed RRD’s dividend payout ratio above 100% during fiscal 2009.Source: Value LineLooking ahead, RRD is focused on reducing their leverage levels to create a lower-risk value proposition. The company’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio is above 4x, and management has communicated the intent to lower this to the 2.25x-2.75x range.This will likely be completed by retiring outstanding debt. The following slide presents RRD’s debt maturity profile until 2026.Source: R.R. Donnelley Fourth-Quarter Investor Presentation, slide 20Expect more of this debt to be retired as the company moderates their risk profile.Valuation & Expected ReturnsRRD’s future expected total returns will come from three sources: dividend yield, earnings-per-share growth and changes in the company’s valuation.Earlier, we saw that the company had a forward dividend yield of 4.1%.With regard to improvements in earnings per share, it is unclear exactly how quickly investors can expect the new RRD to grow their business. Based on RRD’s historic performance along with the growth of the commercial printing industry, I would expect bottom line growth in the range of 2-4% per year over the medium term.RRD’s valuation is also a bit tricky, as the new company does not have 12 months of earnings per share to calculate a trailing price-to-earnings ratio.However, it is possible to calculate a forward price-to-earnings ratio. Management has guided for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.90-1.20 for fiscal 2017. Taking the midpoint of this guidance ($1.05) gives a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.0 – well below the average price-to-earnings ratio of ~26.RRD’s valuation will likely expand as the uncertainty surrounding the company’s future is reduced.To conclude, expected total returns for RRD shareholders will be composed of:for expected total returns of 6.1-8.1% before the effect of valuation changes. Again, it is likely that the company’s valuation will increase as uncertainty diminishes.Final ThoughtsRRD has recently undergone some significant business restructuring. While this was expected to unlock shareholder value, this has not yet occurred and the company’s future still contains a great deal of uncertainty.The company’s dividend yield is north of 4%, which will appeal to income-oriented investors. However, I am hesitant to recommend an investment in RRD right now.This may change when the company’s growth runway becomes more clear."
3969149,85856,2016-04-28T16:26:02-04:00,I review the fourth-quarter results.R.R. Donnelley stock has had a strong rally in 2016; I take a look at the current valuation.Investors are still waiting for further details on the looming breakup in 2016.,"It has been a while since I last touched on R.R. Donnelley (NASDAQ:RRD), and to be honest I had been waiting for further details of the looming break-up before writing further. Despite the lack of information at this time, I wanted to bring attention to the recent movements in Donnelley's stock.If you're an income investor and maybe even a holder of Donnelley, you might be surprised to find that Donnelley stock has actually had a nice run-up thus far in 2016, grossly outperforming the S&P 500 and jumping more than 20%.Source: Yahoo Finance, 27 April 2016I'm not a technician by trade, but I would highlight that the stock price has broken out above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and not long after the breakout, the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average. Some might interpret these movements to indicate a bullish trend.Source: Stockcharts.com, 27 April 2016While this near-term performance is exceptional, I will throw out the caveat that over the last two, five and even 10 years, Donnelley's performance has greatly trailed the S&P 500's. Looking over the last five years when many other stocks have had spectacular rallies, Donnelley has largely been range-bound, trading between $10 and $20 a share.Source: Yahoo Finance, 27 April 2016A look at the fourth quarterIf you haven't listened in on the earnings call, Seeking Alpha keeps a great copy of the transcript here. My impression of the quarter was that it was largely more of the same, declining revenues, though showing slight improvement over the prior quarter. Tom Quinlan, the CEO, was very brief in describing the quarter, speaking nothing of the organic sales decline, and instead focusing on improvements in the gross margin. He stated that:""From a top line perspective, the demand environment remains challenging in the fourth quarter with the organic revenue trend improving modestly than what we experienced in the third quarter. As we did in the previous two quarters, we once again expanded non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin from the same period in 2014.Just as he did in the third quarter he only spoke to gross margin improvements before moving on to discuss the break-up of the company, noting that:""Fourth quarter 2015 margin was 11.2%, an improvement of more than 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, we delivered free cash flow of $444 million for the year, near the midpoint of the guidance that we had provided throughout the year, and ended 2015 with leverage of 2.8 times just above the top end of our targeted range of 2.25 times to 2.75 times.""You can understand why Tom again opted to focus the discussion on margins, for which improvement is nice to see, when the company's sales once again experienced organic declines.Not surprising, in the same fashion as the last quarter, when you take a wider look at quarterly sales, going back over the last three years, most of the growth that the company was making in 2014 has been wiped out in 2015.Source: Information from R.R. Donnelley's SEC FilingsThe guidance looking forward into 2016 was not very favorable either, as Dan Lieb, the CFO, stated that""Now I will provide some additional detail around our full-year 2016 guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion. At the midpoint, this implies an organic revenue growth of 0.7%, with a range of negative 0.2% to 1.6%. We expect our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 10.4% to 10.6% as the impact of continuing price pressure and inflation related cost increases, is only partially offset by our productivity initiatives and the benefits of higher volume.""So, given the ongoing stagnancy in results, I'm left to presume that the bullish sentiment in 2016 is the result of market movements, such as the Federal Reserve's backing off on interest rate hikes or anticipation of value arising from the impending break-up of the company.So, how does the current valuation look?Despite the run-up, the stock's valuation sits at a P/E of about 11.5, which on a historical level still trails the company's averages and is not far from the 11.1 metric that I reported last fall in my last report on Donnelley here.Source: FASTgraphs, 27 April 2016What more has management said regarding the forthcoming break-up?We know from 8-K disclosures that the spin-off is not expected to be completed until October of this year, so very likely (though not guaranteed) dividends will still be paid in May and August at their current levels.We also know that the three entities will be known as R.R. Donnelley, LSC Communications, Inc. and Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. In reviewing Tom's comments from the earnings call he described the approximate size of each entity as follows:LSC Communications (formerly PRSCo) - $3.5 billion in revenue, 20,000 employeesDonnelley Financial Solutions (formerly FinancialCo) - $1 billion in revenue, 3,000 employeesR.R. Donnelley (formerly CMCo) - $6.8 billion in revenue, 42,000 employeesManagement also recently disclosed whom it expects to serve as the executive leadership of each entity in an 8-K filing.We're all still waiting on details of the capitalization of each entity, and I would again caution income investors to be prepared for a period of reorganization where dividends will be halted, before being resumed at likely lower levels by the successor entities.SummaryThe stock has had a nice run-up already in 2016. I feel like I missed a great opportunity to get in, and if in fact you were fortunate enough to buy on the dip at the end of 2015 you are now sitting on a stellar 20% gain. This may complicate your decision on whether to sell and take the gain or hold on the chance of further gains post break-up.Donnelley stock is still trading at a low enough multiple that it accounts for the stagnating revenue. I envision it will remain range-bound, trading between $15-$20 per share, right up to the break-up. Looking forward to the next two quarters, I do not expect to see anything different from Donnelley. Management guided 2016 results at a low level, and the highlights will likely be their disclosure of further break-up details.If I were looking to make a speculative play on the break-up, I would like to purchase the stock on a pullback, closer to $15-$16 per share. For me personally, it wouldn't be in my MnM Portfolio as there is no dividend growth to be had here. It is, however, still very much on my radar and I could add it elsewhere."

        I take a look at the current valuation of the stock.
        Investors remain in limbo as management will not be providing any further updates on the looming breakup until Q1 2016.","I last wrote about R.R. Donnelley (NASDAQ:RRD) back in August, when management had just announced their intention to split the company into three separate entities in 2016. I do not currently, but have held Donnelley stock in the past. I generally try to keep an eye on it, largely as a potential income play. In the following I take a look at what's happened since I last touched on Donnelley in August.A look at the third quarterIf you haven't listened in on the earnings call, Seeking Alpha keeps a transcript HERE. My impression of the quarter was that it was fairly disappointing, but not altogether unexpected. Tom Quinlan, the CEO, began to describe the quarter he started off by saying:""With respect to our third quarter results, while the demand environment remained challenged…""He went on to discuss the gross margin improvement and cost discipline, which you can applaud the company on, but left the discussion of revenue to Dan Lieb, the CFO. Dan went on to highlight that:""Revenue of $2.8 billion represented a decline of 4.4% from the third quarter of 2014. Adjusting for a 220 basis point unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates as well as the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and pass through paper, organic revenue declined 3.1%"".You can understand why Tom opted to focus the discussion on margins and cost saving initiatives when the company's sales declined by a considerable margin over the prior year.When you take a wider look at revenues over the last three years, it looks like all of the gains that the company was making in 2014 have been wiped out in 2015, particularly in their largest segment, product revenues.Source: Information from R.R. Donnelley's SEC FilingsIt is understandable that the focus is solely on the break-up since that is the direction management has chosen to take. Investors will have to be patient regarding plans for future growth; at least until the break-up is complete and the three new sets of management can get in and implement their own, unique strategies.How does the current valuation lookThe stock didn't really tumble on the earnings news. In fact since I last wrote it's actually outperformed the S&P 500, albeit by a slim margin. It's trading largely where it was back in August.Source: Yahoo Finance, 10 November 2015When we look at valuations, with a P/E of 11.1, on a historical level it looks cheap right now.Source: FASTgraphs, 10 November 2015But when we look back at only the last three years, with growth sputtering out, the stock appears to be more fairly valued.Source: FASTgraphs, 10 November 2015What did management say regarding the forthcoming breakup?Nothing really. Investors will have to wait until the first quarter of 2016 to see any further details. Management did note that they intend to maintain the $.26 quarterly distribution until the break-up is completed, but only commented that each new entity would review the distribution following the break-up.I continue to caution investors that this seems to be a telegraphed dividend cut, and to understand that this is very likely to happen within a year from now.ConclusionFacing declining revenue, it almost seems like the company is throwing in the towel and going the break-up route. For the past decade the strategy has been to acquire growth, as evidenced by their acquisitions, covering all segments.Source: R.R. Donnelley Investor Presentation 2015Judging from the extent that revenues have declined, it appears that these moves have just not been enough to counter industry-wide declines.For those looking to speculate on the valuations post-breakup, it's hard to say what will happen once the break-up actually occurs and each segment is trading independently on the exchanges. If we look at a recent example, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), which broke up just this month, we will note that the price of its spin-off Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) soared while Hewlett Packard has stagnated.Source: Yahoo Finance, 10 November 2015I do not anticipate seeing any large pricing movements in R.R. Donnelley in the near future. I anticipate it will trade with the market, as investors are stuck in limbo, awaiting further news on the looming break-up. Income investors may wish to ride it out with the company, and sell post-split; however, others may want to secure a replacement yield before then.The stock seems fairly valued right now, so I would not go rushing in unless you are speculating that one segment will pop in valuation just as the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company did. If you go this route then at least you will be paid a nice yield while you wait."
4003015,101543,2016-08-30T09:13:33-04:00,R.R. Donnelley & Sons is planning to spin-off its publishing and print services business and financial communication services business.The new corporations names will be LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions.It appears investing in the company before the spin-off won't be advantageous for investors.,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NASDAQ: RRD) is planning to spin-off two different divisions within the company. They just recently filed form 10 for both companies and you can find them here and here. The new names of both of these organizations will be LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions. The spin-off is planned to be tax free and RRD will distribute at least 80% stakes in both companies to shareholders. The official date hasn't been determined, but it appears it will be in the second half of 2016. The share distribution ratio also hasn't been determined yet. Over the past 5 years very little value has been created for investors. It has paid a good dividend yield over the years, but price appreciation hasn't been stellar while the overall market is up.RRD data by YChartsBusiness Segment OverviewsLSC CommunicationsLSC Communications will trade under the ticker ""LSKD"". The company will be a global leader in cost-efficient traditional and digital print, print-related services and office products. Many costumers include publishers of magazines, books and directories, online retailers, catalogers, mass merchandisers and contract stationers. They service over 3,000 customers and work with two of the largest book publishers worldwide. Also, LSKD has an office product segment. Most of what they manufacture and sell are the following five core categories: filing products, note-taking products, binder products, tax and stock forms, and envelopes. The office product segment will serve nine of the top ten office supply retailers.For the first 6 month of 2016 LSKD had net sales of $1.786 billion and adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA of $188 million. Estimated full year 2016 EBITDA of $380 million. Net earnings for full year 2015 were $73.6 million. The company really hasn't showed any growth over the past 3 years in sales or EBITDA. The print segment accounts for about 85% of sales whereas the office product segment is 15%. The print segment had 13% of sales outside the United States, mostly within Europe and Mexico.Donnelley Financial SolutionsDonnelley Financial will trade under the ticker ""DFIN"". DFIN primary service is for capital market and investment market clients in the United States and internationally by delivering products and services to help create, manage and deliver accurate and timely financial communications to investors and regulators. They also have a language solutions segment which provides translation of documents and content in up to 140 languages for clients.For full year 2015 sales were $1 billion and earnings of $104 million. The U.S. accounted for approximately 86% of sales, whereas the international markets were 14%. Sales haven't seen any growth and earnings have been sporadic over the past few years.Multichannel Communications Management CompanyThis is basically the company that is leftover after the spin-offs. It will offer customized digital and printed communication services. The company will help client reduce costs and be in compliance with communication through commercial and digital prints and direct mail. As its own company in 2015 it had sales of $7 billion and profitability was a struggle.ValuationThe valuation of all three organizations after the spin-off is difficult. On a consolidated basis the current market capitalization is $3.6 billion. It sells for 32x earnings and 7.7x enterprise value to EBITDA. Depreciation expense for the company is large and compresses earnings. 2015 depreciation expense was $450 million. Even after the spin-offs, I don't see multiple expansion with earnings already being 32x consolidated. I wouldn't be surprised if the multichannel communication company sees contraction in its multiple which will lower the overall value of the three standalone companies. Earnings growth will have to provide upside to investors. As standalone companies management will have to prove this was the right move.TakeawayAs three separate companies this gives them flexibility and strategic focus on the products and services they provide. Capital structures within the companies can be optimized to the most beneficial strategies. More critical acquisitions can made and strengthen market positions. The investment analysis for investors becomes easier and gives options to the type of businesses investors want to invest in. The one company investors should be most interested in after the separation is the financial solutions business. It provides services that are reoccurring and is an asset light business. Cash flows should be strong and with management focus the company can be a leading provider.For investors to invest in before the spin-off doesn't seem advantageous. The current valuation seems too steep for any value creating action right after the spin-off. Overtime though, long term investors should see better operating metrics and value enhancing corporate actions.To read more research on stock spin-offs, fund holdings, micro to large cap companies, and special situations please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."
2814765,25228,2015-01-13T15:58:43-05:00,"R.R. Donnelley had a solid streak of increasing its dividend in the 1980s and 1990s.Beginning in 2003, the company has paid the same quarterly dividend for over a decade.This article looks at this “frozen dividend tale” from a variety of vantage points.","Founded in 1864, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (NYSE:RRD) has a storied history -- beginning as a printer and today, 150 years later, remaining as the largest printer in the world. For the income investor, perhaps just as interesting is the company's dividend record. R.R. Donnelley was able to increase its dividend nicely during the 1980s and 1990s before reaching the $0.26 per share quarterly mark in 2003 -- a mark that still stands today. For over 11 years, the company has paid the exact same dividend.Now some might see this as a great tragedy, especially in a dividend growth craved world with the expectation of higher and higher payouts each and every year. The reality, like most things, depends on your personal situation and relative timeframe. Let's walk through some historical possibilities to better determine whether or not this frozen dividend was indeed a great catastrophe.In August of 2003, R.R. Donnelley began paying its $0.26 quarterly dividend -- one penny more than it had the previous year. In fact, this one-penny raise was more or less the norm dating back 1980s. Not completely unlike AT&T's (NYSE:T) streak today; the difference between the two, though, is that R.R. Donnelley's one-cent increases started at a lower base, meaning larger percentage dividend increases. So in August of 2003 you wouldn't have expected anything out of the ordinary.In August of 2004, things start to get ""slightly concerning."" The company had dutifully paid its four quarterly $0.26 per share dividend installments, but this year the board elected not to increase the dividend. Still, due to the company's mid-year increase history, the dividends paid in 2004 would prove to be higher than 2003 even after paying the same dividend for six quarters. However, by February of 2005 -- with the same ""frozen"" payment -- you could begin to question the company's increase streak.Let's begin here. In February of 2005, shares of R.R. Donnelley were trading around $34. With a $1.04 annual dividend this equates to yield of roughly 3%. The next few years would prove to be quite profitable for the company, with adjusted earnings in the $2 to $3 range. As such, the stock price would climb to a high around $45 in July of 2007 -- representing a 30% capital appreciation gain in just two and a half years. Add in the dividends and this equates to an annualized return of roughly 14% from ""point of probable dividend freeze"" to the peak before the recession. The interesting note here is that the company paid the same dividend for three straight years and the return results were still quite solid.Then along came the recession and all of a sudden businesses were more concerned with staying afloat and less concerned about having a quality commercial printer high-gloss their monthly memorandums. Profitability went from nearly $3 a share to closer to a buck and a half. The share price fell mightily and today still remains well below its pre-recession mark, trading hands around $16 today.If you bought in 2005 and held until today, your capital appreciation per share would have been negative $18. The dividends received during this time would have been a bit over $10 -- so you'd still be in negative total return territory. Interestingly, had you been primarily focused on income, your dividend checks remained steady -- perhaps a small positive to some, but a important note for the retiree.The next tale of R.R. Donnelley's frozen dividend is a bit more upbeat. In March of 2009, the company's stock price dropped below $6 a share. Now remember, the annual dividend has remained constant at $1.04 for the past 11-plus years. Which means that shares could have been purchased at the time with a 17% dividend yield. Forget dividend growth, a 17% yearly payment generates all the return you need. Assuredly one could not be expected to pick the bottom, but it remains that for every seller there is a buyer. Perhaps millions of shares were exchanged at this price.With a share price around $16 today and $6 in collected dividends, the R.R. Donnelley investor of 2009 would now be sitting on 20%+ annual returns. Notably a second (even more lucrative based on annualized returns) opportunity presented itself again at the beginning of 2013: shares could have been purchased around $9 -- representing an 11.5% dividend yield. With the current share price and $2.08 in collected dividends that investor would have seen their capital double in just two years.The takeaway is that, unlike many other companies, the frozen dividend of R.R. Donnelley has not been the precursor to a dividend cut -- or at least not yet. The company's underlying earnings power has changed and people's perception of what the business ought to be worth has fluctuated, but that $0.26 quarterly dividend payment has remained steady. As such, interesting opportunities have previously presented themselves.Moving forward anything can happen, but for the sake of illustration let's imagine that the company is able to maintain this quarterly dividend just as it had over the past decade. Given today's share price this implies a current yield of 6.5%. Analysts are expecting slow growth in the years ahead, which puts adjusted earnings per share estimates in the $1.50 to $2 range. If the company's share price is the same in the future as it is today the math is simple: you would expect to collect 6.5% of your original investment each year; a sum that decreases in purchasing power over time, but starts out quite high. If the company is able to grow a bit, this could easily translate to 10% annual returns.In short, I'm not advocating that you go out and buy shares of R.R. Donnelley. However, much like preferred shares, I am suggesting that it could be wise to learn more. If you believe in the company today, it offers a very solid current yield with the potential for future upside. Alternatively, if the stock price drops dramatically in the future, you would be ready to partner with an 8%-10% yield. I like R.R. Donnelley's ""frozen dividend tale"" because it hits home with the oft-overlooked middle ground: hasn't cut its dividend in decades, but hasn't raised it either. Usually one side or the other wins out, so it will be interesting to see which way this one develops."
3652896,24491,2015-11-05T16:13:32-05:00,"R.R. Donnelley's industry is clearly changing. It's suffering from declining product volumes, challenging pricing dynamics and consolidation across customers and suppliers.R.R. Donnelley's entrenched position in its industry once allowed it to maintain a relatively stable revenue stream through its customer base, but the reshaping of its industry has hurt performance.Acquisitions have played a huge part in R.R. Donnelley’s capital allocation over the past five years, in which it has acquired six companies.Let's take a look at the company's key investment considerations and uncover the drivers behind its Dividend Cushion ratio.","Key Investment ConsiderationsR.R. Donnelley's (NASDAQ:RRD) dividend yield is above average, offering a 6.2% annual yield at recent price levels. Though we prefer yields above 3% and generally do not include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio, R.R. Donnelley does not fit the bill for addition to the Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio. This article explains why.• R.R. Donnelley is a global provider of integrated communications. The firm works with more than 60,000 customers worldwide to develop custom communication solutions. Based on recent data, it serves ~97% of the Fortune 500 and ~95% of the Fortune 1000.• 2015 won't be a terrible year for R.R. Donnelley. The company's net sales are expected to come in the range of $11.4-$11.6 billion on a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.5%-10.7%. Free cash flow is targeted in the range of $400-$500 million for the year.• R.R. Donnelley's industry is clearly changing. It is suffering from declining product volumes, challenging pricing dynamics, and consolidation across customers and suppliers. The firm's legacy publishing and retail services business (magazines, catalogs, retail, books, directories) still accounts for about 25% of sales. Its credit is rated non-investment grade (Ba3/BB-).• R.R. Donnelley is the largest printer in North America with the broadest product and service offering. The US print market, excluding newspaper, is estimated at ~$125 billion. Though competitors are as entrenched as R.R. Donnelley, this suggests there is room for further growth via share gains.• Though R.R. Donnelley boasts a hefty dividend yield, we wouldn't be surprised if management cuts the dividend on the basis of the firm's weak Dividend Cushion ratio. The company has no significant debt maturities until 2019, however.Dividend StrengthsR.R. Donnelley's entrenched position in its industry once allowed it to maintain a relatively stable revenue stream through its customer base, but the reshaping of its industry has provided significant pressure. The firm has maintained the same quarterly dividend of $0.26 since 2003. The lack of an increase to its dividend in recent years leads us to believe that it won't be increasing it anytime soon. Volatile earnings hurt the potential for dividend increases - we aren't sure there are many potential strengths to be found here.Dividend WeaknessesAcquisitions have played a huge part on R.R. Donnelley's capital allocation over the past five years, in which it has acquired six companies. The acquisitions haven't been quite what the firm was expecting, and it has struggled to generate consistent earningsper share. The firm's debt load also weighs significantly on its dividend potential. We think there are more prudent applications for the company's capital than dividend payouts. Delevering and innovative investments would be a good place to start.Dividend SafetyWe think the safety of R.R. Donnelley's dividend is very poor. Let's explain why. First, we measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straight forward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying dividends well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Dividend Cushion ratio, which we make available on our website. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing net cash a company has on hand (on its balance sheet) plus its expected future free cash flows (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected cash dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends and the expected growth in them.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For R.R. Donnelley, this ratio is -0.8, revealing that there is risk surrounding the firm's ability to cover its future dividends and growth in them with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. A negative ratio is particularly concerning.Dividend Cushion Ratio Cash Flow BridgeThe Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the graph below, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. R.R. Donnelley's Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's five-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is less than the sum of the next five years of expected cash dividends paid.Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the five-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk. On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time.Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at risk of a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in our opinion. Generally speaking, the greater the ""blue bar"" to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the ""blue bar"" to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.Dividend Cushion Ratio DeconstructionThe Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction, shown in the graph below, reveals the numerator and denominator of the Dividend Cushion ratio. At the core, the larger the numerator, or the healthier a company's balance sheet and future free cash flow generation, relative to the denominator, or a company's cash dividend obligations, the more durable the dividend. In the context of the Dividend Cushion ratio, R.R. Donnelley's numerator is smaller than its denominator suggesting weak dividend coverage in the future. The Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction image puts sources of free cash in the context of financial obligations next to expected cash dividend payments over the next five years on a side-by-side comparison. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio and many of its components are forward-looking, our dividend evaluation may change upon subsequent updates as future forecasts are altered to reflect new information.Please note that to arrive at the Dividend Cushion ratio, divide the numerator by the denominator in the graph below. The difference between the numerator and denominator is the firm's ""total cumulative five-year forecasted distributable excess cash after dividends paid, ex buybacks.""Dividend GrowthNow on to the potential growth of R.R. Donnelley's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity the company has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in the past 10 years, the company has a nice dividend growth rate, and a solid Dividend Cushion ratio, we characterize its future potential dividend growth as excellent. This is not the case for R.R. Donnelley's dividend growth, which we rate as very poor.Because capital preservation also is an important consideration to any income strategy, we use our estimate of the company's fair value range to assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss. In R.R. Donnelley's case, we currently think shares are fairly valued, meaning the share price falls within our estimate of the fair value range, so the risk of capital loss is medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.Wrapping Things UpR.R. Donnelley is experiencing some difficulty navigating its changing industry. Though we are not expecting 2015 to be a terrible year for the firm, reported results are likely to leave much to be desired. The fact that the company has not increased its quarterly payout in over a decade speaks to our ongoing concerns regarding dividend growth. We also aren't too thrilled about R.R. Donnelley's capital allocation history, as recent acquisitions have not panned out as originally planned. The firm's Dividend Cushion ratio suggests that the company's dividend is not as durable as we would like, and we think there are more prudent capital allocation options for dividend growth investors.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

Donnelley is more of a value investment than a dividend growth stock.See how the company plans to unlock value for shareholders with its planned business break-up.","The first thing that jumps out about R.R. Donnelley (NASDAQ:RRD) stock is its massive 6.0% dividend yield. R.R. Donnelley has paid steady or increasing dividends every year since 1985. Click here to see 12 other high dividend stocks.Steady or increasing dividends since 1985 is impressive. What's less impressive is that R.R. Donnelley has not increased its dividend payments since 2003. The company has paid $1.04 a share per year since 2003. Steady dividends aren't bad, but they don't give investors rising income.R.R. Donnelley has not paid increasing dividends since 2003 for good reason. Earnings-per-share were $1.65 in 2004. In fiscal 2014, earnings-per-share were $1.64. The company has not been able to grow earnings-per-share in over a decade. This is not a good sign for investors. The company's operations are analyzed below to see why growth has stalled - and if the company will return to growth in the near future.R.R. Donnelley Business OverviewR.R. Donnelley is the world's largest commercial printer. The printing industry is in slow decline as electronic communication supplants printed channels. With that said, the printing industry is far from dead. Case-in-point; R.R. Donnelley made $328 million on revenues of $11.6 billion in 2014.What is troublesome about R.R. Donnelley is its large debt load. The company currently has around $3.7 billion in debt. The company's fiscal 2015 guidance calls for the following:The company has an interest coverage ratio of about 3.7x. What is troublesome about R.R. Donnelley's high debt load and fairly tight interest coverage ratio is its lack of growth, declining margins, and cash flow declines during recessions.In 2005, R.R. Donnelley had an operating margin of 15.5%. By fiscal 2014, the company's operating margin had fallen to 9.7%.R.R. Donnelley's earnings-per-share reached record highs in 2007 of $2.94. In 2009, earnings-per-share declined 65% to $1.03.If margins continue their downward trend, or if another severe recession occurs R.R. Donnelley could have difficulty financing its debt obligations and potentially face bankruptcy.Segment AnalysisR.R. Donnelley currently operates in 4 segments:The image below shows the percentage of revenue from each of the company's segments (and sub-segments).Source: R.R. Donnelley Best Ideas Conference Presentation, slide 5R.R. Donnelley is well diversified across its segments. All of the company's various business units have low capital intensity; they require little invested capital to produce cash flows. Low capital intensity businesses typically generate strong free cash flows as less money is needed for capital improvements.The image below highlights the company's low capital intensity across segments, as well as the growth expectations for the company's different segments.Source: R.R. Donnelley Best Ideas Conference Presentation, slide 6As you can see, both the publishing & retail and variable print segments have negative expected growth. The International segment is really a mix of the company's 3 core business segments that are operating outside of the United States. Only the strategic services segment is expected to provide positive revenue growth going forward.R.R. Donnelley's Bold Growth PlanR.R. Donnelley's management has decided to split the company into 3 smaller businesses by the end of 2016 (pending regulatory approval which should not impede progress) via a tax free spin-off. The company will pay its current dividend until the spin-off is complete. Capital allocation (in particular, dividends) policy will be updated in each of the 3 businesses after the spin-off is complete. The 3 businesses post-spin off will be:The image below shows the expected revenue growth rate and total expected revenues of each of the 3 companies:Source: R.R. Donnelley Best Ideas Conference Presentation, slide 14The spin-offs will create 2 businesses with relatively slow revenue growth, and one business (PRSCo) with negative revenue growth. This will give current investors in R.R. Donnelley the chance to benefit from the company's positive growth operations without investing in the declining publishing and retail print business.This solves the 'negative growth problem' that is holding down R.R. Donnelley's share price. While vague, it appears that the slowly declining print business will be saddled with much of the company's debt based on the quote below from the 'Best Ideas Conference Presentation':Overview of R.R. Donnelley Post Spin-OffA brief description of each of the 'new' post spin-off companies is below.CMCo will provide retail/brand execution of labels, point-of-purchase displays, packaging, print, and digital marketing. In addition, CMCo will offer its customers logistics services and value-added services including project marketing, project management, and communication.FinancialCo will provide financial management services to businesses. Services offered include IPO documents, proxies, shareholder report solutions, delivery of investor communications, regulatory filings, report management solutions, and data analytics.PRSCo will provide traditional publishing and retail print services. Key print products are: books, magazines, directories, retail inserts, catalogs, and office products.Spin-Offs Unlock ValueThe break-up of R.R. Donnelley will unlock value for shareholders. The company has traded for a price-to-earnings ratio under 11 for much of the last 5 years. R.R. Donnelley's forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently just 10.3.With two of the 3 spin-off companies expecting positive revenue growth, the split-up value of R.R. Donnelley's assets is greater than its current value.I believe that both FinancialCo and CMCo will likely trade for price-to-earnings multiples of at least 15 if they maintain their revenue growth targets. Additional growth will come from a better focused management team.PRSCo will likely maintain a low price-to-earnings ratio as its lack of growth and declining market does not bode well for shareholders. PRSCo's management will hopefully manage the company as a cash-cow and return nearly all cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends.Final ThoughtsR.R. Donnelley's break-up will very likely prove to be beneficial for shareholders. The company's 6.0% current dividend yield is more-than-fair compensation while investors wait for the break-up to unlock value.The company is not a traditional dividend growth stock. R.R. Donnelley's poor growth over the last decade prevent it from ranking highly using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing.With that said, I believe R.R. Donnelley shareholders will see significant capital gains once the spin-offs complete near the end of 2016. Investors will also receive a 6% return from the company's dividends while they wait. The lack of a consistent dividend policy (as of yet) post spin-off makes this stock a poor choice for strict dividend growth investors. R.R. Donnelley is a compelling purchase at current prices for value investors willing to hold through the spin-off."

        PYS offers a 7% dividend at current prices.
        PYS is a debenture of RRD that must pay the dividend as long as it is a viable company.
        RRD is making the adjustments to its business model to keep it viable well into the future.","Yesterday there was an article on Seeking Alpha touting RR Donnelley & Sons Co. (NYSE:RRD). The major premise of the article was that RRD offers a good dividend and that the future of company appears bright. Unlike the author of that article, I own shares in the company because I agree with his basic arguments. However I own more shares of the preferred issue of RRD than I do of the common. The preferred issue is ML Depositor PPLUS Trust 6.30% R.R. Donnelley Certificates RRD-1 (NYSE:PYS). The CUSIP for this issue is 73941X593 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.PYS is a third party trust preferred which means that Merrill Lynch holds the Debentures of RR Donnelley & Sons and Merrill Lynch distributes the preferred stocks and pays the dividends from the interest payments from the debentures. These preferred shares can be called at any time by RRD and must be called by 4/15/2029 at $25.00 per share. Since the shares are now selling between $22.00 and $23.00 per share, one would immediately make a capital gain of several dollars per share if RRD would pay off the debentures and recall the shares.Since the shares can be purchased at around $22.50 per share, the effective rate of return is just short of 7%. Dividends on these preferred shares offer a better return than one can get from the regular shares that offer about 6.4% at the current price. Furthermore, these preferred shares get preference over the common shares if things begin to turn down. The dividend is paid 2 times a year on 4/15 and 10/15. These preferred shares are rated B1 by Moodys and BB- by S&P.The reasons for the high rate of return revolve around 2 issues. The first issue revolves around RRD and its current transformation. Since its main business is printing, many investors are concerned that the company will not keep up with the times. They are missing or dismissing the steps RRD is taking to transform the company to keep up with the times. While publishing and print services are declining each year due to electronic distribution of materials, the international and strategic services parts of the business are growing. The illustrations below were offered by RRD here RRD predicts organic revenue growth will be largely flat over the next 5 years while maintaining an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10 to 11%. This allows the company to have an annual cash flow of $400 thousand to $500 thousand annually. The company maintains that it will be able to consistently deleverage its balance sheet through 2018.The second reason for this high rate of return on PYS is due to a lack of understanding regarding this preferred stock. The listing on NYSE does not indicate that it is a trust certificate of RRD. This preferred issue is actually a debenture that has been split into smaller portions for easy distribution. A debenture is a bond or debt issue that has no specific collateral. In the event of non-payment of interest, the holders of the debt have the right to go after the assets of the company. A debenture must be paid off at its maturity date and all interest payments must be rendered as long as the company is a viable entity. Therefore this preferred actually offers better guarantees than cumulative preferred issues and/or common shares.Conclusion:While RRD appears to be a good dividend stock to own, PYS the preferred trust certificate offers a slightly higher rate of return with better guarantees of both the dividend being paid and the future return of capital. This stock allows the dividend investor to receive a good current rate of return at a tolerable risk level."
2786605,58481,2014-12-30T22:11:46-05:00,"R.R. Donnelley is a misunderstood stock because of the industry it is in.The stock offers a 6.1% yield.Revenue is expected to increase 10% in 2014, and free cash flow will easily sustain the aggressive dividend yield.","With the S&P 500 up roughly 85% over the past 5 years and the overall level of the market looking fairly valued with pockets being overvalued, I'm heading into 2015 looking to add companies with high dividend yields and good free cash flow. The easy returns seen in the market over the past several years will likely be a thing of the past as interest rates begin to rise and global economies continue to face question marks. Because of this, I expect stocks with decent dividend yields to outperform the market in 2015. One company that recently caught my attention is R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD). The stock pays a 6.1% dividend yield and provides the free cash flow to sustain this impressive yield.R.R. DonnelleyFounded 150 years ago in the print media industry, R.R. Donnelley has become an industry leader with 2014 sales expected to surpass $11 billion, making it the largest printer in North America. Today, the company has over 60,000 customers, including 100% of Fortune 100 companies and 98% of Fortune 500 companies. While many investors believe print media is going the way of the dinosaur, R.R. Donnelley has stayed in business for 150 years by being proactive and constantly looking for new markets and opportunities. The company's source of revenue has changed dramatically since 2000 by expanding internationally and into areas such as digital print. In 2000 the company had 70% of revenue coming from publishing and retail services, which now only stands at 24% of sales. International sales have nearly quadrupled and variable print business has grown by over $3 billion per year. R.R. Donnelley's long history of being able to stay relevant in an increasingly digital age warrants further analysis of the company to determine if the stock is a good investment.Source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Leveraged Finance ConferenceAnalysisR.R. Donnelley piqued my interest because of its 6+% dividend yield. However, generally when a stock pays a dividend over 5%, it raises some red flags, so I wanted to see if the yield was sustainable. Through the first 9 months of 2014, revenue has risen roughly 10% and is expected to range between $11.6 and $11.7 billion for the full year. 2014 revenue should increase over 10%, or over $1 billion, year-over-year. This was a surprising find, because on the surface it would appear print media companies are destined to decline as tablets take the place of books and everything from newspapers to magazines can be read on a mobile phone. What this assumption ignores is the ongoing need for printed financial documents, printed advertising (direct mail), product packaging and labeling, healthcare labels, and regulatory compliance requirements. The bottom line is while some sectors, such as book publishing and retail services, may see negative organic growth, other areas, such as digital print and international markets, remain largely untapped markets. In addition, R.R. Donnelley is extremely diversified with over 60,000 clients and remains the go to company for the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies. With revenue remaining fairly stable over the past ten years and 2014 renewing revenue strength, it's clear the basic assumption of a dying industry may be overstated.Source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Leveraged Finance ConferenceWith roughly 200 million outstanding shares and an annual dividend of $1.04/share, the company must be able to payout $208 million to sustain their dividend. Looking back to historical data, R.R. Donnelley has sustained their $0.26 quarterly dividend payment since 2003 without any interruption. Even during times when the stock has plummeted in price, the company has sustained this dividend.RRD data by YChartsThe company has been able to sustain the dividend because of their healthy free cash flow. For 2014, the company estimates they will produce $400 to $500 million in free cash flow. This is more than enough to payout $208 million in dividend payments. Again looking back historically, the company has achieved tremendous free cash flow. This has allowed the company to pursue acquisitions, while managing its debt.RRD Free Cash Flow (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsConcernsSource: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Leveraged Finance ConferenceR.R. Donnelley has a high debt load with $3.7 billion in debt and annual interest payments of approximately $285 million in 2014 and nearly $270 million in 2015. This $3.7 billion in debt is financed through high interest rates, which averages out to roughly 7.4%. Even though the company consistently produces impressive free cash flow, it's a concern because the company is paying more in annual interest payments than it does in dividends. The debt is spread out in manageable levels for the company to retire, but any downward pressure in operating margins or gross revenue may negatively impact the company's ability to effectively sustain the dividend down the road.ConclusionR.R. Donnelley is likely able to sustain their dividend payments for the foreseeable future, but its large debt level may scare off conservative investors. While nearly all the debt is issued at fixed rates, it still represents large annual financial commitments far out into the future, which has the potential to create problems. In the near-term (1-3 years), I believe there is enough support and revenue trajectory for the company to easily sustain their dividend. However, this stock isn't a buy and forget stock, such as Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) or Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). It requires investors who are willing to undertake due diligence on a semi-regular basis to ensure the dividend is safe. If investors are willing to take the time to actively follow R.R. Donnelley, it offers the reward of an impressive 6.1% dividend yield, which is hard to beat."

Donnelley has just spun off. The diagram below demonstrates the business segments that have been transferred to LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions. Arrow colors correspond with those of the previous segment locations.Source: made by the author using the 2015 annual report.There were 2 primary reasons why the proposed spin-off made sense. Firstly, the majority of the spun-off businesses have been facing declining revenues of late. While not a large loss for RRD, the dismissal of these businesses allows RRD and the 2 spun-off companies to wholly concentrate on their key strengths and productivity. Secondly, the proceeds from the transaction were intended to be used to reallocate the debt maturities by cutting the notes due in 2017-2019 and 2022 and issuing longer-term debt.An investment in Donnelley Financial is essentially a bet on a rebound of the financial unit's revenues, which derives its performance from the state of the global market for IPOs, M&A, LBOs, debt offerings and related financial transactions.Source: made by the author using the 2015 annual report.In the meantime, investors considering LSC Communications should be quite bullish on office products, books and the company's ability to further improve its operating efficiency.LSC Communications: a closer lookSelected financial data of LSC Communications, Inc. Source: made by the author using the data from the company's FORM 10-12B/A filing. The Pro Forma figures reflect the post-transaction adjustments.But what about the company's operating performance? As seen in the chart below, operating margins have been fluctuating quite significantly over the last 2 years.Source: made by the author using the data from the company's Form 10-12B/A filing.Despite being slightly offset by the the downtrending capital expenditures, cash generation has been rather sluggish recently.Source: made by the author using the data from the company's Form 10-12B/A filing.The print segment, through which LSC generates the majority of its operating income, has been demonstrating declining revenues and requires additional focus. Otherwise, the ongoing margin expansion might cease to compensate for the falling sales. On a more positive note, office products segment has been demonstrating solid growth and might soon become a more significant contributor to the top line if the company's productivity maximization strategy succeeds.Considering the revenue seasonality, investors might want to pay additional attention to the margins in Q3 and Q4. Finally, of note is the frequency of significant impairment charges. LSC usually performs its goodwill impairment tests as of Oct. 31. Thankfully, only the top-performing businesses - book and office product units - had goodwill as of Oct. 31, 2015. Third quarter results are going to be published on Nov. 10.Source: made by the author using the data from the company's Form 10-12B/A filing.Donnelley Financial Solutions: a closer lookThe motivation for the spin-off becomes even more apparent when one begins to analyze Donnelley Financial Solutions. The company provides technology and expertise based communication solutions to shareholders, regulators and investors. From the 8-K: ""Donnelley Financial is a financial communications and data services company serving both the investment and capital markets worldwide. Our clientele is primarily focused in three areas: global capital markets (GCM), global investment markets (GIM), and language solutions. Our business is diversified across a range of products and services, including content management, multi-channel content distribution, data management and analytics services, collaborative workflow and business reporting tools, and translations and other language services in support of our clients' communication requirements."" Here is a brief overview of the company's services from its webpage.Source: company's website.As mentioned before, the company's performance is dependent on the state of the global financial activity. The global market for IPOs, M&A, LBOs, debt offerings and related transactions is what drives its revenues. Any negative developments in financial activity, equity valuations and capital flows might pose substantial headwinds to the company's profitability.This sensitivity is greatly evidenced by the recent earnings picture. DFS is definitely not the stock one would like to stay long over an extended market downturn.Source: made by the author using the data from the company's Form 10-12B/A filing.Among the major recent headwinds mentioned in the company's filings were falling transactional and compliance volumes (Capital Markets), and unfavorable mutual funds price dynamics and volumes (Investment Markets unit).Value investors might become concerned with the fact that goodwill and other intangibles constitute almost a half of the company's total assets, which results in a negative tangible book value per share of about $(9.69) vs. a simple book value of $5.88 - a far cry from the current share price of $22.92.The book value calculation involved the use of the company's estimates on debt issuance, representing the issuance of $650.0 million in debt at a cost of $15.6 million and a consequent cash transfer of $634.4 million back to RRD. Even though this leaves DFS with a Debt/Equity of about 3.3 as of June 30, 2016, short-term liabilities do not pose any substantial risk. On September 26, 2016, the pricing of 8.250% Senior Notes due 2024 ($300 million) and a $350 million senior secured term loan B facility (LIBOR + 4%, s.t. a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) was announced.On a less positive note, DFIN has been facing severe cash generation difficulties of late.Source: made by the author using the data from the company's FORM 10-12B/A filing.Concluding thoughts on RRDThe table below demonstrates the post-transaction allocation of revenues and expenses between RRD and the spun off companies. Despite retaining the majority of the consolidated company's revenues, RRD fails to keep its share of operating profits proportional. Its operating margins increase to 2.5 from 1.75 percent if one adjusts for the spin-off transaction expenses, however.Source: made by the author using the data from the company's 8-K.The pro forma statement of operations from the recent 8-K, which puts the 6-month earnings attributable to the continuing operations of RRD at just $100,000, puts a large emphasis on 2 adjustments:Source: company's 8-K.Even though the company has already terminated its debt obligations maturing in 2018 and 2019, it still has to deal with the $250 million 6.125% senior notes due January 15, 2017 and $260 million 7.000% senior notes due February 15, 2022 for the adjustment to be valid.The majority of the company's businesses are stagnating. However, one should not exclude the possibility of more successful acquisitions such as that of Consolidated Graphics.Source: made by the author using the data from the company's 10-K.The issue associated with the negative tangible book value per share is shared by all of the stocks.Source: made by the author.ConclusionAs the article's title suggests, the spin-off is no cure to business stagnation in R.R. Donnelley's case. Nonetheless, there are numerous positive aspects of the transaction, too. Of particular note is the impact coming from the debt maturity postponement, which should provide more flexibility and allow for a stronger focus on margin expansion. As far as the companies' expectations are concerned, one should not underestimate the potential of productivity growth in the upcoming quarters, especially considering the historical margin volatility. Finally, successfully implemented acquisitions might substantially change the thesis presented above. A key risk to the thesis lies in the fact that historical earnings of the separated companies - which were essentially ""cut out"" of the consolidated figures - might not prove to be reliable data to base forecasts on, which the companies acknowledge in their filings.On a less positive note, (1) stagnating revenues, (2) disappointing operating margin dynamics, (3) weak cash flow generation and excessive valuations from the Price/Book standpoint make the case for a bearish thesis. Despite the positive ratings, I am particularly bearish on DFIN due to the stark revenue cyclicity, margin compression and severe cash generation issues. For as long as the near-term prospects of the global financial activity remain exceptionally uncertain, it would take a lot of optimism to remain bullish on Donnelley Financial.Even though RRD and LKSD might be viewed as slightly better picks, their fundamentals continue to display multiple weaknesses and should be monitored closely. Of particular importance to the near-term price action might be the changes in analyst ratings. While DFIN and LKSD remain relatively underfollowed and are about to be put on coverage, RRD might experience significant consensus rating changes in the coming months. Finally, institutional accumulation might lead to increased near-term volatility, making the near-term performance of the stocks increasingly uncertain. Even though DFIN seems to receive positive investor attention at this point, lack of fundamental improvement might drag it lower in the coming quarters. Jim Cramer has recently changed his view and now says that he ""cannot get too enthusiastic"" on the spin-off, and neither do I.I assign a Sell rating on RRD, DFIN and LKSD. I might also post follow-up articles depending on the near-term price action and upcoming earnings.Post-spinoff performanceRRD data by YChartsAdditional Reading"
3421476,85856,2015-08-10T04:48:22-04:00,R.R. Donnelley had a challenging 2nd quarter.R.R. Donnelley announced they would be splitting into three separate publicly-listed companies.I take a look at what impacts this decision may have for investors.,"OverviewI assume many income investors are familiar with R.R. Donnelley (NYSE:RRD); the company was for many years a traditional printer, dating back to 1864, and has a long history of paying dividends. The stock has likely not garnered much interest from dividend growth investors in recent years, as management has not raised the dividend since 2003. The company has, however, been a solid income play, with a 6+% yield, and steady track record of payments, even maintaining the payment throughout the great recession when many others cut dividends. I owned RRD back during the recession, buying in the $9s, and selling in the $13s, so my past experience with the stock was favorable. I probably should have held it longer.What's NewDonnelley reported earnings this week, and the stock shot up as the company beat analysts' estimates on both revenue and earnings per share, largely as a result of cost-saving efforts. The problem for most analysts, which surfaced during the conference call, was that the company saw organic sales decline by 2.1% as compared to 2014; and when you consider currency and other, and the impacts of acquisitions and dispositions, the top-line figure was off by 5.3% from Q2 2014. These disappointing results likely pushed investors to the exits, as the stock sold off, more than erasing the gains from the opening of the trading session, when the stock had soared to near $19.00.But more compelling than just another quarter was management's announcement that they would be splitting the current company into three separate, publicly-listed companies in 2016. Specifically, management is breaking the current business into the following three companies:Note: Donnelley has yet to come up with names for the individual companies to be formed, so for now they are referring to them using the above descriptors of what their operations will be.Management argues that breaking up the companies will allow them to deliver value on a number of fronts, particularly by allowing each business to focus on its own strategies, increasing organic growth opportunities, allowing each to have flexibility in its capital structure, and lastly by achieving better valuations than they are receiving under the current business format.What I find compelling about the company is that in the last 10 years they really have morphed from being solely a traditional printer into a multi-channel organization deriving revenue from many different streams. Obviously printing is still their bread and butter, but I have been impressed to see just how diversified their business has become.Source: RRD Q2 2015 Investor Presentation.ChallengesWhat has always caused me to be concerned with RRD is the high level of debt on the balance sheet, and management's inability (or lack of desire) to pay any of it down over the past few years.Clearly their strategy has been to maintain the capital structure and use cash generation and borrowings to finance acquisitions and pay the dividend. The issue with all of this is that cashflow generation has never been terribly robust, and the payout ratio has historically been high. So the question is, are we just going to see the fruits of these efforts now, as management unlocks shareholder value when they separate the businesses?Getting back to my original thesis, if management truly is looking to grow the business lines, then they likely will need to invest more in acquisitions, CapEx, etc. as their current mix is not delivering robust growth. If this is the case, then we can only assume that at least one or two of the companies will be paying a lower dividend, if any at all.Management declined to comment on what the future dividend will look like under the split; however, I am left to assume that the traditional printing business will maintain a higher dividend rate than the other faster growing segments.For income investors, if one were looking to maintain their current income stream, they may need to be prepared to sell shares in one or two of the companies, in order to load up on the highest-paying business.Unfortunately with little visibility we are left to speculate as to what the dividend will be post-split. Management did, at least, let us know that the current dividend will be maintained going into the split, later next year.ValuationDonnelley currently is trading at a P/E of 10.8, significantly off of its historical ratios, so one could argue that with the recent sell-off, the stock looks cheap right now. Admittedly the print industry is going through some secular decline, but one has to applaud Donnelley for finding new avenues of growth, and recognizing that there is value to be unlocked by splitting up.Source: Historical Graph - Copyright © 2014, F.A.S.T.

        Acquisitions growing RRD’s global solutions and becoming a one-stop-shop for all business solutions.
        RRD high free cash flow $400 million trailing twelve months allows RRD to pay down debt, continue acquisition strategy, and pay huge dividend; 6.24% yield.","Company BackgroundRR Donnelley & Sons Co. (NYSE:RRD) is a diversified printing and media solutions provider with products ranging from magazines, newspaper inserts, forms, labels, to packing solutions. RRD is positioning itself to be the one-stop-shop for all corporate communication needs. RRD generates about 25% of its revenue outside of the US.Investment CatalystRRD's sales are estimated to increase by 11.25% (average estimate form FactSet) in FY14 which will be driven by its competitive pricing and acquisitions.RRD is one of the largest full service printing and labeling providers. RRD uses its size to switch from using several small print shops to meet all of their needs to RRD capitalizes on its size and economies of scale to gain and retain its customer base.RRD also uses strategic acquisitions to generate growth, acquiring a broad range of print and non-traditional service companies. RRD leverages its scale and expertise to reduce expenses within printing operations, and generate growth by cross selling new service offerings to its large customer base. Recent acquisitions have been aimed in the creation of a global footprint allowing RRD to dominate the global supply chain solutions.RRD's fastest growing segment is its Strategic Services line, which includes financial services, logistics, digital, and creative solutions and sourcing offerings. In this segment logistics has generated double digit revenue growth year over year. For example, logistics has been able to realize rapid revenue growth through the expansion in third-party logistics and international mail offers, which requires little capital investment and are complementary to many of RRD's other services. Another line in this segment that is fueling growth is the creation offerings, including photography and design services. In the creation offerings, RRD is aiding customers in the design process of labeling and advertising strategies. RRD's ability to consult with customers on their projects develops stronger relationship with customers and helps push customers into choosing RRD as a one-stop-shop for all business needs.RRD operates with a Debt/EBITDA level of 3.2x, slightly below its five-year average of 3.3x. Management is expecting leverage to lower in the range of 2.25x-2.75x, to allow room for further financing of acquisitions when they see fit. Historical and expected leverage ratios are shown below. RRD will paid down debt with its strong free cash flow generating abilities as seen in its three-year average free cash flow of $550 million. RRD returns capital to shareholders as seen in its high payout ratio of 90% (FY2013) and a huge dividend yield currently at 6.24%.ValuationI have se three valuation methodologies in my analysis of RRD, a capitalization of trailing twelve months free cash flow, capitalization of trailing twelve moth dividends, and a comparable company analysis.Capitalization of free cash flow and capitalization of dividends are presented below. From the capitalization of free cash flow and dividends price target are $20.50 (23% upside) and $20.37 (22% upside) respectively.Comparable company analysis is presented below.As you can see from RRD's peers, RRD trades at a steep discount to peers as RRD is in line with profitability metrics and has a significantly higher dividend yield of 6.24%. The comparable company analysis suggests a price target of $20.87 (25% upside).ConclusionAs RRD continues to develop its full service one-stop-shop to meet all business needs RRD will continue to grow as a dominating player in the global supply chain solutions provider. As shown though the three valuation methodologies presented above, RRD is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value derived through capitalization of free cash flow and dividends, as well as a steep discount to peers. As such, my calculated price target is $20.58 (24% upside) a simple average of all three valuation methodologies."
4084469,85856,2017-06-28T08:11:25-04:00,Last Year R.R. Donnelley Broke itself up into 3 Separate Publicly Listed Companies.I review how the break-up has impacted Income Investors.I compare Q1 2017 Performance and Stock Metrics as Compared to the Predecessor Company.,"OverviewI have long been a follower of R.R. Donnelley, writing on the company a number of times prior to the completion of the break-up of the company last year. For those unfamiliar, the company was for many years a traditional printer, dating back as far as 1864, and has had a long history of paying dividends. The company has morphed somewhat over the years, adding numerous value-added traditional print and digital services, and this expansion lead management to conclude that investors would be best served by breaking the company up. As it stands now, what once was R.R. Donnelley alone is now the following three publicly listed companies:Looking at How Income Investors Panned OutPrior to the split each share of R.R. Donnelley was paying a quarterly dividend of $.26 which generally yielded over 6% relative to the share price. When I wrote about the breakup announcement I cautioned that very likely investors would see their quarterly dividends take a hit as the new companies would use the opportunity to reset their dividend policy.As part of the break-up, shareholders received 1 share of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial for every 8 shares of old-RRD held. Immediately after distributing those shares, RRD initiated a reverse stock-split, issuing 1 share of new-RRD for every 3 shares of old-RRD. For illustrative purposes I am going to assume that an investor held 240 shares of old-RRD, which would entitle them to 80 shares of New-RRD and 30 shares each of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial.Based upon this logic, prior to the break-up an income investor would have collected $62.40 per quarter in dividends. Now that we are a couple of quarters in, we have seen how the dividend policies have been reset for each of the three new companies. We know (from Seeking Alpha’s fantastic coverage) that new-RRD pays $.14 per quarter in dividends while LSC pays $.25 per quarter. Donnelley Financial does not pay a dividend. So, with that information we see that same holder who was collecting over $60 per quarter now receives a mere $18.70, representing a reduction of more than 70%.I will caveat this by saying that there was always the chance that a shareholder could have sold shares in either LSC Communications or Donnelley Financial along the way to try to recreate more of their yield, but from looking at the math, it seems that one would never have been able to fully recreate it.So if income was reduced, then did the break-up create price appreciation?Coming out of the gates last October the breakup looked to be a great idea as investors who had bought prior to the break-up were sitting on gains. If you sold immediately following the split up, you might have done well. Since coming public; however, both R.R. Donnelley and LSC Communications have seen significant declines while Donnelley Financial's stock has largely traded sideways.Source: seekingalpha.com, June 27, 2017 It’s clearly been a bumpy road since the breakup, and we’re now to the point where any ‘value’ unlocked by breaking up the companies has been completely erased. Going back to the 240 share example, using a pre-split price of about $17.74 per share (obtained from my last pre-split article), the value one held prior to the break-up is significantly reduced with current valuations as of the time of writing.Comparing Key MetricsSo in light of the fact that dividend income has been cut and there has been significant value destruction, I wanted to turn our attention to a quick look at revenues and debt.I did a quick comparison of each company’s most recent 10-Q’s filed with the SEC for Q1 2017, comparing revenues and debt levels to Q1 2016 when it was reported as old-RRD, pre-spin-off.Source: Data obtained from SEC filings for Q1 2017 and Q1 2016What becomes quickly obvious is that revenue growth is muted as a whole increasing only 4%, and the only entity to have shown any measure of growth over the past year, Donnelley Financial, was somewhat timid about the beat and only raised guidance slightly.I was initially shocked to see that long-term debt has risen so much, but my fears were somewhat tempered when I saw that total liabilities had increased by significantly less. Likely there was some shuffling on the balance sheet between long-term debt and other liability categories. Either way it was not encouraging to see debt increase at largely the same pace as revenue and tells us that nothing has changed with these companies. The companies can’t seem to be able to grow income outside of acquiring companies, a strategy which has only continued post-break-up.*Note I was not able to agree the three entities Q1 2016 revenues (as reported in their Q1 2017 10-Qs) in total to what the old-RRD filed in Q1 2016. The quarterly filings are unaudited and likely there was no comparisons or addition among the new entities to ensure consistency.TakeawaysAt this point nothing has changed with the new companies. Revenue growth is largely non-existent and leverage has gone up. Any price appreciation which resulted from the break-up has now evaporated and investors are likely facing losses.Given the sluggish results I would not anticipate any quick turnaround is in place, and with the large debt loads I would not count on any sort of increase in the quarterly dividends either (not that R.R. Donnelley was in a position to raise them in the past either).New investors will find these stocks trading relatively cheap, with RRD yielding 4.5% and LKSD yielding 4.6%, however; that is what happens when companies stall out. At the current levels of yield, I would look elsewhere. The yield from the two payers isn't too far from many REITs, who actually are growing and raising their dividends. There is always the chance that maybe one or more of these companies will be acquired, but that's hardly an investment thesis."
2543355,70495,2014-10-07T13:28:40-04:00,$450m in FCF for 9+ years.Long-term strategy of valued added services and roll-up acquisitions.Highly fragmented industry implies long future of consolidation.,"R. R. Donnelly (NYSE:RRD) is a 150 year old commercial printer and services company. Having been around for most of the evolutions of media, this company has survived numerous waves of innovation in communications.The company's history, a narrative which can be found here, has its origins in a small printing plant in Chicago in 1864. For our purposes we are looking at RRD because of its very large cash flows: $400m to $500 million in FCF guidance.Compared to its market capitalization of $3.28 billion, that is a FCF yield of 12.3% to 15.2%. These flows make it look like it might be on the cheap side. However, for us, we would have much preferred to purchase the securities at prices prevailing at the start of 2013, not because the stock subsequently did well (up about 100%) but because the company's TTM FCF yield hit 30% and was running at 8.7% of EV at the time. The fact that the company sold at a PE of 3.3 and then subsequently doubled shouldn't be lost on the reader -- the stock was very cheap from a quantitative perspective.While it is still cheap to some degree and while we think the 6.4% dividend is fairly safe despite ongoing pressures, we want better prices. However, we think the roll-up strategy is working and that the industry will have a long drawn out consolidation. The stock seems fairly valued to slightly undervalued given the industry's prospects. Let's take a closer look.OperationsIn this fragmented but consolidating industry, R.R. Donnelly is the big dog. It is the largest domestic commercial printer. Headquartered in Chicago, the company operated 308 facilities in the U.S. and 155 facilities internationally approximately encompassing a 47.9 million square feet (64% owned, the remainder leased). These facilities serve 60,000 customers.RRD is a fortune 500 company -- rank 264 -- and has 57,000 employees. It serves 100% of the fortune 100, 98% of the fortune 500 and 95% of the fortune 1000. R.R. Donnelley is a ""top of industry"" company, it is dominant. Yet, compared to the size of the industry -- a $140 billion industry domestically -- it is plain that R.R. Donnelley's dominance accounts for less than 10% of the market.Take a look at historic revenues:One can see that much of the revenue increases have been associated with acquisitions. This is generally how it looks when a declining industry is consolidating and ""rolling-up"" other companies. This ""roll-up"" strategy can be very effective in terms of raw cash flow:The consolidation strategy could play out for a significant period of time. In the investor presentation on September 9th, 2014, the company displayed this slide:(Investor presentation Sept. 9, 2014, slide 6)The top 400 printers were only 35% of the industry, illustrating the fragmentation which remains out there. This, by the way, is one reason we feel Cenveo's (NYSE:CVO) recent acquisition of National Envelope (which was largely to take the bankrupt but productive assets off the market and to channel old Natioanl Envelope customers to Cenveo) is not going to solve the competitive problems in that market -- it is simply too fragmented.This fragmentation stands to benefit the commercial printers which have had a better history of rolling up acquisitions and have better operating histories, like RRD, Quad/Graphics (NYSE:QUAD) and Ennis (NYSE:EBF). If these printers are able to roll up acquisitions for a sufficiently long period then all three might be attractive (particularly RRD and QUAD however).Take a look at market cap and EV across that 9 year period:Around the start of 2013, the common stock sold at a massive discount, as related at the start. Assuming $450m+ in FCF, the yield was well over 30%+ at the time and the yield on the EV was 8.7%.Anyways, revenues are up across the period, free cash flow was flat across the period at around $450 million and dividends per share flat lined:But, as we know, the market has not been rewarding RRD and hence the dividend yield has risen:Clearly the business is viewed as mature and declining. However, RRD is in a much different position, with regards to its bargaining power, than Cenveo (whom I wrote about yesterday). Let's take a look at that.Passing On Raw Materials InflationThis is a good position to be in and is nearly the opposite of Cenveo's position. CVO directly absorbed raw material price increases for some time and they were only able to achieve a 5% price increase this year after their absorption of the assets of National Envelope (which theoretically increased their bargaining power).R. R. Donnelley claims that some 71% of their business' cost structure is ""highly variable."" Seeing that the industry is in general decline (although managements across the board are seeking to grow their various businesses) a variable cost structure will handle revenue declines much better a sizable fixed cost structure would. The higher the fixed cost aspect of a business, the more operating leverage is exposed both up and down as revenue rises or declines.Part of the variable cost structure might also be the value added services provided by RRD. The company sells its services to end-users particularly in its logistical operations. You can see the split between product sales and service sales on the income statement (please try our Filings Reader for Android!):(2014 Q2 10-Q, p. F-2; source: Time & Model's Filings Reader)As one can see, while services only make up 16.3% of the business it is also the growing side of the business. The company writes,The services the company provides are wide ranging:A number of these services are directly tied to USPS:Therefore, there is some risk to the business model whenever USPS changes their policies and prices. The company writes in the 10-K:Postage on very large mailing can become a significant, perhaps deterrent, cost. Let's take at the businesses most important fixed cost -- its debt.DebtHere are the company's debt levels:(2014 Q2 10-Q, p. 22; source: Time & Model's Filings Reader)As one can see, the company has a significant debt load, however the maturity schedule appears easy to manage:(Investor presentation Sept. 9, 2014, slide 6)Look how manageable this maturity schedule is -- the largest near term maturity is 2019 and it is only $411 million (well below the historic FCF levels). It takes till 2021 before the company has an annual maturity which might have to be cautiously planned for. This is an impressive schedule given the corporations fairly sizable debt levels. We think the debt is secure and the dividend is secure --particularly considering the ability of corporate managers to refinance well ahead of time.Appendix: Guidance & PrioritiesHaving so many good visuals in front of me, I think I may have gone overboard. Below is the company's five year projections and the company's strategic priorities:(Investor presentation Sept. 9, 2014, slide 17)The company intends to continue to produce signficiantly cash flows for the next 5 years at least. Take a look at the company's priorities:(2014 Q2 10-Q, p. 21; source: Time & Model's Filings Reader)For what the business is, we believe these cash flows are fairly safe and that these priorities are intelligent.ConclusionR. R. Donnelley is on the cheap side but we would rather wait for a really good price. We would definitely be buyers if we again saw the prices which prevailed at the start of 2013. Our luck is unlikely to be that good but there is a reasonable chance we will see better prices at some unknown date. We might bit at FCF yields in the high teens or twenties.The debt maturity schedule is well designed, the dividend appears safe and the industry is poised for a long slow decline. The current level of fragmentation, despite ongoing consolidations, promises to make the roll-up consolidation of this industry very long indeed. Further, R. R. Donnelley has pricing power whereas Cenveo does not. R. R. Donnelley is on our watch list.

Donnelley (NYSE:RRD)R.R. Donnelley (RRD) is in a tough space. It is in the printing business, when everything is going digital. Shares have collapsed over 20% for the year, but it has a 6% dividend. The company has a large debt burden. CEO Tom Quinlan says the debt will soon be within reasonable limits, given the company's cash flow. The stock is also great for investors, given its nice dividend and buybacks. The company is expanding beyond ink and paper and is going into sensor labels, where there is plenty of demand.A Market Pick-Me-UpAfter a few down days, stocks moved up a bit on hopeful comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and stability in oil futures. Interest rates might move higher, but the market doesn't know quite when. However, the concerns that have been driving stocks down have abated somewhat.Off the Charts With Stocks and OilCramer consulted the technical analysis of Bob Lang concerning trends in stocks and oil prices. Lang showed that oil prices are not likely to come up soon, but measured declining oil prices against the chart of the S&P 500. He demonstrated that when oil dropped, stocks managed to produce gains, so that is yet another reason that investors should not abandon stocks with oil falling.5 Stocks to Buy: CVS (NYSE:CVS), Clorox (NYSE:CLX), Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB)Cramer discussed stocks to buy in the current environment. CVS (CVS) has been a leader in the sector, and its no-tobacco rule has helped rather than hurt the stock. Clorox (CLX) is boring, but is a consistent performer. Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Monster Beverage (MNST), while representing opposite ends of the healthy eating and drinking trend, give strong returns. Kimberly Clark (KMB) is also a good stock to cling to in times of trouble.CEO Interview: Roger Stone, KapStone Paper (NYSE:KS)Kapstone Paper (KS) is in the paper industry, which is a difficult place to be, but CEO Roger Stone is seeing price stability with more consolidation and less competition. The cost of building a new paper mill is off-putting to those who want to enter, and that also allows KS to grab market share.

1847282,51992,2013-11-18T15:15:45-05:00,,"R.R. Donnelley Sons & Company (NYSE:RRD) is a leading global provider of integrated communications for the largest corporations around the world. They are also the largest print company in North America. To put it simply, RR Donnelley helps clients communicate more effectively with their consumers. They are able to do this thru their extensive selection of products and services such as pre media, printing, logistics, supply chain management, mailing, and outsourcing to name a few.I view R.R. Donnelley as a company that handles all the branding and printing needs of their clients and offers solutions that further compliments those needs. For example they handle packaging, forms, labels, magazines, books, brochures, mail services etc. These services are necessities for all businesses regardless of size and industry. Their clients consist of the world largest corporations. They have 60,000 clients worldwide with 95% of Fortune 1000 companies as clients. The industry itself is highly fragmented and competitive. Customers are looking for the lowest price to go along with quality and great service. Management understands this and part of their growth strategy is to continue lowering its cost structure along with differentiating their services.R.R. Donnelley understands the ever changing market and how to stay competitive. With technology becoming more sophisticated, print media is shifting more and more to digital media. People rather read the Wall Street Journal on their tablets or online rather than read a hard copy. From a consumers perspective information is consumed much more efficiently and economically digitally then physically. This trend has definitely hurt the printing industry to an extent and will further reduce the market size over time but RRD has been adjusting for this. Their answer is diversifying their products, investing in new technology, and restructuring the company. The stock price has been on a decline since the Great Recession of 2007-2008 but has rebounded this past year. RRD is up over 100% year to date. The rebound in price is a reflection of an improved business model that is positioned for long term growth and profitability. Below is an excerpt of their growth strategy from their 2012 annual report.R.R. Donnelley is a simple company, but they are an industry leader making the right decisions to solidify that position. Most recently RRD reported earnings and came into an agreement with Consolidated Graphics (NYSE:CGX) to allow RRD to acquire them. RRD reported a good third quarter. They reported net sales of $2.6 billion, up 4.2% from last year and also beat the street reporting 38 cents per share versus consensus of 37 cents. RRD raised guidance on revenues from $10.1- $10.35 billion to $10.35- $10.45 billion for the full year 2013. Seems like all the restructuring and cost reductions they have done over the past two years have begun to pay off. The company reported earnings a week early on October 24, 2013 and the market has responded positively to the news ever since. I believe RRD would be a good long term investment, but I've isolated a short - intermediate term trade that I feel has a great risk reward opportunity with a high probability of working.You can find my technical analysis in the charts below.As you can see RRD lines up from a monthly chart all the way down to a 15 minute chart. All time frames are pointing towards a move higher and the recent pull back into $16.30 establishes a clear support level. It's clearly in an uptrend long term and short term and we also have the fundamentals in line with the technicals. From a purely technical perspective, I feel you can buy it at the current price for a short term move above $19.50 and for a retest of the $23 resistance level and hopefully a break out from there. In this trade I see it as you are risking roughly a dollar to make roughly 3-5 points or 20-30% on the low end. I also see this move happening within the next 2-4 weeks. If you really believe in the long term prospects of the company on the swing trade works out you could even hold it for a larger move and collect an additional 6% on the dividend or 26 cents per share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in RRD over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1641352,43471,2013-08-16T16:40:49-04:00,,"RR Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) is up an outrageous 108% year-to-date. Not bad for a company whose industry was supposed to die with the computer - anyone remember the paperless office? - or at least with online shopping. Fortunately for shareholders, RR Donnelley is still doing a few things right. RR Donnelley got its start as a printing company 145 years ago and has expanded and evolved over time. The company now bills itself as a ""global provider of integrated communication... the company employs a suite of leading Internet based capabilities and other resources to provide premedia, printing, logistics and business process outsourcing services to clients in virtually every private and public sector."" What this means in practice is that RR Donnelley can produce nearly anything printed from newspaper inserts to books to catalogs to display advertisements to financial documents. And they have services along the entire production path, from being the largest producer of digital photography in the US to layout to print to shipment, inventory and delivery. The struggle, of course, is that RR Donnelley's biggest segment - printing - is an industry of decreasing volume and shrinking margins.Bull thesisThe bull thesis for RR Donnelley has four points: likely to win consolidation in the industry, able to provide highly specialized business and print services, an improving pension position, and most importantly the ability to provide a one-stop-shop for all of an enterprise's print-oriented communications.Although RR Donnelley is the country's largest commercial printer it holds only about 5% of the total market. RR Donnelley has been active in acquiring other printers - primarily in specialized offerings - and continues to expand its own capacity - particular in textbook printing. As margins across the basic printing business continue to shrink, I expect that consolidation will continue and even accelerate. As the largest player RR Donnelley has a head start in winning the consolidation of the industry. Technical advances help the volume leader as technology will continue to aid economies of scale. Thus RR Donnelley actually has room for a great deal of expansion within its core industry. While margins are not likely to improve, total profits should. This is not unlike the situation, which faced Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in the early and mid part of the century when growth meant volume not margin.RR Donnelley has been pushing into higher tech and more specialized print services. For example, RR Donnelley is now the largest digital photography studio in the US. They also produce book content in every major e-reader format for digital publishing. RR Donnelley has facilities for placing RFID into their products for either tracking or customer engagement. They also acquired EDGAR Online, which expands their existing financial publishing offerings. The vast majority of RR Donnelley's operational strategy is pursuing these newer areas of opportunity. As one measure, early in the century traditional printing - books, magazines, newspapers, catalogs - formed 70% of RR Donnelley's revenue, while today it is less than 30%. Success in continuing the transition will determine RR Donnelley's future prospects.RR Donnelley's position in a range of services makes it a strong competitor for integrated accounts. This is best observed in marketing and branding campaigns. When a company needs to produce a wide range of new materials - imagine what rebranding a bank or airline entails - a printer with significant breadth and ability to manage across services is critical. A special piece in this point is national and international logistics. In order to provide distribution of print material, RR Donnelley has developed an extensive low cost logistics capability. This is now generating its own revenues with growth in the 10-15% range annually.In an ironic twist, RR Donnelley's legacy pension plans will make its future look better than the recent past. While the pension plans are no longer taking new members, the existing commitments need to be funded. Required contributions to the pension plans have taken out a significant amount of RR Donnelley's cash flow in recent years. However, with increasing interest rates returns will be higher and (perhaps even more importantly) discount rates will be higher. According to the recent earnings call, an 80bps increase in discount rate reduced the pension liability by about $425 million. Thus the past years of QE have been costly in terms of pension liabilities, but the coming end to QE and (eventual) rising Fed rates will significantly cut back those liabilities and increase cash flow.Summarizing, again RR Donnelley's strength is its position to provide integration across a wide range of services. When an enterprise wants to put out a big marketing campaign they will need a suite of supporting items - imagery, brochures, signboards, inserts, packaging, labeling, perhaps even manuals for its products. RR Donnelley can provide all of the above along with the warehousing and logistics to get them all to the right place at the right time (and then file the profit reports with the SEC to boot).Bear CaseThe bear case for RR Donnelley has four main points: the core business is a low margin shrinking industry, it has high pension and debt liabilities, it has had significant acquisition write-offs in recent years, and the stock has already rebounded significantly.The principal reason RR Donnelley stays out of favor is the very real concern that its core business is in a long-term decline. Growth in most of the printing segments of the company has been slightly negative over the past few years. This is a result of lack of pricing power due to excess capacity in the industry. As a result, margins on traditional print segments have been in the 0 to negative 3% range. If RR Donnelley is unable to move into higher value services, the old operations will not support a growth story.Second, RR Donnelly has significant liabilities. As mentioned earlier, RR Donnelley has significant pension obligations. Unfunded pension liabilities are over $1 billion. Further, RR Donnelley maintains a significant debt position at $3.5 billion. Management has a goal of reducing that and has been slowly chipping away at the debt level, but it remains significant. While RR Donnelley has successfully rolled over $400 million in debt this month, the rates do not show any improvement in interest expense.Finally, goodwill totals $1.4 billion. This is significant as RR Donnelley has written off $1.8 billion in the last two years. This illustrates that some of the acquisitions in the core print segment have significantly failed to hold value (that's 50% of the company market cap written off). RR Donnelley continues to make targeted acquisitions - something I've listed as a positive - but if they continue to be billion dollar write offs there won't be any company left.ConclusionRR Donnelley holds a strong industry leader position. They have shown the foresight to leverage that position into new and more sustainable offerings, which are more likely to hold margins. RR Donnelley's success will depend on using its broad range of offerings, large print volumes and ability to integrate offerings to win contracts and drive increased revenue. The question then is what is an appropriate multiplier for the company?Unfortunately, RR Donnelley's high debt makes a price to book valuation nonsensical, illustrating the leverage risk. While the company is optimistic this can be reduced, it remains a concern.Using earnings, and looking at the early 2000s, RR Donnelley typically traded at around P/E of 15. Taking the last quarter earnings and projecting that over the year, gives forward EPS of 1.44 and a price of 21.60. If we take last full year results and back out the write-down we get EPS of 2.71 and a price of 40.66. The latter is near all time highs and seems a bit rich.Another possibility is to look for an appropriate dividend yield. Given that cash flow can comfortably cover the current dividend, then 5% yield gives a price of 20.80, and a 4% yield gives 26.00. Both figures are reasonable for a mature industry with sustained cash flow. I should mention that RR Donnelley's dividend has been stable for at least ten years - even through the crisis - though unfortunately not growing.If RR Donnelley can maintain its current operations without any major write-offs, another 15-50% is possible this year. Further growth would be reason for even greater gains.Disclosure: I am long RRD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

        Printed electronic products are key for RR Donnelley to drive revenue growth in the future.
        The company is currently working on commercializing bendable RFID antennas, sensors, and ultra-thin batteries.
        The I Know First algorithmic forecast predicts a positive trend for the three month and one year time frames, which coincides with outlook for the printable electronics industry.","R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (NYSE:RRD) is a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Chicago, IL that provides print and print-related services. In other words, the company helps organizations communicate more effectively by working to create, manage, produce, and distribute content on behalf of its customers. The company assists customers in developing and implementing communication strategies through various platforms that engage audiences, reduces costs, drive revenues and increase compliance.Over the past 3 months, the stock has returned nearly 13 percent as shown below, while also returning capital back to its shareholders in the form of a healthy $1.04 dividend, producing a yield of 6.50 percent.Additionally, the company posted strong financials for the second quarter for 2014. Net sales grew 12.9 percent from the second quarter of 2013, largely due to the acquisitions of Consolidated Graphics and the North American operations of Esselte. However, net earnings attributable to common shareholders came in at $64.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, down from $65.4 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, from the same quarter of the prior year. This was mainly a result of the diluted share count increasing by 18.2 million shares between the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, primarily related to the new shares issued in connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Graphics and the North American operations of Esselte. The share dilution resulted in a drop in the stock's price at the beginning of the year, but the F500 Company has since recovered.In recent news, R.R Donnelley has been praised for its success in its global markets. On August 11th, the printing giant announced that its Global Outsourcing Services had been recognized in Asia's Best Employer Brand Awards for 2014. Not more than a few days later, Donnelley declared they had been awarded a five year, multi-service contract by Allianz Insurance to provide onsite creative design services along with print management and transactional print services. And on August 6th, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company announced it had been named a 2014 Partner in Transformation by Sears Holding Company. The printing giant supports Sears Holdings' operations and strategic initiatives by supplying newspaper circulars, direct mail, in-store graphics, and logistics services. This award is especially prestigious, as it is given to less than half a percent of Sears' 30,000 suppliers. It is evident that Donnelley excels in the printing industry's current landscape, but as technology becomes more sophisticated, R.R. Donnelley will have to figure out how to adapt in order stay competitive.Future in Printed ElectronicsThe company began looking for new lines of business about five years ago, as traditional ink-on-paper printing revenue has been on a downward spiral since 2000, only accounting for 24 percent of total sales in 2013, down from 70 percent in 2010.CEO Thomas J. Quinlan III believes printed electronics could have the potential to become one of RRD's strongest product lines down the road. The company is currently looking for growth in the market for printed electronic parts, such as thin, bendable RFID antennas, sensors, and batteries. Printed electronics refers to a range of technologies in which printers manufacture electrical devices on various substrates. The market for printed electronics shows promise, but the competition is immense, with companies such as Palo Alto Research Center Inc. and the Xerox Corp. (XRX - NYSE) also developing printable electronics that can easily print on plastics, film and textiles.R.R. Donnelly is currently constructing prototype antennas and thin, flexible batteries for a range of sensor-embedded labels, which are pieces of clear film with ultra-thin electronics printed on their surface with electronically conductive ink. The sensors can measure shock and tilt, the presence of specific chemicals, humidity, light or the fluctuation in temperature for, say a heat sensitive shipment over a 48-hour period.Donnelley buys some of the sensors and makes others. In 2011, the corporate titan took an equity position in Solicore, the leader in embedded power solutions. R.R. Donnelley prints the ultra-thin batteries and antennas onto the film and integrates additional electronics using its own process. The result looks something like a clear sticker with an image on the front. Donnelley is also testing printed batteries as a potential power source for credit cards providing security data, which will feature lighted images or a stream of PIN codes.According to MarketsandMarkets, a global market research firm, the thin film and printed battery market was valued at $181.5 million in 2012 and is projected to reach a net value of $1.21 billion by 2017, translating into a compound annual growth rate of 46.14 percent. One of the biggest growth opportunities for flexible batteries is credit and debit cards, as printable batteries allows the card holder to store more security data and account related data on the card itself, as a tool to prevent theft and fraud. With billions of credit and debit cards currently issued, there is clearly a widely-established market for this technology.However, this is by no means a niche product. The applications for these printable batteries are only restricted by the imaginations of the design engineers. For example, printed batteries can be used in transdermal delivery patches for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and wireless micro-sensor products for healthcare and logistics.LimitationsThe disadvantage of these printed batteries is that they have low energy density and are not rechargeable. While the prices for the batteries are competitive, the inability to recharge the battery detracts many potential customers. Donnelley is working to further lower product costs by developing new inks and integration processes and forecasts that revenue will increase as much as 12.7 percent this year from $10.5 Billion to $11.8 Billion. This would be a huge jump compared to the one percent gain in 2013. The printing process for these batteries is extremely scalable and customizable, making them the clear choice for any application where thinness or flexibility is vital.According to Harry Zervos, principal analyst with IDTechEx, the printed electronics market still faces significant challenges. Regarding printable antennas, the passive RFID tags market will generate sales of $9 billion this year, while only one percent of antennas for those devices are printed. The majority are still made using a process called chemical etching, a procedure that is currently under heavy international investigation due to the use of dangerous chemicals.If R.R. and Donnelley is able to develop consistent and dependable printable electronics it will have no problem growing its customer base. The giant printing corporation has the brand, resources, and R&D dollars needed to expand the printable electronics market.AlgorithmI Know First uses an advanced self-learning algorithm based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and artificial neural networks to predict the flow of money in almost 2000 markets from three days to a year. This algorithm provides traders with a tool they can use to identify new investment opportunities in addition to their own analysis. The algorithmic forecast- when coupled with the necessary due diligence - can be effectively used to determine entry and exit points on individual equities, such as RRD.This is not the first time R.R. and Donnelley has been on the algorithm's radar. The chart below shows the algorithm's daily forecast for the three day, seven day, 14 day, 30 day, 90 day, and one year time horizon for the past five months. On March 17th 2014, the algorithm indicated a sell for RRD and it dropped nearly 16% in the 10 weeks that followed. On May 14th, the signal line jumped above RRD's price line, indicating a buy, and the stock has been on a tear ever since.RR Donnelley was also a top stock pick in our aggressive stock forecast issued May 16th, which can be seen in the figure below. This forecast is a component from our Risk Conscious Forecast, and comes with two distinct forecasts. We determine our aggressive stock picks by screening our database daily for higher-volatility stocks that recently moved often strongly up or down. These aggressive stocks present more opportunities, but are also more risky. Our conservative stock picks are determined daily by screening our database for lower-volatility stocks that are subject to less risk.The color-coded forecast is very easy to read, where green indicates a bullish signal and red indicates a bearish signal. Deeper greens signify that the algorithm is very bullish, and vice-versa for deeper reds. The signal is the number flush right in the middle of the box and the predicted direction (not a specific number or target price) for that asset, while the predictability is the historical correlation between the prediction and the actual market movements. In other words, the signal represents the forecasted strength of the prediction, while the predictability represents the level of confidence. These are two independent indicators, but consider both as you make your own analysis. The image below shows the latest algorithmic forecast for RRD in the one month, three month and one year time horizons.ConclusionHaving been in business for well over 100 years, R.R. Donnelley understands how to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving printing market. The Chicago based company has recognized that the demand for printable electronics is expected to ramp up in the near to long term time horizon and has positioned itself accordingly. Not only has it taken a stake in Solicore, the pioneer in lithium polymer battery strips, but the printing giant has started manufacturing printable electronics via its own printing process. Printable batteries, antennas, and sensors have proven to be effective, and as RRD's supply chain improves and costs are brought down, it will have no trouble penetrating new markets and growing existing ones. The I Know First Algorithmic forecast supports this analysis with an extremely bullish outlook for the one year time horizon. While our technical indicators do point to uncertainty in the next few months, this stock is a clear buy for the long term hold."
1405641,27231,2013-05-06T12:00:33-04:00,,"We previously analyzed and evaluated R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (RRD) last November because we were taking a second look at it after its share declined by 50% relative to when we were apprised of it. As we previously mentioned, a local registered investment advisory firm tipped us off to the ""potential surrounding RRD"" back in 2011. Thank G-D we demurred back in 2011 because although RRD has been able to maintain its $1.04/share dividend, its share price has declined steadily until recently. We were quite surprised to see its share price pop recently after it released its results because its adjusted income in Q1 2013 declined by 13.6% versus the prior year's comparable period.Source: Morningstar DirectAssuming the economy does not take a spill thanks to the impending implementation of ObamaCare, we think RRD may have reached a near-term bottom of $8.30/share in January. We were and remain apprehensive of taking a capital position in the company even though it has an 8% dividend yield. The good news for RRD shareholders is that the company's total revenue increased by 54bp year-over-year. The bad news is that it had to spend $127M on acquisitions in order to achieve this lofty achievement. The worse news was that the gross margin gains it obtained from acquiring smaller service oriented companies was not enough to offset its declines from its core printing products operations.RRD's gross margin percentage declined by 100bp in the Q1 2013 period versus the Q1 2012 period. 60 basis points of the decline was due to the customer rebate adjustment in 2012 and 50 basis points was due to the impact of pass-through postage revenue related to its recent logistics acquisition of Presort Solutions, both are factors that RRD noted on its earnings call in February. RRD's organic revenue growth (after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, changes in foreign change rates and pass-through paper sales and the 2012 customer rebate adjustment) declined by 1.2% in Q1 2013 versus Q1 2012. At least this was better than the 2.1% organic revenue decline posted in Q4 2012 versus Q4 2011.After taking a second look, we think that the reason why RRD recently popped was because investors were pleased that RRD incurred less restructuring and asset impairment charges in Q1 2013 versus Q1 2012. We believe investors were content that the company was making progress in rationalizing its operations and that the amount of ""non-recurring charges"" was coming to an end. Although RRD's loss on debt extinguishment charge went up, we believe that investors view that as discretionary and a ""start-up cost"" in pursuing potentially opportunistic management of its outstanding debts (in RRD's case, refinancing now while it can still access credit, even if RRD has to pay a higher interest rate on its new debt versus its old debt). Although RRD's operating cash flows in Q1 2013 declined by $43.8M and its free cash flows declined by $30.6M (due to reduced CapEx and investing expenses), we think investors gave RRD a free pass because nearly of the decline in free cash flows was due to timing shifts of working capital payments and receipts.Although we still prefer to redact the name of the local RIA firm and employee that previously shared with us the ""hot tip on RRD"" (because it is someone we know) we can see that it is but one of many firms that have a significant stake in the company. We were surprised that our friendly local RIA sold 22.6% of its stake in Q4 2012 however it still has all of its original position that it entered into a few years ago (it sold a portion of the shares it acquired after the quarter in which it acquired its original stake). Columbia Management is another local active manager in our town that owns a significant stake in RRD and it owned 2.65% as of Q4 2012. Putnam Investments used to own 3.08% of RRD in H1 2012 but it sold off the bulk of its shares in Q3 2012 and the rest of its position in Q4 2012. The largest shareholder of RRD is The Capital Group Companies and its affiliates (including the American Funds Mutual Fund Family), which owns 20% of R.R. Donnelley's stock. Granted, The Capital Group is the ninth largest money manager in the world and it has $1.1T in AUMs, but at least it isn't an index shop. SunAmerica Asset Management owns 6% of RRD as of its most recent quarter reporting, LSV Asset Management has 3.88%, Epoch has 3.13% and Elm Ridge has 1.93%. New investors in RRD during the most recently reported quarter include Brandywine (1.89%) and Alpine Woods (0.91%).Source: Morningstar DirectRRD is expected to incur $200M-$225M of CapEx during FY 2013 and generate $400M-$500M in free cash flows. RRD paid $187M in cash dividend payments in FY 2012 and is expected to pay a similar amount in FY 2013. Although RRD has a dividend payout cushion of $2.13-$2.65 in free cash flows for each $1 of dividend payments, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will commit to maintaining its dividend. Unlike bond interest payments, cash dividends to shareholders are not an ordinary and necessary business expenditure. Not only are businesses unable to deduct cash distributions to shareholders as a tax-deductible business expense, but shareholders must also recognize that dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the board of directors. Even a company that has a cushion of $3 in free cash flows for $1 of dividend payments can cut its dividend payment in half and then eliminate it two years later (despite carrying a $5/$1 cushion) if they have a bad quarter.Source: RRD's Q1 2013 10-QAs we previously mentioned, RRD is expected to generate $400M-$500M in free cash flows and pay $187M in cash dividends during FY 2013. This will leave $213-$313M in unencumbered cash flows that could (and should) be used to meet a portion of its upcoming debt maturities over the next nine years. The good news for RRD is that its ROE for 2013 is expected to be around 300%. The bad news is that RRD's projected ROE of 300% is due to its heavily leveraged balance sheet and slim shareholders' equity position. RRD's slim book value position is due to the $3B in asset impairments it has taken since the beginning of FY 2008. Investors will want to keep an eye out to see if RRD decides to cut its dividend payment in order to accelerate its debt repayment schedule in order to boost its credit rating.Source: Morningstar DirectIn conclusion, we've kept a loose file on RRD since we received an email from a local RIA touting it. However, we're not ready to join the RIA and other asset managers who have a position in the company. We like the high dividend and free cash flow yields that the company has and we like that well-regarded asset managers are putting their client's money in the company. However, we don't like the secular decline of the company's primary business as well as the acquisition related spending that the company has made in order to give itself a new lease on life. At least this whole episode teaches us that just because large and famous institutions have a position in a company, doesn't mean that investors have to jump right into it. It is important for investors (especially professional investors like us) to take the time necessary to conduct (y)our own research especially when someone seems to have fallen in love with a stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1073131,27221,2012-12-19T11:37:03-05:00,,"When looking for high-yielding stocks for a dividend portfolio, you need to ask a few basic questions. First, is the company growing or is there significant potential for growth? Second, is the company fairly valued, i.e., do I think the share price could rise in the next few years. Finally, is the dividend sustainable and practical for the company to continue at current levels (and ideally increase regularly)?When looking for companies that met these criteria, I came across R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co (NYSE:RRD). R.R. Donnelley is the largest printing company in North America, specializing in the production of catalogs, inserts, magazines, books, directories, and financial and computer documentation. The company operates through two segments, the U.S. Print and Related Services segment (74% of revenues) and the International segment (26% of revenues).The printing industry has struggled to adapt over the past 15 years or so. Technological changes, such as the electronic transmission of documents and data, online hosting of media content, advances in digital printing, and internet technologies all impact demand for RRD's services. The company also does not expect any growth in book volumes due to the boom in e-reading over the past several years.RRD's general strategy is to lower its cost structure and try to improve the quality of its products to stand out in its industry, and so far it is succeeding. Another part of the company's strategy is to enhance its products and services through strategic acquisitions, having made 9 since 2010.Aside from its enormous dividend yield (more on that in a second), the most attractive thing about RRD is its insanely cheap valuation. Although RRD had a rough patch from 2007-2011 due to consolidation in the industry, the company's business model is beginning to turn nice profits once again. In fact, analysts estimate 2012 earnings per share of $1.87, with the stock trading around $9.00 as of this writing. This equates to an EPS multiple of 4.9 times 2012 earnings. In addition, earnings are projected to grow at a modest rate of 5% annually for the next three years. While this is certainly not the most exciting growth rate in the market, a 4.9 multiple for a growing company is simply unheard of.So why is this stock so cheap? As the chart above shows you, RRD has fallen from the mid-20's to its current levels over the past few years. Part of this is due to the previously mentioned losses that RRD incurred as a result of restructuring its business to keep up with the changing times for the sector. From 2007-2011, RRD had a positive EPS only one year.However, I feel that the deep discount in the stock is a result of general pessimism about the printing industry in general. Anything involving printed material is generally seen as a dying industry in the eyes of investors, and the population as a whole for that matter. To further back up this claim, consider that RRD is one of the most frequently shorted stocks in the market, with a staggering 28.09% short interest. However, RRD is expanding by capitalizing on the exit from the market of smaller, weaker competitors. As RRD acquires smaller printing firms and expands, the company will gain market share as it leverages its geographic and product breadth in its favor. Operating margins in 2012 and 2013 will be helped by increased productivity and cost synergies from its recent acquisitions, and its revenues will rise slowly but surely.Now, the big question on investors' minds: Is the dividend sustainable? It certainly is if the analysts are correct about the forward earnings. RRD has paid out $1.04 a share annually every year since 2004. Analysts are projecting earnings of $1.87 this year, $2.00 next year, and 5% growth from there, so do the math. For this reason, analysts have an average 1-year price target of $13.25 on the company, which is 6.7 times projected 2013, well below RRD's historic valuation levels. This represents a 45.8% upside potential over current levels, and I believe this target to be very conservative. If RRD meets analyst expectations and turns in a few more positive quarters, I think the stock will gravitate toward the lower end of its historic EPS multiple, around 8.5 times earnings. Based on projected 2013 earnings, this translates to a target of $17.In the meantime, however, bear in mind that you are paid over 11.4% to wait and see.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1284891,24491,2013-03-19T03:55:47-04:00,,"Every month in Valuentum's Dividend Growth Newsletter, we identify firms that may need to cut dividend payments in the future. While timing is difficult since companies can do a number of things to prop up dividends until cash flow situation becomes dire, as we've seen at firms like SuperValu (NYSE:SVU) and Roundy's (NYSE:RNDY). Our forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion has caught several dividend cuts over the past year, including J.C. Penney (JCP), CenturyLink , and Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC). We're not sure RR Donnelley's (NYSE:RRD) dividend will be the next to go, but prospects certainly look negative.In the firm's most recent quarter, RR Donnelley exceeded consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines, though the company had to take a $1 billion impairment charge. The company even generated positive free cash flow of $486 million, and it anticipates free cash flow will remain between $400 million to $500 million in 2013. Revenue declined 2.1% year-over-year during the fourth quarter, which was better than the 5.2% decline we saw in the third quarter. The firm's core US print business remains in secular decline, but the company is experiencing decent growth in Asia, Latin America, and its logistics business. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP gross margins even rose 20 basis points year-over-year to 21.9%, while SG&A only increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 10.9%. Still, the print business is in a secular decline, and the firm is suffering from competitive price erosion.Ultimately, the company's secular decline is a less of a worry to investor, in our view, than the highly leveraged balance sheet. Companies can often overcome secular problems when cash balances are high and leverage is low, but the opposite is true for RR Donnelley. The firm had $3.4 billion of long-term debt and $1.15 billion in pension obligations at year end, and the company has had to issue relatively high yield debt with longer duration to tender debt that is coming due in the next five years. According to its February 28th press release, the company will issue $450 million of its 7.875% Notes due 2021, saying:""The offering is expected to close on March 14, 2013.RR Donnelley intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, along with borrowings under its revolving credit facility, (1) to fund tender offers for up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of its debt securities, including up to $300 million of its 6.125% Notes due January 15, 2017, up to $150 million of its 8.600% Notes due August 15, 2016 and up to $50 million of its 7.25% Notes due May 15, 2018 and (2) to pay premiums in connection with those tender offers.""Fortunately for the company, the current interest rate environment has an insatiable appetite for yield, so the company (likely) won't have a hard time raising debt, even though the firm doesn't have investment grade ratings from any of the credit rating agencies. S&P has a credit rating of BB with a negative outlook, and Fitch went as far as to withdraw its rating after moving it down to BBB- with a negative outlook.The company's yield of 9.5% may look tempting, but the firm's dividend scores -0.9 on the Valuentum Dividend Cushion, so its dividend isn't safe. Naturally, since the dividend isn't safe, we also don't like its growth prospects. We are not saying RR Donnelley is going out of business, but we do not like the odds that its high yield continues, so we're staying away from shares in the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Donnelley & Sons Company (NYSE:RRD) provides business services like printing, business process outsourcing, logistics and pre-media services, to clients globally. It has an attractive dividend yield of 10.2%, which is sustainable over the short term. The stock is trading at a forward P/E of 5.4x with 34% of its float short and a short ratio of 22 days. If the free cash flow level falls below the forecast $500m, investors should expect a dividend cut.The company pays an annual dividend of $1.04/share. The high dividend yield of 10.2% is mainly due to the 31% YTD decline in stock price. The company has maintained the same quarterly dividend of $0.26/share since 2003. The free cash flow yield is 21% at the moment, according to Reuters. The dividend coverage ratio (earnings per share/dividend per share) for 2012 and 2013 is 1.7x, considering the $1.84 EPS expected from RRD in both years. The cash dividend coverage ratio (free cash flow per share/dividend per share) is 2.6x, as the company expects free cash flows of $500 million for 2012. The company expects higher cash generation in 2H of the year because of the normal operating cycle of the company. Thus, the dividend seems to be sustainable at current earnings and cash flow expectations, though growth should not be expected.The company has an interest coverage ratio (trailing twelve months) of 1.75x, which means that its earnings can just cover the interest obligations. The total debt to equity ratio as of the most recent quarter is 354%, with $343 million as current debt as of the last quarter. The company has been able to get debt/credit to repay the maturing debt e.g. notes maturing in January 2014 and as well as to repurchase senior notes maturing in April 2014 and May 2015. $258 million of April 2014 debt remained according to Q2 earning release, along with $299 million of the notes maturing in 2015. The only problem here might be the fact that the company is replacing debt with interest rates of 4.95% and 5.5%, with costlier debt at 8.25% interest rate.The gross, operating and net profit margins in the last twelve months have all been below their 5-year averages due to economic conditions.The company has beaten analyst estimates of earnings in the first two quarters of the year. The company guided to $10.4-10.5 billion in revenues for 2012, while analysts expect $10.37 billion. EPS guidance is $1.84-$1.92 as compared to analyst consensus estimates of $1.84. Last year, the EPS was $1.82.Free cash flow trend in the future would be the key measure to follow in order to judge when the dividend would be cut. The graph below shows the free cash flow (TTM) over the last 5 years for RRD.If the $500 million level is maintained, the dividends should be safe. Over the long run, there is plenty of risk that deterioration in cash generating abilities linked with declining top line from the company's business will result in a dividend cut. Prospects of the company depend on macro economic conditions as well. At the moment, the stock is fairly priced at 5.4x forward P/E and EPS expectations of $1.84 for 2013. Quad/Graphics, Inc. (NYSE:QUAD) has a forward P/E of 9x and also operates in the business services industry.RRD is going to report Q3 results on 1st November.

1221551,21414,2013-02-25T13:09:11-05:00,,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) is an international printing company, with the majority of sales derived from printing magazines, books, catalogs, directories, retail inserts, financial documents, forms and labels. The company has also attempted to diversify and currently offers logistics services and some digital media services, but the bulk of its sales are still derived from print media. Since my first article on R.R. Donnelley, a rather negative piece, the stock has declined from a 9/11/12 close of $11.96 to a close on 2/22/13 of $9.83. Factor in the $0.52 in dividends, and the total return is a loss of (13.5%) in a little over five months.I remain decidedly negative on the stock, and this article will put forth 8 possible things that could go wrong this week for the company, centered around the fourth quarter earnings release Tuesday before the market opens and 10 a.m. ET press conference. These items include poor earnings, poor sales, poor cash flows, ""one time"" charges, a reduction in the dividend, lowered guidance, analyst downgrades, and a credit downgrade. I will also throw in a few wild cards for additional consideration.The Past Being ReportedEarnings:The first item to worry about this week will be non-GAAP earnings. The company and analysts both use non-GAAP earnings as the standard measure for quarterly and yearly comparisons. These earnings leave out all the special ""one time"" charges, although with R.R. Donnelley, these charges have been anything but one time expenses. The following table shows the previous six quarters earnings and sales progression for the company:Analyst Source: Yahoo. The rest taken from company press releases.As one can see, company earnings have remained in a narrow range of $0.44-$0.53 per share for the last 12 quarters, with one exception. For this fourth quarter, both the company and analysts have guided below the general range, with the average analyst estimate (out of 5 analysts) at $0.37, while the company has guided at the low end of a range, which puts earnings around $0.42-$0.43 per share, on a non-GAAP basis. Although highly unlikely, what could go wrong here is a miss of the company's own earnings estimate, or even more unlikely, a miss of the analysts' estimate. In the past four quarters, the company has beat the analysts each time. If the company were to miss these estimates, the stock could take a big drop, though again, this is highly unlikely.Sales:Referencing the above table, the company's sales have been in deceleration over the past several quarters. Both the company and analysts expect a decline in sales for Q4 similar to Q3. Again, missing the estimates is unlikely, but certainly possible. Missing the sales estimate would be worse for the company than missing the earnings estimate, as this would affect other worrisome items, such as the credit rating, as discussed later.Cash Flow:A lot of the valuation of R.R. Donnelley relies on the cash flow and its ability to pay dividends. By the company's own estimates in the 3rd quarter earnings release, operating cash flow is expected to be around $450 million before capital expenditures. This number is more important than sales and earnings, as the ability to pay dividends, the ability to pay down debts in the future, and the company's credit rating all rely heavily on a steady operating cash flow. With 182 million diluted shares outstanding and a dividend of $1.04 per share annually, the company will spend $189 million of its cash flow on dividends alone, assuming the dividend rate is held. Any short fall in cash flow is likely to hit the stock hard and become a worry for bond holders as well.As shown in the 3rd quarter SEC filing, the company had a net drawdown in cash over the first nine months of 2012 of $56.8 million, as compared to $151 million in the first nine moths of 2011. The company had $392 million in cash at the end of the quarter. The amount of cash as compared to debt is alarming. In roughly the next five years, through May 15, 2018, the company has $2,028 million in debt due. With current cash of roughly $400 million, the company has to come up with $1.6 billion in cash to cover debt over the next five years, or convince investors to fork over additional financing. Therefore, of the things that could go wrong this week for R.R. Donnelley, missing on the cash flow number would set off a chain of negative events, and may be the most important number for the company to hit.Charges:Every year, the company assesses the value of goodwill held on the books on October 31. If the value of the goodwill declines, this results in a charge for fourth quarter earnings. Last year, the company reported $507 million in restructuring and impairment charges for the fourth quarter and $667 million on the year. Between this and other factors, equity eroded by nearly $1.2 billion to just over $1 billion by the end of 2011.Like most companies, management tries to steer investors towards focusing on a particular set of numbers. In this case, management highlights cash flow from operating activities, minus capital expenditures, the new businesses the company has acquired, and their changing product mix. However, all the acquisitions that created the goodwill have to be evaluated for their future potential. When the potential declines, charges result and equity erodes. As of the end of the third quarter, the company still had $2.27 billion in goodwill on the books, versus $1.15 billion in equity. This is the biggest reason I believe there is little to no value left in the company. Impairment charges are likely to occur once again in this fourth quarter report, and will likely erode equity once again. Charges are definitely something that could go wrong this week for R.R. Donnelley.The Future Being ProjectedThe DividendR.R. Donnelley has been a stalwart when it comes to paying dividends. For this reason, many investors continue to hold shares over time and defend the company's prospects, despite losing more money on the share price decline than what is being paid out in dividends. As I highlighted in a past article, to have bought this company for the dividends and held long term would have been a losing prospect for the last decade. Simply put, the share price has declined faster than the company has been able to pay dividends. However, the current high yield of 10.6% has likely created somewhat of a floor on the company's price. If management were allude to a change in this policy in either the earnings press release or conference call, the stock would suffer immensely. A change in dividend policy is certainly one thing that could go wrong this week for R.R. Donnelley.GuidanceThe company typically offers three items in its guidance for investor consideration. The first item is usually annual sales, which the analysts put at a moderate decline of 2.1% to $9.96 billion in 2013, according to Yahoo. The second item typically provided is non-GAAP earnings, which the analysts put at $1.70 for 2013, or a 5% decline from their 2012 estimates. The third item is cash flow, which is the most important item for bondholders, those expecting continued dividends, and the credit rating agencies.All three of these items will be negatively impacted by the e-book and e-reader market. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, perhaps the authority on media sales, had this to say about the e-reader/e-book category versus print for the fourth quarter of 2012 in the company's earnings release:The largest share of R.R. Donnelley's business comes from print media. With a statement like this from Jeff Bezos, the reality of the decline of print media is becoming evident. Not only can one bypass a physical book with an e-reader, but other items such as magazines and phone books are heading to digital media and can be accessed by e-readers.A growing part of R.R. Donnelley's business has been the logistics segment, namely its logistics services for the United States Postal Service. In recent weeks, the pending end to Saturday delivery for the USPS has been highly publicized, as this arena of printed media is also in decline.Although R.R. Donnelley has made inroads into the digital media business, it's a small part of the company's overall sales and in 2013, I do not expect it to grow fast enough to counter the decline in print media. Therefore, I believe guidance to be one of the biggest things that could go wrong for the company this week.AnalystsWith any earnings report, analysts are likely to come out and adjust guidance and their buy/sell/hold recommendations on a stock. If any of the aforementioned possibilities of things that could go wrong this week for R.R. Donnelley comes to fruition, it's likely an analyst downgrade or downward revision in earnings guidance will be seen.Credit RatingThe last of the 8 thing that could go wrong this week is a downgrade to the credit rating of R.R. Donnelley. A shortfall on sales, earnings, or cash flow could affect the company's credit rating. More likely to affect the credit rating would be company guidance for lower cash flows next year than rating agencies currently expect. Although in the short term, this would not change the material operations of the business, in the longer term, the company will struggle to be able to pay a dividend, cover pension liabilities, and cover the existing debt structure. Any material decline in operations is likely to warrant a credit rating downgrade and thus, the company's ability to obtain financing in the future or to refinance the massive debt load it carries. For stock holders and bond holders alike, a credit rating downgrade is yet another thing that could go wrong for R.R. Donnelley this week.Wild CardsAlthough there are certainly many other wild cards that could pop up this week for the company, I'd like to highlight three. First would be the addition of more debt. Sometime in the next 14 months, the company has to figure out how it will pay $258 million in debt due on April 1, 2014. The current credit facility and cash on hand are both possible routes to take, but the company may offer more debt instead. This seems highly unlikely to me so far away from the due date, but it is something to consider.Second is the possibility of the company putting itself up for sale. Earlier this year, the stock moved up on rumors the company was going to sell itself. In most instances, this would be viewed as a positive event, however, for those who have held the company's stock over the long term to collect the dividend, a sale would not get investors out of the hole unless the purchase price was extraordinarily above recent prices.The last item that may be most likely as a wild card would be the announcement of additional charges. The company may consider closing facilities, impairing extra goodwill, or any number of other items, which would result in additional charges to be taken in 2013. An announcement of this sort may not change revenue, cash flow, or earnings, but any erosion in the company's equity at this point should create a big pocket of worry for stock holders and bond holders alike.ConclusionThis article focused on things that could go wrong for R.R. Donnelley and Sons this week. The biggest worries I see are from lower than expected guidance, a drop in the dividend, and a credit rating downgrade. Any of these items is certainly a possibility, given the expected decline in the company's top and bottom lines. I will admit, however, there is still a strong possibility that nothing could go wrong this week. Earnings, sales, and cash flow could come out better than expected, guidance could be good, analysts and credit agencies could upgrade the company, and I could be in for a big surprise. But for now, I remain bearish on a company I think has no long-term value and will likely be out of business within the next 7-10 years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Donnelley's Attention-Getting YieldsR.R. Donnelley & Sons currently has several bonds on the market that investors might consider for their high yields. For instance R.R. Donnelley's 2021 bonds have an 8.57% yield; that is more than 5 times greater than the current 10-year U.S. treasury rate:The 2029 bonds are trading at $88.62, some might consider this a good discount. The 2017 and 2018 bonds are trading slightly under par and offer very high yields, 6.69% and 7.70%, respectively. Of course, the bonds are rated below investment grade for a reason, so investors must realize there is more risk.R.R. Donnelley Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-Score is one formula for gauging a company's risk of bankruptcy. The Z-Score relies on total assets and fractions of the company's:A score above 2.99 is thought to be a safe zone, a score between 1.82 and 2.98 is a grey zone; 1.81 and under signifies a distress zone.

Donnelley listed negative $326M net income, however, there was a $507M non recurring expense:The 2011 Annual Report shows:Thus far, the return to positive quarterly net income is a sign that such expenditures could be paying off. However, investors are currently weary of printing companies, especially those not involved in business that can draw revenue from the internet. So let's take a look to see how R.R Donnelley is trying to keep up with the digital age. R.R. Donnelley's digital solutions segment includes:To give an idea of some of these services, the e-Book service states:The eDelivery services states:R.R. Donnelley: Most Recent Quarterly ReportR.R.

R.R. Donnelley's debt maturity schedule is as follows:The quarterly report also shows that Asia was the only international market where R.R. Donnelley saw increased net sales:This is even more of a reason for investors to be cautious. In fact, I would only consider R.R. Donnelley bonds if I had profit from other positions to fund the majority of the investment. As well, consider allocations, to individual junk bonds, at less than 5% of a total portfolio.Balancing Quality and YieldHere I will form an example that will combine R.R. Donnelley bonds, higher quality Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bonds and an income fund. While the 10-year and 20-year treasury rates have fallen to 1.62% and 2.36% respectively; junk bonds like R.R. Donnelley's may tempt investors:10 Year Treasury Rate data by YChartsIn this example I will use the 2017 R.R. Donnelley bonds, over the 2016 bonds, because the 2017 bonds are under par. I will also use the 2021 bonds, because they are listed as call protected, and they currently offer a greater yield than the 2029 bonds (though the 2029 bonds are less expensive.)I will also use R.R. Donnelley common stock, because it currently has an 11.2% dividend. To counterpoint the non-investment grade R.R. Donnelley bonds, I will include Goldman Sachs bonds, because they are call protected, offer a monthly coupon and are investment grade. There is also an income fund, to provide exposure to multiple other companies and types of income:*totals include estimated commissions and accrued interestThis example adds just one more R.R. Donnelley bond to each position in the $1M portfolio. This illustrates the conservatism I believe investors should consider, however, even a smaller portfolio could consider these individual high yield bonds.While Moody's and S&P rate Goldman Sachs bonds investment grade, like any company they are not totally risk free. Given the fact treasury rates are so low, the R.R. Donnelley bonds may be worth the risk; so long as proper allocations, that balance risk, are employed. The company is in the Z-Score distress zone, and the business is hurting, so a bankruptcy is not impossible. Still at this rate R.R. Donnelley would generate ten years of treasury returns (1.62% x 10 = 16.2%) in two years, at an 8.57% yield.If you have any thoughts regarding R.R. Donnelley and Sons junk bonds, or this example, please leave a comment below.Disclosure: I am long RRD, MCO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Donnelley & Sons Company (NYSE:RRD) may not have a government sponsored license to print money, you wouldn't know it from its bottom line. The author gave it a 5 star performance rating and a ""thumbs up"" rating to its Dividend Reinvestment Plan. During the 1990's, RRD was the world's largest and most profitable commercial printing company and it reeled off a 33 year streak of dividend increases from 1971-2003, before snapping it in 2004 and seeing its annualized dividend frozen in time at $1.04. RRD was a forgotten stock on our pay no mind list until last year, when we received an email from someone we knew at a local RIA about RRD. This RIA has held RRD since Q2 2010 and this email was touting RRD as a turnaround play. At the time, RRD was yielding 5% and the RIA's thesis was that RRD would be harvesting its cash flows for dividends and share repurchases. Unfortunately, the thesis hasn't worked out the way the RIA expected it to as the shares have dropped by 40% since Q2 2010 and by 27% since we were alerted to it. At least it wasn't the only firm that held turnaround hopes for RRD.Source: Morningstar DirectAlthough we prefer to redact the name of the local RIA firm and employee (because it is someone we know) we can see that it is but one of many firms that have a significant stake in the company. Other local active managers in our town that own a significant stake in RRD as of Q2 2012 include Columbia Management (4.14%) and Putnam Investments (3.08%). The largest shareholder of RRD is The Capital Group Companies and its affiliates (including the American Funds Mutual Fund Family), which owns 20% of R.R. Donnelley's stock. Granted, The Capital Group is the ninth largest money manager in the world and it has $1.08T in AUMs, but at least it isn't an index shop. NFJ Investment Group owns 8.72% of R.R. Donnelley and its parent Allianz has 2.3%. LSV Asset Management has 4.11% and Elm Ridge has 2.61%.Source: Morningstar DirectAnyway, back to the email we received about RRD. The email touted RRD based on a number of reasons and we debunked each reason listed. We were inspired to write about it because RRD came out with uninspiring EPS as well as a significant decline in its FCFs on a year-over-year basis. Here is a replay of what our friendly neighborhood RIA was saying about RRD.""RRD is using their FCF (stock traded at a 10% FCF yield (as of August when we received the email)) to buy back 25% of their outstanding shares over the next two years."" We were amused at the thought of RRD buying back 25% of its shares over a 2 year period because it had only repurchased 10% of its shares from 2004-2010. The good news is that the company is halfway towards its repurchase goal as it borrowed $500M to repurchase shares under an accelerated repurchase agreement with an investment bank. RRD received 19.9M shares under the agreement in May 2011 and an additional 9.3M shares in November 2011. In 2012, the company has issued 1.9M shares under its employee stock compensation programs. The bad news is that it spent an average of $17.12/share with this agreement in 2011 and yet its shares trade at $10.02 as of November 1st.Source: Morningstar Direct and RRD's Q3 2012 10-Q Notes""RRD has taken a hard look at further acquisitions in its own industry and said ""No thanks""."" We beg to differ because anyone can see that RRD had spent $4.3B on empire building acquisitions since 2005, including $440M in 2010, $142M in 2011 and $89M in 2012. RRD has taken $3B in asset related impairments since 2005 and its market capitalization is currently $1.8B.Source: Morningstar Direct and RRD's Q3 2012 10-Q Notes""RRD shares trades at a 10% FCF yield and is a liquid way to participate in this profitable leveraging strategy and get paid 5.5% to do so.(figures were quoted as of August 2011)"" We were tempted to take a long position in the company this year because the company's shares had declined from $14/share in August 2011 to $11 in October 2012 before the October 18th fiasco involving the mishandling of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings release. We like that the company now has a 10% dividend yield and 17.1% free cash flow yield as well as increased operating income on a year-over-year basis for Q3 2012 and YTD 2012. However we didn't like the fact that the increase in operating income for Q3 2012 and YTD 2012 is due to lower depreciation and amortization accruals, as well as lower asset impairment charges. Despite cutting its selling, general and administration expenses by ~13% for Q3 2012 and YTD 2012, these cuts were not enough to make up for declining gross margin dollars due to the company's continuous decline in sales. Also, we didn't like the fact that the company had a free cash flow deficit of $80M for YTD 2012, versus $164.6M in YTD 2011.Source: R.R. Donnelley's Financial Results Website""Instead, RRD is leveraging up its balance sheet, utilizing currently artificially low rates to reduce its after tax cost of capital…borrow now and paying back in future devalued dollars."" RRD has $3.79B in short and long term debt outstanding as of Q3 2012. The company generated $553M in free cash flows last year and paid out over $700M in dividends and net share repurchases. Assuming that the company wisely refrains from pursuing the rest of its buyback and generates the same level of free cash flows this year, it will pay an estimated $187M in dividends, leaving $366M in available cash for 2012. We think that if anything, it would be more prudent for the company to use its remaining unencumbered cash flows to pay down debt rather than share repurchases or boosting the dividend since the company has a significant debt load, as well as $1.12B in pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities.Source: RRD's Q3 2012 10-Q NotesIn conclusion, we've kept a loose file on RRD since we received an email from a local RIA touting it. However, we're not ready to join the RIA and other asset managers who have a position in the company. We like the high dividend and free cash flow yields that the company has and we like that well-regarded asset managers are putting their client's money in the company. However, we don't like the secular decline of the company's primary business as well as the acquisition related spending that the company has made in order to give itself a new lease on life. At least this whole episode teaches us that just because large and famous institutions have a position in a company, doesn't mean that investors have to jump right it. It is important for investors (especially professional investors like us) to take the time necessary to conduct (y)our own research especially when someone seems to have fallen in love with a stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

901911,24191,2012-10-03T08:50:59-04:00,,"INTRODUCTIONR.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) has a yield approaching 10% at the time of this writing. We'll look at the following in an attempt to answer the question ""High-Yield Opportunity Or Value Trap?""RISKBelow are two major concerns creating headwinds for RRD from the 10-K filing.Although both are having an impact, we think item one has wrought havoc on the stock price while item 2 is manageable over time. The financial crisis has hit this industry hard. The following comparison of five-year cumulative total return among RRD, S&P 500 Index and peer group (source 10-K) correspond to the start and continued effects of the financial meltdown.Pressuring the stock is a lack of visibility when a sustained global economic recovery will take hold. Until then, RRD could experience strong headwinds and a possible dividend cut as discussed here.The effects of the digital concerns are magnified due to the economic uncertainty. Print is not going away, and the company's size and diversity will allow it to manage and adapt to digital changes over time.RRD's challenge going forward is managing the economic climate until a solid recovery is in place.MANAGING THE RISKThe CEO discussed RRD's strategy to mitigate these headwinds in the February conference call:While this sounds impressive, can we measure the results? Two metrics that indicate how RRD is managing the uncertainty are revenues per diluted share and operating income per diluted share. The per-share metrics take into account any dilutive effect of acquisitions.Revenues per Diluted Share:RRD was hit hard during the first few years of the financial crisis, but the revenue per share has recovered. A red flag would be the trends turning negative which is not the case as of this writing.Operating Income per Diluted Share (excludes restructuring and impairment charges):This graph gives perspective to the major headwind facing the company. It's no coincidence the downdraft in operating income corresponds to the global financial crisis. The strategy outlined by the CEO (above) seems to be taking hold. Operating income is starting to trend up. What is lacking is visibility, i.e., the direction and speed of a global economic recovery or lack thereof.Reported operating income for the first half was $1.83. The company noted in the 10-Q it expects higher net cash inflows from operations in the second half of 2012 due to normal operating cycles of the Company's business which should extend the positive trend through 2012.FINANCIALS & VALUATION:We'll examine trends based on management's financial track record to highlight longer-term trends. The annual data used in this article can be found here.EPS TRENDS: The following graph for EPS and cash trends are arrived at by calculating the statistics for a trend line using the ""least squares"" method. This determines the line that best fits the historical data and consensus estimates.The above represents the following trends:CASH TRENDS:The above represents the following trends:2009 was adjusted for large one-time gains in income taxes payable, accrued liabilities among other items that contribute to ""net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations.""VALUATION: The following fair value analysis is based on management's longer term financial performance as measured by the previous data. Fair values are based, in part, on the following: Discounted cash flow, a modified Graham's intrinsic value formula and a P/E analysis. The valuation model consists of two parts.Fair value used is the minimum value of the two parts.Part 1: Discounted cash flow and the modified Graham's intrinsic value.An estimated long-term EPS growth rate of 1.38% and long-term cash per share growth rate of 0% were calculated from the data described above. Analysts are projecting a five-year EPS growth rate of 1.8% as of this writing. (Source: Nasdaq.com)Running these projections through our pricing model, excluding the P/E analysis, produces a fair value of $12.7. Needless to say, the result is sensitive to changes in the growth rates as illustrated below.A longer-term negative cash growth rate would lead to the elimination of the dividend and a collapse of the stock price.Part 2: P/E AnalysisThe model looks at current and past periods to calculate a limiting P/E value. The company has a history of reporting negative EPS numbers with one exception since 2007. Analysts and guidance from management use non-GAAP metrics. Using this metric produces a maximum allowable P/E of 13 yielding a fair value of $17.7. The P/E is not the controlling factor in this case.Final fair value is the minimum of the two methods or $12.7.CONCLUSIONIs RRD an opportunity or value trap? Based on the low growth rates used in this article, it seems to be an oversold stock. That said, the economic risk is substantial. Although management is doing a respectable job of managing the current headwinds they may not be able to overcome another downturn in global economic conditions, i.e., free cash flow could take a hit which could be devastating for the dividend and stock price.Is the risk worth the high yield? The current free cash flow payout ratio is 38%, a reasonable ratio. The answer hinges on how stable free cash flow is going forward.Feel free to comment and share your opinion in the comment section.Disclosure: I am long RRD.

To get a better handle on the question we'll examine some important issues that impact the sustainability of the dividend. They are:Pension LiabilitiesRRD's pension was $1 billion underfunded at the end of 2011, approximately a 100% increase over 2010. On November 2, 2011, the Company announced a freeze on further benefit accruals under all of its U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2011. Beginning January 1, 2012, participants ceased earning additional benefits under the plans and no new participants will enter these plans, limiting future liabilities. The following projection shows the issue is manageable, but the unfunded liability will take years to wind down unless actual return rates are higher and/or the company increases their contributions. The pension does not include the 401(k) and retirement plans.The company modeled an expected rate of return in excess of 8% in the past. This is aggressive and higher than the discount rate, so we ran the analysis with a 6% return. These numbers are not meant to be exact based on the limited information available. The purpose of this exercise is to determine if a reasonable return rate will reduce the unfunded portion. The important observation is the trend.The risk is management cannot control Mr. Market. Lower returns or worse, negative returns could require much larger contributions, impacting dividend payouts. Based on the increase in unfunded liabilities in 2011 combined with the risks outside of management's control (reflected in the 2011 actual return) is an argument for reducing the dividend until there is better visibility confirming the trend.DebtA leverage ratio of 3.2 is based on an estimated 2012 EBITDA of $1.2B and $3.8B of debt. This ratio will fall to 2.8 by the end of the year which is in line with management estimates from the June conference call:FCF (Free cash flow) is projected at $500 million for 2012, most of which will be generated in the second half. FCF is defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, which is inclusive of approximately $205 million of cash contributions for the pension, 401(k) and postretirement plans.RRD is generating enough cash to service the near term debt (at least through 2014 as a minimum) and pay the dividend. There appears to be no short term risk to the dividend in regard to the debt.GrowthThis represents the largest concern. Some believe the print business is a dying business due to digital technologies. No doubt, the industry is going through major changes, especially when combined with the economic turmoil around the world. The data presented below show the year over year declines in both the U.S. Print and Related Services segment and International segment.U.S. Print and Related Services segment:Digital technology is having an effect on top line growth for ""Books and directories"" among others. What is unknown is quantifying the impact of digital vs. economic conditions.Management has been able to navigate both the digital revolution going on for many years now and the economic stagnation in the US as shown by an increase in operating margins in both total dollars and percentage growth.International segment:The international side, especially in Europe, has been more of a challenge.Margin declined in both categories as shown below.These numbers call into question the visibility past 2012. As economies heal, business should improve, but there is little visibility of significant improvements in the near future. A robust recovery could be years away.Conclusion:The longer term risks outweigh the benefits of keeping the dividend at current levels. Unfunded pension liabilities depend on factors such as Mr. Market being kind with returns, and RRD is at the mercy of the markets.Debt is high when considering top line growth, but could continue to shrink going forward. The prudent path would be to strengthen the balance sheet in the short term until longer term visibility is known. The high yield indicates the market is expecting a cut. RRD has not repurchased any shares this year, and given the above information, any share repurchase program will be on hold for the foreseeable future.When would any cut occur? Management may be waiting to see how the second half proceeds, and if the outlook does not improve, it could come by December. Then the question would be the magnitude of any dividend cut.Additional sources used in this article:2011 10-K2012 June 10-QDisclosure: I am long RRD.

Here are the details:Security: 8.250% Notes due 2019Note Type: Unsecured Principal Amount: $450,000,000Maturity: March 15, 2019 Coupon: 8.250%Redemption Provision: Callable at the greater of par or MW +50Change of control: If a change of control event occurs with respect to RR Donnelley and the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's and S&P the company will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest.The company plans to use the proceeds of this issue to (1) partially fund tender offers for up to $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of their debt securities, including up to $350 million of the 4.95% Notes due 2014 and up to $100 million of the 5.50% Notes due 2015 and (2) to pay premiums in connection with those tender offers. If there are any remaining proceeds, the company intends to use those proceeds to repay borrowings under their revolving credit facility.I wrote about the company earlier and here is my summary on the debt:Nothing has changed since then. I would still prefer the 16s, but if I had to be in the seven year segment of the curve, I would be looking at the 11.75%s - they last traded at $111 (on the 24th) - as the yield at those levels is 9.53% and the bonds have step-up language which could increase the coupon 150bps should the bonds hit ""B"" ratings. In order for the bonds to trade at 8.25% (which they will not do as a result of the premium), they would have to trade at a price of $118. I would put a yield of around 8.50% - 8.60% on the bonds (to compensate for the premium) which translates into a $116.2 - $116.7 price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Donnelley's (NYSE:RRD) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $17 per share, significantly higher than where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. The framework of the Valuentum Buying Index is backed up by extensive academic analysis revealing the significant benefits of a combined value-momentum portfolio versus other strategies (namely value, growth, and momentum alone). RR Donnelley does not make the cut for the combined portfolio. Our white paper showcases the benefits of the combined portfolio can be downloaded here.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. R.R. Donnelley posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment, neutral relative valuation versus peers, and very bullish techinicals. We prefer companies that score 9 or 10. R.R. Donnelley is near the top of its peer group that includes Cintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), and Xerox (NYSE:XRX).Our Report on R. R. DonnelleyOur report on R.R. Donnelley and hundreds of other companies can be found here. imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsR.R. Donnelley earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 20.8% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $12, we might take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter, but that would depend on our technical assessment at that time. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below:R.R. Donnelley has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 4% in coming years. Total debt-to- EBITDA was 2.9 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 77.8%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. R.R. Donnelley's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 20.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 8.5%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. R.R. Donnelley's free cash flow margin has averaged about 8.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At R.R. Donnelley, cash flow from operations decreased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 29% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think RR Donnelley is worth $17 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about -26.9 times last year's earnings andan implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 5.1 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of -0.9% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -2.9%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 7.7%, which is above R.R. Donnelley's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of -0.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For R.R. Donnelley, we use a 8.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $17 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for R.R. Donnelley. We think the firm is attractive below $12 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $22 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate R.R. Donnelley's fair value at this point in time to be about $17 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of R.R. Donnelley's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $19 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $17 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
1691252,28271,2013-09-12T15:07:35-04:00,,"In May of 2012, I outlined in SA a contrarian approach to stock selection that I dubbed the Fear And Loathing Stock strategy, as a somewhat extreme alternative approach to income related investing. To summarize, Fear And Loathing Stocks refer to distressed stocks that are out of favor with Mr. Market, and have been priced in the refuse bin accordingly. As a rough threshold, I looked at stocks that were down 40% or more from peak value, since this is a typical price drop threshold in contrarian stock picking. Stocks get in these situations in a variety of ways. Some were stocks in static or declining businesses, some were in bad places in the world (i.e. Europe), some had other special circumstances. What made this group of losers special, was they were continuing to pay above market dividends (in excess of 6.5%) and had metrics that to my mind supported the dividend. This made them interesting, even aside from their turnaround potential, from an income point of view.My logic, as discussed in the 2012 article, worked on the assumption that regardless of their beaten down state, if there was sufficient value and cash flow to cover the dividend, these might be safer income investments than they first appeared. With this in mind, I set ""safety"" guidelines of five underlying metrics that made these dividend paying Fear And Loathing Stocks worth consideration. These were:A stock was a viable investment candidate under these criteria, if it hit on 4 out of 5 of the metrics. Six dividend paying stocks - FTE (recently re-tickered ORAN), RR Donnelley (NYSE:RRD), Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), ST Micro (NYSE:STM), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) were identified as examples that met 4 of 5 of the criteria and represented a cross section of having disdained businesses and being European based. Four other high dividend distressed stocks: Frontier (NASDAQ:FTR), Safebulkers (NYSE:SB), Centurylink (CTL), Winstream (WIN) did not meet majority of criteria, were included for contrast as distressed income stock alternatives. At the time, I promised to report back at some point on how this investment hypothesis turned out.Even though the most important point of the article to me was the metrics and their rationale for investment, not surprisingly, the first thing most folks who remember the article want to talk about is ""how did the stocks perform"". The metrics from the original article are given in this table updated from original Fear and Loathing article. May 2012 refers to metrics as of 5/23/2012; Sept. 2013 metrics were taken on 9/10/2013.As 2013 has featured a generally strong market, from a pure ROI point of view, I was not surprised to see an overall positive return on the portfolio. Since the whole point was that the companies had some good fundamental financials, and were beat down pretty hard, this seems to validate one main point of the exercise, which is that by virtue of being already distressed, they had more upside than downside as investments.Of the 6 primary examples, 5 increased in price, the exception being FTE (now having symbol ORAN), down roughly 12% on a combination of factors, including a dividend cut. Interesting that ORAN, which I noted as having the best conformance to all my criteria, is the (sic) loser, but is also the sole survivor of the original portfolio.So how did other stock fall out of the portfolio? The big surprise to me is that half the cases (RRD, STM, NOK) saw increase in stock price > 50% from May 2012 values, quite a bit ahead of the general market return. (NOK price has benefited from its recent Microsoft deal, but qualified even prior to that). The most beaten down stocks were those that increased the most, which in hindsight, has a certain logic; but overall, I did not anticipate that level of improvement in market opinion in such a short timeframe. In comparison, the returns for the weaker metric ""also-ran"" stocks (FTR, SB, CTL, WIN) was much less, with only FTR (the most beaten down of the bunch) seeing a significant increase of about 20%.As surprising, while the stocks as total return investments did nicely, their performance as income investments was much more checkered. Since May 2012, only RRD and STM have maintained their original dividend. ORAN and PBI roughly halved their dividends, NOK and TEF cut theirs entirely. Of the also-ran stocks, FTR and WIN have maintained their dividends, while SB and CTL have reduced them. The one conclusion to draw from this dividend analysis is ""Location Matters"" - European companies (SB, ORAN, NOK, TEF) accounted for majority of the reduced or eliminated dividends. My takeaway is this is something to consider when chasing income yield overseas, where maintaining dividends is not as highly held an idea as in US markets.In keeping to the metric guidelines, between changes in stock price and dividends, most of the stocks have fallen out of the Fear and Loathing income portfolio; as mentioned, the only stock from the original list that continues to meet all Fear and Loathing for Income criteria is ORAN. This is in no small part due to a combined widely anticipated dividend decrease at end of 2012 and corresponding drop in stock value, that resulted in a more sustainable but still compelling ~10% dividend (we assume that ORAN will keep to its stated $1.04 payments in 2013). It is worth noting that CTL over the last year, has evolved into a similar solution; losing value after dividend cut to wind up with basically the same yield as before the cut (but with improved financials).It is worth noting that both CTL and FTR come increasingly close to hitting the criteria (primarily in CTL case, still falling short on the cash Criteria (5)) and are on watch to be part of a next generation Fear and Loathing stock portfolio. Also worth noting that WIN, which has been my general counter-example (consistently failing Criteria 3-5) continues to pay its impressive dividend, even as it stock price continues to drop almost in synch with dividend payments for a breakeven return.I want to reiterate that in the original article and this follow-up, my primarily focus is on the metrics used to filter investing in distressed stocks for income. Investing in distressed stocks has risks to be sure; following the stocks on the original list was a definite rollercoaster ride (not something I look for in investments) Discussion of the stocks above are used only as examples, and my observations and conclusions should be considered in that context rather than as investment advice. No advanced numerical analysis was attempted - the stock sample size and timeframe as discussed in the articles is recognized as too small and short for any significant trend or correlation analysis between stock dividend performance and the metrics at this point. However, I do find these metrics to be a very useful rule of thumb for evaluating distressed companies, and one that validates by Fear and Loathing as (one of several) stock investment criteria, if not a reliable dividend generator. I am formulated a new crop of Fear and Loathing stocks (a little more difficult in today's stronger market - any suggestions?), and plan to post these in a future article.Disclosure: I am long CTL, FTR, NOK, PBI, RRD, SB, STM.

886451,21414,2012-09-25T03:26:27-04:00,,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) is an international printing company, with the majority of sales derived from printing magazines, books, catalogs, directories, retail inserts, financial documents, forms and labels. The company has also attempted to diversify and currently offers logistics services and some digital media services, but the bulk of sales are still derived from print media. Since the last article I wrote on September 11, 2012, the company has had its unsecured debt downgraded by all three major credit ratings agencies. This article will focus on reviewing these downgrades and review the strategy of buying and/or holding RR Donnelley for its 9.4% yield (as of 9/24/2012 close).The Ratings Downgrades And The Unsecured DebtAll three ratings downgrades were a result of the company restructuring its revolving credit facility, from unsecured to secured, meaning the new facility now takes priority over the unsecured debt. Additionally, Fitch downgraded the Issuer Default Rating and Moody's downgraded the Speculative Grade Rating. The immediate impact of these ratings downgrades will be minimal as far as I can tell. From the 2nd quarter 2012 10-QThe debt affected by the prior downgrades totals only $172.2 million out of over $3.7 billion in total debt as of June 30, 2012. Even a full 1% increase in interest rates on this debt would only result in about a $0.01 per share decrease in annual earnings, based on 180 million shares outstanding. After combing through prior SEC filings, I see no mention of other debts being impacted by prior debt downgrades. Assuming these are the only debts affected by the current round of downgrades, there should be no material change in the business as a result of the ratings downgrades. However, after three rounds of ratings downgrades this year and the addition of a secured revolving credit facility, one can imagine future attempts at obtaining unsecured debt will be greatly hindered and at a much higher interest rate than obtainable in the past.Here is a table summarizing the last two rounds of downgrades by the ratings agencies:Source: Yahoo news headlinesAnother important part of these downgrades is the rationale presented in the text by the ratings agencies. The Moody's text is not readily available through traditional news outlets, but can be found on the Moody's site, where one can register for free. The S&P text and the Fitch text are readily available and both agree on several core items relating to the company's financial performance. Both agencies agree with the company's projection of around $300 million in free cash flow (FCF) for 2012, and both agencies expect single digit sales declines with flat EBITDA for 2012. These numbers do not differ from the last downgrades issued by the agencies. S&P goes one step further and expects flat to single digit sales declines in 2013, while also predicting a decline in EBITDA in 2013, reversing any margin gains made in 2012. These outlooks are in line with what has been expected out of this slowly declining business.Essentially, these downgrades do little to change the outlook of the business, nor the outlook for most of the existing debt. If anything, the holders of the notes due February 1, 2019 are going to get a higher interest rate. However, as all three ratings agencies note, this all hinges on a continued emphasis on debt reduction by management and only a single digit decline in revenues and EBITDA. If the decline should accelerate or the company has trouble reducing debt, ratings will drop further. The opposite may also be true. If RR Donnelley could somehow manage to grow its business amidst such strong adversity in the industry, ratings would improve and the company's outlook improves dramatically.The Case Against Buying For The DividendIn my last article on RR Donnelley, I forgot to include a discussion of the dividend, which was pointed out in the comments made by others. To me, there is no rational reason to hold the company's stock in order to receive dividends, as long as the company is still in decline. In order for one to truly reap a reward on dividends, one must also at least maintain the same level of capital. In other words, if the stock is dropping faster than the dividend payout, then one is still losing money on the investment. The following table outlines the net losses one would have incurred by investing in RR Donnelley on September 24th, or the last market day if the 24th was on a weekend, for each of the last ten years.Dividend source: Nasdaq. Historical stock prices from YahooAs one can clearly see, before paying taxes on the dividends, an investment on this date any time in the last ten years would have resulted in a loss. Throw in taxes, and the loss increases.With the ratings agencies expecting a decline in sales and earnings and there being no room in credit facilities for an increase in dividends, there is little to fuel the fire of a bullish stock. The average analysts' opinion from Yahoo roughly agrees with the rating agencies, projecting a slight decline in sales this year and flat next year. As I mentioned in my previous article, the latest reported fiscal year end 2012 featured a decline in assets, an increase in liabilities, and a 53% decrease in shareholder equity. None of these concepts would lead me to believe the stock is in for a big run in the near future. Indeed, the only case for an upward moving stock I have seen is the yield, which may eventually produce a general floor in the stock's price. However, if general business conditions continue to deteriorate to a point where the company can no longer cover debt payments, the first thing to go will most assuredly be the dividend.ConclusionThe recent downgrades do not change my opinion of the company and they seem to be a non-event for most stakeholders. With print media suffering year-over-year declines, there is little in the way of a growth prospect for RR Donnelley. The logistics services and digital media products of RR Donnelley remain a very small part of the business. Although some may be excited by the recent acquisition of Edgar, this company will contribute a scant $55 million a year, give or take, to 2013 sales, assuming its previous projected growth rate of 35% is obtainable. The digital acquisitions of RR Donnelley are not contributing enough to offset the sales declines of print media. The only justifiable reason to buy the stock is the yield, and after this justification, one must hope the stock does not continue to fall and erode any gains from the dividend payouts and one must also hope the company does not cut the dividend. Investing for the dividend's sake is a high risk venture, though if these holders are right they will reap high rewards.I remain bearish on the stock in the long run and will remain so unless there is a material change in the company's business. In roughly five weeks, we will get another update on the company's business when quarter three earnings are released. If sales were to show an increase in the 3rd and 4th quarter and no major restructuring or impairment charges were included in the 4th quarter release, I would change my long-term opinion of the company's stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

873971,24491,2012-09-18T13:31:37-04:00,,"In this article, we will evaluate the investment merits of R.R. Donnelley (NYSE:RRD), as well as its dividend under a new and innovative dividend methodology. For an in-depth assessment of the firm's intrinsic value via a DCF process, please click here.Although analyzing historical dividend trends is important, we think assessing what may happen to the dividend in the future is even more important. Unfortunately for the individual investor and time-strapped financial advisor, most dividend analysis that we've seen out there is backward-looking, meaning it rests on what the company has done in the past: how long it has raised its dividend, etc. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future.Investment ConsiderationsClick to enlarge images.Return on Invested CapitalR.R. Donnelley's DividendR.R. Donnelley's dividend yield is above average, offering a tempting 8.8% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio.However, we think the safety of R.R. Donnelley's dividend is very poor (please see our definitions at the end of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read: hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For R.R. Donnelley, this score is -0.8, revealing that on its current path the firm may not have the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends, though flexibility remains. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). The Dividend Cushion also caught the recent cuts by J.C. Penney (JCP), whose score was 0.9, and SuperValu (NYSE:SVU), whose score was -10. We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of R.R. Donnelley's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is not the case for R.R. Donnelley. We rate the firm's future potential dividend growth as very poor. There's just no excess capacity -- in fact, future dividend payments overwhelm future free cash flow after considering the company's net debt/cash position.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In R.R. Donnelley's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. All things considered, there's just not too much for us to get excited about with R.R.

382821,24389,2012-02-22T09:19:21-05:00,,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) is a prominent player in the traditional media and printing services. Established in 1864, the Chicago-headquartered company provides pre-media, logistics and business process outsourcing products worldwide. It recently announced a multi-year, multi-million contract with Office Depot to provide a range of production and related services. The contract is expected to benefit both companies. RRD was able to increase its earnings at a double-digit rate in the last 5 years. However, the stock was a disappointment, and is trading well-below its pre-crises valuation.As of the time of writing, R.R. Donnelley stock was trading at $13.23 with a 52-week range of $11.25 - $21.34. It has a market cap of $2.5 billion. Trailing twelve month [ttm] P/E ratio is 11.6, and forward P/E ratio is 7.4. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 1.4, 0.3 and 3.6, respectively. Operating margin is 4.4%, and net profit margin is 2.2%. The company has some serious debt issues. Debt/equity ratio is 1.9, but this is still lower than the industry average. R.R. Donnelley offers a nifty yield of 7.8%, fully supported by both its earnings and free cash flow.R.R. Donnelley has a 3-star rating from Morningstar. Out of 2 analysts covering the company, 1 has a buy, and 1 has an outperform rating. Wall Street has diverse opinions on R.R. Donnelley's future. Average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 10%. This is a reasonable estimate, given the double-digit growth rate in the past 5 years.What is the fair value of R.R. Donnelley given the forecast estimates? We can estimate R.R. Donnelley's fair value using discounted earnings plus equity model as follows.Discounted Earnings Plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal ValueV = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5]The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my growth estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence.ValuationHistorically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate. In order to smooth the results, I will also take the average of ttm EPS along with the mean EPS estimate for the next year.E0 = EPS = ($1.18 + $1.74) / 2 = $1.46Wall Street holds diversified opinions on the company's future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 10%. Book value per share is $9.61. The rest is as follows:(You can download FED+ Fair Value Estimator, here.)I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my 5-year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for R.R. Donnelley is between $21 and $31 per share. At a price of $13.23, R.R. Donnelley is undervalued by at least 60%. The stock has up to 133% upside potential.SummaryR.R. Donelley is one of the oldest companies in U.S. history. Within the last 2 centuries, it became a global provider of printing and traditional media solutions. Surely, the online media outlets are expanding their presence in the market at an exponential rate. However, expecting online multi-media technologies to eliminate the traditional printing solutions will be a mistake. As World's premier provider of print and related solutions, RRD is well positioned in the market. It serves over 60000 customers worldwide.The traditional printing sector is fiercely competitive with razor-thin margins. In such a competitive sector, RRD was able to distinguish itself by focusing on large corporations that outsource printing-related services. The company has been a very stable dividend payer, offering 26 cents per quarter since 2007. Nevertheless, the current yield of 7.86% is higher than the year end yield of 2008. Thus, RRD is priced at near the peak-crises valuations. Insiders must have realized that their stock is pretty cheap, since they initiated several purchases. In September, the director Johnson Thomas has acquired 149,000 shares worth more than $2 million. The current price of $13.23 offers a better deal than what the director paid for.RRD may not be the cheapest stock in the market, but at single-digit P/FCF and forward P/E valuation, it offers attractive entry points. Based on my FED+ analysis, R.R. Donnelley has at least 60% upside potential, which implies that it is a good company to buy at a good price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
381691,20568,2012-02-21T20:50:21-05:00,,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. (NYSE:RRD)  is scheduled to release its fiscal fourth quarter 2011 results before  the opening bell on Wednesday, February 22, 2012. In the run-up to the  earnings release none of the analysts tracking the stock made any  revision to the estimate over the last 30 days.A Sneak Peak into the Previous QuarterThe printing major’s third quarter earnings came in line with the Zacks  Consensus Estimate. The reported EPS was up 16.0% from the comparable  prior-year quarter. Though the reported revenue missed the Zacks  Consensus by a whisker, it increased 7.8% year over year.Operating metrics were down due to continued pricing pressures that  more than offset productivity improvements, lower variable compensation  expense and higher recovery on print-related by-products. (For further  details please read: R.R. Donnelley Reports In Line)Fiscal 2011 EstimatesR.R. Donnelley expects revenue for fiscal 2011 at $10.6 billion,  relatively in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management expects  fiscal 2011 free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $700  million.Non-GAAP operating margin is expected between 6.6% and 6.7% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate between 23.0% and 24.0%.Management expects total corporate expenses to be down 16% on a  year-over-year basis and to recognize a certain non-cash curtailment  gain of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus estimates R.R. Donnelley to generate revenue of $2.8 billion.Estimate Revision TrendNone of the 3 analysts covering the stock revised the estimate in the  last 30 days. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter  remained at 44 cents per share.The same phenomenon was witnessed in the estimation of fiscal 2011  earnings, where none of the four analysts covering the stock made any  change. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained at $1.82 per share.Analysts covering the stock are positive on the company because of  several multi-million dollar deals that it has secured in the recent  past.  However, the printing industry is facing challenges in the form  of continued pricing pressures and increasing threat of digital  technologies that enable much easier transfer, designing, resetting and  reproduction of data.Moreover, organic growth has been next to 0 to negative, as the company  has been concentrating on a large number of acquisitions such as  StratusGroup, Genesis Packaging & Design Inc, LibreDigital, Sequence  Personal, Helium, Inc., Journalism Online, LLC and 8touches. However,  we view the acquisitions positively because they have not only expanded  and enhanced Donnelley’s offerings to its current customers, but also  helped it to pick up new ones.RecommendationR.R. Donnelley’s positive earnings surprise for the past four quarters  averages at a modest 1.49% and for the current quarter we expect the  company to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by the same magnitude.We remain Neutral on the company over the long term (6-12 months)  despite its increasing volumes and new customer wins. We believe that  strong alliances and customer wins including those of AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and more recently Office Depot Inc. (NASDAQ:ODP) will create value for the company over the long term.However, we expect Donnelley to remain under pressure due to weak  macroeconomic conditions prevailing in most of its current as well as  prospective markets.Moreover, higher pension expenses, continuing pricing pressure,  volatility in raw material prices and a highly leveraged balance sheet  are significant headwinds going forward. Currently, Donnelley has a  Zacks #4 Rank, which implies a Sell rating in the short term (1-3  months).RRD: Free stock analysis reportODP: Free stock analysis  reportT: Free stock analysis  report"
344731,25032,2012-02-06T16:24:29-05:00,,"Commercial printing company R.R. Donnelley (NYSE:RRD) may be seen as the big fish in a shrinking pond. As the world goes more and more digital, the printing and paper products that have been the company's primary business are not as widely ordered and used. RR Donnelley appears to the uninformed investor as the exact opposite of a modern tech company. These reasons may be why the market has recently pushed the RRD share price down toward the 52-week low while pushing the dividend yield to over 9%. There are several compelling reasons why this stock may be undervalued, selling at a price of $11.50 per share at the time of writing.RR Donnelley provides printing services to a full range of business customers. Recent new contract signings include Chrysler, IMG, American Media, Inc. and Herbalife (NYSE:HLF). Printed products include catalogs, magazines, user manuals and financial reports. The company counts every one of the Fortune 100 companies and 88 percent of the Fortune 1000 companies as customers.To cope with a future where printed materials are replaced by digital files, R.R. Donnelley has a two-pronged strategy. As the dominant company in a sector filled with smaller, niche companies, R.R. Donnelley is very active in the acquisition of smaller businesses in the sector. In 2011, the company announced eight acquisitions. The most recent was the purchase of LibreDigital, a provider of e-book content. A major addition occurred in late 2010 when the acquisition of Browne & Co. was finalized. Browne was a major provider of corporate shareholder and marketing communications services. All corporations are required to generate a large amount of information for shareholders and the oversight agencies, making this a very lucrative addition to the business portfolio.The other focus for maintaining and growing revenue and profits is to transition to a wider range of digital services and products. Many of the acquisitions made by R.R. Donnelley are geared toward offering digital as well as print services for the existing product lines. Adding product lines and services allows Donnelley to be a one-stop shop, where everything is available for print and digital printing when compared with smaller competitors like VistaPrint (VPRT) and Multi-Color Corporation (NASDAQ:LABL), which have more limited offerings.The current dividend rate from Donnelley is 26 cents quarterly. The company has been paying at this rate since the second quarter of 2003, when the payout was increased by a penny. Investors should not expect a dividend increase any time in the near future. On the other hand, there is little reason to anticipate a dividend cut. Non-GAAP income per share was $1.79 in 2010, projected to be $1.80 for 2011 and the earnings estimate for 2012 is $1.74 per share. This is not the type of earnings path an investor wants to see for a growth stock, but the current and expected earnings amounts adequately cover the $1.04 per year dividend.For 2011, R.R. Donnelley will generate $650 million in free cash flow after capital expenditures. The annual dividend payments total about $200 million. A share repurchase authorization has reduced the number of outstanding shares by 10 percent over the last year. With the current share price at about half the value when the $1 billion buyback was authorized, the share count could decline even faster in 2012. This would increase the net income per share and improve the dividend coverage based on both net income and free cash flow.The Donnelley share price fell off the $20 cliff to the low teens in July of 2011, when the overall market had a pretty severe correction with the broader market averages dropping by about 15%. The indexes recovered most of the decline by the end of the year, but the share value of R.R. Donnelley stayed down. Then in January, several analysts hit R.R. Donnelley with target price reductions and the share price dropped to the recent 52-week low. So the Wall Street target prices drop from the high teens to the $16 to $17 range and the stock price drops to $11.50 - go figure.The bottom line is the R.R. Donnelley share value is not going to decline to the point where this stock yields 10 percent. With a couple of decent quarterly earnings reports the share value will be back into the mid-teens. If management has been spending that billion dollar share authorization on $11 to $12 shares, the stock could be close to $20 by the end of the year, based on the per share income gain due to a much lower share count.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
861251,21414,2012-09-11T18:24:15-04:00,,"The printing industry has taken a big hit over the past 20 years across the board. Newspapers are in the dumps, with many barely surviving. Encyclopedias, atlases, and other staples of American households have gone digital. With the advent of e-readers, now books, magazines, and catalogs are all poised to go down a similar path as reference materials. These factors, combined with its balance sheet and earnings statement, leaves shares of R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) and ideal candidate to short.The Income StatementThe first item to scrutinize for RRD is the company's income statements of the past few years. After five years of revenue growth, the rapidly contracting economy of late 2008 and 2009 produced a distinct slowdown in sales for the company. In 2010 and 2011, RRD had a small comeback in sales, but never reached the peak of 2008. So far in 2012, the company has produced sales declines of 2% and 4%. Clearly the company has had problems producing growth in the top line.Looking at the bottom line, there are three quarters that really stand out -- namely the fourth quarters of 2008, 2009, and 2011. Why has the company produced the largest sales amounts in these fourth quarters, yet has produced some outsized losses in three of the last four fourth quarters? The answer lies in restructuring and impairment charges, where the company is rapidly closing plants and shedding workers in order to keep pace with the rapid decline of print media. This leaves the trailing 12 months bottom line at a loss. Nothing on the earnings and revenue front points to a growing, solid company with a case for a higher price per share. The table below highlights the earnings of the last 14 quarters:Source: Nasdaq.The Balance SheetNext, let's look at the balance sheet. I will be using the year-end 2011 balance sheet, since the company tends to make large deductions in the fourth quarter of the year. The past two quarters have produced no more than a 3% change in any major balance sheet category.Perhaps there is some real value in the company outside of earnings and revenue, or perhaps not. Right off the bat, a red flag goes up when I look at RRD's balance sheet. Current assets and total assets are shrinking, while current and total liabilities are increasing. This leads to a 53% decline in equity from year-end 2010 to year-end 2011 and less than $4.50 a share in equity. Without a doubt, a 53% drop in equity for such a large company is a very alarming figure.Now let's look at the quality of the assets. The three big items of current assets for this company are cash, receivables, and inventory. All these check out as quality assets. Property, plant, and equipment of $1.85 billion is the major non-current, tangible asset. Based on previous depreciation expenses, this is set to decline around $400 million this year and render these assets nearly worthless in the next five or six years. If equity is only $1.06 billion, depreciation alone could eat away the remaining equity of the company in a matter of a few years.Next we have goodwill and other intangible assets. The company has a whopping $2.8 billion of ""assets"" in this category, nearly three times equity, and down $500 million from the year before. These intangible assets will have to be written off over time as an impairment charge. Between the declining value of goodwill and property, plant, and equipment, the company could be in negative equity by the end of 2013. We will find out more when RRD recalculates the value of goodwill again in the fourth quarter of this year.The debt picture is not any brighter than the assets and equity picture for the company. Through the end of 2015, RRD has over $1.2 billion in long-term debt maturities to pay off or otherwise refinance out of a total of $3.4 billion in long-term debt. With cash shrinking and under $450 million at the end of last year, RRD will have to find a creative way to raise money through selling stock, selling pieces of the company, or find an institution willing to loan it more money.The good news, and perhaps the saving grace so far, has been a strong cash flow from operations, but this has not in any way contributed to strong cash on the balance sheet. The company may tout $500 million in share buybacks, but the company also borrowed $600 million in long-term debt. This does not enrich shareholders. At the end of the day, the company has less cash on hand than it did a year ago. It's the case of strong earnings, or strong cash flow, or strong earnings and strong cash flow. If companies don't have both, then there is no gain in equity for shareholders.In all, the balance sheet of RRD looks horrendous and is getting steadily worse over time. Assets and equity are declining, while debt is still on the rise.The Story of the Company, or Future ExpectationsUnfortunately for fans of printed media like myself, e-readers and the digital age are quickly destroying the industry. Newspapers are practically obsolete, especially for the younger generations. Magazines are struggling and its much easier to browse a catalog or phone directory online than lug around a thick, heavy volume. None of these items bode well for RRD. The company has made some inroads through acquisitions in the digital media industry, but the bread and butter of the company remains printing.Already with a big hit in sales for 2009 and once again declining sales in 2012, the company is reeling, trying to stay afloat. Cost cutting through the elimination of employees and plants is rapidly eating away at what's left of the business. The company eliminated its pension at the start of this year and has been eliminating its highest paid, most skilled employees. These actions parallel the decline of many other industries in the past as companies try to survive.Conclusion and Brief Technical AnalysisWith the prospect of negative equity by year-end 2013, if not by year-end 2012, there is no value left in RRD. With sales already declining and the world moving away from print media, there is little expectation, from my perspective, for raw earnings power to pull the company out of its downward spiral and deteriorating balance sheet. When looking for a short, this is one company to keep on your list.Technical analysis of a nine-month chart shows the stock failing to reach levels earlier in the year during the mid-May through early August rally, even while the broader market has made multiyear highs. Last week's five-day rally on light volume brought the stock to just under the 50-day moving average, right below and in the area of some overhead supply created in early August. If the stock fails to break above the 50-day moving average or begins to decline from the $12 area, the company is not only a candidate for shorting over the long term, but is a candidate to be shorted rather more immediately.Overall, the stock faces many hurdles in the future, and without a big positive catalyst could soon be heading to penny stock status. This decline may start sooner rather than later, with the poor chart created in last few months.(Note: All company financial figures, except in the earnings and sales table, were obtained from RRD's 2011 annual report filed on SEC form 10-K.)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

575331,28751,2012-05-09T17:26:09-04:00,,"It's not often you get a stock paying a dividend yield greater than its average bond yield. It usually means the company is in distress or there is significant turmoil in the financial markets. Although there is still great economic uncertainty around the world today, the market we're in now is not 2008 all over again. And although the company in question, RR Donnelley (NYSE:RRD), certainly has its challenges, I don't think the word distressed would be applied under any circumstances.The company currently has outstanding bonds with coupons ranging from 7.25% to 8.6% for maturities between 2016 to 2020. Most of the bonds are trading reasonably close to par so the effective yields range from 7.0% to 8.5%. R.R. Donnelley's dividend yield based on a $11.43 stock price would be 9.1%.Let's look at the dividend first and then the business. R.R. Donnelley offers a $1.04 annual dividend (paid quarterly) and has paid a cash dividend since 1985. The company has provided 2012 EPS guidance in the range of $1.84-$1.92 excluding extraordinary items.However, these earnings include non-cash amortization for intangible items such as trademarks and customer relationships. Adding back the company's estimated annual intangible amortization of $90 million for 2012 and tax-affecting it to be conservative would provide a cash EPS range of $2.18-$2.26.Anyway you look at it, R.D Donnelley's dividend payout ratio is somewhere around 50%, very acceptable for a mature, low growth, high free cash flow company. R.R. Donnelley can certainly miss guidance like any company, but a material miss to bring its payout ratio above 100% is highly unlikely. Double checking the free cash flow availability to continue paying the dividend, the company expects free cash flow after capital expenditures of at least $500 million in 2012. The amount of cash dividends payable is approximately $190 million annually which leaves an enormous cash cushion in case things turn south, or the company is completely off the mark in its business forecasting.This is an interesting and perhaps rare anomaly that exists now between its dividend yield and bond yields. Looking at the business itself might provide an answer. R.R. Donnelley is the largest commercial printer in N. America, or as it describes itself now - a global provider of integrated communications. The company prints books, retail inserts, magazines, catalogues, manuals, billing statements, healthcare documents and IPO prospectuses just to name a few. The company also operates a logistics business and various digital businesses.Its revenues in 2011 were $10.6 billion with its next 3 competitors, Quad/Graphics (NYSE:QUAD), Transcontinental [TSX:TCL.A] and Cenveo (NYSE:CVO) at only $4.3 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in revenues, respectively. The U.S. print market excluding newspapers is about $110 billion in size, so the industry is still highly fragmented. The global print market excluding newspapers is approximately $275 billion. The digitization of the world and the rapid growth in desktop or mobile based reading provides the company with many challenges, however they have tried to offset these trends with various digital initiatives (and many technology related acquisitions). These newer products and services include digital book distribution for e-readers and SaaS type businesses for integrated direct and digital marketing.This evolving technology business dynamic around the world has obviously hurt the company's business and growth rates, however through market share gains, acquisitions and newer digital initiatives, the company should grow its top line at least at GDP rates. With judicious expense management, interest expense declines as debt is paid down, and the use of share buybacks, R.R. Donnelley should be able to grow its EPS at a rate well exceeding its revenue growth. That means it's dividend appears safe in the near-to-mid term. The company is trading at 6.0 X 2012 EPS and 4.4 X 2012 EBITDA, and with a valuation so low, it doesn't make sense to own the bonds compared to the stock.I have no idea if this company is a short target for those who partake in that sort of thing. But when fixed income holders switch from the bonds to the stock to get a higher yield while enjoying the very likely chance of a highly valued, embedded call option on the equity, it will probably be a short target no more.Disclosure: I am long RRD.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

Donnelley & Sons Company is in the print business and provides capability for printing a wide variety of media including books, catalogs, magazines, inserts, financial information, etc.With the advent of the Internet and eBook readers like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Kindle and Barnes & Noble's (NYSE:BKS) and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, print books and magazines are on the way out and R.R. Donnelley's target market is shrinking and will continue to shrink.The company has nobly attempted to reposition itself with its CustomPoint platform where customers can self-order printed product. In its most recent Q3 2011 conference call, the company indicated the CustomPoint platform experienced a 12.7% increase in order activity with more than 566,000 order executed during the quarter. The CustomPoint platform is a nice try, but it's kind of like selling self-portrait kits to passengers on the Titanic. And, CustomPoint appears to fall short, as I did not see support for an Application Programming Interface (API) which would allow R.R Donnelley's customers to automatically enter orders from their own servers instead of having to manually access R.R. Donnelley's platform for every order, order revision, etc.The company has also made some strides to transition to the digital age via acquisitions. The company recently acquired Sequence Personal, which offers the capability to aggregate content for digital printing, LibreDigital which provides digital content distribution such as e-reading software and Genesis Packaging & Design which provides point-of purchase signage and other displays used for a variety of applications.Of these new acquisitions, the only one that doesn't look like an accessory for a horse & buggy is LibreDigital. The Sequence Personal and Genesis Packaging & Design acquisitions will certainly help with the company's print business, but only delay the company's demise. But, LibreDigital looks like a brand new Porche, ready to take the company on a race around the track. LibreDigital was one of the first companies to deliver digital files to Amazon and created the first iPhone book application. If R.R. Donnelley lets LibreDigital run the race, R.R. Donnelley might successfully transition itself to the digital information age. But if R.R. Donnelley attempts to convert LibreDigital to a pack mule for catalogs, then all bets are off.To its credit, R.R. Donnelly serves its customer well as it was recently named Staple's (NASDAQ:SPLS) Supply Chain Vendor of the Year and also recognized as an IKEA Tulip Award winner for best print supplier.R.R. Donnelly apparently recognizes its dire situation, as the company recently closed and froze is defined benefit pension program, lest the company eventually end up in bankruptcy as in the case of Kodak.R.R. Donnelly's stock price has really taken a hit over the last eight months by falling from about $20 plus change in May to around the current $12 price as shown below:A contributor to the company's drop in stock price depreciation is basically related to a shutdown in the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market, as the R.R. Donnelly prints the financial information associated with company public offerings. I hope R.R. Donnelly is not expecting this cash cow to recover and be around forever, as I would venture to guess that eventually all IPO financial information will be distributed electronically.With the drop in R.R. Donnelley's stock price, the dividend yield for the company has skyrocketed to around 8.5%. The company's next dividend payment of $0.26 is March 1, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 27, 2012, which makes the ex-dividend date as January 25, 2012.An investor considering on investing in R.R. Donnelley for the dividend may have second thoughts based upon the company's long-term prospects. However, an investor might consider entering a collar position for the company which enables participation in the dividend and also provides protection against a significant drop in the company's stock price. A collar position may be entered by selling a call option against an existing or purchase stock and using some of the proceeds for purchasing a protective put option.Using PowerOptions tools, a collar position was found for R.R. Donnelley with a potential return of 3.1% and a maximum potential loss of 8.4%. The time frame for realizing the potential return is 145 days. The potential return of 3.1% and the maximum potential loss of 8.4% take advantage of the upcoming dividend payment and an assumed second dividend payment prior to June options expiration.The specific call option to sell is the 2012 Jun 13 at $0.55 and the put option to purchase is the 2012 Jun 11 at $0.85. A profit/loss graph for one contract of the position is shown below:As a bonus, if the price of the stock is greater than or equal to the $13 strike price of the call option at expiration in June 2012, the position will return 8.2%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 24.6% during the past three years.R.R. Donnelley's valuation is compelling at this time. The firm is trading at a nice discount to our estimate of its fair value, even after considering an appropriate margin of safety. The firm's forward earnings multiple and PEG ratio also look attractive versus peers.R.R. Donnelley has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 3.2% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.8 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 61.3%.The firm's shares have underperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter. Although R.R. Donnelley's valuation appears attractive, the company is currently exhibiting characteristics of a potential value trap, and we'd still be cautious at these levels. There may be a better entry point yet.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 7%. We expect the firm to pay out about 56% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. However, let's take a deeper dive into the firm's dividend.Dividend ConsiderationsR.R. Donnelley's dividend yield is impressive at about 7%, so we view the name as a nice potential income generator. However, we think the safety of its dividend is very poor, the lowest rating on our scale. We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year.We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter or year. As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.Therefore, we've developed the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion (read more about this innovative dividend tool here). The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For R.R. Donnelley, this score is -1.1, indicating that the company doesn’t have a cushion for future dividend growth.Now on to growth. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years and the company has a nice growth rate, its future potential dividend growth is excellent, which unfortunately is not the case for R.R. Donnelley. We think R.R. Donnelley's potential dividend growth is very poor.However, we don't just stop there. By employing a matrix, one can see above that R.R. Donnelley has an unhealthy dividend--the cross section of its very poor safety and very poor future potential growth scores. And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In R.R. Donnelley's case, we think the shares are undervalued, so the risk of capital loss is low. This is the only thing income investors have going for them in a position in R.R. Donnelley.All things considered, we're more interested in R.R. Donnelley's equity valuation than its dividend at this time. Its shares are cheap, but the dividend looks weak.Read our full report on R.R. Donnelley here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Donnelley (NYSE:RRD) has spurted higher this week, and one investor apparently thinks that the stock will hold its ground.optionMONSTER's tracking systems detected the sale of 32,500 September 20 puts for $1.15 against open interest of just 40 contracts. The transaction indicates a willingness to own shares in the printing company at the strike price and reflects a belief that they'll remain above $19 or rally higher. Investors often sell puts on companies they like but don't want to expend capital to buy shares. RRD fell 1.07 percent to $20.25 in late morning trading but is up more than 20 percent in the last six months. It reported worse-than-expected earnings on May 4 but also announced a $1 share buyback.The shares remained around $19 until Monday, when they made a sudden push through $20. It isn't clear what caused the move, but it came after RRD found support at its 50-day moving average and then its 30-day moving average. While traditional printing has been in decline for years, the company has been expanding into services such as layout and document distribution while growing overseas. International revenues grew 11 percent last quarter, almost twice as fast as the U.S. market. Overall option volume in the name is more than 70 times greater than average so far today."

Donnelley's (NYSE:RRD) case we think the firm is worth about $25 per share, almost double where it is currently trading. Our full reports on R. R. Donnelley and hundreds of other companies are available on our website.We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. We think our methodology and broad coverage universe is largely responsible for the meaningful outperformance of the portfolio in our Best Ideas Newsletter.Our Report on R. R. DonnelleyClick to enlarge images  Investment Considerations  For every company in our coverage universe, we rate them on 13 unique measures. To get started, we show R. R. Donnelley's below:Investment HighlightsR.R. Donnelley earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 24.6% during the past three years.R.R. Donnelley's valuation is compelling at this time. The firm is trading at a nice discount to our estimate of its fair value, even after considering an appropriate margin of safety. The firm's forward earnings multiple and PEG ratio also look attractive versus peers.R.R. Donnelley has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 4% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.8 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 61.3%.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield over 7%. We expect the firm to pay out about 60% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.Click to enlarge imagesEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. R.R. Donnelley's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 24.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 8.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisValuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that R.R. Donnelley's shares are worth between $16.00 - $34.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $25 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 23.6 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 6.6 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 1.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -4.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 7.6%, which is below R.R. Donnelley's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, our valuation model assumes free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For R.R. Donnelley, our model uses a 8.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $25 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for R.R. Donnelley. We think the firm is attractive below $16 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $34 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate R.R. Donnelley's fair value at this point in time to be about $25 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of R.R. Donnelley's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence.This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $30 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $25 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsClick to enlargeDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
267446,20568,2011-05-03T19:03:03-04:00,,"A leading commercial printing company, R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD) is scheduled to report its first quarter 2011 results on May 4, before the market opens.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2011 is pegged at 36 cents per share, which reflects a year-over-year growth of 9.1%.R.R. Donnelley posted an average earnings surprise of 14.05% in the trailing four quarters, implying that it has outdone the Zacks Consensus Estimate by the same magnitude over the last four quarters.Fourth Quarter HighlightsR.R. Donnelley reported fourth quarter 2010 earnings, on a non-GAAP basis, of 51 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus of 46 cents per share. Earnings increased 10.9% year-over-year from 46 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Revenues spiked 4.8% year over year to $2.71 billion and was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66 billion. Fourth quarter revenue growth was impacted by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate and lower paper sales, which was fully offset by contribution from the newly-acquired Bowne. (For further details please see Donnelley Fourth Quarter Beats.)GuidanceFor fiscal 2011, R.R. Donnelley expects continued year-over-year revenue growth in the low single-digit range. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $10.6 billion, slightly down from the reported revenue of $10.7 billion in 2010.For fiscal 2011, R.R. Donnelley expects non GAAP operating margins in the range of 7.6% to 7.8%, up 30 to 50 basis points (bps) year over year, despite an increase of approximately $23.0 million in non-cash pension expense.Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $575.0 million. Interest expense is estimated to be roughly $240.0 million.For fiscal 2011, capital expenditures are expected in the $250 million to $275 million range. Management expects free cash flow of around $600.0 million. The non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 33%.Management did not provide any earnings guidance for the first quarter as well as for fiscal 2011. However, management believes that first quarter earnings will be negatively impacted by the absence of revenue from the extensive U.S. Census project, which was recognized in the first quarter of 2010.Moreover, higher non-cash inventory step up charge of approximately $3.5 million and incremental purchase accounting related amortization expense will have a negative impact on first quarter earnings.R.R. Donnelley also expects higher restructuring charges for the first quarter of 2011.Estimate Revision TrendOf the four analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, only one analyst made a downward revision, while none made any upward revisions in the last 30 days. Overall, estimates for the first quarter were down two cents in the last 30 days from 38 cents per share to 36 cents per share.RecommendationDonnelley is witnessing stabilization in demand, increase in volumes and new customer wins. However, foreign exchange movement and lower paper sales are expected to be headwinds for the stock going forward.We believe strong alliances and customer wins including AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Wireless (NYSE:VZ) will create value for the company over the long term. We also remain positive about the Journalism Online LLC acquisition. However, pricing pressure and a highly leveraged balance sheet could limit near-term stock appreciation in our opinion.We maintain our Neutral rating on the shares over the long term and a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy rating."

322037,22989,2012-01-25T13:59:09-05:00,,"RR Donnelley's (NYSE:RRD) current woes came as a reaction to their press release on January 16th which stated:Oops, looks like the company is coming in a little lighter than expected on the top line and margin. The result:(Yahoo Finance)Not a good day for long suffering Donnelley shareholders. But this is the type of knock down that piques my curiosity as to potential opportunities within the capital structure. (NOTE: All data taken from company financials and presentations and compiled by me unless otherwise noted).Company Description:R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company provides premedia, printing, logistics and business process outsourcing products and services to leading clients in virtually every private and public sector. Donnelley conducts operations through two reportable segments, U.S. Print and Related Services (74% of 9Mo 2011 Sales) and the International segment (26% of 9Mo 2011 Sales).Summary:R.R. Donnelley is the largest player in a declining industry. The company is attempting to transition the business into the digital age while expanding their traditional business to meet the needs of their customer base (and prospective customers). I view Donnelley as a levered company with pressure on every one of their business lines - pressure which will only increase going forward. With that said, the company currently generates a decent amount of cash flow (north of $600MM TTM) and free cash flow (north of $400MM TTM) which it has used for capital expenditures, acquiring businesses and doing share repurchases. The company has also been opportunistic about issuing debt (in June of 2011 they issued $600MM in notes and used the proceeds to buy back some of their outstanding debt). Ultimately, if the company were viewed in isolation, it would resemble a mature company. Unfortunately, the industry is in a secular state of decline, which is different than being a mature industry.From an equity perspective the yield may be tempting (8.5%), but I do not see a catalyst that will drive the share price higher. If it is yield you are looking for, the debt of the company might be a better option. If you want exposure to the sector, Consolidated Graphics (NYSE:CGX) might be a better option although it does not pay a dividend.From a debt perspective, I view the company as being too shareholder friendly which will serve to further impact their ratings and their financial health. The company is currently at the upper end of their leverage targets (above them if the pension obligation is considered) and debt reduction does not seem to be a priority. While cash flow is decent, it appears to be allocated to equity and, as a result, does little to enhance the debt perspective. For yield/income investors who are primarily interested in the ultimate repayment of debt, I would look at their shorter duration debt (maybe the 16s) as the company will continue to be healthy (relative to many high yield companies) in the near to intermediate term. For total return investors, the yield - IMHO - will not offset the continued decline and therefore price erosion, so upside is limited at best. I would avoid the intermediate to long maturities as the risk/return is not there at current levels.Industry Background:The printing industry is a fragmented and mature industry undergoing a transformational change ad the digital age has been thrust upon it. The company stated industry challenges very well in their last 10Q, which I will summarize here:In other words, the company is operating in an industry undergoing significant change and is currently price based - which means very little ability to raise prices. Taking out costs can only achieve so much.This can also be shown by Fed data on industrial production and capacity utilization within the Printing and Related Support Activities:The above chart shows that production has been in decline for some time and there is still too much capacity in the industry. While continued pressures will no doubt knock out many of the smaller players and force continued consolidation, this trend will be difficult (if impossible) to reverse.The chart below was compiled from UCC data provided by Equipment Data Associates (EDA), shows up-to-date UCC activity for all printing equipment. Although UCC filings are a combination of new equipment sales, used equipment sales and re-financings of existing placements, they are still a strong indicator of market activity. This information is extracted directly from EDA's comprehensive database of nearly 30,000 records for purchasers of printing equipment. (found here: Printing Supplies)Equipment sales also point to a declining industry as new equipment is not being purchased at the same rate - this is evidenced by Donnelly's depreciation and amortization exceeding their capital spending.Company Financials and Other Considerations:With a better understanding of the industry in which RRD operates, it is now possible to look at the company in the proper context.The following is a financial snapshot of RRD:Source: company financials and ADVFN.A couple of observations on the company's financial profile:Now lets look at R.R. Donnelley's capital structure.Capital Structure:The following is a snapshot of the company's current capital structure (adjusted for a Jan 2012 maturity):As of 9/30/11 with the exception of removing the January 2012 maturity.Equity:Equity consists of 187MM shares outstanding with a book value of equity of $1.8B and a market value of $2.3B. The following are key statistics and peer comparisons:As the above chart illustrates, RRD is by far the biggest player in the space. While this is true, Consolidated Graphics has the premium valuation (by these measures). The company trades at a trailing P/E of 10.7x while CGX trades at a trailing P/E of 15.4x (QUAD and CVO have no ""E""). Based on Thomson Reuters, RRD trades at a forward (12/31/12) P/E of 7.0x while CGX trades at a forward (3/31/13) P/E of 11.1x (QUAD and CVO have forward P/Es of 5.9x and 5.1x respectively).Here is a relative performance chart for the group (from Yahoo! finance):In the last year, shareholders of RRD have lost a little north of 30%. I have to ask: why will this change? What is the catalyst? As I stated in my summary, I see none.Debt (Ba1/BB+/BB+):The following is a table of the company's debt (tradeable debt, credit facility not included):Source: FINRA TraceLooking at RRD's debt, the yield is more akin to ""B"" rated debt (Barclay's HY Index lists ""B"" rated debt as having a yield to worst of 9.12% while ""BB"" debt yields 6.84%). As RRD is rated high BB, this gives some cushion against downgrades (which I would somewhat expect). RRD's debt (for the most part) contains change of control covenants and has a limitation on secured debt (principal properties of US restricted subsidiaries) with a 15% carve-out. The 11.25% notes due 2019 have step-up language, currently have a coupon of 11.75% and the potential to step another 150bps should the notes get downgraded to ""B"".As I am not fond of the sector, I would stay shorter if I were going to buy the company's bonds. As I stated in the summary, I do not see significant upside in the name, although they should outperform similarly rated bonds due to their higher yield. If the company comes out with decent earnings (after guiding lower) and a compelling story (somewhat more difficult) you could see the bonds add a couple points to get closer to their pre-revision levels. Of the listed bonds, I believe that the 16's are the most compelling as they are cheap on the company's credit curve and have the highest Z spread (zero vol).Conclusion:In conclusion, an investment in the company is an investment in an industry in decline. While the company is the largest player in the space, I do not see a catalyst to drive prices higher. If choosing my spot within the capital structure, I would be buying into shorter maturity debt.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Donnelley & Sons (NYSE:RRD), a leader in the commercial printing industry is scheduled to report  fourth quarter 2010 results on February 22, before the market opens.Third Quarter HighlightsDonnelley reported third quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings of 44 cents per  share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. Earnings  decreased 19.0% year over year from 54 cents.Revenues increased 1.0% year over year to $2.48 billion, but fell short  of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.53 billion. Third quarter revenue  growth was dampened by an unfavorable foreign exchange and lower paper  sales. This was offset by better volumes in the U.S. Print and Related  Services segment. However, the company continued to win new customer  contracts in the quarter.Guidance and EstimatesDuring the third quarter earnings release, management said that it  expects strong revenue growth in fourth quarter 2010 and fiscal 2011.  Revenue is expected to grow 0.5% to 1.0% year over year for 2010.  Revenues are expected to be affected by foreign exchange rates and lower  paper sales.For 2010, non-GAAP operating margin is expected in the range of 7.3% to  7.5%. Depreciation and amortization is projected at approximately $535  million versus the previous expectation of $540 million. Interest  expense will likely be around $225 million. The effective tax rate  (non-GAAP) is expected the 30% to 32% range. The forecast for capital  expenditure is approximately $225.0 million, implying free cash flow of  $600 million.Management did not provide any earnings guidance. The Zacks Consensus  Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at 47 cents per share for the  fourth quarter and $1.71 for full-year 2010.The current Consensus  estimate for fourth quarter 2010 is a penny above the year-ago quarter,  when Donnelley reported earnings of 46 cents.There has been no upward or downward revision in estimatesover the last  30 days for the fourth quarter or full-year 2010 as well as for 2011.  We do not see any surprises this quarter, with earnings expected to be  in line with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate.But Donnelly’s quarterly results have not always been devoid of  surprises.Donnelley has reported positive surprises in all of the last  four quarters with an average of 13.1%. This means that it beat the  Zacks Consensus Estimate by that percent.RecommendationDonnelley is witnessing stabilization in demand, increase in volumes  and new customer wins; however, foreign exchange movement and lower  paper sales are expected to create significant headwinds to fiscal 2010  revenues.The company’s cost-containment efforts, operating leverage, aggressive  acquisition policy, debt repayment initiative, impressive cash flow and  stable dividend payout will leverage growth. Moreover,a cyclical  recovery in advertising, growth in logistics and digital business,  broadening customer base and new product launches are long-term drivers  of growth.We believe strong alliances and customer wins such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Wireless (NYSE:VZ) will create value for the company over the long term. We also remain  positive on the Bowne acquisition; but pricing pressure and a highly  leveraged balance sheet could limit near-term stock appreciation.We maintain our Neutral rating on the stock over the long term.  Moreover, the lack of estimate revisions, in either direction, in the  company’s Zacks Consensus implies an almost flat performance for the  current year. The stock is currently a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Neutral  rating)."
254219,23986,2011-02-22T14:02:25-05:00,,"R.R. Donnelly & Sons (NYSE:RRD) is the largest commercial printer in the world, with operations both inside the United States (75% of sales) and international. Its primary lines of business are magazines, catalogues, and retail inserts, as well as books and directories, but the company also performs all manners of large-scale printing, and also performs ancillary services in allowing clients to communicate with their customers. As recently announced, its clients include LL Bean catalogues and Bauer Publishing, which produces Women's World and Life & Style Weekly magazines, although it has a fairly diverse stable of clients that apparently number more than 60,000. With the ongoing slump in the global economy, R.R. Donnelly has been forced to reorganize its operations and cope with large impairment charges and a shrinking of sales. However, despite these nonrecurring expenses and noncash writeoffs, the firm has not only retained profitability, but is also throwing off an impressive free cash flow yield of 12.9%. Furthermore, sales seem to have stabilized alongside the economy. The company also offers a dividend yield of over 5.5%, which is very generous, especially nowadays.This morning, R.R. Donnelly released an earnings report indicating sales were up 4.8% from the same quarter last year, although margins declined slightly as compared to last year, partly due to a large acquisition, a larger than normal pension contribution, and expenses relating to a large acquisition. Reported earnings of $0.51/share before special items for the quarter beat the consensus estimate of $0.46, and the full-year free cash flow figures are only marginally lower than 2009's, as shown below. The market has not responded favorably to this news, although the situation in Libya is dominating market perceptions today.R.R. Donnelly's reports claim that the commercial printing industry is highly fragmented and suffering from overcapacity problems that can be addressed somewhat through consolidation. Indeed, the firm is doing its own part to accelerate the consolidation process by making acquisitions of its own, including three in 2010 alone. These strategic acquisitions of smaller firms have assisted Donnelly in maintaining its current level of sales. It has also allowed it to ratchet down its level of capital expenditures in response to continued economic weakness, as well as the decline in print directories and the rise of e-books, although Donnelly claims in its financial reports that e-books have not cut into book printing volumes as yet.Turning to R.R. Donnelly's financials, sales declined from roughly $11.5 billion in 2008 and 2007 to $9.8 billion in 2009, and sales in 2010 were only marginally higher at $10 billion. Free cash flows have also declined, but show signs of stabilizing in the area of $525 million for 2009 and $501 million for 2010, which represents a remarkably low price/free cash flow ratio of 7.6 based on current prices (for more, see 7 Shipping and Business Service Stocks Yielding Over 5%).As mentioned above, R.R. Donnelly faces a terminal decline in publishing directories, and perhaps as e-books increase in popularity, book printing volumes may begin to suffer. However, the company is adapting to the situation by reducing capital expenditures and diversifying its lines of business through restructurings and targeted acquisitions. As a result, R.R. Donnelly gives every indication that it is in a position to spin off a great deal of cash from its various lines of business even as some of them decline. Furthermore, the company has produced significant sales growth in logistical services and financial printing in 2010 as compared to 2009, as well as significant sales expansion in Asia. Also, despite the decline in sales, the company's interest requirements are covered by operating cash flow more than four times, so the risk of financial distress derailing its cash flow generation is not a great one. In fact, according to the finra.org bond screen, R.R. Donnelly's bonds generally trade at a premium to par. Also, the low multiples that seem to prevail for printing companies, if they continue, will benefit R.R. Donnelly in its future acquisitions.As R.R. Donnelly has for the moment stabilized its operations and seems to be in a strong financial position to address its long-term issues and generate comparably high cash flows for the foreseeable future, I believe it is attractively priced and definitely deserves to be a candidate for portfolio inclusion.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in RRD over the next 72 hours."

Donnelley is the largest printing company in the U.S., providing various global printing services to a wide variety of businesses worldwide, as well as related services such as logistics and distribution for print customers and mailers.During the third quarter earnings release, management said that it expects sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter in the low single digits. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 125 – 175 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2009 due to the absence of some of the third-quarter benefits. Free cash flow was expected to exceed $1 billion in 2009. However, the company did not provide an earnings forecast.Zacks Estimate Revisions WatchThe earnings outlook for the full-year 2009 appears far less robust than in the recent past. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year is $1.58 per share, with no upward or downward revisions in the last 30 days. However, this is a huge decline from the year-ago period, when Donnelley reported earnings of $2.92 a share. We believe the challenging economic environment in 2009 impacted end-market demand and forced the company to lower prices, thereby hurting profits.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is 43 cents, which has seen no revisions in the last three months. However, it is a decline of 31.7% reported in the same quarter last year. We do not see any surprises this quarter, with earnings expected to be in-line with the current Zacks Consensus.But RRD’s quarterly results were not always devoid of surprises. The company’s third-quarter earnings of 54 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents by 11 cents. This was despite a huge decline from the year-ago period.Donnelley has posted positive surprise in 3 of the 4 preceding quarters. The average surprise for the last four quarters (including the third quarter of 2009) is 9.6%. However, we expect earnings surprises to be non-existent for the current year and next.Longer-Term OutlookWe expect revenue growth to pick up, as the effects of the recession are expected to wear off by fiscal 2011. Meanwhile, cost-containment efforts will improve margins and leverage growth in earnings.The company’s aggressive acquisition policy, debt repayment initiative and an attractive regular dividend payout (5% yield) are other positives. In our opinion, RRD has sound fundamentals and a number of competitive advantages which have enabled it to generate impressive cash flow. Thus we remain positive on RRD’s long-term value for investors.However, the lack of estimate revisions, in either direction, in the company’s Zacks Consensus implies an almost flat performance for the current year. Additionally, the highly leveraged balance sheet and integration related risk are of concern, as reflected in its Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Neutral rating)."

Over the last week, the Dow Jones index has fallen into negative territory for the year, but still is down less than 2% from its starting point. Whether the market will the market will rally back to a 52-week high like it did in April or frantically sell off like we saw in May and June remains to be seen.The roller-coaster market does present investors with some unique investment opportunities. The heightened levels of fear in the marketplace often cause stocks to fall dramatically even when there doesn’t seem to be any bad news related to the company. Of course, that is not always the case and often the markets move in anticipation of bad news rather than in reaction to it.Savvy investors know when a stock has sold off too much and the risk-reward tradeoff is once again in their favor. Dividend investors can often scoop up accidental high yielding dividend stocks that have gone “on sale” due to market jitters.One high yielding dividend stock that seems to be on sale right now is R.R. Donnelley (NYSE:RRD). RRD stock price has dropped 15% in the past two weeks even though there hasn’t been any bad news out about the company. In fact, prior to this slide RRD had reported strong second quarter earnings that were 30% higher than Wall Street was expecting.R.R. Donnelley offers an impressive dividend yield of 6.7%. Although the printing firm has not raised their dividend in the past few years, they do have strong history of maintaining their dividend payments. That certainly counts for something when you consider that companies ranging from JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) to BP (NYSE:BP) have cut or suspended their dividends in the past two years.R.R. Donnelley is also a well-established company that has been around for 145 years. The firm is committed to growing their business both organically and via acquisitions. This has led to a sizeable $3.4 billion in debt, but RRD has generates over $1.2 billion in free cash flow each year. These strong cash flows enable RRD to service their debt load as well as pay out $216 million in dividends each year.With RRD now trading at a 52-week low and at only 8x consensus 2011 earnings estimates, that high yield is looking very attractive.Disclosure: No positions"

Donnelley & Sons Company (NYSE:RRD) provides various print services to a wide variety of businesses worldwide, as well as, logistics and distribution services for print customers and mailers. It has a market capitalization of 4.32 billion and is, by far, the biggest player in the space. The company is carrying 3.62 billion in debt and, while many businesses like RRD are debt intensive, there are a number of conditions on the balance sheet that give reason for concern. The “return on equity ratio” is a measure of the effective use of shareholder money and the current ROE is -20.2%. The profit generated from each dollar of asset value is the “return on asset ratio” and it is -6%. These are decidedly low rates of return and, generally,  provide a picture of the efficiency of management.On the revenue side, 3rd quarter earnings vs. the year ago quarter were -92%; profit margins are -6.23%; year over year revenues are -14%; and net income year to date vs. year to date is -89.5%. These figures speak for themselves and draw us to the question of how the company will deal with its high debt load.The company’s “quick ratio”, a measure of short-term liquidity and the ability to meet its near cash obligations, is low at 1.05%. The “interest coverage ratio” is alarming low at -2.5%. A reading below 1.00% generally indicates that a company is not generating enough revenue to cover interest expense. The current dividend is $0.26, a yield of 5.00%, and that could be in jeopardy. On the technical side the chart has recently started to show signs of deterioration. In the beginning of October we entered a period of channel consolidation. The top end of the channel is $22.00 and it was tested many times in October and failed. It was tested, again, with the strong action in the first week of November, failed again, and appears to be setting up to test the low end of the range around $19.80. The weekly MacD is rolling over and the daily RSI and MacD indicators are showing bearish divergences. The 13, 21 and 50 day moving averages are in confluence which often precedes a violent move in price. Money flow has been falling off since the start of this consolidation period.  The stock looks like a short candidate on a fundamental and technical basis and affords good entry and tight stop levels. The most recent close was $21.04, a break below the 50 dma at $20.38, would be a point to enter half of a short position with the stop above the 11/09 high at $21.25, risking $0.87. The second half of the position would be put on when the bottom of the channel was broken at around $19.70 with the stop now lowered to the 50 dma at $20.38. The risk on the second half of the trade is approximately $0.68 with the stop on the first half of the trade now at breakeven. The problem with clearly defined patterns, like the channel with RRD, is that they are susceptible to false moves and head fakes. The “irrationality” of this market has been contagious with close correlation and the “rising tide” effect on diverse boats. The rule is always, trade consolidation patterns cautiously, trending patterns aggressively and preserve your capital. Disclosure: Short RRD"

Rather, it is meant to provide you more information for your consideration from those currently directly in the industry itself.I recently had the opportunity to interview John Hass, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Rosetta Stone (RST). Rosetta Stone is an education technology company founded in 1992 and has been a public company since April 2009.Hass, who served for decades in various leadership roles in the global banking world, has served as CEO of Rosetta Stone since 2015 and Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2016.While Rosetta Stone had a difficult time in the public markets during its first few years, in the middle of the Great Recession, since 2017 it has made a big resurgence and currently has a market capitalization of approximately $566 million. From January 1, 2019 to August 2, 2019, Rosetta Stone's stock was up 31.46% as compared to the S&P 500's 16.96% gain. From January 1, 2017 to August 2, 2019 Rosetta Stone's stock was up 142% as compared to the S&P 500's 30.96% gain. Clearly something was happening at the company worth noting and examining.The company made $173 million in revenue in 2018, a decrease from $184 million in 2017. This was largely due to a decrease in product revenue while increase in subscription and service revenue as the company changed its business model to be subscription-based. The company's net loss also increased from $1.5 million to $21.4 million, better than its worst periods but also distant from its best.The education technology sector has seen massive shifts in recent years both in terms of money as well as in its products and infrastructure. Major recent developments have included custom learning, cloud computing utilization, virtual reality usage, speech-to-text, and more. It is estimated to continue to see significant growth in the upcoming few years as new products are created and new users brought into the sector.(Figure: John Hass, Source: Rosetta Stone)ER: What would you describe as Rosetta Stone's line of business and the sector it operates in? JH: Rosetta Stone is in two lines of business -- language learning and K-12 literacy. We operate in the education technology sector.ER: When many people think of Rosetta Stone they think of its language learning products. However Rosetta Stone has expanded far beyond that into other education technology services. What is the strategy behind and vision for this?JH: While we have expanded beyond language learning we have stayed true to our focus on helping people communicate with each other. This led us to focus on an area of great need and where we can have a positive impact - helping children in our schools learn to read through our Lexia Literacy business.For decades approximately two-thirds of children in the U.S. have been reading below grade level (source: National Assessment of Educational Progress). This can have a devastating impact on their ability to succeed in school and in life after they leave school (e.g. The Literacy Project Foundation found that three out of five people in U.S. prisons can’t read; 85% of all juveniles who interface with the court system are functionally low literate according to the Nat'l Center for Education Statistics). Complicating this is the fact that at least 85% of school curriculum is delivered via reading (source: Annual Growth for all students, Catch-Up Growth for Those Who are Behind, Lynn Fielding, Nancy Kerr, & Paul Rosier).With Lexia we have a business that has been entirely focused on helping teachers and our schools solve this problem for over three decades. When I joined Rosetta Stone one of the first things that stood out to me was the efficacy of Lexia's solutions as demonstrated by results in schools and third-party reviewed research. Consequently, we made the decision to invest significantly in Lexia in two primary areas. First, we have built a complete suite of literacy products that can serve children whether they are a new learner, regardless of ability, or an older struggling reader. Secondly, Lexia used to sell and service its products primarily through third parties. Over the last three years we have built a direct sales, implementation and training team to develop those trusted relationships with our school partners ourselves.ER: Rosetta Stone recently moved from a perpetual product business model to a subscription sales model. Could you explain what prompted this transition, its impact, and how Rosetta Stone hopes to benefit from this?JH: The move to a subscription model is the direct result of moving away from a boxed CD-based format to web and app-based software. Our learners want to experience our products when and where it is convenient for them, whether at home, at the office or on the road. When we made the move to mobile-based products, the transition to subscription followed naturally. With subscription pricing that varies with the initial term, we are able to respond to the needs of our learners, whether they have a short-term desire to refresh their language skills or are embarking on a longer journey to learn a second language.The other primary benefit of the subscription sales model is that as we continually improve our products, we can push those benefits out to learners and provide product updates on-the-go, which we could never do when it was a box of CDs.The impact of the transition has been positive. It has allowed us to build a relationship with our learners and better understand their habits and needs. For us it has created a deferred revenue balance and a source of future bookings through renewals that provide more stability than we had previously in this business.ER: The development of the Internet services sector has significantly disrupted the software space in many ways. Rosetta Stone has been around since the beginning of the Internet age - how has the company adapted, and hopes to continue to adapt, to changes in web and mobile?JH: We’ve adapted according to what our customers want and need. Providing a seamless learning experience across desktop and mobile devices became the clear path forward when we saw that most of our learners were using a mobile device for at least part of their learning. Over the past three years, mobile usage has exploded -- it's gone from being less than 10% to 85% of usage for our consumer language learners today.Consumers today want the convenience of learning when and where it is best for them. Offering learning experiences through a mobile device provides the opportunity to enrich and innovate the educational experience. This can be as simple as providing you with reminders that help you reach your learning goals, or as complex as using the object recognition technology in your phone to identify objects around you, translate them into the language you are learning, and carry out a conversation about that object -- a learning program that we introduced late last year called Seek & Speak.The combination of our investment in mobile technology, combined with the depth and quality of our educational content and pedagogy is recognized by our customers who give us a 4.9-star rating in the app store. Additionally, in a recent survey of Rosetta Stone customers, nearly 75% tried learning a language from a different program before they chose Rosetta Stone, and 91% of our users would recommend Rosetta Stone to others for learning a new language.ER: In the 2018 fiscal year Rosetta Stone's revenue was roughly evenly distributed across its Literacy, E&E Language, and Consumer Language segments. Which products and segments does Rosetta Stone believe have the most potential for the company's future growth?JH: We see opportunity in all of our segments but clearly the one that has been growing the fastest has been our K-12 Literacy segment. The underlying needs of our schools, the ongoing transition in K-12 education and our ability to provide solutions with unmatched research-based efficacy positions us well to have strong growth in this part of our business.ER: In 2018 Rosetta Stone reported a net loss of about $21.5 million and guides for a $15 million net loss in 2019. This is a major improvement from some of Rosetta Stone's worst years, such as 2014, but also a far cry from its profitability levels in, say, 2010 and 2009. How does the company hope to reverse course and restore profitability?JH: Returning to net income profitability is important. In the meantime, we expect to have positive adjusted EBITDA this year and for this to improve meaningfully over the next few years. As a subscription-based learning company with very high gross margins, the key to improving profitability is growth. With growth we will profitably leverage the investments we have made to build our Literacy segment and to transform our language products and go-to-market strategies.ER: What in your opinion are some of the most transformative developments in the education technology space as a whole right now worth watching?JH: Two things.First, differentiation based on the quality of outcomes. Schools, for example, are increasingly demanding to see a return on the investment they are making in education technology products. This means that solutions increasingly need to demonstrate that they are producing positive outcomes for students backed by real research. Schools aren’t awed by technology anymore. They are becoming discerning customers.Second, returning human beings to a more central role as instructors in the learning process. While Rosetta Stone provides technology-based learning solutions, we recognize the importance of human intelligence in the learning process. Social and emotional connection between a student and his or her teacher is critical to effective learning outcomes. The industry is seeing this in the growth of virtual tutoring companies around the world. For us, this can mean empowering teachers in the classroom to help their students learn to read or providing live virtual language tutors to demanding corporate customers, and maybe someday, consumers.(Source: Rosetta Stone)Explore other segments of Tech Investment Insights' Executive Interview series below:"
4056128,23806,2017-03-17T12:00:46-04:00,"Revenue at Lexia Learning, Rosetta's Literacy segment continued to make great strides while the company confidently predicted 20-25% annual growth. We estimate renewal rates are running at ~95%.Total operating expenses decreased $13.0 million or 22% year over year to $45.5 million, representing the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year expense reductions.Net loss improved 51% and EPS improved 52% year over year to $5.6 million or $(0.25) per diluted share.Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, improved $1.9 million year over year to $3.5 million.Cash and cash equivalents increased $4.0 million sequentially to $36.2 million at December 31, 2016, with zero debt outstanding.","Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) has entered into a series of agreements with SOURCENEXT Corporation (""SOURCENEXT""), the leading software distributor in Japan. John Hass, CEO, said:As part of the agreement, Rosetta Stone will provide SOURCENEXT a perpetual, exclusive license of certain brands and trademarks, including the primary Rosetta Stone brand, and product code for exclusive use in the consumer and enterprise language and education space in Japan. Rosetta Stone is receiving $13.5 million before certain adjustments, and is guaranteed a minimum of an additional $6 million over the next 10 years. RST expects to receive the $13 mill in the ""relatively near term,"" with $9 million expected to come in the first quarter.The company has articulated licensing as a core focus of its turnaround efforts, and we believe further deals will be forthcoming in due time. Think about it, the company exited Japan two years ago where it was making no margin, given the marketing costs there, and now just extracted $13.5 million (and ultimately another $6 million), with no capital outlay. In fact, the company well understands that the market for world languages is not a growth market; the market for digital English worldwide is a 13% CAGR market, and management has studied and is effectively implementing a profitable business model to take advantage of this long-term secular trend. And, to be clear, we continue to believe free services like Duolingo are glorified dictionaries (serving the casual European traveler very well), but are not substitutes for real language acquisition skills.RST also announced that it has entered into a marketing product development agreement with Univision. Under this agreement, the companies will develop and sell a co-branded consumer language product targeted to the Hispanic community. More details about this partnership will be announced in the coming weeks. Univision reaches 106 million users every month through 17 broadcast and cable networks and partnerships in addition to 123 local TV and radio stations and a growing portfolio of mobile and video properties.RST projected cash generation in 2017, with an estimated year-end cash balance of $44 million versus today's $36 million. The company projected 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $8 to $10 million, double 2016's $4.4 million. Our confidence in RST's multiple assets overseen by John Hass and a competent Board - Lexia Learning, E&E Language platform, and brand strength related to its consumer business underscored by the newly announced Japanese deal - was bolstered by the company’s performance in 2016. In addition, management's strategy for changing the consumer product to more of a short-term subscription model with renewals is showing early signs of success.Bottom line in our opinion is that this recent quarter shows that management is doing an exceptional job in executing its strategy. Management indicated a normalized EBITDA margin for 2017 of around 10% in its Q&A, and if the company's projections of subscription model revenues materialize as expected. The 2017 guidance for revenue, EBITDA and cash generation are all quite encouraging.We continue to believe that the company is ultimately being positioned for sale in whole or in parts. In particular, our industry contacts suggest potential buyers for Lexia Learning are growing as are the multiples in that space for companies able to grow at 20%-plus with 95% renewal rates (like Lexia). RST made a savvy strategic decision to not sell two years ago, believing that a cleaned-up, focused company with a reduced cost structure, a new enterprise-class E&E Language product, combined with licensing opportunities on the consumer side given the strength of the company’s brand, was a far better means to optimize shareholder value. This strategic decision, which RAM fully supported at the time, is proving to have been the right one given the company's ability to execute."
4008968,23806,2016-09-28T12:05:12-04:00,"CEO: ""There is no company of our size that should believe that it will perpetually be a public company.""Value anchored in Lexia resulting in a “stub value” for language business (both consumer and E&E) of ~$50 million; this is only 10% of Duolingo’s valuation despite RST’s product receiving a superior rating from MacWorld.MacWorld’s review was a recent one for RST’s newly updated app that now allows users to simply develop “vacation skills” (ala Duolingo) if not deep language learning.RST is a different machine than it was a year ago with >30% CAGR for Lexia, great reviews for new E&E language and consumer products and reduced expenses.Price target raised from $11.50 to $13 due solely to Lexia’s continued strong growth and renewal rates (>90%).","Company Description: Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) provides technology-based language learning solutions. RST continues to execute on its plan to focus on three core business lines: enterprise and education (E&E) language, literacy (Lexia Learning) and serious consumer language learners. Led by Chairman and CEO John Hass and a strong board, the company is, in our view, showing clear signs of a successful turnaround. We believe that the company will continue to materially improve its operations and will attract financial and strategic buyers interested in purchasing the company in whole or in parts. The company recently reported its sixth consecutive quarter of year-over- year operating expense reductions.Investment Thesis: Summing the company’s net cash balance and the value of fast-growing Lexia Learning (year-end annual bookings run-rate of $40 million, coupled with 90% plus renewal rates and a 30% plus annual growth rate), implies little value for the company’s consumer and E&E language businesses. The company’s new iOS app recently won a Macworld bake-off of competing language apps. Macworld’s Seamus Bellamy found that Rosetta Stone’s app topped Duolingo and Babbel, noting it has a “feature set the other two can’t match.” Additionally, RST’s new E&E Language Program “Catalyst” was reviewed by PCMagazine and received an Editor Rating of Excellent. The editor called Catalyst “a new and smarter tool for enterprise language learning.”  Current Market Valuation: Shares 22 million @ $8.00/share = $176 million Net Cash: $35 million (Year-end estimate) Enterprise Value: $141 million Revenue: $190 million (Consumer – 45%; E&E Language – 35%; Lexia – 20%)  We assign a $100 million valuation to Lexia (2.5x year-end bookings run-rate) leaving the company’s combined language businesses (consumer and E&E) valued at $41 million. Applying a modest 1x multiple to language revenue of about $150 million sums to a total RST valuation of roughly $285 million, or $13/share. Note, consumer competitor Duolingo recently raised capital at pre-money valuation of $470 million. It is believed that Duolingo has less revenue than Rosetta Stone.Key Considerations:"
3974896,23806,2016-05-14T11:55:16-04:00,"Post-earnings stock rise reversed last week after The Motley Fool newsletter recommended selling RST – this selling pressure was compounded by the small float.Yet the thesis remains unchanged; value of cash/Lexia is $155M compared to market cap of $165M, implying only $10M valuation for the language business with $150M of revenue.Recent pivot by competitor Duolingo away from free offerings (due to inability to turn a profit) reinforces the value of RST’s Consumer language business/strategy.RST beta-testing new enterprise-class platform to be rolled out for 3Q/4Q selling seasons; industry contacts speak highly of it and the number of corporate customers signing up far exceeded expectations.New permanent CEO John Hass received a very shareholder friendly comp package that highly incentivizes a monetization event in the short/medium term; target price of at least $11 within 18 months.","Rosetta Stone’s (NYSE:RST) recent quarter further underscored our belief that the company is keenly positioning itself for a sale. We believe a sale is a high-probability event and as a result, we have changed our filing status to a G from D filer, i.e. from an active to passive shareholder. We believe the investment thesis possesses little downside, and while upside is far more difficult to handicap, a free option effectively exists at RST’s current price. In aggregate, we believe within 18 months (on the outside), it is likely that RST is ultimately monetized for at least $11/share, representing a near 50% return, while something closer to $14 remains reasonable.RST’s post-earnings stock rise was reversed last week when David Gardner, and The Motley Fool newsletter he leads, recommended that his readers sell their RST shares. Evidently, Fool subscribers owned a relatively meaningful amount of shares in this small-float company sufficient to ignite a near 10% sell-off. To be clear, The Motley Fool targets fast-growing companies and RST, in aggregate, is not fast-growing. However, as a standalone company, RST’s Lexia Learning would likely garner significant investment recognition from The Motley Fool and would likely be valued by them in a way that would effectively leave RST’s language business as a freebie to investors.Lexia’s chief characteristics are worth repeating. It’s a true SaaS platform (recurring revenue), it’s expected to grow at 30% plus over the next five years (while still growing 20% plus in its current year of transitioning from a 3rd party to direct sales force), and its renewal rates are 90% plus. Lexia has the good fortune of leveraging its 30-year history assisting and perfecting tools that enable children to acquire reading skills during a time of rapid demand for such tools.Lexia’s efficacy has been well-documented by school districts and educators. There is no shortage of white papers underscoring Lexia’s effectiveness as a reading aide. We have little doubt that the capital (strategic and financial) looking for investments in this space will accrue to the benefit of RST shareholders. Thus, the way to look at RST, investment wise, is to first value the things easiest to value (cash and Lexia Learning), subtract those values from its current market capitalization (roughly $155 million), and to then view the implied value for its other assets (consumer and E & E language businesses).Cash: $35 million (Year-end Estimate)Lexia Learning Valuation: Industry checks have increased our confidence in Lexia’s valuation and it is clear that this was a homerun acquisition for the company. We value this division at 2x to 4x year-end 2016 bookings run-rate of roughly $40 million: $80 million to $160 million (mid-point of $120 million at year-end). The current Credit Suisse SaaS software index is at 3.6x EV/Revenue overall with companies growing at 20% plus being valued at 4.7x EV/Revenue. Below is a summary of recent transactions in the space.Sum: $35 million + $120 million = $155 millionCurrent Market Capitalization at $7.50 @ 22 million shares = $165 millionImplied Value for RST Language (consumer and E & E) = $10 millionIs RST’s language business worth more than $10 million? We believe the answer is yes for the following reasons:Consumer language. Current revenue run rate of $70 million. Duolingo (the service that undermined RST’s consumer business and aggressively gained market share with free offerings), raised $45 million in capital in June 2015 at a pre-money valuation of $470 million. Our understanding is that Duolingo, having been unable to turn a profit with its paid translation service, is now going to pursue a model providing paid language certification. In other words, Duolingo’s investors need to find a way to make money (like all invested capital) and giving away modest language acquisition skills is evidently not working.RST has no intention to cede the certification market to Duolingo. RST’s recent announcement that it has been approved to provide language certification to California’s high school students looking to meet the state’s university language requirement underscores this point. RST’s consumer mission is clear – pursue serious language learners willing to pay a modest amount of money while pursuing bottom-line profitability, not top line revenue.If Duolingo’s investors (including Google Capital, Union Square Ventures and Kleiner Perkins) see a potential return on investment at a $470 million valuation given the opportunity in digital language, it seems highly probable that RST’s language business (with name recognition of 7 out of 10 Americans) is worth something materially higher than $10 million.E & E language. Current revenue run rate of roughly $80 million. There is little doubt that RST’s E & E language business has been an overall disappointment with flat to slightly down recent growth trends despite a significantly growing digital English market. RST tried to take its consumer platform to the enterprise and education marketplaces but those marketplaces (corporate and K-12) wanted reporting software features (ongoing assessment and monitoring tools) beyond straight digital language software.RST is now beta-testing its new enterprise-class platform (built on the enterprise platform acquired from LiveMocha) with the expectation that this platform offering will be rolled out in time for the 3rd and 4th quarter selling seasons. Our industry contacts speak highly of the platform and the company indicates feedback has been “very positive.” We understand the number of corporate customers signing up for the beta test far exceeded the company’s expectations.Nonetheless, this is clearly a yet-to-be realized growth vehicle for the company. It is hard to imagine that with the digital global English market growing at an expected 13% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next several years that RST does not participate in this strong secular trend. RST has particular strength in its K-12 business given its history and existing footprint serving over 20,000 schools in North America.In fact, while 20% should not be assumed as go-forward growth rate, K-12 revenue grew at 21% YOY from $2.4 million to $2.9 million in the most recent quarter. RST’s Tell Me More acquisition has given the company the differentiated ability to serve high-end language learners. In fact, of the four acquisitions RST has made in the past four years, only Fit Brains was a poor one in retrospect.Global Digital English Language Learning Market 2014–2019 (Source: TechNavio Analysis) Language Valuation: .5x to 1x Revenue - $80 million to $160 million (midpoint of $120 million).Sum:Odds & EndsRoughly one year ago, Roumell Asset Management (and others) filed 13Ds to encourage RST to shift its focus to its E & E (Language and Lexia) business and reduce its emphasis on its consumer business with the full knowledge that this would result in disruption and a reduction in the cash generated from the consumer business. With broad shareholder support, RST’s board named John Hass as its interim-CEO and identified the following objectives: cost reduction, a strong emphasis on its E & E business while running its consumer business for the serious language learner.Since that time, the company has delivered on those promises. To wit, RST recently announced it is on track to realize $65 million annualized cost savings. Moreover, the company recently identified an additional $19 million in cost reductions from exiting countries outside of Northern Europe and North America. The company is being simplified, increasingly moving toward a complete SaaS model, resulting in what is expected to be a durable and long-term profitable business.The company has guided toward cash-flow break-even to positive in 2017 and 10% FCF generation by 2018. The company could choose, if it wanted to, to not invest in Lexia and could generate free cash flow today (which we believe would be the wrong decision). Potential buyers only need to see the writing on the wall. We believe the company has been correct in de-risking and streamlining its business prior to sale rather than having entertained previous indications of interest to sell the company, which we believe would still have been done at a share price greater than today’s.John Hass named permanent CEO. As indicated in the company’s most recent proxy statement, RST’s compensation committee (led by 7% holder David Nierenberg), approved one of the most shareholder friendly CEO compensation packages we’ve ever come across rewarding Mr. Hass for shareholder return. Moreover, as an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Hass has deep M&A experience. As such, we believe the board sent a clear signal to the market that RST is being primed for sale not as a long-term going concern that would have more likely resulted in a more experienced digital education CEO.That said, we have been extremely impressed in how quickly Mr. Hass has mastered the key elements of RST’s operations while clearly articulating a larger company vision. Thus, while Gardner indicated Hass’s selection “…had the feeling of throwing in the towel,” we wholeheartedly disagree. Rather, it has the feeling of executing a plan to reward shareholders in the short to medium term with a monetization event. Mr. Hass’s shareholder friendly compensation package is worth highlighting. The following statement is an excerpt from the company’s proxy statement:Why RST’s shares don’t reflect intrinsic value? Over 50% of the company’s shares are held by dedicated deep-value investors leaving a modest amount of float resulting in a micro-cap volatility. To be clear, turnarounds take time and patience. RST is well worth the wait given the downside protection (at its current price), and significant upside optionality."

The company's financials show the problem is severe.RST's key competitor, Duolingo, just released an app update with a feature called ""Bots"".Unfortunately for RST, the worrying disruption trend looks to continue.","A Worrying TrendRosetta Stone (NYSE:RST)'s financial results over the past few years demonstrate the severity of the company's disruption problem.The company's language learning, or core business, revenues peaked in 2012, and have been declining since, at an increasing rate.Language learning revenues decreased -5% y/y in 2014, -23% y/y in 2015, and so far in 2016, are down more than -20% again. Moreover, each of RST's first two quarters in 2016 has been worse than the SPLY.Disruptor DuolingoDuolingo, backed with funding from Google Capital and other VC firms, has been trying to disrupt RST and the language-learning industry since 2011.Duolingo's latest update, featuring ""Bots,"" allows users to converse with an AI to develop listening and speaking skill. Rosetta Stone investors should be wary of this development, as it continues the degradation of RST's competitive moat, but more importantly, financial results.Duolingo vs RSTDuolingo and Rosetta Stone both provide language-learning services; however, there are several important distinctions between the companies.Duolingo's demonstrated competitive advantages outlined above have led customers to flock to the service. The company dominates RST in terms of subscribers: 110 million people use Duolingo worldwide, compared to a number around 9 million for RST.Customer disparity should be expected given the different pricing mechanisms and target markets.

3958610,56112,2016-03-16T13:31:18-04:00,"Rosetta Stone's balance sheet, brand, and interesting literacy asset give it time to figure things out.... but the Consumer business looks unlikely to stop imploding, and given shared costs, this has implications for the margin profile of the enterprise/education part of the language business.I can come up with reasonable scenarios where the stock is worth $9-$15 within a few years, but these require strong execution from management (and some luck).If you're bullish here, keep a close eye on Lexia's bookings growth (which is decelerating in 2016) as well as the rate of decline in the Consumer business.","Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is a brand everyone knows but a company relatively few investors follow. While the bearish, popular perception of the sustainability of the company's consumer brand is largely correct (in my view), there's more to the story than that - the company's Q4 investor presentation is 30 slides - excluding the appendix. There are a lot of moving parts here. If you believe in management, the risk-reward does look skewed to the upside, particularly if the company's Lexia product continues to gain traction (and this alone is enough to make the company a very bad short idea). If Lexia's revenue growth decelerates, though, I would be very careful in the revenue and margin profile you assign to the language side of the business - while it's easy to come up with values significantly higher than the current trading price, this is not a situation without risk.Lexia: Strong Results And Outlook, But Deceleration ConcerningWhile the company reports in two segments - ""E&E"" (Enterprise and Education) and ""Consumer"" (what you think of when you hear ""Rosetta Stone"") - I prefer to look at the business in terms of ""Literacy"" (i.e. Lexia) and ""Language"" (everything else) because those are really the two core products the company offers, although go-to-market is obviously different for the various categories of the latter. The general bull thesis can be summed up to this: even if Consumer continues to head to zero, the current market price equates to Lexia plus cash on the balance sheet, so whatever you get out of Consumer and E&E ex-Lexia is gravy.I agree with this directionally, but not in magnitude (as we'll get to shortly). First, credit where credit is due: Rosetta's acquisition of Lexia a few years ago was a brilliant deal (that may actually have saved the company). It's rare that I see M&A by dying companies creating actual value - I've previously discussed how Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) doesn't appear to be transforming fast enough, and all of Outerwall's (NASDAQ:OUTR) diversification attempts over the past few years have floundered. But Lexia has been nothing short of a home run. Acquired for $22.5 million with a $7-$8 million revenue run rate, Lexia will post over $30 million in revenue this coming year and likely $40 million the next, making it worth several multiples of what it was acquired for at any reasonable multiple. While purchase accounting overstates the magnitude of the results, bookings were up 46% y/y in the fourth quarter and up 32% y/y for the full year.Directionally speaking, the outlook appears strong: teachers and parents like Lexia, the product's effectiveness has been validated, and there's a big runway for growth. Literacy is surprisingly low, particularly in inner-city schools as well as those in heavily Hispanic areas. Anecdotally, although it was a long time ago, I was once part of an educational program at an all-Hispanic school, and when the kids asked questions, many of them asked in Spanish and the teachers had to translate it into English (and then my answers back into Spanish). Products like Lexia are clearly needed, and penetration is still fairly low relative to what it could be.While I'm pretty confident in continued long-term growth here, what is slightly concerning is the unexplained deceleration in momentum. Not even six months ago at the Roumell Asset Management Investor Day (RAM is a big shareholder), Rosetta Stone CEO John Hass stated ""... I think there is a sustainable 35% growth rate in that business over the longer term"" and attested that the 2015 performance was strong - ""we beat our own expectations internally."" The company is targeting $100 million in bookings within 4-5 years.But then there's this (slide 27):The company's bookings guidance for 2016 implies a substantial deceleration - $41 divided by $33.9 is ~1.21. Admittedly they're coming off a strong comp, but 21% growth is well below the strong momentum they were showing last year, and the ""sustainable 35% growth"" that Hass referenced at the Investor Day.It may sound churlish to complain about 21% revenue growth, and it would still be a strong result to be sure - but the effect on valuation here is a double-whammy. If Lexia grows at 20% rather than 30%, you're applying a smaller revenue multiple to a smaller revenue run rate, and this is something investors should watch closely.Language: Don't Look Down...The company has done a very good job of shedding empty-calorie revenue, shrinking its footprint, and otherwise focusing on running the Consumer business for profitability rather than revenue. This is undoubtedly the right thing to do, and contribution margins have increased pretty dramatically. (Revenue is also being pressured by the transition to subscription.)The problem is that I don't think bulls give enough credence to how important Consumer cash flows are to supporting the rest of the business. Everyone likes to talk about synergies when you put businesses together, but nobody likes to raise the topic of dis-synergies when you take businesses apart (or downsize them). I believe it is reasonable to expect that there are material SG&A as well as R&D synergies between the Consumer and E&E language-based offerings; while there are obviously different go-to-market channels and different technology stacks (although those will be consolidated), French is still French either way, and there are a lot of unallocated corporate costs shared between the businesses. With that, while I do think management can continue to take costs out of the business, I think it pays to be prudent in terms of what you think long-term margins look like at a smaller revenue run rate.It's also important, then, to have a view on the direction of the Consumer franchise - and my view is ""not good."" In the name of research, I've been using Duolingo for the past week to brush up on Spanish (which I haven't seriously studied since junior high). It gave me a painless assessment test which put me at a level that is neither too hard nor too difficult. I've been pleasantly surprised at a) how effective it is at teaching me new words, b) how painless it is, and c) how enjoyable it is. My only question/complaint is that I'm not sure I'd be getting as much out of it if I didn't have a basic grammatical framework (i.e., understanding how to conjugate verbs in present tense, when to use ""usted"" vs. ""tu"", etc.)That said, Rosetta Stone's hallmark is immersion without explicit grammar training, so this isn't a drawback relatively speaking - and on the immersion side, I actually find Duolingo to be more useful than the (admittedly brief) online Rosetta Stone demo I tried, as the ability to tap on words and learn what they mean is quite helpful.Less anecdotally, one study suggested users could learn as much in the first 34 hours of Duolingo as they could in the first 55-60 hours of Rosetta Stone. While I agree that there will always be a market for serious language users, I would also point out that my mother, who has been daydreaming about a trip to Paris for as long as I can remember, has a never-installed, circa-2004 set of Rosetta Stone French CDs gathering dust on a shelf. The dropout/churn rates for Duolingo are quite high, and while it's difficult to estimate them for Rosetta Stone with any degree of precision, anecdotally speaking, a lot of (recent) Amazon reviews reference this phenomenon as well. I don't think gym memberships are a bad mental model - we consistently overestimate our future willpower; as such, having spent a lot of money isn't always enough to stimulate the sunk cost fallacy and get us off the couch and to the gym (or to Rosetta Stone, as the case may be).Increasingly, I believe free apps will be ""good enough"" for the majority of the non-passionate consumers. I agree that the well-known Rosetta Stone brand will continue to appeal to passionate language learners, but again, from wandering around on recent Amazon reviews, I'm not convinced that this demographic is large enough to support Consumer segment revenues anywhere near the current size of the business. As merely one example, while the company cites downloads of its Rosetta Stone mobile app, some context is helpful: on Android, for example, Duolingo has 50 million plus downloads and 2.5 million reviews, vs. 1 million plus and 100,000 reviews for Rosetta Stone.Valuation: Upside Is There… Just Not EnoughWe'll start with the part bulls will like: if management meets their own goals or slightly underperforms, then shares are worth anywhere between $9 to $15 a couple years out (vs. a trading price of ~$7.50 today). This is equivalent to a fairly pedestrian 10% IRR on the low end up to a juicy 40% on the high end.For those interested in my assumptions, I usually don't like to go into great detail, but here I will (feel free to pick away - these are obviously just my own opinions). I'm assuming Lexia's FY17 revenue is equivalent to FY16 bookings, with a 2.5x - 3.5x LTM revenue multiple. In the ""low"" scenario, I'm assuming that E&E language revenue pretty much holds flat, while Consumer declines to ~$75 million; in the ""high"" scenario, I'm assuming $80 million and $90 million, respectively (which I consider to be fairly bullish assumptions). In these respective scenarios for the ""Language"" pseudo-segment, I'm assuming 7.5%10% EBITDA margins and assigning a 6.0x and 8.0x EBITDA multiple. Finally, I'm assuming that the company has somewhere in the neighborhood of $35- $45 million in cash at the time.This is enough to make me think RST is a poor short, and also enough to think that it has some merit as a potential long idea. A few very large cautionary points, though. First, risk/reward based on sum-of-the-parts almost always looks skewed to the upside in turnarounds - yet of the ones I've followed over the past four years, reality has often played out differently. The number that actually turned around vs. the number that just slowly wasted away is not favorable. Second, these numbers give management credit for arresting the decline in the Consumer segment, as well as almost reaching their margin target laid out on the Q4 call (they are hoping for 10% OCF/revenue in 2017).The big risk factor here is that the consumer business doesn't stabilize - and I don't believe it will. In that scenario, it's not at all clear what sort of margins the company could eke out of E&E language, and the market would likely not assign a high multiple to that business until any gains in E&E are big enough to offset losses in Consumer. (I would point out, by the way, that E&E Language hasn't exactly been demonstrating the traction that Lexia has.) Lexia and the cash on the balance sheet could conceivably provide downside support, but if Lexia's bookings growth drops below 20%, that support would vaporize, and there could certainly be further downside.All told, then, with the company still expecting to burn cash this fiscal year, I don't find this to be a compelling idea. Until and unless the company can demonstrate that it can generate free cash flow from its Language businesses despite the ongoing (and likely terminal) decline in Consumer, I don't find the upside potential large enough to offset the risk that the Language business ends up being much smaller and much less profitable than the company's expectations.Wrapping It UpWhile the clean balance sheet, strong brand, and ""crown jewel"" asset (Lexia) give Rosetta Stone plenty of time to figure it out, and the significant ownership by long-term investors provides a community of interest, the price today simply isn't cheap enough. There is a credible path to $15, but it requires very strong execution by management - and with the Consumer business currently in freefall, even the achievability of the scenario where I get to $9-$10 is an open question.If we get a couple years down the line, Lexia is still growing strongly, and the stock is still in the neighborhood of where it's at today, I'd find it a lot more interesting - but absent free cash flow (net of all corporate costs) from the Language business, it's hard to assign much value to it, given that revenues are likely to be under pressure for a long time. Until such time as we get there, I think the ""dead money"" risk is far too high here, as Lexia is the only part of the business actively creating value. The rest is treading water at best and destroying value at worst.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

4265492,102102,2019-05-21T09:22:11-04:00,"Rosetta Stone is executing a business transformation, shifting away from its historical Language Learning segment and focusing on Literacy/Education.Q1 results demonstrated the shift is working, and displayed continued financial improvement.However, even if the company hits its targets and Literacy/Education skyrockets, its current valuation has run up and seems absurdly high. Watch out below.","Rosetta Stone (RST) is, for many consumers, a household name associated with the yellow software box. Historically, the company’s primary business has been selling language education software to consumers. Rosetta Stone calls this business “Language Learning.”Language LearningThis Language Learning business, however, has been facing rapidly-developing competition over the last several years, from companies such as Duolingo (duolingo.com) as well as mammoths like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (Google Assistant's new interpreter), (Google's translating headphones).I first wrote about this trend in 2016. Since then, this competition has continued to cause a significant decline in RST’s Language Learning segment, with revenues falling 56% since 2012.(Source: Author's model, company results)Literacy/EducationGiven these industry trends and results, RST has been shifting its business strategy, focusing on another, more successful part of its business – Literacy. This segment includes reading (of course), but also more general education purposes, and is sold to schools and educators as a learning platform.Literacy has performed much better over recent years, growing over 400% over the last 4 years.(Source: Author's model, company results)The segment has had so much success, that as of Q2’19(E), Literacy will for the first time in Rosetta Stone's history contribute more to revenue than the Consumer Language business.Rosetta Stone notes the Literacy segment has a “greenfield opportunity,” as they have only sold to 14% of U.S. public schools. (Source: company presentation)The business, however, is slowing down, and it seems less likely that RST could ever fully penetrate the market. Over the past 4 years, the growth rate has significantly declined, from 120% in 2015 to 21% last year:(Source: Author's model, company results)Indeed, Q1’19 continued the trend – Literacy grew 20%, down (albeit, slightly) from 22% in Q1’18. Perhaps even more worrying, total bookings were actually flat, and moved from 36% of revenue to 30% of revenue:(Source: company presentation)If RST had been hammered by the market over the past few years, the company’s transition could be a great turnaround story, providing investors with a deep value play.The stock, however, is trading near 52-week and all-time highs, having run up 65% over the past year alone.Data by YChartsTo theoretically estimate RST's value, we'll use EV/EBITDA and management's guidelines.The company is predicting ~$30mm in adjusted EBITDA by 2021:(Source: company presentation)With RST’s market cap at ~$600mm, and the company sitting on $28mm of net cash, its Enterprise Value is $572 - making for a current EV/EBITDA of 71.5!Using a P/S multiple, the company is at about 3.15 P/S using management's 2019 targets.And in 2.5 years, and assuming the company hits its growth targets, EV/EBITDA would be nearly 20.This valuation seems absurd. While the company has nearly completely transitioned to a higher-multiple SaaS model, this slowing business does not deserve such an elevated value; the company seems priced for absolute perfection in operating results. Even then, the stock could trade completely flat for 3-4 years and finally be fairly valued.I’m not a buyer at these levels, and you probably shouldn’t be, either."
3994742,93456,2016-08-02T16:59:56-04:00,Declining revenues are only being masked temporarily.A decline in deferred revenues will be the last shoe to drop.The business model will not be long-term sustainable.,"Several months ago, I laid out a bearish case against Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST), and on a short-term trading basis, it went very well. In the last two weeks, I have again taken a short position on RST before earnings and the thesis is very similar.The previous article can be found here.Basically, the Rosetta Stone situation is all about deferred revenue, which although has been growing steadily, the revenue stream (which is more and more predictable) has fallen dramatically. As of the end of Q1 2016, deferred revenues were up to $132 million, of which $99 million was under the current liabilities section of the balance sheet - $99/12 months is approximately $25 million per quarter.The total revenues for RST on an annual basis have been on the decline since 2012. Total revenues have been:2012 - $2732013 - $2642014 - $2622015 - $2182016 Q1 revenues were $48 million, down from $58 million the same quarter a year earlier.The bulls have argued the turnaround at RST is only beginning. Effectively, the company is moving from a one-time marketing and selling of its product to an individual consumer to a reoccurring subscription-based model. The problem with this approach is the software is not essential, and in a world where every company is cost conscious and other similar products can be had for free, RST will be further challenged.Essentially, the loss per share has begun to narrow, but with a ""single skew"" type of approach like RST's, the declining revenue or receding of the tide may be only beginning. Having taken a short position around the earnings on a few occasions in the past year, I have had the opportunity to listen in on the conference calls and have witnessed the euphoria from one analyst several quarters ago to a completely mum audience of analysts on the 2016 Q1 conference call.I believe those paying close attention to the company already are aware the tide has turned, and potentially after earnings on August 3, 2016, the stock price will finally move down from the $8 range it has kept for the past several weeks to the range where it belongs. It's hard to say where the range is though.Currently, with no debt outstanding and $40 million in cash on the balance sheet, the company may take a long while to arrive at its judgment day or be bought out.Maybe that's where the analyst's euphoria came from on the conference call several quarters ago: either an attempt to do a deal or get some investment banking business. This I have no proof, however, it's only my own supposition.Given the time frame and potential buyout, I think the $4 per share price range may be in the right ballpark, but we'll have to see what the ""street"" thinks in a few days.I shorted the shares of RST in the past several weeks at a price above $8 and have not written or bought any options. Although the revenue may be predictable, a decline in deferred revenues may sink the stone."
3959536,23806,2016-03-19T11:00:28-04:00,"Decision to name John Hass as permanent CEO and focus on licensing model outside North America/Northern Europe signals trajectory towards monetization.Licensing deals laying the groundwork for a leaner consumer business; RST consumer brand should be worth at least $20M as competitor Duolingo raised $45M at a $470M pre-money valuation last year.Very positive feedback on new E&E language offering to be launched in 2H16 in time for fall selling season should reverse recent disappointing performance.Stress testing assumptions results in little downside; optionality remains with reasonable multiple on Lexia, adoption of new E&E language offering and monetization of consumer business.We are regularly contacted by institutional buyers interested in acquiring our shares (who otherwise can’t due to lack of liquidity); PE firms expressed interest for direct investment into Lexia.","The decision to name John Hass as permanent CEO (and drop two board members with no intention to replace them) signals, in our minds, the company’s trajectory toward monetization. There are far more qualified digital education CEOs than John Hass available in the marketplace who could have easily been attracted to join Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST). In fact, this would have been the most logical decision if the company was going to pursue being a long-term going-concern. On the other hand, John Hass is a perfect person to best position the company strategically. Since he was a longtime Goldman investment banker previously, he likely knows exactly who the buyers are and what they want. We also are encouraged by John’s commitment to see this investment through to a successful end.The decision to simplify the business by focusing on a licensing model in areas outside North America and Northern Europe and significantly reduce the overall cost structure (e.g., exit high-cost France) to provide clear visibility into future cash-generative business underscores the first point above. In essence, clean it up and make the tough choices today so it’s teed up for a strategic buyer. In terms of cash flow, the company is making the right decision to allocate capital to grow Lexia (given the lifetime value of a customer with 90% plus retention) as opposed to conserve cash because the cash spent to grow Lexia is worth more than the capital invested.E & E Language business is disappointing particularly given the backdrop of a growing market. TechNavio Analysis is projecting a 13% CAGR for the next five years for the Global Digital English market. The new E & E language product is not expected to be introduced into the marketplace until the 2nd half of 2016 but in time for the fall selling season. This is the real beta mover in the company’s prospects in our view.The most logical buyer in our minds remains a dedicated E & E buyer (interested in both language and literacy) who would immediately license out the consumer business. Once the new language E & E product is available in the second half of ’16, the ability to run consumer without undermining E & E will be in place, providing two offerings that are not currently sufficiently differentiated in the marketplace. The company signaled very positive feedback on the E & E language beta test. The company also reiterated its expectation that Lexia bookings will reach $100 million in 4 to 5 years. Increasingly, this asset, plus cash, is accounting for the company’s market cap. Today’s announcement from a school in California is typical of the feedback that Lexia generates.The company is laying the groundwork for a leaner consumer business by pursuing licensing deals; now it is in Japan and Korea and we expect others to soon follow. A consumer business model has validity because of the brand and the efficacy of the product, which is underscored by partners who are willing to license it, which costs RST nothing. Last year, competitor Duolingo raised $45 million at a pre-money valuation of $470 million. Is it a safe assumption that RST’s consumer brand is worth at least $20 million? I think so. Maybe the buyer of this business will pursue a business model closer to Duolingo’s if that makes the most sense.The RST investment thesis is classic value – little downside (in our view), with strong, albeit wide ranging, optionality on the upside. Downside appears to us as follows: 2x Lexia’s $33 million estimated ’16 revenue (vs. Credit Suisse’s SaaS industry average multiple of 4.25x), 1x E & E language of $70 million, 0.25x consumer revenue of $75 million, $5 million for Fit Brains, and cash of $30 million equates to roughly $8.75/share.In our view, take care of the downside first, second and third. RST fits squarely into that investment approach. With little downside, the upside/downside equation is convincing. In reality, a more reasonable valuation suggests 3x to 3.5x Lexia revenue, given its growth and 90% plus retention rate, resulting in a valuation of at least $11 to $11.50 per share, with upside optionality still feasible from that level depending on Lexia growth, the adoption of the new E & E language offering and the creativity in monetizing the consumer business.We are regularly contacted by institutional buyers who want to know if we’re weary and want to part with our stock. These buyers seem to only be interested if they can fulfill a large order, otherwise it’s not worth their time given the lack of liquidity in the stock. We’ve also been contacted by PE firms indicating their desire for a direct investment into Lexia. We’re not tired. We are confident in this management team and support the decisions they’re making and firmly believe the company will have many options available as the year unfolds."
3581886,23806,2015-10-19T09:55:00-04:00,"Placing a reasonable 2x multiple on the Language Arts segment (which includes the fast growing – 20% plus - Lexia business) effectively gives investors the corporate, government and consumer businesses for free.Management running consumer business for bottom-line profits not top-line growth (reduced marketing spend, pricing discipline, margins increased from 25% to ~40% on reduced revenues).Integration of its three current language platforms onto one more corporate friendly platform alone is expected to generate annual savings of $5-6 million.The company retained outside advisors after receiving indication of interest from RDG Capital, led by Russell Glass (former president of Icahn Associates).Downside limited by strong balance sheet (no debt, year-end expected cash of ~$45 million) and recurring revenue.","(Editors' Note: This article was originally published as part of Roumell Asset Management's 2Q letter to investors).In the past year, we have discussed Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) in two separate quarterly letters. We have continued to build our position and significantly reduce our cost basis, as its stock price has declined and our conviction in the ultimate investment thesis has increased. The thesis is pretty straightforward: RST is a well-capitalized, debt-free company with a differentiated language platform whose enterprise business is delivered through a recurring-revenue SaaS (software as a service) business model. While the future of the company is its Education and Enterprise (E&E) division, which serves K-12 schools, corporations and government agencies, we believe the stock is cheap because of inflated concerns over its declining consumer business. Recently, the company received an indication of interest from private equity firm RDG Capital Fund Management, led by Russell Glass, former president of Icahn Associates, the eponymous firm of investor Carl Icahn. We believe RDG and its private equity partner are serious in their intent to want to own the company. Further, we believe the company’s resistance to negotiate near the current stock price is a result of its confidence in its plans succeeding and organically moving the price higher, creating a more favorable environment to market the company in whole or in parts.On July 1st, RAM filed a 13D highlighting our support for the current management team but also indicating our strong belief that the company should hire outside advisors to review potential strategic options in light of the RDG indication of interest. To our satisfaction, on July 7th, RST announced it had “retained outside financial and legal advisors to assist management and its Board with their ongoing comprehensive review to analyze potential options to improve financial performance and enhance shareholder value.”To be clear, RST is no longer a pure language learning software company given its 2013 purchase of Lexia Learning software. Lexia just completed its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year organic growth, having grown annual bookings to $25 million from $15 million when Rosetta Stone acquired it. Equally important, Lexia’s renewal rates are over 90%, evidence of a true recurring SaaS revenue model. Conversations with strategic industry insiders suggest such metrics are associated with private market values of 3x revenue, which would value Lexia at $75 million. Lexia is growing because its reading software is receiving notable accolades among educators given its proven and measurable reading results. In its second-quarter call, investors apparently ignored that the company indicated its belief that this business will grow at roughly 25% plus a year for the next five years.The RST investment thesis is driven by an exceptionally favorable price versus value proposition underscored by recent private market transactions. To wit, RST has a current stock market capitalization of roughly $150 million and an enterprise value of about $110 million using $40 million in net cash (versus the company’s indication of a year-end cash level of mid $40s). The company’s combined Language Arts segment (Lexia literacy and K-12 language software) has roughly $65 million in annual sales. At even 2x revenue, this basically covers the company’s current enterprise value, and so we effectively get the remaining ~$160 million of revenue from the corporate, government and consumer businesses for free. For comparison, in 2012, Pearson (NYSE:PSO) purchased Global English ($42 million in corporate annual revenue) for $90 million cash. We estimate RST’s corporate revenue to be roughly $50 million annually and don’t see why it wouldn’t be at least similarly valued to Global English given Rosetta’s superior brand. Valuing the company’s consumer business is much more difficult but we do believe it possesses value and is a free option. Additionally, Fit Brains, purchased for $12 million two years ago, seems likely to be worth at least its purchase price given that its revenues have more than doubled since RST purchased it.RST’s August 17th report provided some clear and comforting data points. Year-end cash is estimated to be roughly $45 million (same as 3/31/15) as the company guided for $10 to $15 million in operating cash flow by the end of this year. Year-end net cash represents approximately 35% of the company’s current market capitalization. A breakdown of each segment is worth highlighting:Lexia Learning - As our investors know, RST is no longer a pure language learning company with its acquisition of K-12 literacy software company, Lexia, nearly two years ago. Lexia is performing extremely well. Its bookings grew nearly 50% in the most recent quarter and YOY bookings as of June 30th are now at $26 million as compared to $20 million. Bookings are indicated to have a near 100% conversion rate as these are signed contracts. RST indicated its goal of growing Lexia to $100 million in five years with 20% plus EBITDA margins. We believe it’s quite possible that Lexia alone accounts for roughly 60% to 75% of RST’s current enterprise value of roughly $100 million. Strong secular tailwinds in early education spending bodes well for this company asset. In our research, we were basically unable to find negative comments about Lexia’s offering from a parent or educator.E&E Language - This segment is comprised of corporate, K-12 and government contracts and generates roughly $90 million in revenue. Our contacts indicate government is growing nicely, with increased buying by Homeland Security and Border Control. However, corporate is performing mediocre at best, and the renewal rates in K-12 are only about 80% (compared to Lexia’s 95% rate). The company indicated it will have completed its technology integration of placing its three current language platforms onto one much more corporate friendly platform by year-end (an estimated annually savings of $5 to $6 million). This is clearly where the company needs to focus and execute better. As we’ve noted previously, Global English was purchased by Pearson for $90 million in 2012 and had $42 million in unprofitable revenue. RST’s total language revenue of roughly $200 million (split between consumer and E&E) is currently being valued at roughly $30 to $50 million after backing our valuation of Lexia and net cash from the company’s market cap.Consumer - The company has executed on its stated plan to reduce marketing spend on consumer and maintain strong price discipline so as not to undermine E&E pricing. The results from the second quarter are promising. The consumer segment contribution margin went from 25% (historical average) to nearly 40% on reduced revenues. The company is no longer running this business for top-line growth, but for bottom-line profits. The company also executed pure licensing agreements in Japan and South Korea.We believe RST is an exceptionally well-capitalized, exceedingly cheap security with a promising future. Management deserves credit for aggressively simplifying its business. RST also possesses a highly-regarded RAM attribute – it has multiple shots on goal. As our investors know, the company recently announced the hiring of outside financial advisors and we’re confident we will realize a meaningful return as a result of the business being sold in whole, sold in pieces, or as a high-probability turnaround. To be clear, RAM has expressed to RST’s board that we would not support any offer(s) that is not well north of the current price. For instance, we would not support a $10 offer nor do we believe other major shareholders would support such an offer. RAM's ownership stands at roughly 6% of outstanding common stock."
3964845,101579,2016-04-12T19:14:32-04:00,Rosetta Stone is successfully transforming into a simpler and more profitable business.Rosetta Stone will continue to embrace higher overall profit percentages as the transition is finalized.Rosetta Stone is a good long term opportunity for growth seeking investors.,"Thesis:Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is successfully transitioning into a lower cost, higher profit margin business model. By electing to phase out of the consumer product segment and shift towards educational subscription services, RST will soon be positioned for high revenue growth and positive earnings. (See the 10-K for reference.)Introduction:Rosetta Stone is widely respected for its highly effective instructive language learning software. After Q4 of 2015, RST celebrated the achievement of growing its educational subscription segment to greater than 50% of the overall company in terms of revenue. This major milestone was significant because it was the long term vision of management and the highest profit margin segment of the company. Now that the transition process is more than half way complete, RST and investors can expect to begin seeing improved financials in the upcoming quarterly reports, and greater value creation from less invested capital. As the business transition continues its course, RST will enjoy a long period of steady growth and higher profitability.Consumer Product SegmentThe consumer product segment was once a profitable operation until it became heavily dependent on marketing in order to sustain consistent growth. The major problem was that product sales were one time transactions that required a new buyer every time. The isolated costs associated only with this segment are manufacturing, packaging, storing inventory, and shipping. These costs were affordable and offset by high product prices but this only added to the growing difficulty RST was having maintaining positive sales growth. Management realized that this segment was becoming unmanageably expensive to promote, and decided to stop spending the extremely high capital on sales and marketing expenses for product sales. Instead, Rosetta Stone made the decision to phase out of product sales and move towards a virtual education subscription service company. The breakdown below shows the product consumer segment in the last 5 years, its diminishing percentage of the total business, and its lack of profitability from costly marketing and advertising expenses.The consumer product segment has created consistent losses over the past 5 years, however finally represents less that 30% of the overall company. This operational shift to a subscription service business is helping RST lower overall expenses by decreasing the need for high marketing efforts. Over the course of 2016, Rosetta Stone will continue to remove the product segment entirely until it no longer exists. The subscription service segment will then take over as the controlling driving factor of the company.Electronic Subscription & Service SegmentRosetta Stone is currently more than 70% controlled by its subscription service segment as of the end of 2015. This segment allows for an entirely virtual business model with downloadable products and lower COGS. After the transition is complete, RST will no longer be responsible for manufacturing hardware, packaging CD's, holding storage, or shipping. Business virtualization will increase overall profit margins, and subscription pricing models are creating reoccurring revenue opportunities. Rosetta Stone's Lexia Learning software has received very positive feedback by language programs in many school districts across the country, and has positioned RST for long term growth in this market. The focus on education programs in schools decreases excessive advertising expenses, and simplifies ongoing sales by partnering with schools that annually re-subscribe for Rosetta Stone's interactive language learning software. The education market is more focused, and easier to effectively advertise to than trying to mass market to all consumers on the planet. The breakdown below shows the subscription service segment in the last 5 years, its takeover progression as a percentage of total business revenue, and the higher profitability of the virtual and simpler electronic subscription service segment.The electronic subscription segment has higher profit margins and lower associated marketing expenses that enable it to remain a profitable business segment every year. This segment has posted consistent revenue growth dating all the way back to 2005 and will continue this trend for many years ahead. Lexia is Rosetta Stone's top performing language education software right now. With over a 90% retention rate for new trial users, and a 50% revenue growth in 2015, RST estimates continued growth in this division which will help foster overall growth in the subscription service segment. RST and investors will also enjoy growing profit margins while the costly product segment continues to fully phase out of the company. This transition will begin having a positively dramatic effect on earnings growth in upcoming quarters.Looking Forward to 20162016 will be the pivot point for investors and RST to begin benefiting from the success of simplifying operations and reducing unnecessary costs throughout the company. Management projects that total revenue will continue to decline for the first quarter of 2016 in line with expectations as a result of further reduced sales in the consumer product segment. Electronic education subscription service revenue was also forecasted to slightly decline from managements decision to strategically exit a select few unprofitable locations. These decisions will allow RST to continue drastically decreasing operating expenses, and will position the company for a period of long term high profitable growth. In 2016, the accumulated cost savings will be the dominating value driver for the company. Look for Rosetta Stone to complete its strategic shift by the end of 2016, and embrace higher profit segments and overall revenue growth in 2017.Risks for Investors to Consider1) Low Possible CompetitionAn up and coming language learning competitor, Babbel, originated in Germany and soon will be entering America's market. Babbel's biggest advantage is its low cost pricing strategy with subscription packages starting as low as $7.45 per month. The affordability and strong reputation the company has already built in Germany may translate to positive sales in the consumer market of the United States. Fortunately, Rosetta Stone is no longer relying on consumer sales for its main revenue stream and this will lessen the impact that Babbel can have.Discontinuing the consumer segment is also helping RST avoid the threat of competition from free language learning software. The transition to a higher focus on education markets helps remove a lot of competitors who focus on public consumer sales. As Rosetta Stone continues completing its transformation, consumer segment competition will become less of a factor. However, competition in the education market will have a greater impact for the future of the company2) High Possible CompetitionA major competitor for Rosetta Stone in the enterprise & education segment is Duliongo. Duliongo has also been successfully expanding its business in education programs in various school districts. RST and Duliongo are two of the top players in this market and are proving to have successful programs. This competition will make it more difficult for RST to maintain positive growth for its E&E segment in the long run. This factor is an uncertainty that investors should consider if taking a long position on the company.Additional Notes1) Insider OwnershipThe public ownership shown above from capital IQ reveals high Institutional and Hedge Fund interest. In the past 12 months, insider have accumulated almost 280,000 purchases and sold only 12,608 shares. This activity is related to the success RST is having strategically shifting its operations, and great sign that it is going continue in 2016 as well.2) Declining M&A and G&ATotal advertising/marketing and general/administrative expenses have been decreasing over the course of the operational shift. RST is becoming a more cost effective company, able to avoid unnecessary expenditures by focusing growth strategies. This trend will continue as the consumer segment continues to be phased out of Rosetta Stone's overall business model.3) Deferred RevenueRosetta Stone currently has 139.4 million dollars in deferred revenue and plans to recognize 102.7 million of it over the next 12 months. This incoming revenue will help compensate for the declining product segment and boost overall revenue for all of 2016.ConclusionAt the current price, I believe Rosetta Stone is the right investment for any long term growth investor looking for a high return. RST is successfully transforming its business, and pursuing only profitable strategies that benefit from low cost operations. The subscription service segment, also known as the enterprise and education segment, is becoming the sole driving factor for RST's future. Using a proforma to discount future cash flows by assuming an annual 5% decline in the subscription segment (strategic discontinuation of unprofitable divisions) , including 100% of the proposed deferred revenue, and eliminating the consumer product segment, I calculate an intrinsic value of $7.69 and a 1 year price target of $10.50 for RST. This represents a 35% return and a great opportunity for investors to benefit from a currently undervalued company."

        Shares have been left for dead as shares hover at all-time lows.
        There appears to be mispricing in this security with the optionality for an operational turnaround if management is able to right the ship.","Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is a technology-based language-learning solution company that has made news of late with numerous activist investors filing 13Ds in hopes of turning around the business (Roumell, Nierenberg, and Osmiium).Since the ousting of former CEO, Stephen Swad, the new interim CEO, John Hass has made tremendous strides to stabilize the business and provide for the right growth plan going forward as they invest in segments that can provide better ROI. The company is focusing its strategy and resources towards the Global Enterprise and Education part of the business.Hass is doing a good job in focusing the company on this segment of the business. However, demand is still relatively weak and the company is likely a few quarters away from profitability. Declines in the average revenue per product is a worrisome sign and competitive pressure is picking up in the space. There are those who are worried Rosetta will lose market share to the free language apps in the marketplace, but Rosetta's competitive advantage stems from its far superior customer service and support base for global enterprises and schools. Many of these app based companies cannot provide the support of Rosetta.The interest of well-respected value investors is certainly intriguing. As David Nierenberg says in his 13D filing, ""Our hope for RST is that, with a much tighter focus on the valuable assets it owns today, the company could double EBITDA in 2015 compared with current 2014 guidance, accelerate the growth of its SAAS E&E business to a rate materially faster than it has guided, and rebuild cash per share back towards $5. We urge RST not to make any further acquisitions until it first digests what it has swallowed and focuses the company's strategy much more tightly.""Roumell Asset Management adds further in their 13D filing about their support of Hass as CEO saying, ""Mr. Hass, with his Goldman Sachs and operational background, appears to us to be well-suited to take advantage of RST's market opportunity, particularly with the assistance of experienced cost-rationalizer Al Angrisani.""Rosetta Stone is one of the most recognized language learning brands in a world that is constantly growing and globalizing. The company is being circled by activist investors, they are extremely well capitalized with no debt and cash representing ~25% of the current share price. The reorganization plans may take a few quarters to take hold. However, there appears to be a plan that provides for upside optionality with an interesting asymmetric risk/reward profile for patient investors.Let's dive into the valuation.VALUATIONOn the valuation front, things don't look great at first glance.However, the job of every great investor is to translate reported GAAP earnings of the business into real economic earnings (free cash flow or owner earnings). The durability of those real economic earnings is the next (usually most important) step. Although sustainable competitive advantages can be difficult to pinpoint, it's extremely important to establish.And sometimes an investor needs to look beyond the now and keep an eye out for potential management teams that may be executing turnarounds in their businesses. Rosetta may be such a business.Since the future is inherently unknown and unpredictable (to any high degree of probability). And because we weren't blessed with a crystal ball, we believe a margin of safety is ESSENTIAL in every investment.A larger margin of safety is recommended for lower quality investments (larger discount between current prices and the Intrinsic Value of the Business). A higher quality business or investment doesn't necessary require a large discount to intrinsic value if you expect (with a high degree of probability) that returns will be realized shortly or returns of the business will compound over time.Regarding valuation, margin of safety can be accomplished in one of two ways (or both for that matter):1) Purchasing the conservative estimate of future free cash flows of the business at a discount2) Purchasing a business below its liquidation value with favorable earnings power in 3-5 years.In the case of Rosetta, we will be valuing the business based on its discounted future free cash flows OR owner earnings OR earnings power to determine if there is a margin of safety.In valuing any business, it's important to focus on free cash flow (as well as the durability of its competitive position).In valuing Rosetta, let's start with the FCF number.Rosetta had Cash Flow from Operations of $6.7 million in 2014. Capital expenditures for the year were $9.7 million. The ""back of the envelope"" net free cash flow was about -$3.1 million.Prior to the four year period of unprofitability, Rosetta regularly generated returns on equity in the 7-19% range and return on invested capital between 10-24%.It appears Capex has remained relatively stable between 8-10% over that time. Rosetta operates in an industry that is becoming extremely fragmented. As such, the increased competition has brought on a bout of cyclicality and uncertainty.With current management in place, as well as activist taking a larger role, we would not be surprised to see the company generate net profit margins in the 5-6% range in a more normalized environment. Given these net profit margins, we see the company being able to generate future free cash flow of at least $20 million over time. If/when this happens, there will be a re-pricing of the stock (hopefully at much high levels).We will use a conservative discount rate of 15%, given the cyclical and volatile nature of the business.And even after all the DCF projections, the business is still worth something at the end of the day (all else being equal). So we assume that the business is sold at the end of the year 10 at a conservative 10x FCF plus any excess capital in the business. Rosetta has $29.8 million in cash, but has been bleeding cash to date. As a result, we'll use $25 million as a conservative number of excess capital.We'll even assume they sell raise capital at these levels and offer shares at these levels. We don't believe this will occur (nor is it a great idea), however we want to be conservative in our assumptions. We'll say they raise another 9 million shares (almost double current shares outstanding), so we'll use 30 million shares outstanding in our calculation.Based on these numbers, and to be very conservative, we will come up with 3 growth scenarios for Rosetta over the next 10 years. We'll also give a probability weight based on the likelihood of each scenario. Let's look at the three scenarios below using these various assumptions, and see how we were able to arrive at a fairly conservative estimate of intrinsic value using a range of values and probability of the scenarios playing out:Low-Range Scenario #1: ­­­0% growth in FCF for years 1-10Mid-Range Scenario #2: ­­­­­5% growth in FCF for years 1-10High-Range Scenario #3: 10% growth in FCF for years 1-10The discounted values of Rosetta range from $5.83 to $9.50. The stock is trading ~$6.90 per share which gives a slight margin of safety to our weighted assumptions. However, we believe the most likely scenario is 5-10% growth in FCF in the future, which is why we weighted scenario #2 and #3 at 70% probability.This gives us a weighted intrinsic value of $7.65 per share. With shares trading at ~6.90 per share, it seems like an interesting opportunity at these levels.BOTTOM LINEThe current share price clearly reflects investor concern with the business. There are numerous potential positive developments and the company has plenty of time on its hand, as it has no debt and ~$1 per share in cash. There appears to be a mispricing in this security with the optionality for an operational turnaround if management is able to right the ship.Hat tip to Jim Roumell on this find.

3391645,41741,2015-08-03T15:17:52-04:00,"Rosetta Stone is still being targeted by major activist investors.The biggest and most recent thesis is a buyout.We could be even closer to a buyout now, but is the company still misunderstood?","Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) has a few of activist investors pushing for a change. Rosetta has been targeted by Osmium Partners and Nierenberg Investment Management. We first covered this topic in late 2014, when we noted that ""Outside of the questionable management decisions, Rosetta might be struggling a little from competition. Its first-mover advantage is gone. Rosetta is now one of many language and educational tools available to consumers, many of which are free.""Things have changed a bit since then, but you wouldn't know it from the stock price. There's a potential buyout on the table, where the company is rumored to be a buyout target. Of note, RDG Capital has made an offer for the company, said to be between $9 and $10 a share. Osmium Partners, Rosetta's second largest shareholder, has come out in support of a potential buyout. Osmium, whoever, wants a buyout price of $16 a share or more - well above the current $7 a share price.Now, in April of last year, other activist, David Nierenberg got a board seat. As a result, he laid out all his plans for Rosetta. This includes leveraging the company's brand name and vast customer base in an effort to capitalize on the large amounts of money spent on education each year.But the company has effectively destroyed itself. Its sub par management team has continued to drag the company down. They've tried acquiring growth, but that hasn't worked. And as a result of its aggressive growth plans, it managed to create a cost structure that's unnecessary and convoluted. RST has spent upwards of 60%of its revenues on sales and marketing expenses, meanwhile, revenues have been flat since then. But gross margins are still high and enticing.The answer is to get the company to forget about being large and growing revenues and to focus on profitability. Cash flow generation should be the focus going forward. How long that takes is anyone's guess.The quickest path to success for the activists involved is getting a buyout. The company has already retained advisers to help with exploring the potential sale of the company. The natural buyers for the company could include Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co. (NASDAQ:HMHC), which recently bought Scholastic's Educational Technology. Meanwhile, a number of other buyers could be IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI) or Graham Holdings Co. (NYSE:GHC).In the end, the best near-term opportunity at Rosetta lies in getting the company bought out. However, there is some hope with Rosetta. The company has minimal debt, with plenty of cash. But the market continues to misunderstand the company, seeing it as a CD business, yet, it's a growth story with the transition to enterprise and software as a solution. So you have a legacy business that's still generating cash and a growing high-margin recurring revenue education business."
2798695,61761,2015-01-05T18:09:04-05:00,"Osmium Partners revealed in a December 31st Form 4 filing that it had recently sold 147,247 shares of RST.I believe the share sales are an indication that Osmium's confidence in RST's business is wavering.An analysis of Osmium's four point plan reveals that the firm's turnaround plan for RST has a low chance of success.Osmium has reduced its RST ownership to just below the insider threshold of 10%. This indicates that further share sales are likely.RST remains an excellent short opportunity.","In my prior article on Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST), I argued that RST was a tremendous short opportunity due to the Company's misleading financial reporting methods and deteriorating business performance. In just a few short days since the release of this article, the bear case against RST has only strengthened, as Osmium Partners recently liquidated a portion of its holdings.On December 31st, Osmium Partners reported in a Form 4 filing that it had sold a significant amount of shares in RST. From December 29th to December 31st, Osmium sold a total of 147,247 shares, which reduced its stake in RST from 2.276mm to 2.129mm shares (a 6.5% reduction). Many RST shareholders have placed a significant amount of faith in Osmium's ability to help turn the Company around. Thus, Osmium's recent decision to reduce its investment is a troubling event for RST longs. I believe that Osmium has lost confidence in its ability to help turnaround RST's business.Also, further share sales appear to be likely in the near term. The firm's decision to reduce its ownership in RST to below the SEC's insider threshold of 10% will allow it to sell additional shares without having to report them immediately. These points are fleshed out in further detail below.Osmium Appears To Have Lost Some Confidence In Rosetta StoneThe timing of Osmium's decision to reduce its investment in RST was rather odd. Firms usually do not sell a significant amount of shares in their top holding on the last 3 trading days of the year. The reason is because the last trading days of the year are usually very slow from a volume perspective. Selling a large amount of shares during these days can severely pressure the share price. This is particularly true for thinly traded small-cap stocks like RST. In addition to this, Osmium's decision to reduce its investment comes just a few weeks after the firm gained a board seat and released a four-point turnaround plan for RST. Typically, activist investors do not decrease their ownership stake at the beginning stages of a turnaround campaign. Thus, the peculiar timing seems to indicate that Osmium's share sale was a somewhat spur of the moment decision rather than a carefully planned sale.So why did Osmium decide to sell RST shares at such a peculiar time? I believe Osmium has lost some confidence in RST's business and the feasibility of its four-point turnaround plan. As I pointed out in my prior article, RST's bookings and cash flow this year have been temporarily boosted by the Company's increased focus on signing multi-year contracts. In addition to this, the Company has grossly inflated financial results by switching to a new definition of Adjusted EBITDA, which adds future deferred revenue to current results. I estimate that management's guidance for FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA ($18mm-$22mm) is overstated by at least $22mm. In light of these discoveries, I believe that Osmium may now realize that its turnaround plan has a relatively low chance of success. In fact, I believe that implementing Osmium's turnaround plan may actually do more harm than good for RST shareholders. I arrived at this conclusion after analyzing each of the four points of Osmium's action plan. I have provided below my detailed analysis of Osmium's turnaround plan.Point #1: …take advantage of Rosetta Stone's significant brand equity, business models, and assets to deliver meaningful value to shareholders with the objective of doubling targeted free cash flow margins from 2% in 2014 to 4% in 2015.I believe that free cash flow is a misguided measure of the current financial performance of RST's business. The reason is because the Company is in the process of converting a higher proportion of its customers to multi-year contracts. As I demonstrated in Section 2 of my prior article, converting customers from single-year to multi-year contracts temporarily boosts free cash flow, because all of the cash for a multi-year contract is received in the first year. When the conversion to multi-year contracts eventually slows down, free cash flow will be significantly pressured. In fact, if the current trend in RST's business continues, the Company's free cash flow is likely to be deeply negative once the conversion to multi-year contracts slows down. Instead of focusing on bookings and free cash flow, Osmium should instead focus on the GAAP P&L results and a revenue-based Adjusted EBITDA metric. If the firm did this, it would see that the Company's performance has deteriorated significantly this year. As I detailed in my prior article, RST is projected to generate a GAAP net loss of over $2 per share this year. In addition to this, its FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA guidance is overstated by at least $22m. Based a more reasonable revenue-based metric, FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be a loss of at least $4mm.Point #2: Create a sharp focus with a clear strategy on how to evolve, innovate and profitably grow BOTH the Consumer and Education & Enterprise segments.I agree that this is a good goal to have. I do not have much to comment on here except that, as of right now, RST has failed to evolve, innovate and profitably grow.Point #3: Provide clear disclosures and appropriate business metrics for shareholders to understand both the Consumer and Education & Enterprise segments.I agree that RST needs to provide business metrics which more accurately convey the performance of the business. Unfortunately, as I discussed in detail in my previous article, the Company's current financial reporting practices significantly mislead and inflate the performance of the business. The first step RST needs to make is to abandon its bookings-based definition of Adjusted EBITDA. This metric has thoroughly confused investors and sell-side analysts regarding the true financial status of the Company. In addition to this, more segment-specific performance metrics would also be welcome. Overall, providing more detailed and accurate business metrics will most likely show a worse-than-expected trend in the business. Although more transparency is better for the Company in the long run, the adoption of more accurate business metrics may have a detrimental effect on RST's share price in the short term.Point #4: Conduct an aggressive share repurchase either in the open market or via a ""Dutch Tender."" We believe Rosetta Stone's balance sheet is considerably overcapitalized given projected and historical cash flows.As discussed above when addressing Point #1, free cash flow has been artificially boosted by the conversion to multi-year contracts. The Company is receiving cash flow from multi-year contracts upfront at the expense of future cash flow. If the current trend of the business continues, it is likely that RST's free cash flow will be deeply negative once the conversion to multi-year contracts slows down. As a result, conducting an aggressive share repurchase at this time is a risky proposition.To summarize, Osmium's four-point action plan appears to have a low chance of success. In regards to Point #1, free cash flow is a misguided measure due to the ongoing conversion to multi-year contracts. It is highly likely that free cash flow will decline substantially once the conversion to multi-year contracts slows down. In addition to this, implementing Point #3 and Point #4 of Osmium's turnaround plan may actually destroy rather than create shareholder value in the long-term. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Osmium may be reevaluating its investment in RST and the feasibility of its turnaround plan.Osmium Will Likely Sell More SharesIt is unknown whether Osmium has sold additional shares since the latest sale on December 31st. However, I believe it is likely that Osmium will further reduce its stake in RST in the near future. As I detailed above, I believe that Osmium has lost some confidence in the feasibility of the Company's four-point turnaround plan. In addition to this, the firm's recent share sales have conveniently lowered its ownership in RST to just under the SEC's designated insider threshold of 10%. I have provided below a figure which shows Osmium's ownership before and after the recent share sales:As a result of reducing its ownership to just under 10%, Osmium is no longer considered an insider by the SEC. This is significant, because insiders are required to report any purchase or sale of stock within two business days with a Form 4 filing. Now that Osmium is no longer an insider, it is only required to report any meaningful purchase or sale of stock (greater than 1% of RST's outstanding shares) within 10 business days in a 13D filing.So what does this all mean? Osmium will have 10 business days to report any significant change in its ownership of RST. Also, it will not have to report anything until the firm sells additional shares that in aggregate are greater than 1% of RST's outstanding shares. Thus, I believe that Osmium's decision to reduce its investment to just under 10% is not a coincidence. Instead, I believe that Osmium wanted to lose its insider designation to get more time to liquidate shares without reporting it to the public. This is not just baseless speculation. Osmium actually utilized this same tactic when it reduced its position earlier in the year. I have provided below a figure which shows the change in Osmium's ownership from March 2014 to June 2014:As shown in the figure above, from March 21st to April 7th, Osmium sold 173K shares and reduced its ownership to just under 10% (9.91%). After reducing its ownership to under 10%, Osmium was able to sell an additional 161K shares without tipping off RST shareholders. These actions by Osmium earlier in the year strongly indicate that it is likely to sell additional shares in the near future. Just how many more shares it will sell is uncertain. However, given the issues that I have raised regarding RST's accounting practices and business performance, I expect Osmium will further reduce its holdings by a significant amount. It is also worth nothing that since March 21st, Osmium has significantly reduced its holdings of RST in its two largest funds - Osmium Capital, LP (22% decrease) and Osmium Capital II, LP (38% decrease). This is another strong indication that Osmium is losing confidence in the investment.ConclusionIn conclusion, I believe that the peculiar timing of Osmium's recent share sales is an indication that the firm has lost confidence in its turnaround plan for RST. Also, Osmium's decision to reduce its ownership to under 10% indicates that the firm plans on selling additional shares in the near future. Further share sales by Osmium will likely put additional downward pressure on RST's stock price over the short term. Also, any indication that Osmium may be wavering in its commitment to RST will certainly hurt the Company's perceived chances of a successful turnaround. Thus, I believe RST remains an excellent short opportunity at the current share price level."
3038006,60741,2015-03-31T09:24:45-04:00,"Rosetta Stone is pivoting its strategy again, focusing on enterprise and education, pulling out of the consumer segment and engaging in extreme cost cutting. The strategy is viable.The price is attractive, factoring in only a very modest success. A double or a triple is not a remote scenario.Activist investor David Nierenberg, possibly with the cooperation of Osmium Partners, recently drove CEO Swad to resign. Their commitment to RST's success is an important factor in the transformation.","Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is where the action is these days. After delivering disappointing results... yet again... For FY'14, their third largest investor David Nierenberg filed a 13D recommending a change to executive leadership. Two weeks later, CEO Stephen Swad resigned. During the past two years, the company continuously over-promised and under-delivered. Nevertheless, the business model is solid, the price is cheap and with the recent leadership change, the company may have the right focus to execute. If one is willing to look beyond the disappointments of the past, the story is compelling. In this article, I will explain why I am maintaining my long position alongside notable investors David Nierenberg and Osmium Partners, and why I believe that the stock has the potential to at least double in the upcoming two years, while possessing only a minimal downside risk.BackgroundSince 2012, Rosetta Stone is undergoing a transformation from its old bricks-and-mortar CD-ROM retail model to a fully SaaS (SW as a Service) operated model. In the four years since the transformation to SaaS has started, the decline in the old physical goods segment has been faster than the growth in SaaS. New revenue just doesn't grow fast enough to replace the old evaporating revenue. The company is non-profitable since 2011. Not only that, but until recently, the company had little strategic direction and was shooting in all directions - targeting the Enterprise and Education segment, and North-American consumer, and trying to ramp sales abroad, mainly in Europe, Japan and Korea. Rosetta was ill for a long time. It was unprofitable and unfocused. The transformation is definitely taking longer than anyone had expected. Actual business results have been falling short of projections made along the way, time and again. Disappointments came in every year, and the stock price has been tumbling as a result.My investment thesis is simple. Rosetta has good competitive products, good strategy, the right entrepreneurial spirit, and hopefully, it finally has the right focus. With the recent leadership change, and shareholders such as David Nierenberg and Osmium Partners, it will pivot and refine its game until it get it right. Once it does, share price will go up significantly. As long as it doesn't get it right, share price will not go down much further, as the company is already priced for disappointments.FinancialsSurely, the income statement looks very uninspiring. Revenue is not growing, and the company is showing a loss from operations from 2011 and on. But GAAP statements do not tell the full story. The growth in SaaS revenue is not high enough to replace the quickly declining revenue of the old ""kiosk"" model. In addition, SaaS revenue comes in the form of multi-year subscriptions, in contrast to a full payment upfront in the old ""kiosk"" model.The company is doing a service to investors by publishing quarterly an ""Economic Income statement"", which is based on non-GAAP bookings. A reminder on what bookings is - bookings reflect revenues and changes to deferred revenues, or ""new business coming at the door"". The bookings trend shows that the business is growing, in part, thanks to the acquisitions that were made and recognized in 2013 and 2014. Bookings have grown from $278M in FY'13 to $309M in FY'14. Adjusted EBITDA which is based on bookings actually declined from 2013 to 2014, mainly because of excess sales and marketing expenditure. Critics are saying that bookings are growing because of the large investments in sales and marketing. If the company were to reduce its marketing spend, bookings will decline. That is probably generally true in the consumer space, but less so in the Enterprise and Education segment. In the E&E segment, the churn rate is expected to be lower. Once an organization decides on a vendor, the duration of the engagement should be longer than that of a consumer.Where is Rosetta Stone Headed?After faltering and showing modest success in 2013 and 2014, Rosetta pivoted again and presented a revised strategy in March 2015. It will now focus even more on the Enterprise and Education segment, which is comprised from its language courses offerings and its Lexia literacy products. It will continue making investments in products and in sales and marketing that goes into this segment. In consumer, it will pull out from most of it, cutting investments and reducing 15% of its global workforce. It will still have a consumer offering to serious learners, those who are willing to pay handsomely, and only where it complements E&E. By this, Rosetta admits that it can't and doesn't want to compete with free apps and services, such as Duolingo. It addresses only the very high end of the market, which is less sensitive to costs. The third part of the strategy is extreme cost-cutting. Rosetta acknowledges that its cost structure is too high. In 2014, operating expense was about $250M compared to bookings of $300M. Rosetta plans to cut $50M annually, starting in 2015, mainly by reducing its workforce and cutting the sales and marketing expense of its non core units. The proceeds will be used for investments in E&E products. Rosetta's revised strategy can be summarized by the following three pillars:Once again, to the dismay of its shareholders, Rosetta revised its guidance. For E&E, it expects bookings to grow at accelerated rates (from $113M in 2014), and operating margins to reach double-digit by 2017. In Consumer, bookings are expected decline from $196M in 2014 to $110-130M in 2015, and settle on $50-75M in the following years. A 10% EBITDA margin is expected by 2017.In previous quarters, the company's guidance was way off, and the company disappointed with reduced guidance, quarter after quarter. Let's see how projections have changed across the previous two years.In May 2013, the company projected 2013 bookings to be $280-290 million and upped that number to $287-298 million after the purchase of Lexia in July. The company revised down bookings to $270-280 million in November 2013. The actual 2013 figure was $278 million and $16 million in adjusted EBITDA. For 2014, the company projected above $315 million in bookings and above $18 million in adjusted EBITDA. It recently reported $309 million in bookings and a mere $12.2 million in adjusted EBITDA. The earnings announcement from March 2015 has sent the shares down 20% from about $10 to less than $8 a share. The largest blow, though, is the change in long-term bookings projections. In 2013, the company believed it could reach bookings of $400M by 2015 and a 10-13% adjusted EBITDA margin. That target was pushed to 2016 in February 2014. The $400M figure was based on the assumption that the company invests both in Enterprise and Education, and in consumer, working North America and rest-of-world. Recently, in March 2015, came the final blow. With a strategic pivot to focus on Enterprise and Education, downsizing sales and marketing spend and pulling out from the consumer business, the long-term target of $400M bookings was dropped. The only one making long-term projections now, or better call it ""hopes"", is David Nierenberg who wished the company would turn $250M bookings by 2017 with a 10-15% EBITDA margin.The largest investor in the company's shares is Ariel Investments which owns 18% of the shares yet it is only 0.5% of the company's total holdings. The second largest investor is Osmium Partners, a California based hedge fund, led by John Lewis, an activist value investor. Osmium recently reduced their position by about a tenth, but they still hold 9.5% of the shares, which is one of their largest positions. David Nierenberg of D3 funds owns 7% of the shares. Rosetta accounts for 20% of his 13F portfolio, one of his largest positions indeed. Nierenberg turned activist in 2014, and filed a 13D disclosure with the SEC.I absolutely love it when David Nierenberg participates in the Q&A session of the conference calls to make his statements, rather than to ask questions. In the most recent one, he said the following thing:Nierenberg is still on board this ship. He had put the past in the past. Even with the new reduced outlook, the company is an attractive holding to him, and to me. On March '15 he filed another 13D saying:Two weeks later, CEO Stephen Swad resigned, and John Hass, who is affiliated with Osmium Partners, took the helm as interim CEO. It's not unreasonable that Nierenberg and Lewis are well coordinated on their plans for Rosetta.ValuationSaaS companies trade at an average of 6.7x EV/sales multiples compared to Rosetta modest 0.4x. To attempt in assessing Rosetta's value, let's consider the following scenarios for 2017:Taking Nierenberg's wishes made during the Q4 conference call as my best-case scenario, adjusted EBITDA in 2017 may reach $33.75. Assuming a $40M cash level and reasonable yet somewhat high EV/EBITDA multiples of 16-20x, the company may trade north of $24.5 a share. That's more than a triple from today's price of $7.5.Even with more conservative assumptions for my base scenario which are based on the company's low end projections, we reach prices of $14 and up, about 2x today's prices.But what if consumer booking goes south to $50M annually, and E&E bookings don't grow much, and the company has spent all of its cash in unproductive capex? Even in this case, which I believe is unlikely, the company's value will probably exceed today's price. The stock is hated, and the selling pressure following the recent earnings miss resulted in more than a 20% drop in price. The stock may be reaching a point of capitulation, where even its most devoted advocates among shareholders are getting tired of being disappointed, and are dumping the name. I believe that the downside is rather limited at current prices. Mohnish Parbrai's meme ""Heads I win; Tails I don't lose much"" is very relevant in this situation.SummaryInvesting in Rosetta Stone requires putting your ego aside, and believing that its assets are valuable, and that its business model is finally viable following the recent pivot. It requires taking a leap of faith in the management team and the newly appointed CEO. The price is right. Modest success will result in excess returns, and there's not much downside from here. Put the past in the past, be patient, and you may be rewarded handsomely. I'm long RST.In a personal note, I recently started experimenting with making investment webcasts. For me, it is a cool new way to organize my thoughts and share my investment ideas. My recent 30-min Youtube webcast on Rosetta Stone is available here. I am hoping to earn your feedback. Help me understand how to make it better."
2813165,61761,2015-01-12T08:25:35-05:00,"On an annualized basis, YTD FY 2014 E&E bookings have actually declined versus last year.
        Sell-side estimates for FY 2015 E&E revenue are much too high.
        RST may be cutting uneconomical multi-year deals to boost bookings in the short term at the expense of future performance.
        Competitors, such as Duolingo, have begun to take share in the E&E space.
        RST remains an excellent short opportunity.","Many Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) longs feel that the Company's Enterprise & Education (E&E) segment will be a significant growth driver for the business going forward. For the first nine months of FY 2014, the Company's E&E bookings grew by 7.4% y-o-y (pro forma for Lexia & Tell Me More acquisitions). This growth in bookings has been perceived by investors as a strong sign that the E&E business is accelerating. In reality, a deeper analysis of the E&E segment results reveals that this business segment is actually showing signs of deterioration. In my initial article on RST, I argued that the performance of the Company's E&E business has been artificially boosted by the Company's conversion to multi-year contracts. In this article, I will provide a more detailed analysis of the recent bookings trend in the E&E business. From this analysis, I will show the degree to which the E&E bookings growth has been inflated by the conversion to multi-year contracts. In addition to this, I will also demonstrate how research analyst estimates for E&E revenue in FY 2015 are significantly overstated. Finally, to finish the article, I will discuss the potentially negative implications of the Company's shift to focusing on multi-year contracts.Annualized Bookings Trend Reveals Minimal Growth in E&E SegmentI have provided below a comparison of the E&E segment's YTD FY 2014 bookings results versus last year.As shown in the figure above, YTD E&E bookings have grown by 7.4% versus last year. This growth was primarily driven by strong growth in Lexia bookings, as well as a turnaround in Language bookings in Q2 and Q3. On the surface, the recent E&E bookings trend appears to be encouraging. In reality, the recent growth in E&E bookings is not as strong as it appears. In particular, Language bookings have been greatly aided by an increased focus on signing single-year versus multi-year contracts. On an annualized basis, YTD Language bookings have actually declined relative to last year. For example, in Q2 2014, RST signed a 5-year Language contract worth a total of $3mm. On an annualized basis, this contract is worth $600K a year. Thus, Q2 2014 Language bookings were inflated by $2.4mm due to this contract. The figure below provides a comparison of Q2'13 and Q2'14 Language bookings after properly adjusting for the $3mm multi-year contract:In Q2 2014, RST reported Q2 2014 Language bookings growth of 1.8% y-o-y. However, as shown above, Q2 2014 Language bookings actually declined by 8.9% y-o-y after annualizing the value of the $3mm contract. The decline in annualized Language bookings in Q2 2014 continued into Q3 2014. In Q3 2014, the Company signed an even higher proportion of multi-year Language contracts. This is reflected in the abnormally large increase in RST's long-term deferred revenue liability from Q2'14 to Q3'14:Long-term deferred revenue increased by $9.8mm from Q2'14 to Q3'14. This is more than twice the increase in long-term deferred revenue from Q1'14 to Q2'14. This strongly implies that more than twice the amount of multi-year Language contracts were signed in Q3'14 compared to Q2'14. Thus, I have assumed that the Company signed 5-year contracts in Q3'14 worth a total of at least $6mm. Based on this assumption, I have provided a comparison of Q3'13 and Q3'14 Language bookings after adjusting for multi-year contracts:In Q3'14, RST reported Language bookings growth of 5.5% y-o-y. However, similar to Q2'14, annualized Q3'14 Language bookings have actually declined after adjusting for multi-year contracts. Annualized Q3'14 Language bookings of $24.0mm represents a 12.1% decline y-o-y. Thus, based on this analysis, the decline in Language bookings has accelerated in Q3'14.At the beginning of this section, I provided a comparison of YTD FY 2014 E&E bookings versus last year. Once again, I have provided this same comparison below. This time, however, I have replaced actual Language bookings with my estimate for annualized Language bookings:The figure provided above ties everything together. After adjusting for multi-year contracts, YTD annualized Language bookings have declined by 9.1% y-o-y. Due to the decline in annualized Language bookings, total E&E bookings have actually decreased by 1.8% y-o-y! The Language business represents ~80% of E&E revenues, so the deterioration in annualized Language bookings has greatly depressed overall E&E growth. While the recent growth in the Lexia business is certainly a positive, Lexia currently represents just 20% of E&E revenue and less than 10% of RST's total revenue. Thus, growth in Lexia bookings has a relatively small impact on total bookings. Overall, the fact that annualized E&E bookings are actually declining rather increasing should be of great concern for longs. Also concerning for longs is the fact that Lexia is the only business demonstrating positive growth. The other 90%+ of RST's business is declining at a rapid pace (e.g. Consumer, Language).Sell-Side Research Estimates Are Way Off The MarkIn addition to investors, it appears that sell-side research analysts have also been fooled by RST's artificially inflated E&E bookings growth in FY 2014. For example, provided below is a summary of PiperJaffray's current estimates for FY 2014 and FY 2015 E&E revenue:As I demonstrated in the prior section, total E&E bookings have actually declined after properly adjusting for multi-year contracts. Based on this fact, it is clear to see that PiperJaffray's FY 2015 revenue growth estimate of 46.2% is way too aggressive. It should be noted that FY 2014 revenue has been artificially depressed due to the acquisition-related write-down of Lexia and Tell Me More's deferred revenue balance. After adding back the lost revenue due to the deferred revenue write-downs, FY 2014 revenue is estimated to be ~$100mm. However, even after this add-back to FY 2014 revenue, PiperJaffray's FY 2015 revenue estimate still appears much too high. $122mm of E&E revenue in FY 2015 represents a 22% increase over $100mm of E&E revenue in FY 2014. Given the fact that E&E bookings have declined this year on an annualized basis, achieving 22% E&E revenue growth in FY 2015 appears highly unlikely. In fact, given the current negative growth in annualized bookings, E&E revenue is likely to decline in FY 2015.Signing Multi-Year Contracts Could Have Negative Long-Term ImplicationsIn addition to inflating the E&E bookings results, the Company's increased focus on signing multi-year contracts could have negative long-term implications for the E&E business. The reason is, in order to get enterprises and schools to commit to multi-year deals, it is likely that RST had to offer substantial discounts. For example, as mentioned previously, RST signed a 5-year K-12 Language contract in Q2 2014. Schools typically operate on an annual budget which constantly changes. Thus, it is highly likely that a school would be unwilling to commit to a lengthy 5-year contract without substantial price concessions. Similarly, it is likely that enterprise clients would also require a meaningful discount in order to commit to a multi-year contract. The turnover of a typical company's workforce is simply not high enough to justify spending the same amount on RST's products year after year. The return on investment for using RST's services diminishes significantly over time after the majority of the workforce has been trained in the first year. For these reasons, I believe that RST may be signing uneconomical multi-year deals. Cutting uneconomical multi-year deals will boost bookings in the short-term but significantly depress revenue growth and profitability over the long-term. Thus, over time, I believe that RST's focus on signing multi-year contracts will further deteriorate the Company's financial performance.So why would Rosetta Stone cut uneconomical deals at this time? I believe that competitive pressures are beginning to affect the E&E business in the same manner as the Consumer business. Some schools are beginning to adopt Duolingo as a supplementary tool for language learning. For example, my sister currently works at AltSchool which is a private school system in San Francisco. Their teachers all use Duolingo as a teaching tool rather than Rosetta Stone due to the superior efficacy and cost. Although this is just one example, the fact that an elite school system that is very forward-thinking would rather use Duolingo than Rosetta Stone speaks volumes. Thus, I believe that Duolingo will eventually take more share in the E&E market.ConclusionRST's conversion from single-year to multi-year contracts has fooled both investors and sell-side research analysts. As I demonstrated in this article, after properly adjusting for multi-year contracts, annualized E&E bookings have actually declined versus last year. FY 2015 estimates for the E&E business are much too high, and it is likely that the Company will miss analyst targets by a meaningful amount. It also appears that RST may be cutting uneconomical multi-year deals which boost E&E bookings in the short-term but depress revenue growth and profitability over the long-term. Finally, it appears that competitors, like Duolingo, are beginning to take share in the E&E business. Given that many investors have hinged their hopes on RST's E&E business, the points I have raised in this article should be of great concern. Despite the recent decline in share price, I believe RST remains an excellent short opportunity."
3675886,23806,2015-11-12T10:55:00-05:00,"Lexia Learning's literacy software is growing much faster than we anticipated; subscription and service revenue was 72% of the revenue mix in the quarter.Cost-cutting initiatives paying off as adjusted EBITDA was negative $1.6 million vs. negative $9.1 million in prior year's quarter; the company identified an additional $15 million in cost reductions.Recent certification by the University of California is a clear indication of the value of RST's product, particularly compared to free apps.New single platform for E&E language business expected to be beta-tested in the fourth quarter and rolled out to corporate market in 2016; recently combined K-12 Language and Literacy divisions already have bookings of $60 million.Fit Brains continues to grow and is being managed for NPV without burning cash; market leader Lumosity expected to go public soon and should provide value transparency to Fit Brains.","Rosetta Stone's (NYSE:RST) third-quarter report strengthened our view that the company continues to gain momentum toward building a long-term sustainable business model leveraging a unique brand with sizable market opportunities in the language and literacy digital marketplaces.Lexia is turning out to be a home-run acquisition. Government and philanthropic money is pouring into early education digital learning and growing the marketplace. The efficacy of Core 5 reading software is increasingly being recognized by education decision-makers as a high-quality product that materially helps all children, particularly at-risk ones, acquire reading skills. In fact, we've been unable to source negative product views from educators and/or parents. Lexia's RAPID Assessment product is addressing the adjacent diagnostic market to provide actionable data for instructional planning. We do not expect 70% y/y growth to continue, but 35% appears to be sustainable for the foreseeable future. On the second-quarter conference call, management highlighted its expectation that in five years Lexia will be a $100 million annual bookings business with over 90% renewal rates and strong margins. In the third quarter, albeit one quarter later, this goal is now being seen as ""four to five years"" away. We can surmise that Lexia is running ahead of management's expectations.The current Credit Suisse SaaS industry index trades at roughly 4.5x revenue. If management turns out to be correct in its presumed growth rates, 3x revenue (a SaaS multiple two-thirds of current industry multiples), discounted back conservatively at 15% per year, represents a present value of roughly $160 million. This number itself represents a 30% premium to the company’s current enterprise value using management's year-end cash balance of mid-$40 million. Thus, in this analysis, E&E Language, Consumer Language and Fit Brains are free to investors at the current price.The company continues to work with Al Angrisani, noted business rationalizer, on appropriately allocating capital to its best use. The company reported that it has identified an additional $15 million in cost savings, which are expected to be ""non-revenue impacting."" Targeted savings from R&D, G&A and S&M will allow this capital to be reinvested in high-growth, high-return opportunities.RST's initiative to right size its consumer business, announced early 2015, is taking hold as shown by the segment's margin contribution. Consumer average selling price (ASP) is stable above $200. The days of $170 ASP seen in the fourth quarter of 2014 appear to be over. The difference between free-app language candidates and serious language learners was highlighted by the company's recent announcement involving the University of California. To wit, ""School districts now have the option of leveraging Rosetta Stone Spanish I and II as a for-credit alternative, enabling students to complete the two year language requirement for college admission using Rosetta Stone at school, home or on their personal mobile device."" In our view, this is a clear indication of the value of RST's product, particularly when compared to free apps.The E & E language business continues to disappoint on the top line. Management indicates that this is primarily the result of not having the ongoing assessment and initial placement tools increasingly required by these buyers. The new single platform (segueing from supporting three different ones currently), which includes strong assessment and placement tools, is expected to be beta-tested in the fourth quarter and rolled out to the corporate market in 2016. The marketplace is large and growing so the sooner the better. According to a British Council article published in May 2014, ""Number of English Language Learners Keeps Growing,"" currently over 1 billion people are learning English worldwide and this will double in five years. RST recently combined K-12 Language and Literacy into one Language Arts division under the leadership of Lexia President Nick Gaehde; combined bookings now $60 million. We believe this makes great sense given Mr. Gaehde's success in penetrating the K-12 literacy marketplace while attaining 90% plus renewal rates. Thus, E&E language should be a growing business; only time will tell if management can correct the course.Fit Brains (FB) continues to grow and is being managed for NPV without burning cash. We believe market leader Lumosity will go public before long and provide value transparency to the FB business. Revenues have doubled since RST made this early 2014 acquisition for $12 million, and the company believes its value is growing.We believe naming John Hass as the new Chairman upon selecting a permanent CEO is an excellent choice by the board. Investors may not be aware that Mr. Hass has a significant individual investment in RST through his personal investment in 10% RST owner Osmium Partners, in addition to the options he was awarded upon joining the board (strike price at roughly $7.25/share). We believe the company is confident that it can grow its overall value in the marketplace and that any strategic decision to sell itself (in whole or in pieces) must occur at a substantially higher price than today’s market level. We continue to encourage the board to meet with all interested parties.We view RST as a well-capitalized special situation with multiple shots on goal to reward investors. The company's seriousness about simplifying its business, introducing the right end-market products and managing for profitability with a laser focus on expenses bodes well for investors in light of RST's current price. To wit, investors are paying very little for the optionality of a successful business turnaround. Certain sell-side analysts, while complimenting the company's initiatives and successes, remain on the sidelines despite noting they see little downside investing at current levels. In our opinion, it's precisely because we see little downside, coupled with meaningful upside, that we're invested in RST. Moreover, we believe the current enterprise value is substantially below current liquidation value. Finally, of note, over 50% of RST's shares are firmly in the hands of long-term, deep-value oriented investors."
2791385,41741,2015-01-01T17:54:19-05:00,"Rosetta's business has been under attack from various competitors.The stock has been pressured further by management missteps.But with two activists involved, there's a plan in place for righting this sinking ship.","Educational software company Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) has been struggling for a while. The stock is down 20% in 2014 and nearly 50% over the last five years. There's clearly something in need of repair.There are a lot of problems, including questionable management decisions and financial reporting. As Jay Yoon noted in a recent Seeking Alpha PRO article:And as Ian Bezek argued in another Seeking Alpha PRO piece, investors hoping for a turnaround in Rosetta's business shouldn't expect one anytime soon:Enter two activist hedge funds that think they have the answer. Between the two of them, John Lewis' Osmium Partners and David Nierenberg's Nierenberg Investment Management, they own nearly 18%. Osmium joined Nierenberg in August, and the two have similar goals. Although the $130mm Osmium Partners fund is small, Rosetta is Osmium's largest position and it owns nearly 10% of the company.Nierenberg went active back in June. At the time, it said Rosetta needed to narrow its focus and strategy. The company's big appetite for doing everything for every consumer has been impairing free cash flow generation.The hedge fund singled out Rosetta's North American Consumer business as having too many initiatives going on in terms of products, pricing and distribution. It's asking Rosetta to focus on just the one thing it can do to maximize free cash flow. Nierenberg has said ""We fear that Rosetta's 'initiative overload' may be causing sub-optimal execution and impairing free cash flow.""Narrowing The GoalsBoth funds have pointed out Rosetta's excessive marketing, research and development spending. The company's historically had an affinity for expensively produced videos and heavy cable and radio advertising. Nierenberg referred to this type of marketing as ""low-calorie"" expenditures, and commended the company for cutting back. However, it's clear that both funds think spending can decrease more.Osmium has also taken a bigger-picture view and asked the company to articulate a long-term strategy for doubling free cash flow margins and returning to growth. This starts with improved financial reporting and providing clear disclosures and appropriate business metrics.As well, both funds want Rosetta to clean up its balance sheet and focus its business by holding off on acquisitions until it has developed a new strategy. Recent acquisitions of companies such as Vivity, Tell Me More and LiveMocha have drained cash off the balance sheet and added several layers of complexity to the business. The best bet is to use its cash to fund a buyback program.The StrugglesOutside of the questionable management decisions, Rosetta might be struggling a little from competition. Its first-mover advantage is gone. Rosetta is now one of many language and educational tools available to consumers, many of which are free.And despite its heavy marketing spending, Rosetta has seen its revenue decline by 2% so far in 2014. Sales of the core Rosetta Stone CD-ROM have been the biggest sufferer.The idea is that Rosetta's recent acquisitions have expanded and diversified its business, but it's been buying the wrong companies. LingoLive founder Tyler Muse blasted the LiveMocha acquisition, saying it didn't provide the online credibility that Rosetta needs, and that it should have acquired a company that already had its own mobile app.Where Do We Go From Here?Rosetta's board is useless; it needs to be bigger and more diverse. More specifically, Rosetta needs more digital and customer experience members. A proxy battle on the board looks to be almost a certainty at this point. Nierenberg suggested the board needs to be enlarged from its current six members, and put forward several of its own candidates.The question is will the funds' strategic initiatives rescue Rosetta, or has the company already become a dinosaur in the online learning tools business? The short interest at Rosetta is less than 8%, it's generating $260mm sales on a $207mm market cap, has virtually no debt and trades at 4.2x cash.In the end, with 18% ownership of the company and a good track record with these types of battles (Osmium just recently took control of the board at Spark Networks), it's tough to bet against the funds. The easy short money appears to have been made in Rosetta."
2783635,22201,2014-12-30T07:00:00-05:00,"I described in great detail in 2011 why Rosetta Stone was a compelling short.Since then, the company has gone on an acquisition binge and changed some accounting measures as part of its turnaround strategy.These developments have attracted value investors, shoring up Rosetta Stone's shares.The core business continues to melt away, and the new developments fail to change the company's downward trajectory.Shares remain a great short opportunity.","I've long held that Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) was an overvalued stock. I first covered the company when its shares traded at $16 in early 2011. I published a series of three articles explaining problems with the company's core business and showing why its ""turnaround"" strategy would fail. Since then, the stock market has nearly doubled, while Rosetta Stone shares are down sharply. Does Rosetta Stone retain the characteristics of a good short three years later?For me, the answer is most definitely yes. Despite most of the company's management team leaving, numerous new acquisitions, and three years of ""transition,"" Rosetta Stone is still a struggling company whose revenues continue to shrink as its core product continues its inexorable and terminal decline into irrelevancy. Once you make proper adjustments to the company's newly re-calculated ""adjusted EBITDA,"" as fellow SA contributor Jay Yoon did in his excellent article Rosetta Stone: Misleading Financials Mask Continued Deterioration In Business last week, you'll see the company continues to lose vast sums of money.When I first wrote about Rosetta Stone, it was an overvalued company with a strong balance sheet, thus limiting the potential decline in the stock. This situation has totally changed; the company now has negative tangible book value. As such, the company has no inherent asset value any longer. The old bull thesis was that the company's strong cash position would backstop the company's shares as the ""transition"" ensued.This previous bull thesis is now incontrovertibly dead. Rosetta Stone's only value now comes from its ongoing operations - which lose more and more money on stagnant or lower revenues with every passing year. Negative book value, shrinking ongoing operations and ever-widening losses: Do the math, if nothing changes, Rosetta Stone shares may well end up utterly worthless. The company on October 28th arranged a new line of credit, foreshadowing a future in which they may become a net debtor. A negative tangible book value company plus money-losing operations on falling revenue adds up to very little in terms of shareholder value.Rosetta Stone has frittered away its cash with massive advertising budgets to try to stem the decline of its core product, in addition to questionable new product launches and a dubious stream of marginally-related acquisitions.While documenting the entirety of Rosetta Stone's decline over the past few years is outside the scope of this article - we are more interested in the future after all - this bit from the company's latest 10-K sums things pretty well: ""In late 2012 and the first half of 2013 we restructured our product team including hiring a new Chief Product Officer (…) Our Chief Product Officer resigned in December 2013.""Rosetta Stone, in the midst of a three years and counting transition plan, hires a Chief Product Officer - a most important position for a company in restructuring - who then quits within a year. A most interesting of developments, it would seem. As I said in 2011 and am happy to restate, the company's core product doesn't offer anything unique or better than the veritable ocean of language-learning alternatives, and the company's new acquisitions, particularly as judged by the disastrous LiveMocha purchase, are no improvement.Revenues: Going NowhereIn 2009, during the height of the great financial crisis, Rosetta Stone generated $252 million in revenues. Four years later, in a much better economy, after numerous new product launches, several acquisitions and a seemingly endless stream of TV advertisements later, Rosetta Stone generated $265 million in revenue for full-year 2013. Four percent growth over four years. Think about that.Even worse, Rosetta Stone generated $268 million in 2011 revenues; as such, revenue has fallen $3 million between 2011 and 2013. There's simply no growth here. Don't look for it in margins either. Back in 2009, during the economic crisis, Rosetta Stone produced $219 million in gross profit. In 2013, it produced, wait for it, $219 million in gross profit. Gross profit grew all of $87,000 over the course of the past four years.Costs: Surging HigherGoing from bad to worse, gross profit only accounts for direct cost of revenue. Once you include sales and marketing, things look downright terrible. Consider, in 2009, Rosetta Stone spent $115 million on sales and marketing. This surged 20% to $146 million in 2013. To generate that extra $12 million in revenue and $87,000 in gross profit over the past four years, Rosetta Stone spent an extra $31 million in advertising! What a great investment, spend $31 million more on marketing to get back $12 million in revenue and merely $87,000 in gross profit.Adding it all up, Rosetta Stone transformed from a reasonably profitable company in 2009 - dark economic times - into one that produces nothing but red nowadays despite the much improved economy. The company went from earning a respectable $20 million from operations in 2009 to a smaller profit in 2010, a huge loss ($28M) in 2011, a smaller loss ($5M) in 2012 as the company cut marketing, and then a larger loss ($18M) in 2013 as revenues sank sharply following the previous year's marketing cutbacks.Factoring out the swings in EPS income due to widely variable tax expense, the company now loses roughly $20M, or $1/share per year. The market was willing to forgive this, to a large degree, due to the company's formerly large cash position. However what once exceeded $5/share back in 2011 has fallen to just above $2/share now. The company's strong balance sheet has eroded and the company now has negative tangible book value; its physical assets are worth less than its accrued liabilities.The Present Is Dark. How About The Future?As I noted in the intro, it's possible to see a case for Rosetta Stone shares being nearly worthless. The company's liabilities exceed its real assets. So the company's value entirely rides on its operations, which have been loss-making for four years running and which are experiencing falling revenues. If the status quo is maintained, shares are bound to end up, like manufactured CD software, in the discount clearance bin.Obviously there are two sides to every trade, and Rosetta Stone's current quotation of $10/share is still well north of what you'd expect merely from looking at its balance sheet and its business prospects as based on the last few year's results. This is based on the idea that Rosetta Stone is now effectively operating two businesses. One of these is a rapidly growing online subscription-as-a-service (SAAS) model while the other is the declining traditional sale of disc-based software to consumer model.The bulls claim that the company's growing online revenues should garner a premium valuation from the market. In conjunction, the company's acquisitions continue to broaden the company's online product lines and give the company broader runway to grow its online and mobile business.Refer to my previous articles to see why I disagree with most of this. I already explained three years ago why moving the core product online wouldn't work - and it hasn't - costs are rising and revenues from the core segment are stagnant. Sure they derive more of their revenue from online instead of printed disc, but it's at lower margins due to the higher costs of servicing online subscribers which has done little for the company's overall profitability. This has replaced higher margin revenue with lower-margin revenue, rather than unlocking some new revenue stream. In this article, I focus more on the acquisitions, as they are the new thing as Rosetta Stone since I last covered the company in depth.The Acquisitions: The Sum Is No Greater Than The PartsWhat happens when you combine a bunch of struggling disjointed businesses with few relational synergies and hand them to a management team in upheaval? According to the Rosetta Stone bulls, you get a promising SaaS operation that should be valued at many times sales. From my vantage point, you get a discordant bunch of struggling disjointed businesses lacking operational synergies that were of little value prior to purchase and remain of little value under new management.I will concentrate my analysis on LiveMocha, as my field of expertise is language-learning and I have familiarity using LiveMocha's site. I'm less intimately familiar with the other sub-sectors Rosetta Stone has delved into. Before moving to discuss LiveMocha, I'd mention in passing that Rosetta Stone purchased a ""brain fitness"" company, Vivity.Vivity is ""adjacent"" to Rosetta Stone's core language-learning segment, or at least the company thinks so. Check out the business synergy that the company envisions for the two segments. Rosetta Stone's 10-K states:You read that correctly, Vivity's brain fitness and Rosetta Stone's core language learning segments are connected because Vivity has translated its apps into multiple languages. By that logic, Rosetta Stone could acquire any app in any segment for literally any purpose, and as long as the app is available in more than one language, it's, voila, a related offering! The mind boggles.I'd also note that ""brain fitness"" itself seems a fairly unproven business segment, to state it generously. I know little about this segment, and in reading through the company's filings for more information, the resulting discovery was less than reassuring. Discussing Vivity's Fit Brains product, we read from Rosetta Stone's 10-k:In other words, customers don't know they need this product, and with good reason, as it's seemingly unclear whether the underlying product's methodology is based on sound science. Should it not be, well, that'd be embarrassing. (On a side note, when I was editing this article, my spell-checker said that ""neuroscience"" isn't a word and suggested I replace it with ""pseudoscience."")Comparing this (along with Rosetta Stone's over-hyped language products) to other SaaS offerings, as the Rosetta Stone bulls do, is generous. The usefulness of, say, Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) software is obvious. It's unclear whether this so-called brain fitness product serves any quantifiable function at all.LiveMocha: Buying Nothing For SomethingMoving back into language learning, an area in which my expertise lies, we can now move on to discussing the LiveMocha acquisition. I remember the day the deal was announced, I thought to myself, wow, Rosetta Stone is a far better short than I realized. Nothing has changed since then to alter my initial perception. To anyone with cursory knowledge of the online language learning space, it was clear this acquisition was a dud from the get-go.Let's consider an analogy. Imagine an investor debating the pros and cons of investing in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in 2013; which has better growth prospects, can monetize mobile better, has a stickier user base. After pondering through all the possibilities and agonizing for several restless weeks, the investor foregoes both Facebook and Twitter and instead buys Myspace.Such was Rosetta Stone's acquisition of LiveMocha. Faced with an online space full of vibrant new upstarts such as Duolingo, LingQ, iTalki, and so on, Rosetta Stone went out and bought a company with outdated technology and an atrophying user base. It gets worse, according to online language learning entrepreneur Tyler Muse, LiveMocha's own venture capital backers thought the company had failed. Any sort of exit, even one at half its prior valuation was a success given the circumstances. For the venture founders, realizing they'd taken a chance and it hadn't panned out, they were glad to take whatever money they could from Rosetta Stone and say goodbye to a business whose valuation was rapidly heading to zero.I highly recommend that you read Muse's full article to realize just how questionable the acquisition was. To summarize:By buying LiveMocha, Rosetta Stone doubled down on the bet it had already made with its Sharedtalk.com which offered a similar function of connecting language learners. Sharedtalk was a good product that never moved the needle for Rosetta Stone. Unsurprisingly, both Sharedtalk and LiveMocha have seen traffic declines, as Muse had foreseen, Rosetta Stone is offering a service most language learners simply aren't looking for. LiveMocha's traffic post-acquisition has gone off a cliff, showing that the acquisition has been a near-total loss.You might be saying, Ian, why are you going on about LiveMocha, which despite being a totally pointless acquisition with no likely terminal value, ended up only wasting $8.5 million of cash? Given the company's long-record of prodigious losses, what's $8.5 million of burnt cash in the bigger scheme of things?The bigger issue is that this acquisition shows the cluelessness of the management team toward their industry. The company's former leader Tom Adams was a multilingual dynamic personality who had at least some read on what language learners wanted. The current management team doesn't have that language learning experience and it shows. Current Rosetta Stone CEO Stephen Swad's past experience as CFO was at Fannie Mae and AOL Time Warner, indicating no experience with foreign languages, along with an uncanny ability for turning up at imploding companies. Anyone who has a passion for foreign languages simply shouldn't have considering buying LiveMocha, full stop.Looking across Rosetta Stone's acquisitions in recent years, you have Lexia which targets the children's reading market, Vivity and its ""brain fitness"" segment, LiveMocha, the redundant and now nearly moribund language community website, and Tell Me More, another language learning DVD-Rom product with terrible reviews - which is strikingly similar to Rosetta Stone's flagship core product. We'll give them points for sticking to their primary business with the Tell Me More buy anyways.There's no clear cohesive strategy, it seems they're just buying stuff willy nilly with the formerly sizable cash pile and hoping something works. Add it up and you have a company that's blown through more than $50 million of cash over the past few years while revenues have declined! Just imagine if you'd told shareholders in 2011 that the company would make four sizable acquisitions and revenues would be lower now than back then despite all the new purchases. There'd have been a mutiny.As fellow SA contributor Jay Yoon's excellent article demonstrates, Rosetta Stone is juicing short-term numbers by using a newly-defined version of its old adjusted EBITDA metric (re-adjusted EBITDA, anyone?) that changes the company's FY '14 results from negative $4 million to positive $18 million. This swing in adjusted EBITDA based on a new accounting method for deferred revenue bookings causes the company's results to look more promising than they otherwise would have had the company stayed with its prior accounting methodology.Rosetta Stone is no stranger to this sort of accounting tactic. Even Motley Fool, a long-term booster of Rosetta Stone, couldn't stomach a previous attempt to exclude the costs of a new product launch from its adjusted net income:Another time, the company also made an adjustment to year-over-year revenue to exclude the sales of a discontinued product segment while not backing out new revenue from an acquired segment. If you're going to do apples-to-apples comparisons, normally you'd either leave them both in or take them both out. But Rosetta Stone has a clever accounting department, as Yoon's article reminds us with the latest ""adjusted EBITDA"" incident.This re-adjustment of adjusted EBITDA to produce a flashier number, in combination with the bull camp's efforts to focus attention on the recurring online revenue segment, has attracted more than a few value investors to Rosetta Stone's shares. The decline in Rosetta Stone's core language learning product has been successfully veiled, but beneath the surface, the termites keep hollowing out what remains of the company's foundation.The new version of the adjusted EBITDA metric shows Rosetta Stone generating significant reported profits, while actual EPS for FY '14 will be a loss likely exceeding $2 per share. The company had $99 million in cash as of the end of last year, and is under $50 million currently with bulls hoping to get back to merely $70 million after the seasonally strong Q4 concludes.As they say, ""cash is a fact, profit is an opinion."" The smart money says to be short Rosetta Stone.Despite the glowing ""adjusted EBITDA"" figure, at least $30 million of cash has gone out the door this year while revenues continue to stagnate and the sales and marketing budget explodes without any seeming effect on actual consumer buying behavior. Rosetta Stone is a busted turnaround story with vast downside as the company continues to squander what remains of its formerly solid balance sheet on frivolous acquisitions and ineffectual new product launches and marketing strategies."
2775165,61761,2014-12-24T05:00:00-05:00,"RST management is using questionable financial reporting practices which significantly overstate the financial performance of the business.In Q4 2013, RST changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA to a methodology which significantly inflates performance via aggressive deferred revenue add-backs.A more reasonable method for calculating EBITDA indicates that management’s FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $18mm - $22mm is overstated by at least $22mm.In addition to aggressive financial reporting, RST’s business has continued to deteriorate due to competitive pressures.RST shares are overvalued by over 40% at the current price level.","At first glance, Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) appears to be at the beginning stages of a turnaround. On October 29th, RST released its Q3 2014 earnings report which seemed to indicate positive progress at the business. During Q3 2014, total bookings increased by 16% y-o-y to $82.1mm. Although much of this growth in bookings was driven by acquisitions, Consumer bookings rebounded in the quarter and investors were encouraged by the 10% organic bookings growth reported for the Enterprise & Education (E&E) segment. The Company also reiterated the low-end of its FY 2014 full year bookings and Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $315mm to $325mm and $18mm to $22mm, respectively. In addition to the perceived positive earnings report, Osmium Partners has recently stepped up its efforts as an activist investor in the Company. Over the past couple months, the firm has increased its stake in RST to 10.67%, gained a board seat at the Company and released a four-point action plan to guide RST management in its turnaround efforts. Based on recent share price performance, investors appear to be encouraged by these developments at the Company. Since reporting Q3 2014 earnings on October 29th, RST shares have increased by ~29% from $8.19 to $10.53 per share today (as of December 19th).I believe that the recent appreciation in the Company's share price has been unwarranted. After examining RST's financial reporting methods, I discovered that the Company's performance has been greatly aided by a recent change in its methodology for calculating Adjusted EBITDA. In Q4 2013, RST changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA to a method which books future profits to current EBITDA. Due to this change, RST's reported YTD FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA results are significantly inflated relative to the Company's actual performance. By using a more reasonable method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA, I estimate that the Company's current FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $18mm to $22mm is overstated by over $22mm. The Company's aggressive financial reporting methods have helped to mask the continued deterioration of the overall business from investors and sell-side analysts. Due to the continued decline in RST's overall business and the inflated nature of the Company's historical financial performance, I believe that RST shares are overvalued by over 40% at the current share price.A Quick Lesson In Bookings, Deferred Revenue and Deferred ExpensesBefore I dive into my analysis of RST's financials, I believe it would be helpful for readers if I first explained the concept of bookings, deferred revenue and deferred expense. I believe clarifying this concept is important because I will be referring to it throughout the article.Bookings is simply the amount of contracts that RST signs in a given year. Bookings are either recorded immediately as revenue or recognized over time. Revenue that is not immediately recognized is referred to as deferred revenue.When RST signs a subscription-based contract, they typically receive cash upfront before the actual service is delivered. Thus, a deferred revenue liability is created on the balance sheet and amortized over time as revenue. For example, if the Company signs a $9mm contract to be recognized over 3 years, RST would receive and recognize $9mm of cash on its balance sheet. On the liability side, the Company would then book a $9mm deferred revenue liability. The deferred revenue liability will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years as revenue in the P&L.On the expense side, when RST signs a subscription-based contract, it also pays sales commission to its sales team. This cash is paid upfront and then the expense is amortized over the life of the contract. For example, if the Company signs a $9mm contract for 3 years, they might pay out $3mm of cash in sales commission upfront. Thus, the Company would deduct $3mm from the balance sheet. At the same time, the Company would recognize a $3mm deferred sales commission asset on the balance sheet. This deferred sales commission asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years as a sales & marketing expense in the P&L.To provide further clarification, I have provided below a breakdown of how a $9mm contract flows through the P&L, balance sheet and cash flow statement over time:RST's New Definition of Adjusted EBITDA Has Mislead InvestorsManagement's current definition of Adjusted EBITDA is misleading and has grossly inflated the Company's FY 2014 financial results. In Q4 2013, the Company changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA from a revenue-based metric to a bookings-based metric. The Company ties Adjusted EBITDA performance to bookings growth by including an adjustment for the change in deferred revenue liability. For example, if deferred revenue increases from $90mm one quarter to $100mm in the next quarter, the Company will include a change in deferred revenue adjustment which increases Adjusted EBITDA by $10mm.In FY 2014, RST has focused on signing an increasing number of multi-year contracts. As a result, this has boosted the Company's bookings in FY 2014, and in turn, has increased its deferred revenue liability. As a result of the increase in deferred revenue liability, YTD FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA has been artificially inflated. I have included a simple illustration below which demonstrates why a greater proportion of multi-year contracts has artificially inflated Adjusted EBITDA results.The above analysis is based on a 6-year timeframe. For the first 3 years, I assume that the Company's customers only sign 1-year contracts amounting to $100mm of bookings per year. However, starting from Year 4, I assume that the Company converts 10% of its existing customers to 3-year contracts. Overall, I have assumed that the Company has remained stable and does not gain or lose any customers during the 6-year timeframe.As you can see from the analysis above, in Year 4, there is a large increase in deferred revenue due to the conversion of just a small percentage of their customers to multi-year contracts. Deferred revenue increased from $50mm in Year 3 to $70mm in Year 4. This represents a 40% increase in deferred revenue and, in turn a $20mm increase in Adjusted EBITDA. However, this increase in deferred revenue and the positive impact on Year 4 Adjusted EBITDA is misleading because the actual business performance has not changed. As you can see, revenue has remained flat at $100mm in Year 4 and remains at that level for the next two years. At the same time, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA declines $10mm in Year 5 and an additional $10mm in Year 6. Basically, the Company is giving back the artificial increase of $20mm in Adjusted EBITDA that was recognized in Year 4.The takeaway from this analysis is that RST's FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA performance has been artificially inflated due to the large increase in deferred revenue created by its focus on multi-year contracts. Due to the deferred revenue add-back, the Company is essentially cheating by pulling in revenue from future years into FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA. Another takeaway from this analysis is that Adjusted EBITDA performance in subsequent years may be pressured relative to FY 2014 results due to the ""give-back"" of the inflated deferred revenue adjustment in FY 2014 (as shown above in Year 5 and Year 6). Thus, investors should view the Company's current FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $18mm to $22mm with a high degree of skepticism. As I will discuss in the next section, based on a more reasonable and commonly accepted definition of EBITDA, FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be significantly less than management guidance.Adjusted EBITDA Performance Has Declined SubstantiallyIn Q4 2013, the Company switched its definition of Adjusted EBITDA to the current bookings-based method that I have described in the section above. Prior to this switch, the Company was actually using a definition of Adjusted EBITDA that was better representative of Company performance and was based on commonly accepted accounting principles. During its Q2 2014 earnings call, RST management was asked why it had changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA to the current method that is utilized today. It responded with the following explanation:In the quote above, management states that, due to purchase accounting requirements, the Company had to write-down the deferred revenue of Lexia and Tell Me More upon acquisition. As a result of this write-down, GAAP revenue recognized from Lexia and Tell Me More has been artificially depressed. Thus, management states that they switched to the current bookings-based definition of Adjusted EBITDA in order to compensate for revenue lost due to these acquisition write-downs.Unfortunately, management's explanation for why it changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA does not make much sense. The reason is because its prior method for calculating Adjusted EBITDA already included adjustments which added-back the exact amount of deferred revenue that was lost from the acquisition write-downs. For example, if Lexia's revenue excluding the write-down was $20mm but actual reported Lexia revenue was $10mm, RST would include an add-back of $10mm in its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The current method, on the other hand, got rid of the Lexia and Tell Me More write-down add-backs and replaced them with a more aggressive add-back based on the total change in RST's deferred revenue liability. For reasons which I outlined in the prior section, this method of adding back the total change in deferred revenue significantly inflates and misrepresents RST's Adjusted EBITDA performance. Thus, I believe that the prior method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA is a better gauge of RST's financial performance.The figure below provides a side-by-side comparison of FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA. The left side calculates Adjusted EBITDA based on the current definition. The right side is based on the old definition.As can be seen in the figure above, the amount of the add-backs to FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA is drastically different between the two definitions. Management stated that most of the deferred revenue add-back in the current definition can be attributed to the reported revenue lost from the Lexia and Tell Me More acquisition write-downs. Thus, this large discrepancy in the size of the add-backs between the two definitions makes little sense. I have provided below a table which shows the implied Lexia and Tell Me More revenue based on the add-backs in the new definition and old definition.The table above clearly illustrates that the amount of deferred revenue add-backs in the new definition is grossly inflated. Based on annualized YTD results, I estimate that FY 2014 reported revenue for Lexia and Tell Me More will be $8.3mm and $14.1mm, respectively. To compensate for the revenue lost to the acquisition write-downs, the old definition includes an add-back of $11.7mm for Lexia and $12.2mm for Tell Me More. Thus, based on the old definition, FY 2014 total combined revenue from Lexia and Tell Me More will be $46.3mm. This represents a 6.9% increase from last year. By contrast, the new definition includes a deferred revenue add-back of $52.3mm to compensate for the revenue lost to acquisition write-downs. Thus, based on the new definition, FY 2014 total combined revenue from Lexia and Tell Me More will be a whopping $74.7mm. This represents a 72.5% increase from last year! This amount of growth in Lexia and Tell Me More revenue is simply not possible based on the revenue and bookings trends this year for these businesses. The reason why the deferred revenue add-back in the new definition is so inflated is because the Company added the increase in deferred revenue of the entire business rather than just the deferred revenue lost from acquisition write-downs. This example clearly illustrates how management has grossly inflated the Company's Adjusted EBITDA results by switching to the new definition.Based on the old definition, my estimate for FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA is a loss of $4.1mm. This implies that management's guidance of $18mm to $22mm in FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA is overstated by at least $22mm! Also, this helps to explain how YTD FY 2014 net income has deteriorated significantly compared to last year while Adjusted EBITDA performance is magically improving. In fact, on an apples-to-apples basis, Adjusted EBITDA based on the old method has declined from $11.0mm in FY 2013 to a projected loss of $4.1mm in FY 2014. Overall, this does not paint a very promising picture in regards to the current financial performance of the business.Due to Competitive Pressures, RST's Business Has Continued To StruggleRST's poor financial performance is a reflection of the competitive pressures that continue to weigh down its business. The recent bullish sentiment that has caused the stock price to increase 27% since the Company's Q3 2014 earnings report is quite puzzling. For reasons which I will highlight in this section, I believe that many investors are mistaken in their belief that the recent earnings report is an indication that RST is in the beginning stages of a strong turnaround.Based on the Q3 2014 results, the Company's Consumer segment continues to struggle. Although y-o-y Consumer bookings increased by 4% in the quarter, this growth was largely driven by dramatic price cuts. The figure below from the Company Q3 2014 earnings slides shows the pricing and unit volume trend of the Consumer business:In addition to substantial price cuts, Consumer bookings growth this quarter was also aided by a large increase in sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased from $34.8mm in Q3 2013 to $43.8mm in Q3 2014. As a result of the price cuts and sales and marketing expense increase, profitability of the Consumer segment declined substantially compared to last year. The figure below, also provided in the Company's Q3 2014 earnings slides, illustrates this point:Many investors have placed a significant amount of value on the RST's E&E business. These investors believe that the 10% organic E&E bookings growth reported in Q3 2014 is an indication that growth in this segment will continue to accelerate going forward. On the surface, 10% organic bookings growth is encouraging. However, a deeper analysis reveals that much of this growth was aided by the Company's change in focus to signing multi-year contracts instead of single-year contracts. For example, long-term deferred revenue (to be recognized greater than 12 months from now) as a % of total deferred revenue increased from ~20% in Q2 2014 to ~25% in Q3 2014. Signing a greater proportion of customers to multi-year contracts today will temporarily boost E&E bookings in the short term, but long-term bookings growth will be pressured due to the upfront recognition of the entire amount of the contract. Thus, it is highly uncertain whether the recent organic growth in E&E bookings can be sustained over the long term. In fact, in RST's recent Q3 2014 10Q, the Company actually acknowledged that E&E bookings growth was largely due to signing a higher proportion of multi-year contracts:It should be mentioned that not all of the Company's recent results were negative. The Literacy segment, which is a part of the E&E business, has grown bookings in excess of 25% in FY 2014. This segment is the lone bright spot in RST's business based on the robust bookings growth. However, the segment itself is less than 10% of the overall business from a revenue perspective. Thus, although growth has been strong, the impact on the overall Company's financials is very limited at this time. This segment must show continued growth for a long time in order to compensate for the weakness in the other business segments.In summary, the Consumer segment's profitability continues to decline due to competitive pressures. The Company has significantly increased its sales & marketing expense, but this has not translated into a meaningful acceleration of topline growth. Instead, the increase in expenses has been accompanied by large price cuts which have only resulted in further financial losses. This is a strong indication that RST's services are becoming increasingly commoditized. In addition to this, it is highly questionable whether the organic bookings growth in the E&E business is sustainable over the long-term. Recent growth in the Literacy business is a positive, but this segment currently represents just a small portion of RST's overall business. Thus, there is no indication yet that a sustainable turnaround in RST's business has occurred.ValuationCurrently, research analyst valuation targets for RST are based on a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA. However, research analysts are basing their Adjusted EBITDA projections on the Company's inflated method of calculating EBITDA. As I have shown, based on a more reasonable and commonly accepted method of calculating EBITDA, FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA will most likely be negative. As a result, a valuation of RST based on a multiple of EBITDA is no longer relevant.So how should RST be valued? As I have discussed, RST's recent Q3 2014 earnings report (released on October 29th) showed a continued deterioration in the business. Thus, I believe that RST shares should, at the very least, retrace back to a valuation in-line with the recent low of $7.54 per share on October 10th. Based on the 21.3mm shares outstanding and $49.4mm of net cash, the implied enterprise value at this share price is $111.4mm. Consensus estimates for FY 2014 revenue is currently $264mm. Thus, on October 10th, RST was trading at a FY 2014 EV / Revenue valuation of 0.42x. Due to the misleading nature of the Company's financials, the true state of RST's business is unknown to investors. Given this uncertainty, combined with the continued commoditization of the Company's services and loss of credibility of management, I believe that RST shares should trade at a discount of at least 25% to the recent low. A discount of 25% results in an implied valuation of 0.32x FY 2014 EV / Revenue. Applying a 0.32x multiple to projected FY 2014 revenue of $264mm results in an implied enterprise valuation of $83.6mm. Adding net cash of $49.4mm results in an implied equity valuation of $132.9mm. Thus, assuming 21.3mm shares outstanding, I believe fair value for RST shares to be approximately $6.23 per share. This represents a 41% discount to the current share price of $10.53 as of market close on December 19th.My Interaction With Investor RelationsI would like to note that I have reached out to RST investor relations via phone and email over the past few days. As of now, I have not received a response yet regarding my concerns over its accounting methods.ConclusionFrankly, I am shocked that RST has not yet been called out for its misleading definition of Adjusted EBITDA. I believe that management has lost a significant amount of credibility due to its highly questionable financial reporting practices. Based on management guidance, investors are expecting the Company to generate Adjusted EBITDA of $18mm to $22mm in FY 2014. In reality, based on a more commonly accepted definition of EBITDA, the Company will generate an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.1mm in FY 2014. This fact alone is reason enough to sell shares. To make matters worse for investors, the Company's overall business has continued to deteriorate due to intense competitive pressures. Unless management takes dramatic action, the Company will likely continue to struggle to maintain its market share. Add it all up, and it is clear that RST is significantly overvalued at the current price level. Thus, I would recommend initiating a short position or selling shares if you are an existing RST shareholder.AppendixProvided below is a more detailed explanation of how I calculated the FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA add-backs for the deferred revenue and deferred commission write-downs of Lexia and Tell Me More.In order to calculate the Lexia and Tell Me More add-backs to FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA, I had to come up with a reasonable estimation for the following:Item #1: How much GAAP revenue will be recognized for Lexia in FY 2014?For the first nine months of FY 2014, the Company reported GAAP revenue of $6.2mm from Lexia. By annualizing this number, this implies that RST will report $8.3mm of GAAP revenue from Lexia this year.Item #2: If there was no deferred write-down, how much revenue would have been reported for Lexia in FY 2014?Provided below is Lexia's historical financials (prior to the acquisition) as presented in RST's July 24th, 2013 8K filing:As shown in the figure above, prior to the acquisition and subsequent deferred revenue write-down, Lexia was projected to generate approximately $17mm of revenue in FY 2013. Organic YTD bookings growth for Lexia this year has been in excess of 25% (32% in Q3 2014). However, it should be noted that Lexia's contracts are generally multi-year contracts, so the increase in Lexia's FY 2014 revenue from the bookings increase will be much less. Thus, I estimate that Lexia's FY 2014 revenue (assuming no write-down of deferred revenue) would have been ~$20mm.Item #3: How much GAAP revenue will be recognized for Tell Me More in FY 2014?In RST's Q3 2014 10Q, the Company stated the following:Based on this quote, the Company reported $10.6mm of GAAP revenue from Tell Me More during the first nine months of FY 2014. By annualizing this number, this implies that RST will report $14.1mm of GAAP revenue from Tell Me More this year.Item #4: If there was no deferred write-down, how much revenue would have been reported for Tell Me More in FY 2014?In RST's December 11th, 2013 press release, the following information was provided:Based on this statement, prior to the acquisition and subsequent deferred revenue write-down, Tell Me More generated ~$26mm of revenue in FY 2013. In FY 2014, Tell Me More's business has not demonstrated much growth. Thus, I estimate that Tell Me More's FY 2014 revenue (assuming no write-down of deferred revenue) would have remained flat at ~$26mm.Based on these four items, I was able to calculate the estimated deferred revenue and sales commission add-back to FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA for Lexia and Tell Me More:"
3009946,61761,2015-03-19T09:41:21-04:00,"Rosetta Stone reported poor Q4 2014 results which were below consensus analyst estimates from both a revenue and earnings perspective.
        In addition to poor Q4 results, management provided disappointing Q1 2015 and FY 2015 guidance.
        Particularly troubling for the Company is the slowdown in the E&E business in Q4 2014, as well as the projected decline in Q1 2015 E&E bookings.
        Overall, the Q4 results confirm my thesis that the Company’s conversion to multi-year contracts was artificially inflating EBITDA results and masking continued deteriorations in the business.
        Despite the large decline in share price, I remain short Rosetta Stone shares.","Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) released its Q4 2014 earnings report after market close on March 11th. The Company's results were disappointing as Q4 revenue of $79.3mm (2% y-o-y growth) was $2mm below consensus estimates, while Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7mm was ~$6mm - $10mm lower than management guidance ($18.5mm - $22.5mm). Q4 EPS of -$1.01 was also below expectations as analysts were projecting Q4 EPS of -$0.13. In addition to reporting poor Q4 results, the Company provided very weak Q1 2015 and full year FY 2015 guidance. For FY 2015, RST management guided for total E&E bookings of $122mm - $130mm (8% - 15% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA of $8mm - $12mm. This was well below analyst expectations. For example, prior to the Q4 2014 earnings report, Baird Research was projecting FY 2015 E&E bookings of $135.1mm and Adjusted EBITDA of $22.8mm. The Company's Q1 2015 guidance was even more disappointing than the full year guidance. In Q1, management expects the Company to report $17mm of E&E bookings which represents a 7% y-o-y decline. Furthermore, the Company is projecting Adjusted EBITDA of -$10mm in Q1 2015 which represents an over $3mm decline versus Q1 2014 Adjusted EBITDA of -$6.7mm. Due to the poor Q4 2014 results and disappointing guidance, RST shares declined by over 16% the day after earnings from $9.50 as of March 11th to $7.96 as of March 12th.For RST longs, the most troubling aspect regarding the Company's recent earnings report was the significant slowdown in E&E bookings. In Q4 2014, organic E&E bookings increased just 2% y-o-y compared to 10% y-o-y organic growth in Q3 2014. The slowdown in E&E bookings is projected to accelerate in Q1 2015 as management is projecting total E&E bookings to actually decline by 7% y-o-y. Based on the weak Q1 2015 guidance, I believe it is likely that the Company will fail to achieve their full year E&E bookings growth target of 8% - 15%. The deterioration in the E&E business is very concerning for long investors. For the past year or so, large investors in RST such as Osmium Partners and Nierenberg Investment Management have argued that most of the Company's value was in the ""high growth"" E&E business. Both of these firms believe that the E&E business deserves a valuation multiple of at least 3x price to sales. On the other hand, due to inconsistent historical growth and increasing competitive pressures, I believe that the E&E business should be valued at 1x price to sales at most. Based on the recent deterioration in E&E bookings growth, I would argue that my views are more in-line with reality than Osmium or Nierenberg. Thus, at this point, the bull case appears very weak as most longs were counting on strong growth in the E&E business to be the primary driver of future share price appreciation.The significant deterioration in RST's E&E bookings performance is not surprising. In my first article on RST, I argued that the RST's FY 2014 Adjusted EBITDA and E&E bookings performance were artificially boosted by the Company's conversion from single-year to multi-year contracts. As I subsequently demonstrated in one of my follow-up articles, after annualizing the value of multi-year contracts, RST's E&E bookings in the first 9 months of FY 2014 had actually declined relative to the prior year. After most of single-year contracts had been converted to multi-year contracts, I believed that E&E bookings growth would begin to slow down dramatically. This is exactly what occurred in Q4 2014, and it appears that the weakness in E&E bookings growth will continue throughout FY 2015.ConclusionFrankly, the Company's Q4 2014 results and FY 2015 guidance fell below my already low expectations. I expected RST's results to deteriorate as the conversion to multi-year contracts slowed down. However, I did not anticipate that the Company's results would deteriorate so soon. Overall, RST's recent Q4 2014 earnings report has confirmed most of the key points of my bear thesis. I do not believe that the Company's recent restructuring initiatives will create much value for shareholders. The fundamental problem with RST is that they offer a product that is in many ways inferior to much cheaper products offered by upstarts such as Duolingo. No amount of cost-cutting and refocused sales & marketing efforts can make-up for an increasingly commoditized product. I believe that RST will continue to lose market share, and as a result, I believe RST shares will continue to decline from the current price level. To take into account the Company's weaker than anticipated FY 2015 guidance, I have applied a 15% discount to my previous price target of $6.23 which results in a new price target of $5.30 for RST shares. Thus, despite the recent large decline in the Company's share price, I believe that RST still represents a good short opportunity at the current price level."
2745315,39591,2014-12-10T08:56:10-05:00,"Investors are ignoring strong growth in B2B revenues, and focusing solely on weakness in B2C segment.Estimated 92% upside based on target price of $19.30, calculated as the sum of net cash and enterprise value computed at three times B2B revenues, excluding contribution from B2C business.Potential catalyst includes implementation of action plan proposed by Osmium Partners.","Elevator PitchThe growth potential of Rosetta Stone's (NYSE:RST) B2B segment is not fairly reflected in its valuations and share price. Its B2B segment operates on an attractive recurring revenue SaaS (Software as a Service) subscription business model, with renewal rates in the range of 75%-80%. Applying a 3x EV/Revenue to Rosetta Stone's end-2014 estimated bookings of $115 million for its B2B segment and adding an estimated year-end net cash of $65 million, my target price for Rosetta Stone is $19.30, representing an upside of 92% from its share price of $10.04, as of December 9, 2014. Osmium Partners' activist stance and appointment of a director to Rosetta Stone's Board should lead Rosetta Stone's management on the path of shareholder-friendly, value-accretive actions.Company DescriptionRosetta Stone provides innovative, technology-driven learning solutions to both B2C (individuals) and B2B (schools, businesses, and government organizations) customer segments. Within the technology-based learning industry, Rosetta Stone participates in the consumer and institutional language learning, literacy and reading for students, brain fitness and kids-focused learning solutions categories.Transformation Started Since 2012 Led To Growing B2B RevenuesIn early 2012, Rosetta Stone was largely a B2C company focused on one core product, technology-driven language learning solutions, which was mainly sold in physical boxes. This meant that Rosetta Stone suffered from several problems. Firstly, Rosetta Stone didn't capitalize on the adjacent growth opportunities in technology-driven learning such as literacy, reading and brain fitness. Secondly, it ran the risk of becoming obsolete, as consumer buying and consumption habits shifted from offline to online. Lastly, its revenues were lumpy, as it relied on one-time sales of its products. In February 2012, Stephen M. Swad was promoted from CFO to CEO and he led Rosetta Stone's transformation.Rosetta Stone expanded beyond its core language learning business and diversified into education-technology with its acquisitions of Livemocha (among largest online language-learning communities globally) and Lexia Learning Systems (reading technology) in 2013, and Vivity Labs (sells Fit Brains brain-training products) and Tell Me More (language-learning software company with significant presence in Europe) in 2014. In addition, Rosetta Stone started to generate more online sales of its language learning solutions.More importantly, Rosetta Stone's B2B segment, which it terms as Enterprise & Education, has grown much bigger and stronger, following its efforts to strengthen the product portfolio in 2013 via acquisitions. Its B2B customers include K-12 schools, businesses, and government organizations. Rosetta Stone's Enterprise & Education business segment has increased bookings from $61 million in 2012 to $75 million in 2013, and it expects bookings to further grow to $115 million in 2014, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 53%. This is highly achievable, as its cumulative bookings for the Enterprise & Education business segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 already account for 73% of its full year guidance of $115 million in bookings. Note that bookings represent executed sales contracts received by Rosetta Stone that are either recorded immediately as revenue or as deferred revenue.Rosetta Stone's Enterprise & Education business segment boasts significantly more attractive economics than its legacy one-time sale B2C business model. Its Enterprise & Education business segment generates substantially all of its sales from a SaaS (Software as a Service) subscription business model, with renewal rates in the range of 75%-80%. Furthermore, the future growth prospects look very promising, particularly in the areas of K-12 education, basic literacy training and language learning. According to a study conducted by IBIS Capital in January 2013, e-Learning expenditure for K-12 education is projected to grow at a 33% CAGR between 2012 and 2017; while 0.7 billion adults are expected to lack basic literacy skills by 2015; and the English language learning market is currently valued at $36 billion and expected to grow at a 25% CAGR going forward. Rosetta Stone's ability to deliver a complete suite of solutions from basic literacy to advanced language proficiency to both kids in schools and working adults in corporates, should position it for the tremendous future growth opportunities.Instead, investors are unfairly penalizing Rosetta Stone for the lackluster performance of its B2C business segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, its B2C segment's bookings have declined by 9.8% year-on-year to $128 million. While I expect Rosetta Stone's core B2C language-learning solutions business to continue being impacted by free online technology-driven language solutions such as apps, any such decline should be partially offset by the increased revenues from cross-selling of new products. For example, Rosetta started to up-sell its brain-training solutions branded Rosetta Stone Fit Brains to its existing customers signed up for language-learning solutions in the third quarter, with cross-selling penetration rates at approximately 5%.ValuationPublicly traded SaaS companies trade anywhere between 4 to 20 times EV/Revenue, while they have historically been valued at a range of 3-5 times EV/Revenue between 2004 and 2011. If I apply a 3x EV/Revenue multiple to Rosetta Stone's 2014 estimated bookings of $115 million for its B2B or Enterprise & Education business segment and add its end-2014 estimated net cash balance of $65 million, I arrive at a target price of $19.30 for Rosetta Stone. This represents a 92% upside from Rosetta Stone's share price of $10.04, as of December 9, 2014. More importantly, this target price does not even ascribe any value to Rosetta Stone's B2C business which delivered bookings of $128 million (or approximately $6 per share) for the first nine months of the year.Potential CatalystThe key catalyst for Rosetta Stone is the adoption of the action plan proposed by Osmium Partners, an asset management firm. In August this year, Osmium Partners changed its filing status for its then 9.95% stake in the Company from passive to activist. In November, it was disclosed that Osmium Partner has increased its stake in Rosetta Stone to 10.67%. On November 19, 2014, Rosetta Stone appointed Arthur ""John"" Hass to the company's board of directors. Hass was formerly senior advisor at Osmium Partners and boasts more than two decades of experience serving the roles of investment banker, CEO, and director. This is part of a standstill agreement between Rosetta Stone and Osmium Partners, where Osmium Partners is not allowed to conduct a proxy contest during the period of the standstill agreement.Osmium Partners disclosed a four-point action plan, proposing the following actions for Rosetta Stone. Firstly, Rosetta Stone should take actions to double targeted free cash flow margins to 4% in 2015, Secondly, Rosetta Stone should ""create a sharp focus with a clear strategy"" to grow both the B2B and B2C segments. Thirdly, Rosetta Stone should ""provide clear disclosures and appropriate business metrics for shareholders."" Lastly, Osmium Partners urged Rosetta Stone to buy back its own shares aggressively.If Rosetta Stone adopts some or all of Osmium Partners' proposed actions, it should accelerate the narrowing of the gap between Rosetta Stone's share price with its underlying intrinsic value.Variant ViewThe biggest risk with Rosetta Stone is its reliance on language-learning solutions for its B2C segment. Free language-learning solutions and decline in international travel are some of the factors that could negatively impact Rosetta Stone's B2C segment, if it does not diversify into new products outside its core language-learning solutions effectively."
2554995,25432,2014-10-13T13:00:00-04:00,"Rosetta Stone is incredibly undervalued by a variety of measures.
        Using the CFO's year-end cash guidance on Q2 earnings call of $70 million (before considering buybacks, etc), Rosetta Stone trades for less than $100 million pro forma EV.
        Most investors I talk to don't understand Rosetta Stone has an Education & Enterprise business unit where most of RST's value resides.
        Management is being cooperative with two 13D filers - Nierenberg Investment Management and Osmium Partners. The company announced a new director and important E&E partnerships.","Time is not your friend.These are the words from reputable value shop, Nierenberg Investment Management, in its June 13D filing and reiterated in August in an amended 13D/A filing with respect to Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST). Nierenberg holds 8% of RST's equity.Rosetta Stone is an education technology company comprised of two business units, North America Consumer (""NAC"") and Education & Enterprise (""E&E""). RSTs offerings include language learning, literacy and brain fitness with sales migrating to online subscription channels rather than legacy, perpetual software sales. This channel shift and competition from free alternatives in the NAC segment are causing RSTs value to become obfuscated by market participants.It is clear based on the price action over the last several quarters that RST is a broken stock and investors are not appreciating, or completely misunderstanding, the business model transformation that is underway. This creates opportunity for the contrarian investor, although I will admit the last few months have been frustrating as a RST investor.RST data by YChartsBut along with the slide in the share price comes a welcomed sense of urgency and change at RST. Management appears to understand Nierenberg's warning that time is not its friend and is taking action.Recent news flow indicates that the company has taken to action with respect to certain suggestions by Nierenberg which include, among other things:On October 7, 2014, RST announced it added eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) mobile and innovation executive Steve Yankovich to its BoD. It is the first of three additions to the BoD expected by year-end as suggested by Nierenberg. Mr. Yankovich stated:I welcome Mr. Yankovich to the BoD. The press release indicated the next BoD addition would focus on an individual who can enhance the investor perspective, which I interpret to mean bolstering RST's investor communication strategy.With respect to investor communication, RST management has taken part in recent interviews with journalists to more clearly explicate the business strategy. To sum up, RST is focusing on less crowded markets where competition from free alternatives is not as prevalent -- the E&E business. For interested readers, those interviews can be found here:ValuationEven with a misunderstood situation, the question is valuation and how long will it take for the market to re-rate the subject company?First, the valuation question. For less than $100 million pro forma enterprise value, investors can buy an education software company with 80%+ gross margins, a growing subscription revenue stream and paid online subscriber count and be protected against a permanent impairment by the considerable net cash pile.Management is guiding to $320 million for FY 2014 ""bookings,"" $19 to $22 million EBITDA and ~$10 million in free cash flow. Investors, therefore, can pick up RST for about 9x EV/FCF for a cash flow stream that is becoming more visible (from the E&E SaaS business) and likely to grow given some execution of the highest ROI activities in the NAC segment. The current valuation is too cheap relative to the future earnings power of this business.Another point worth mentioning is RSTs change to describing bookings instead of revenue which management believes is a better representation of its performance. Bookings is defined by RST as executed sales contracts received that are either immediately recorded as revenue or as deferred revenue. This has been a point of confusion among analysts since bookings aren't necessarily revenue in the current period. Either way, the revenue stream is becoming more visible as the deferred revenue backlog increases. As of Q2, deferred revenue was $93 million, up 51% year-over-year, and pricing RST at 1x deferred revenue relative to its enterprise value.Valuation, of course, is not a catalyst in and of itself, but the depressed price could attract interested buyers looking to buy growth and recurring revenue stream on the cheap. Given the bargain basement valuation for a player in a sexy industry, a big brand and a large net cash balance, I expect for strategic and/or financial buyers to get interested in a buyout situation given the transitioning economics of Rosetta Stone's operating model. A buyer wouldn't even need to commit much equity given RST has untapped debt capacity to help finance a transaction.Indeed, the education technology business is highly fragmented and characterized by innovation then consolidation. For example, language competitor Berlitz was acquired in 2001 by the Japanese conglomerate Benesse Corporation. Renaissance Learning was bought and sold numerous times by PE buyers (including investment by Google Ventures) in the last 4 years.If history doesn't repeat, it certainly could rhyme.ConclusionTo be clear, RST is not without its challenges. The consumer business is facing the threat of free alternatives from various Web 2.0 competitors such as Duolingo. But investors appear intensely focused on this segment while disregarding the E&E business which is 100% SaaS revenue ($115 million expected in 2014) with 5+ year customer relationships, rich margins, high renewal rates and expected to exit the year with 10% topline growth.These sorts of SaaS models normally fetch at least 3x sales multiples, suggesting a ~$350 million value for this unit alone. Adding $70 million in expected net cash at year end increases equity value to $420 million. If we assume the consumer business is worth zero, there is still an incredibly wide discount to what the E&E business is worth. Market participants, however, are pricing the operating businesses at $90 million (net of pro forma cash)!The threat of permanent impairment here is limited coincident with meaningful upside. I can think of worse places to hide out in this market."
2502685,70915,2014-09-17T17:30:23-04:00,"Rosetta Stone’s latest quarter brought a decline of 6% in the revenue.Cheaper mobile apps are taking over the company’s business. Internet piracy is also an additional concern.The industry has been performing well, indicating Rosetta Stone’s own failure to deliver optimum returns.","Parallel to clever buying decisions, shorting underperforming stocks at the right time helps maximize investment returns. One such stock to sell right now is of Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST). The company's share value has gone down by 43% in a year. The company is a leading provider of technology-based solutions for learning languages. However, it hasn't been able to perform well financially, owing to the factors which are out of its domain. An example would be internet piracy, through which the company's products are being downloaded with Rosetta Stone receiving not even a single penny at its end.In this article, I will analyze the company's financial stance by looking at its latest quarterly performance. After that, I will discuss the factors which should outline the future prospects of the company.Second QuarterDuring the period, the company's revenue declined by 6% to $57.3 million on a year-over-year basis. From a geographical point of view, both the domestic and international market posted double-digit fall in revenue. The company tried to improve its volume sold by running promotional activities but all its efforts went in vain as revenue kept on declining. The promotional activities eventually led the average revenue per product ""ARPU"" to fall by 13% to $238.Certainly, from all perspectives, the top line for Rosetta Stone was found crumbling in its latest quarter. The ARPU isn't expected to stay at its current level. This is because longer promotional periods and deeper discounting will further have a negative impact on the ARPU in the future. My opinion can be confirmed through the company's statement:This virtually leaves no room for growth. A company needs either the volume or the price to grow, in order to sustain its revenue stream. However, since both of them are on decline, I do not see any other way through which the company can increase its revenue, other than choosing to make profitable acquisitions.Needless to say, the company has not been making the best use of its acquisitions either. To give an example, Rosetta Stone acquired LiveMocha last year. Even after its acquisition, the company has still not been able to make a mobile app available. Conversely, LiveMocha's users have been continuously asking for one.Rivals have been taking advantage of this weak spot. They have developed apps and have obtained the design and usability of Rosetta Stone for a bare fraction of the cost. An example would be Duolingo, a free app that is benefiting and even beating Rosetta Stone at its own game.Source: Morningstar (TTM=Trailing Twelve Months)This lack of focus has resulted in peers performing better than Rosetta Stone (see graph above). Revenue growth for the industry is 12% on average for the past three years. Rosetta Stone, on the other hand, has given an increment of only 0.7%. The other most important measure is the return on equity, which has been negative 36.8% even when the industry has given a positive result. This implies that Rosetta Stone's failure to accommodate the growing needs of the customers has resulted in a poor performance being provided to the investors.Another point worth mentioning is internet piracy. Free downloadable content is resulting in loss of millions to Rosetta Stone. Last year, a man admitted that he downloaded the pirated versions of Rosetta Stone's products and then copied the programs onto compact discs in order to sell the discs to online customers at prices of more than 50% of the suggested retail price. The convict admitted that he made at least $100,000 out of this scheme. This isn't a one-time event, as there have been several other cases in the past.In the future, greater accessibility to lower cost and free products on the internet will continue putting higher pricing pressure and will create further problems for the company. Falling ARPU is already an example to consider.As a result, future estimates for the company have been reduced further. The company is now expected to deliver a loss of $1.95 and $0.89 per share in 2014 and 2015 respectively, down from negative $1.26 and $0.58 per share, estimated two months ago.The company doesn't provide any dividend to console stock holders who have been affected through the share value drop. With the future earnings forecast being negative, and the industry performing better than Rosetta Stone, it is better that investors short the company from their portfolio and consider other investments in the same industry. Rosetta Stone holds a sell rating."
2229853,25432,2014-05-22T06:30:00-04:00,"Rosetta Stone trades at a distressed valuation.Investors are missing the hidden value from a growing subscription-based revenue model.With recent M&A activity in the education software space, Rosetta Stone could become a buyout target.","The landscape for education software companies is heating up after private equity firm Hellman & Friedman purchased Renaissance Learning for $1.1 billion, a 130% premium to what another private equity player Permira Funds paid for Renaissance ($475 million) just 2.5 years earlier. In addition, Google Ventures purchased a minority equity stake in Renaissance just a few months prior to H&F coming along. It is expected that Google Ventures will buy back in alongside H&F at the higher valuation, indicating the growing value of education software in the technology ecosystem.Given that backdrop, Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is one of the cheapest and most misunderstood companies I can find in the market today.RST data by YChartsWhile it is true that Rosetta Stone's revenue has been basically flat since its IPO in 2009, its evolving SaaS business model is being overlooked by investors and Rosetta Stone's earnings power is masked by too-high sales & marketing spend. To that end, investors are too focused on Rosetta Stone's transactional based consumer business which is in decline and represents only a small fraction of Rosetta Stone's underlying value.If we look at selected financial data across the last 5 years, it appears like Rosetta Stone is a ""busted growth story."" But there is more happening under the hood than meets the eye.(Source: FY 2013 10-K)What is not evident from the consolidated numbers is Rosetta Stone's evolving business model that is moving away from a transactional-based consumer language business to a subscription-based learning business. Rosetta Stone's subscription revenues have increased from $25 million in 2009 to an estimated $140 million in 2014 ($115 million in Education & Enterprise and $25 million in consumer).Rosetta Stone's E&E and consumer subscription businesses are characterized with high renewal rates which lowers the average cost of customer acquisition over a longer lifetime customer relationship.Here is a diagram for how management is driving change in its consumer business away from its historical, transactional-based revenue model and towards a more attractive subscription revenue stream:Inherent in the business model shift is opacity in Rosetta Stone's GAAP financials. A key disclosure in the 10-K footnotes helps explain the muted revenue growth rates in the consumer business. As Rosetta Stone transitions from its old selling model, it is realizing less revenue upfront but it is creating a longer-term revenue stream which adds stability to the revenue base and improves lifetime customer value.This key disclosure is one reason the consolidated sales figures are showing lackluster growth -- sales are being extended over a longer time horizon due to the subscription model and not realized upfront.The problem for management is clearly articulating the evolving business model, growth strategy and value proposition because the results are not showing up in the numbers yet. Frankly, Rosetta Stone's transactional consumer language business (e.g., physical CD-ROM sales) is no longer its core business, but that is what investors are keenly focused on. The threat of hot start-ups like Duolingo and other free alternatives have created the consensus view that Rosetta stone is in permanent decline.I take the variant view that there is considerable ""hidden value"" embedded at Rosetta Stone in its consumer and E&E subscription businesses, which have similar economics and operating model to Renaissance Learning.How did private equity players value Renaissance? In 2011, the $475 million buyout represented a 3.6x sales multiple on Renaissance' 2010 $130 million sales base. In the latest H&F transaction, the $1.1 billion deal represents a 6x sales multiple on Renaissance' estimated $175 million run rate.If we simply assign a 3x sales multiple on Rosetta Stone's subscription businesses (which is in line or lower than other SaaS comps), that yields a $420 million valuation for the subscription revenue stream alone. If we add net $55 million in net cash, Rosetta Stone is worth $475 million, even without considering the legacy consumer business. While that business does have at least some value, it is in decline so I will value it at zero for conservatism.Alternatively, another way to value Rosetta Stone is to use management's 2016 estimates of $390 to $400 million revenue run rate at 10% adjusted EBITDA margins, implying $40 million EBITDA. Applying a 12x EBITDA multiple indicates $480 million plus $55 million in net cash, or a $535 million enterprise value.Based on a fully diluted 21.2 million share count, I think shares are worth between $22 and $25 per share.ConclusionNow that Rosetta Stone is priced at just $200 million by market participants and holds $55 million in net cash ($155 million enterprise value), I think Rosetta Stone has become a very attractive takeout target by a strategic or financial buyer to acquire a visible revenue stream in the education software space cheaply.Given the opacity caused by the transitioning consumer business, a sophisticated buyer could finance a transaction with little equity to buy Rosetta Stone, transition the rest of the consumer business to a SaaS model, leaving only the attractive SaaS businesses which are more richly valued by market participants.As noted in previous columns, Rosetta Stone acquired numerous businesses over the last 18 months thereby making integration risk a key factor for investors. However, management appears to be handling the new tuck-in acquisitions very well given the increases in bookings and deferred revenue. In my mind, the key risk remains how management deals with the transition of the legacy consumer business and how long it takes for investors to recognize the value in the new SaaS businesses.However, I now believe M&A remains a very real catalyst given the numerous transactions for Renaissance Learning, illustrating the penchant for buyers to own businesses in this space.Disclosure: I am long RST.

The company expects ~$70 million net cash at year-end.At the current $190 million valuation, Rosetta Stone continues to be an attractive risk/reward investment while it continues its business model transformation.","Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) remains one of the most misunderstood companies I can find in the market today and, therefore, one of the most mispriced (as I discussed here). The key point in the Q2 earnings call is that the business remains on track integrating a slew of recent acquisitions, including Lexia Learning, Fit Brains, Tell Me More and Live Mocha. In addition to affirming its guidance for FY 2014, Rosetta Stone reported accelerating growth in its most valuable segment - Enterprise & Education (""E&E"") - with pro forma growth up 8% year-over-year, and an increasing backlog in the deferred revenue line item on the balance sheet ($93 million). Rosetta Stone also disclosed that it won a significant 7 figure SaaS deal with a K-12 customer in Q2 which management believes they won because of their broadening suite of education software products.RST data by YChartsWhile Rosetta Stone reported a GAAP loss, I continue to be bullish on the company due to valuation and evidence that the E&E business continues to strengthen. Moreover, the CFO indicated on the earnings call that 90% of its EBITDA and cash generation occurred in the second half of 2012 and 2013 due to purchasing patterns from its customers. To that end, Rosetta Stone expects to generate about $8 million in free cash flow this year and end the year with around $70 million in net cash, up from the current $46 million cash pile. At the current $190 million valuation, investors can buy the operating business for $120 million which should generate around $140 million in higher-quality SaaS revenue via its growing consumer web and E&E subscription streams. Even before considering Rosetta Stone's CD-ROM (i.e., perpetual, one time sales) consumer business - which has issues due to channel shift and competition - Rosetta Stone is cheap based only on its cash and subscription revenue streams to which I ascribe a 3x multiple.Rosetta Stone is still in the middle of a transformation from a language technology company to an education technology company, and from a one-time CD-ROM sale business to one delivering its solutions to customers via subscription plans which is lengthening customer relationships, making product pricing more accessible (monthly payments vs. lump sum) and increasing the visibility of the revenue streams (evidenced by growing deferred revenue backlog).At the end of the day, Rosetta Stone has a recognizable brand name, sells a product with 80%+ gross margins with growing subscription revenue streams and has a very strong balance sheet which should report ~$70 million in net cash by year-end. That seems like a pretty reasonable investment to me. My value estimate remains in the $25 to $30 per share range (similar to management who gives a $20 to $35 per share estimate in recent investor presentations). There is clearly a wide gap in those estimates and the current market valuation, but with some execution and a simpler story to tell going forward, I think Rosetta Stone will be priced significantly higher if it reaches its low double digit EBITDA guidance in 2016.Disclosure: The author is long RST.

Intuitively, low prices provide investors a ""margin of safety"" when investing in an uncertain environment.The world seems pretty uncertain for Rosetta Stone investors at this moment.The stock continues to trade at 52-week lows and the overblown fears of competition from sexy startups like Duolingo continues to instill fear. Rosetta Stone's recent investor conference to discuss 2013 annual results, long-term strategy and business plan didn't seem to embolden investors.Here are the key themes, succinctly summarized by management:(source: 2014 Investor Day Presentation)I walked away from the presentation feeling pretty good about the future of Rosetta Stone, especially because the SaaS business outperformed on the back of strong Q4 bookings. Rosetta Stone is well-capitalized with about $70 million in net cash, and has a nice set of assets to drive value, including a number of recent acquisitions.In particular, I am bullish on the Education & Enterprise (""E&E"") business which is characterized by high-margin subscription income, high customer renewal rates and long lifetime customer relationships, as I explained in my last narrative.The market has no problem pricing many SaaS based businesses at 5 to 10x sales. Meanwhile, Rosetta Stone is a SaaS business in disguise, and the market is yet to pick it up as the general consensus appears to focusing exclusively on the consumer business. I admit there are significant headwinds in the consumer segment, including competition from Duolingo, massive open online courses (""MOOC"") and other free alternatives. I am sure there is a significant valuation disparity between Duolingo, which just raised $20 million, and the reviled Rosetta Stone. But that creates opportunity for contrarian investors.To be honest, I'm uncertain Duolingo has figured out its business model. It isn't profitable yet, and generates a bit of revenue from content partners who pay a few cents per word for translation services. But, Duolingo is certainly hot, and priced accordingly, as are many web based startups. So why not raise capital when the money is flowing at rich valuations? I would.Given the wide disparity in valuations, opportunity looms for contrarian investors. Even if Rosetta Stone were to cede its entire share of the consumer market to Duolingo and other competitors, the E&E business is still more valuable than the entire enterprise of Rosetta Stone. To that end, I also believe there is more of a ""moat"" around the underlying E&E businesses, and less susceptible to free alternativesHow do I value the E&E business? It is pretty simple: 3x LTM sales, which is generally in line (but lower, read, conservative) relative to take out multiples for this type of SaaS business model. Rosetta Stone's CEO values the E&E business in a similar fashion, and suggested a comp set valued SaaS businesses at 4 to 20x sales. To that end, I think 3x is decidedly conservative. Using the 3x multiple to $115 million in LTM SaaS sales brings the valuation to $345 million, and adding in net cash brings the valuation to $415 million before considering the consumer business. At an estimated 22 million fully diluted share count, that represents a $19 stock quote (without the consumer business).Does Rosetta Stone have challenges? Yes, certainly. One issue, in my mind, is the too high level of sales and marketing spend, which is generally in the 50-55% range. Some of that includes necessary salaries and commissions for sales representatives, but it certainly appears like dialing back those operating expenses could improve profitability. In fact, the E&E business is characterized by low customer acquisition costs when considering the high renewal rates and long customer relationships (hence the rich sales multiples for SaaS businesses). I expect the economics of this arrangement to be better explained in multiple upcoming investor conferences and communication from management.ConclusionI see little risk in owning Rosetta Stone at the current quote in terms of permanent loss of investment capital. However, this is a value proposition that could take some time to get noticed by the market, and therefore, an investment in Rosetta Stone could be ""dead money"" for some time. However, if management gets the E&E business integrated and rights the consumer business, a double is not out of the question over the next 12 to 24 months.Meanwhile, the last negative shock in this stock should have passed given Rosetta Stone's large private equity investors forcibly sold their remaining stakes in late 2013 as they wound down their liquidating trusts.Disclosure: I am long RST.

1763082,21820,2013-10-23T08:25:27-04:00,,"Once known for its kiosks at airports and malls, language learning specialist Rosetta Stone Incorporated (NYSE:RST) has shifted its focus to the internet and cloud. Rosetta Stone is in the middle of a key transformation from box software bundles to mobile games. The company is also using its cash wisely to acquire learning companies that give the company a more diversified revenue base. Long term investors should hop on board now to enjoy gains along the way.The company's latest launch in the freemium game market is ""Rosetta Stone Arcade Academy"". The game, which is available for iOS, features 12 freemium Spanish themed games to begin. Along with the freemium model, Rosetta Stone will hope for additional items like value packs to be purchased. In this case, the purchases will unlock additional content.The newest launch in mobile games expands on the success Rosetta Stone has already had from its games aimed at it new kids' division. Recently, Rosetta Stone launched Lingo Letter Sounds, a game aimed at helping children match letters in a game based on sounds. The game was recently seen as the number two most downloaded free app in the kids' section. More importantly, Lingo Letter Sounds has a smart mode that is being used by some of the most popular mobile games. Gamers get five credits to start and then receive two credits every day they come back and open the app. People can purchase credits to speed along this process and likely will as the game gets more addicting.As the worldwide leader in foreign language translation, it is important for Rosetta Stone to diversify into other learning methods like learning mobile games. Lingo Letter Sounds teaches over 50 words and phrases in Spanish to kids in any country. Rosetta Stone will most likely add more languages to the popular game and could expand on this platform.Back in July, Rosetta Stone acquired Lexia Learning for $22.5 million. At the time of the acquisition, Rosetta Stone CEO Steve Swad had this to say, ""This acquisition marks a major step forward in Rosetta Stone's strategy to strengthen our leadership position in the use of technology in education. Reading represents a natural adjacency to language learning, and Lexia enables us to expand into this important market with leading-edge products celebrated for their effectiveness by educators and parents. We see exciting synergies between the two companies globally.""Lexia Learning is a leader in the education market. The company has relationships with over 14,000 schools and 1 million students through its educational programs. To me, the acquisition is a great one by Rosetta Stone and great management at a rather small price. The company expects the acquisition to add to the already growing Enterprise & Education. In 2013, that business segment is expected to produce revenue of $80 million, which represents almost a third of total sales.Another important coming catalyst for shares of Rosetta Stone will be the company's share buyback program. In August, Rosetta Stone approved a $25 million share buyback plan. If these shares are all bought, it would retire around 7% of the current outstanding shares, which would have a large impact on earnings per share going forward.Rosetta Stone ended the recent quarter with over $6 per share in cash. This comes on top of a debt free balance sheet. With a share price between $15 and $16, the cash value of shares represents around 40% of the total value. This gives investors a great cushion of comfort, as Rosetta Stone can use the money to acquire more companies in the education field, or diversify itself even further. Rosetta Stone could also return some of that capital to shareholders, but that seems unlikely to me at the current time.Shares of Rosetta Stone trade above $15 and seem destined to hit a new 52 week high. Investors will be watching earnings closely to see how mobile gaming traffic and the acquisitions are paying off. The company trades with a market capitalization of under $350 million. Shares are up 23% in 2013, but still fall shy of the $20 level last seen in 2011 and the $30 mark shares enjoyed back in 2009.Analysts on Yahoo Finance see modest 4.8% ($286.5 million)revenue growth for Rosetta Stone in 2013. In 2014, analysts turn more bullish with double digit gains of 10.9% ($317.6 million) projected. Rosetta Stone is projecting revenue to grow to $400 million. This $400 million target would represent growth of 26% in 2015. Add up double digit revenue, new acquisitions and business sectors, and a strong cash position, and you have a recipe for success.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in RST over the next 72 hours.

2496175,20568,2014-09-15T13:45:59-04:00,,"Based in Arlington VA, Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is a leading provider of technology-based solutions for learning languages. Founded in 1992, the company had its IPO in 2009.The company operates through three segments: North America Consumer, Rest of World Consumer, and Global Enterprise & Education. They sell their software products directly as well as through selected retailers.Disappointing Second Quarter Results Rosetta reported its Q2 2014 results on August 5. Total revenue excluding discontinued operations, decreased 6% to $57.3 million from $61.2 million, in the same quarter of 2013.Enterprise & Education revenue grew 32%, but North America Consumer revenue declined 17%, primarily due to weakness in the retail and call center channels. Rest Of World Consumer revenue decreased 27% due mainly to the downsizing in Asia in Q1.Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter fell to negative $0.1 million compared with $3.7 million in Q2 of 2013, mainly due to lower contribution from North America Consumer, partially offset by an increase in contribution from E&E. Loss for the quarter was $0.74 per share, substantially worse compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of $0.20 per share.The company reiterated its guidance for the full year 2014.Downward RevisionsAnalysts have cut their estimates for the company after disappointing results. Zacks Consensus Estimates now call for loss of ($1.95) per share and ($0.89) per share in 2014 and 2015 respectively, down from ($1.26) per share and ($0.58) per share, 60 days ago.The Bottom LineWhile Rosetta Stone enjoys a market leadership position with its effective and user-friendly products, its declining profitability and persisting pricing pressures continue to pose challenges. Increasing availability of lower cost and free products in the space will result in increased pricing pressures and create headwinds for the stock.A better Play in the Industry?Investors looking for a better play in the Computer Software industry could consider Aspen Tech (NASDAQ:AZPN), which has jumped to Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) after delivering a 55.6% positive earnings surprise in the recent quarter."
1969411,25432,2014-01-28T09:45:00-05:00,,"One thing I look for in security selection are prices that are experiencing a large, temporary dislocation for specious reasons, rather than for any significant change in the underlying value of the business.In the case of Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST), shares sold off drastically in November due, in part, to one of its private equity investors, ABS Capital, being forced to sell a large block of shares as it wound down its liquidating trust in which RST shares were held. Typically, PE funds invest with a certain time horizon - usually 7 years. Therefore, I understand that ABS Capital was selling for no other reason than because it was forced to sell (it acquired its stake in Rosetta Stone in 2006).To add to the selling pressure, Rosetta Stone issued muted revenue guidance (no change in EBITDA guidance) on account of closing its ""zero calorie revenue"" kiosk distribution channel, without finding adequate revenue replacement for what was the remainder of 2013.These transitory issues are actually quite fortuitous for Rosetta Stone shareholders, as the forced sale and selling pressure allowed management to buy back 1 million shares at $11.50/share, equating to 5% of the company's equity. This was a very accretive use of excess cash, in my opinion.The company still has another $13.5 million remaining in its buyback program, and has shown its willingness to be opportunistic with its share repurchases. Continued weakness in Rosetta Stone's share price could provide management another opportunity to exhaust the program, thereby making remaining shares more valuable and adding downside protection. I estimate that the company has about $60 million in net cash after a number of recent acquisitions closed, including Tell Me More ($28 million) and Vivity Labs ($12 million) which were finalized earlier this month, and Lexia Learning ($23 million) and Livemocha ($9 million) which were acquired earlier in 2013 (and reflected in the balance sheet).These acquisitions appear to be done at reasonable prices, and allow Rosetta Stone to reach expand internationally (Tell Me More is a French outfit) and into new adjacent product categories, namely ""brain fitness"" which is a growing category focused on increasing cognitive abilities later in life. And, in particular, Lexia Learning allows Rosetta Stone to leverage its language learning expertise, and expand its Enterprise & Education (""E&E"") business by offering reading solutions for the K-12 segment, a natural adjacent to languages. Putting it all together, Rosetta Stone is diversifying its product offerings allowing it to offer attractive product bundles, and to leverage its marketing spend (which is high, and averaged between 50 and 60% of sales over the last three years).In my view, the sell off in Rosetta Stone shares is overdone because in addition to Rosetta Stone's extensive brand value, it is also transitioning to a SaaS business model, particularly in its E&E segment, with significant recurring revenue and long lifetime customer relationships.From recent conference calls, I understand that Rosetta Stone has north of 80% renewal rates for its large managed customer accounts in its E&E business. The SaaS business also has gross margins in excess of 80% (as does the consumer business), so Rosetta Stone has highly visible, sticky and high-margin recurring revenue streams. This is particularly important to the value proposition, and is the reason why SaaS businesses normally trade at premium multiples of sales.Speaking of which, I understand the closest comparable transaction in this sector occurred in 2011, when Renaissance Learning was taken private for about 3.5x sales, after an unusual bidding process. Applying a 3x multiple to Rosetta's Stone E&E business (expected $80 million in 2013 sales), arrives at a value of $240 million for this segment alone (which should account for about one-third of total sales).Turning to the consumer segment, Rosetta Stone reduced its cost structure by: (1) rightsizing its fixed cost base in its Asian operations and (2) abandoning its ""zero calorie"" revenue stream in the kiosk segment. To replace those sales, Rosetta Stone recently announced a strategic partnership with Target (NYSE:TGT), who will sell Rosetta Stone's product via 1,300 stores and through Target's online channels. While average revenue per user (""ARPU"") may be reduced via wholesale channels, I think management made the right strategic move to shutter the kiosk channel which wasn't resulting in bottom line earnings growth.So, while Rosetta Stone has considerable brand value and very high consumer awareness as a result of its marketing spend, Rosetta Stone only garners a ~$175 million enterprise value in the public markets today.Because management is guiding to what appears to be an achievable $400 million in sales in 2015 at 10 to 13% operating margins, or $40 to $52 million in EBIT, Rosetta Stone looks cheap at the current price. If one assumes Rosetta Stone's pro forma operating profits land at $50 million, the company trades today for just 3.5 times pro forma 2015 EV/EBIT and 0.45x EV/sales. Both of those multiples are exceedingly low for a business of this nature.Given that SaaS businesses with high renewal rates and rich margins similar to Rosetta Stone trade at premium sales multiples (between 2x and 5x, generally), there is plenty of room for error given the significant discount at which Rosetta Stone currently trades. In other words, management doesn't need to do anything heroic as part of its turnaround, other than execute the stated strategy and be mildly successful in integrating its four recent acquisitions, including Lexia Learning, Livemocha, Tell Me More and Vivity Labs.Besides firm-level execution and integration risk, there is also risk to Rosetta Stone in the form of free alternatives that are emerging via digital channels. For example, massive open online courses (""MOOC's"") pose a threat, but I think that language learning is a bit different than other subjects given languages generally need immersion and extensive practice for learners to become proficient. To that end, Rosetta Stone's solutions appear to offer better learner outcomes based on the curriculum and technology solutions that promote interactivity with instructors and other students, digitally.Given the dynamics of the Rosetta Stone business model and the attractive industry to which it is levered, I am long these shares and I think they could be worth up to $20 today, equating to a ~$400 million market capitalization for the business.ConclusionAt current levels, I think investors are incurring below average risks for above average potential rewards. In fact, if Rosetta Stone's share price stays low for another few quarters, I would argue this is a good thing, allowing the company to exercise the remaining $13.5 million in its share buyback program. It would also allow investors time to allocate capital to an idea that appears asymmetric to the long side at the current price.Certainly integration and execution risk remains in Rosetta Stone's turnaround, given the change in distribution strategy and figuring out how to manage the new businesses acquired of late. Downside risk, though, should be mitigated due to a large net cash balance, a dwindling share count and the removal of a significant negative catalyst, namely, forced selling from PE investors.Disclosure: I am long RST.

1440141,39951,2013-05-16T10:43:40-04:00,,"We attended the Value Investing Congress in Vegas last week, and instead of listing all the presentations and giving a brief summary, which can be found many places on the internet (here, here and here), we thought we would look at some of the ideas that warrant further analysis. Most of the ideas presented have some investment merit and were well thought out and presented. While Peter Lynch always said you should be able to present your investment case in three minutes or less, 25-35 minutes to present some of the ideas weren't enough to cover all the factors involved in certain ideas -- and that is as it should be. There was something for every kind of value investor. Finding ideas with markets and most stocks at or near all-time highs means it is not the easiest time to find lots of profitable value ideas.Whitney Tilson suggested that the three most dangerous words in investing are ""I missed it,"" and that discounting stocks that have had big runs can cause investors to miss substantial appreciation (AIG (NYSE:AIG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were a couple of examples). However, we want to focus on some ideas that are a bit nontraditional. Our usual caveat is that everyone needs to do their own work on an investment idea and not just blindly buy or sell or short a stock because a famous investor or other credible source says to do it. Each investor has a different risk tolerance and investment horizon, which may or may not match up to the presenter's.Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) -- Presenter: David Nierenberg of D3 FundsOur first idea is a stock that was a great short for the last two years and went down 10% on the earnings announcement that occurred just after the Congress. Nierenberg (a Guru Focus guru) led off the Congress with RST. The firm likes ""busted"" growth names that are potentially posed to resume that once promised growth due to new management and a renewed focus on the basic fundamentals of the business.Reasons Given for the Stock Price Collapse1. The company had bloated international sales and marketing costs as it tried to maintain a high sales growth rate. This is very typical of a high growth story stock and a short seller's favorite type of short. It's a growth stock that can't meet the market's expectations and valuation. As both collapse, the stock declines substantially.2. Kiosk strategy was a low ROI sale channel. A low-margin sales channel dilutes margins for the sake of growth. It's more like advertising cost than profitable sales.3. Online and mobile products were weak. There was no iPad app until recently, and it's now in the ""cloud.""4. Competitive threat from massive open online courses (MOOCs) is increasing. High-profile MOOCs like Kahn Academy and San Jose St. create competition. Several New York Times articles (here and here and here) create plausible doubt about business model and sustainability of high gross margins and sales growth rates. We have no great insight as to how much of an impact MOOCs will have on RST -- and there are plenty of rebuttals to their potential (here and here, for example) -- but, admittedly, it is a major factor.Investment Thesis1. New management is cutting ""empty calorie marketing spend"" in international markets and eliminating kiosks in the U.S. (from 250+ in 2010 to zero by 2014). Former mismanagement has created an opportunity. This is a classic example of growing the top line without paying attention to bottom line, something that is all too common with both Internet- and non-Internet-focused companies. Usually it takes new management to break the culture, and that usually comes after problems materialize and valuations contract.2. It's a large, growing, and fragmented market ($1.3 billion out of $82 billion global language market) with No. 1 player (Berlitz) controlling only 0.62% of the market. RST has 0.34% market share. True market size is difficult too estimate, but lots of room for ""growth.""3. Returning to unit growth and business model has high, 80%+ gross margins that can fund R&D and other growth initiatives.4. The company is very inexpensive if 2015 financial objectives are achieved. In our opinion, you need to have a valuation that allows for wide margin for error in both margin and growth rate estimates. Valuation appears to allow for that even if 2015 targets are not achieved.We always advise caution when using comparable valuation metrics but, as the table below shows, if the company can achieve its financial objectives, the stock is not only relatively inexpensive but absolutely inexpensive as well.Risks Covered in PresentationD3 has reasonable responses to these questions (you can find them by doing an Internet search), but you have to be comfortable with your own answers -- not theirs or ours.1. How are margins sustainable given the proliferation of free/low cost apps?2. Many RST customers do not finish the course.3. Consider consumer spending headwinds in general.4. ABS plus Norwest 40% private equity stake sales could pressure shares.5. There is execution risk with a first-time CEO.Price Objective and Methodology1. There's a potential price range of $28-$60 depending on success.2. $28 base case3. $60 optimistic case4. Downside about $12Things We Liked1. Strong balance sheet and cash flow. $150 million cash balance on $350 million market cap. Large cash balance gives company tremendous flexibility to turn business around at a measured pace. Free cash flow generation also a plus, because it can do acquisitions and still increase EV with increasing cash.2. New CEO has had success with turnarounds before and making tangible progress in cost reductions ($20 million turnaround in EBITDA in first year). New management always something we like to see in ""turnarounds,"" especially ones with proven track records. D3 vetted CEO through their Bain connections.3. Despite lack of success internationally, the demand for others to learn English seems to be much greater than the demand for Americans to learn other languages and is a large growth opportunity. A return to international areas in a more prudent, cost-efficient way would be a positive.4. A 75% upside to its base case, which is based on reasonable assumptions on strategy and valuation metrics, seems acceptable for the risks.5. Little analyst coverage, all of it by smaller regional firms. (On the last call, three of the five analysts had their assistants ask questions.)6. Valuation metrics do not price in substantial growth or success of turnaround.7. The fact the stock declined 10% on an earnings miss shows there are still lots of short-term focused investors in the stock, allowing for time arbitrage.Concerns We Have1. While language learning market is huge, the addressable market is much smaller. The fact that the No. 1 player has less than 0.75% of the total market shows how difficult it is to capture market share. Fragmented market is a sign of just how diverse the learning options are.2. There seems to be an ""impulse buy"" component to their products (kiosks and commercials), which makes the ""need"" vs. ""want"" aspect of their products difficult to understand. While there are many successful companies selling the consumer ""wants,"" this is a tougher sell to us.3. Also hard to gauge the ""stickiness"" of its products. Once you learn a language, how much follow up do you do? Do you then want to learn another language (product)? Institutional segment helps offset this somewhat.4. The $100 million ""brand value,"" based on a conservative estimate of total R&D worth, may or may not be viewed similarly by other investors. The $12 ""downside support"" may be too aggressive (stock traded as low as $7 in 2011-12, but not a big negative).5. MOOCs are the current threat and it is tough to handicap the competition. However, during the presentation it was brought up that San Jose St., one of the first adopters of MOOC, was experiencing resistance to the idea by some of the faculty. Even with positive merits to the idea of MOOCs, widespread adoption will take a tremendous amount of time and effort.6. Most value investors would have sold out long before the valuation metrics used to justify the $60+ price targets would be achieved. While RST could trade at 2-4x EV/sales, we think very few investors buying the stock today would realize that type of gain. But it is possible.SummaryWe believe that looking at other successful investors' ideas when trying to find new ideas can be a rewarding strategy. The investment case for RST is very interesting and seems reasonable to us. However, we also believe that simply reading a presentation or just hearing the basic idea and investing in it with no additional work can be a failed strategy. All investors make mistakes, even very successful ones, and everyone has their own investment style, risk tolerance, investment horizon and investing goals.Investing conferences have become extremely popular and most of the investment ideas are widely disseminated within minutes of their presentation. However, knowing a ticker symbol, the story, and the well-respected presenter is not really doing analysis or using an investment process. Use their expertise and skill to help shorten the time it takes to do your analysis, but don't let it take the place of it. Of course, you could always just let them manage your money for you.Other ideas we might discuss as part of this series include Dole Food Company (NYSE:DOLE), WPX Energy Inc.

1172381,43481,2013-02-11T13:52:45-05:00,,"Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) provides language-learning software in over 30 languages. It has long been a leader in the United States language market. However, it is facing increased competition that threatens its business and profitability.The CompetitionRosetta Stone's biggest new competitors? Significantly increased competition from free (yes, free) language learning sites. Why spend $400 on something you're not sure is going to work when you can learn a language for free on Duolingo.com, and talk to natives giving free lessons in your target language on Livemocha.com or Verbling.com? Duolingo is truly threatening Rosetta Stone's business model. By offering a free, easy to use, interactive online-based service, Duolingo is revolutionizing language learning.Where did Duolingo come from?Duolingo received Series A round funding of $3.3 million led by Union Square Ventures. They recently raised $15 million more in Series B funding, led by NEA. Tim Ferris of the 4 hour workweek and Ashton Kutcher are also prominent investors in the company. The company was founded by Luis von Ahn, the creator of reCAPTCHA.But does it work?The question is: Do Duolingo users actually learn the language? Or is it just like so many other language programs out there that fail to provide any real benefit to its users. Independent research suggests that new Duolingo users with no prior experience in Spanish take an average of 34 hours to learn the equivalent of a first college semester's worth of Spanish. Seems like it works. By contrast, a study by the same group found that it takes Rosetta Stone users between 55 and 60 hours to learn the same amount of material. This spells bad news for Rosetta Stone. It's competing against a free product that is arguably better for learning a language.The Millennial ProblemThere is another large new development that threatens the Rosetta Stone business model: Generation Y. The future language learners of the world don't want to spend $400 to buy a product that may or may not work. They want content for free, and they know how and where to get it. As Duolingo improves, it and others like it will take over the language learning market and leave companies like Rosetta Stone in the dust.To research this a little further, I went to a slightly unorthodox source: Google Trends. The Trends search showed some surprising results, although in retrospect maybe they were to be expected.This trends search shows the most commonly used phrases including ""rosetta stone"" on Google in the last 12 months. The 100 for ""rosetta stone Spanish"" represent the most frequently searched term in the last year. Not bad. The next 4 terms however, seem unlikely to become buyers. ""Free Rosetta stone"", ""download rosetta stone"", and ""rosetta stone torrent"" are all reflections of a new generation. They want results free and fast. Duolingo provides that. Rosetta Stone does not. I find it unlikely people searching for ""the rosetta stone"" will become customers either.International Translation for Profit?Revenues from international markets, once thought to be a haven of growth for Rosetta stone, who derives 77% of it's sales from domestic markets, have declined 8% from Q3 last year. Not exactly promising for the prospect of international growth. In addition to this, overall revenue growth YOY in the last quarter was less than 1%. And this is with a marketing spend of over 60% of revenues. In addition, reviews from international users of Rosetta Stone's products have been less than stellar. Considering 50% of people in Europe already speak a foreign language (compared to just 10% in the United States), maybe they already have a better formula for language learning. Or the market is saturated with entrenched, superior international competitors. Whatever the reason, RST is looking at flat growth or worse in international markets.Another potential source of growth for RST is online learning subscriptions. If you look at RST's earning's slides from last quarter, you will see emphasis placed on the 167% increase in online learners through Rosetta Stone. Impressive, until you realize this 167% growth rate reflects just 40,000 new customers using Rosetta Stone online learning programs. Also readily admitted on the earnings call, subscribers rarely re-subscribe after their year expires. So either their customers learn their choice language in one year, or they give up long before that. Either way, no repeat business for Rosetta Stone.Duolingo, by contrast, has over 1 million active users, with over 1 million iPhone app downloads, and 100,000 daily users. Oh yeah, and it launched to the public less than 8 months ago. That's what real growth looks like.Saving GraceThere could, in my eyes, be one saving grace for Rosetta Stone. This is if they refocus their product offerings on the younger generation by offering much less expensive platforms for mobile and online learning, and use their brand name as leverage to get customers. Yes, this would likely cannibalize their current product line, but, as Steve Jobs once said ""If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will."" Someone else is cannibalizing RST right now. It's time to evolve. This would be a risky move by management, however, and I have not heard any indication of plans to lower prices, or offer stand-alone mobile apps. Unless changes are made soon, I see a grim future for Rosetta Stone.ConclusionA combination of slowing growth in international markets, combined with highly increased competition from free language-learning providers who provide a better online product, make Rosetta Stone's business model unsustainable. Its earnings have turned negative in the last 5 quarters, and I expect a continued lack of profit and downward trend for the company as revenues shrink and product prices are forced downward with new competition.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1437821,48751,2013-05-15T15:54:23-04:00,,"Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is a $362 million company that provides technology-based language learning products. Rosetta Stone's customers include individuals in North America, global individuals, and institutions, including government agencies. RST generates revenues from product software sales and online learner subscriptions. Its shares have traded from a high of $30.69 on July 31, 2009 several months after its IPO in April to $7.63 by the end of 2011. The downward trend reversed, and by the end of 2012, RST gained 21% to $11.98. YTD, the shares have increased over 43% to its peak of $18.30. Given the extreme price volatility, I wanted to provide a method to value RST.Rosetta Stone faces competition from Berlitz International, tellmemore.com, babble.com, as well as free programs like duolingo.com and even the British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC]. Despite the intense competition, Rosetta Stone has been able to grow its paid online learning subscribers from 16,762 in 2010, to 68,393 in 2012. However, product software sales have remained stagnant. In April, Rosetta Stone acquired Livemocha, one of its competitors offering free language lessons with paid premium content to over 16 million subscribers. Livemocha connects users to live instructor-led classes and private tutors - a different approach than Rosetta Stone's. Rosetta Stone displays a picture and the user selects the corresponding word or sentence, so it is difficult to note any synergies to this acquisition. There are several flaws to RST's approach, which are outlined by a blog in the Economist. Moreover, Rosetta Stone must deal with other issues, such as piracy.Given the trends in paid online learners, revenues, profits, and free cash flow, I believe the fair value of Rosetta Stone should be $22.79.Economic Profit SpreadTo help determine Rosetta Stone's growth rate, a modified version of economic profit spread (return on invested capital minus weighted average cost of capital) will be assessed. The return on invested capital was measured using the value of cash flow from operations divided by equity plus debt.Next, the cost of equity was estimated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).The first four columns correspond to the historical spread of stock returns over government-issued debt securities. The equity risk premium in the last column was measured by estimating the required rate of return on equities through the calculation of the present value of dividend yields on the S&P 500, and then subtracting the yield on the 10-year treasury. For more information about the estimated risk premiums, see Damodaran, Aswath. Equity Risk Premiums [ERP]: Determinants, Estimation and Implications - the 2013 Edition. NYU Stern School of Business (March, 2013). Given that the beta of Rosetta Stone is 1.1 (calculated using YTD daily prices) and the 10-year Treasury yield, the risk-free rate, is 1.92%, the weighted average cost of capital [WACC] are given below. Rosetta Stone holds an insignificant amount of debt, so the cost of equity equals the WACC.The average WACC of the eight figures is 8.63%. Using this figure, Rosetta Stone's economic profit spread in 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are, respectively, 15.48%, -6.73%, 9.13%, 17.51%, and 11.98%.Although, besides 2011, Rosetta Stone's return, based on CFO, on invested capital is significantly higher than WACC, these values are highly variable, adversely affecting the value of this company. Investors may find it difficult to estimate Rosetta Stone's potential for growth, and their investments, like in 2011, may even yield negative returns (by the end of 2011, RST stock decreased to 36% of its December 30, 2010 price). Given the risk, the fair growth rate that will be used in the subsequent discounted cash-flow analysis will be less than the average economic profit spread between 2008 and 2012, of 9.47%.Gross Profit Growth RatesIn April, Rosetta Stone undertook both cost-cutting and revenue-growing activities. All physical sales locations (kiosks) in the U.S. were closed; attention would be shifted toward cloud-based sales methods, reflecting Rosetta Stone's target market. Also in April, Rosetta Stone bought out a competitor, Livemocha Inc., but its effects on bottom- and top-line growth are not expected to be significant. Revenue guidance for 2013 is expected to increase to $280-290 million, while net income, without litigation, restructuring and other costs relating to mergers and acquisitions, is expected to be between $-1 to $1 million. This represents revenue growth of 2.47%-6.87%. RST's subscription and service revenue growth is on a strong upward trend, while product revenues are falling.Since 1Q2011, Rosetta Stone has delivered only one quarter where quarterly net profit was positive - the seasonally strong fourth quarter of 2012.If the exponential trends continue, total revenue and gross profit will be $287,557 and $235,156 (thousands).Estimates for Revenues and Gross Profit in 2013Free Cash Flow ValuationTaking a weighted average of free cash flows (2012 values worth three times more than 2010; 2011 weighted two times more than 2010), and using the growth rates and WACC previously found, the value of Rosetta Stone was estimated.Using the average growth rate, Rosetta Stone would be fairly valued at $504.5 million, valuing each share at $22.79, an increase of 33.9% from current prices, aided by their cash holdings and almost no debt. The fair price ranges from a low of $20.66 to an optimistic $24.52, assuming the growth rates and WACC are accurate. This will change if there are different estimates of free cash flow and growth rates. Given that there is a high level of variance in RST's historical growth rates, the value of Rosetta Stone may be lower than the most pessimistic estimate of $457.3 million due to risk-aversion. The company will need to be successful in increasing competitiveness through innovations, pricing, and marketing. As of April 30, 2013, 4.66% of RST shares were sold short. If RST stock increases, the shorts will be squeezed, adding to potentially greater share price appreciation.Until growth trends, based on Rosetta Stone's future earnings reports change, I believe that Rosetta Stone is undervalued, and still has high upside potential in 2013.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

387811,24491,2012-02-23T14:54:38-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Rosetta Stone's (NYSE:RST) case, we think the firm is undervalued. We think it is fairly valued at $12 per share, significantly higher than where it is currently trading. Our reports on Rosetta Stone and hundreds of other companies can be found here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth narrated presentation of our innovative methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Rosetta Stone posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting its undervaluation on a DCF basis, neutral relative valuation, and bullish techinicals. Though imperfect, our peer group consists of Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO), Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI), The 9 Ltd (NASDAQ:NCTY), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).Our Report on Rosetta StoneClick to enlarge images.Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsRosetta Stone earns a ValueCreation rating of excellent, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 99.2% during the past three years.Although we think the firm's DCF valuation indicates a potential attractive investment opportunity, we'd be more comfortable investing in the firm if it was more attractively priced on a relative basis versus peers as well. However, we're still considering it in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Rosetta Stone has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about -0.2% in coming years as it continues to invest in the period. The firm had no debt as of last quarter.The company's stock price has outperformed the benchmark during the last quarter, and its valuation still looks interesting at these levels. Investors could be accumulating shares, as the stock continues to trade at bargain-basement levels.The firm experienced a net income CAGR of about 72.8% during the past 3 years. We expect its net income growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Rosetta Stone's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 99.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of excellent. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Rosetta Stone's free cash flow margin has averaged about 9.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively strong. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. (For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website here.) At Rosetta Stone, cash flow from operations increased about 73% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 18% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Rosetta Stone's shares are worth between $9.00 - $15.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's medium ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $12 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 19.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 7.1 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 1.8% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 23.5%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of -1.5%, which is below Rosetta Stone's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Rosetta Stone, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $12 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Rosetta Stone. We think the firm is attractive below $9 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $15 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Rosetta Stone's fair value at this point in time to be about $12 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Rosetta Stone's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $16 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $12 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
312765,20545,2011-12-08T16:16:38-05:00,,"In the microcap world, channeling Ben Graham is normally a difficult proposition. When small- and micro-cap stocks trade at lower than their price to book value, its usually for one reason: lack of staying power. So its not often that you see recognizable brands trade below book value, much less brands that have best-in-class products. When companies with solid products trade at such a discount, it usually means an opportunity. At current levels, the opportunity in Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) is difficult to ignore.Rosetta Stone's share price has been battered over the past year with shares down 67%  as revenue growth has come to a screeching halt. The US military and other government agencies have cut back purchases of the premium-priced product as spending gets reigned in, and consumers also look less likely to break out their checkbooks to pay for a language software that costs five times more than most rival software. This has clouded the outlook for Rosetta Stone's shares, causing the company to be revalued from former growth king to struggling brand.Those are the negatives. But when we look at the valuation, its hard not to believe the worst is already priced in. The company sports $111 million in cash on the books, another $60 million in accounts receivable, and no debt. From a balance sheet perspective, Rosetta Stone can continue to operate at current levels for years without calling into question its ability to fund itself. But how does Rosetta Stone turn itself around?To be sure, part of the story is that a broader economic slowdown has hurt demand for a premium-priced product, and that an economic rebound would provide a much needed boost for product sales. But buying Rosetta Stone on the basis of an economic recovery is a bridge too far for me. Instead, I find the story compelling I believe Rosetta Stone can carve out efficiencies that would return the company to profitability even in the current economic environment.Looking at the financials, the answer seems pretty clear. Since 2008, revenue at Rosetta Stone is up 19%. SG&A, meanwhile, has exploded, up 38%. As the company has expanded its brand it has clearly run up against diminishing marginal returns in its sales force. Language software that costs $500 is always going to be a niche product, and Rosetta Stone's sales army is simply too expensive. The scope for cutbacks in the US appears substantial, even as the company continues investing in and growing its brand overseas.Having used the product, as well as several other language softwares, there is no question that Rosetta Stone has best-in-class technology and that nobody has yet replicated the Rosetta Stone experience at a lower price point. It is a strong brand, and for those willing to spend big money on language software, the product sells itself pretty well. The strategy of trying to force sales by beefing up the sales team has been ineffective and unprofitable, and my belief is that Rosetta Stone can return to a smaller and more efficient sales force without much damage to revenue.The scope for streamlining the business is significant, and along with international expansion, it provides upside for Rosetta Stone shares for years to come. Meanwhile, the downside appears limited as the company currently trades below book value, has more than $5 per share of cash, and no debt. That kind of risk/reward is rarely found among solid small-cap brands, and any small victory is likely to send Rosetta Stone shares sharply higher.Disclosure: I am long RST."
278737,24627,2011-07-10T08:53:47-04:00,,"Rosetta Stone, Inc. (NYSE:RST) offers learning programs for many different languages.  In the past year, RST's shares have ranged from $12.57 to $25.66, so they are currently trading fairly close to the lows.  Even at these lower levels, the stock appears to be overpriced and could see significant additional downside.This is based on a number of factors, including disappointing financial results, forward earnings estimates, and a high price to earnings ratio.  The consensus earnings estimates call for a loss of about 85 cents for 2011 and only a small profit of 37 cents for 2012.  RST shares currently trade at around $14.70.  Based on these estimates, even if you ignore the expected loss for 2011 and look forward to 2012 earnings estimates of about 37 cents, this gives a price to earnings ratio of nearly 40 times forward earnings.The company recently posted financial results which saw a drop in revenues and losses.  The press release stated that ""the net loss in the three months to March 31 came to $9.3 million, or 45 cents per share, reversing a net profit of $5.0 million, or 24 cents per share, a year ago""  and that ""revenue fell 10 percent to $57.0 million from $63.0 million.""

225915,23522,2010-09-19T08:02:16-04:00,,"I am  willing to bet that once you hear the name Rosetta Stone, you  automatically associate it with learning a foreign language. Rosetta  Stone (NYSE:RST) has done a tremendous job of marketing, and today, it is the most  recognized brand of language learning products in the United States. The  results are evident because since 2004, revenues have increased from  $25.4 million to $252.3 million in 2009, which represents a tenfold  increase.The company uses a unique method known  as Dynamic Immersion to teach adults new languages. This method is  modeled after the way children learn, with no grammar or explanation but  with practice and context. It uses images, text, and sound to teach  vocabulary terms and grammar naturally. Rosetta Stone’s customers  include individuals and institutions such as schools, government  agencies and corporations.HistoryThe company was founded by Allen  Stolzfus, after a frustrating experience trying to learn Russian in a  classroom setting. He had already experienced learning a second  language, German, while living in Germany, and because of this, he  believed that immersion was a much more effective method that allowed  him to learn in the same way he had learned his native language.As a result, he came up with the idea to  create a system that would simulate the process that he used to learn  German through computer technology. However, he needed help and he  approached his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who had an advanced  degree in computer science. Unfortunately, this was during the 1980s  when computer technology was not as advanced as it is today. Allen had  to wait until 1992 for the technology to develop to meet his vision.Finally, he and John started the company  and named it Fairfield Language Technologies. Allen also recruited his  brother Eugene Stoltzfus to be the company’s first executive vice  president. Soon after, they released their first product and named it  Rosetta Stone. This was a clever idea because the Rosetta Stone was the  key to finally deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, which many scholars had  tried to decipher for hundreds of years. With this name they were going  to unlock the secret to learning a foreign language.In 2002, Allen passed away and his  brother assumed the leadership role until Tom Adam became the company’s  CEO. In 2006, the company was sold to ABS Capital Partners and Northwest  Equity Partners who renamed the entire company Rosetta Stone. In April  2009, Rosetta Stone became a publicly traded company with the ticker  symbol RST. IndustryThe worldwide language industry is big.  Based on the Nielsen survey, in 2007, people and organizations spent $83  billion to learn languages. However, the United States represented only  6 percent of the total and Rosetta Stone derives more than 90 percent  of its revenues from the United States.I believe that the worldwide language  industry is going to keep growing because our world is becoming more and  more globally integrated. People are learning new languages to advance  professionally, conduct international business or travel the world.For many years, Americans didn’t need to  learn foreign languages because everyone else was learning English.  Now, with business becoming more global with countries such as India and  China establishing themselves as major players, many Americans are  starting to realize that they need to learn other languages to stay  competitive. Even though the language industry is likely to grow  worldwide in the future, it will probably grow faster in the U.S.  because so many Americans are behind when it comes to learning new  languages.StrengthsRosetta Stone’s greatest strength is its  brand name. Like I said before, when you hear the name Rosetta Stone,  you automatically associate it with learning new languages. For many  people who want to learn a new language, Rosetta Stone is most  definitely one of the options that they would consider.The company has done a tremendous job  with marketing and has built its brand into a household name. This  allows it to charge a lot more for its products than competitors. The  company also has a great direct distribution model. While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) sell Rosetta Stone’s products, the majority of  revenues come from its direct distribution model through the company’s  website or mall kiosks. The direct distribution model allows the company  to have higher margins than competitors who rely on third-party  merchants to resell their products. WeaknessesWhile the company’s marketing efforts  created the most recognized brand in the language learning industry, I  believe that the need to rely so heavily on marketing in order to  maintain its brand name and to grow is a major weakness. If the company  suddenly stopped its heavy marketing, revenues would deteriorate  significantly. This was evident recently when it experienced some  marketing mistakes which caused it to miss revenue estimates. I will  discuss this issue in the performance section.Rosetta Stone tries to differentiate  itself by teaching the Dynamic Immersion method. While this might be  viewed by many people as a strength, it could became a major weakness in  the future. Currently, the company is capitalizing on it because when  you hear an ad that offers immersion in a new language and describes its  method as one that teaches you in the same way child learns, it implies  that this is a superior method. However, after using the product, some  customers have become more acutely aware that adults do not necessarily  learn in the same way that children do. As an adult, you are more likely  to benefit from grammar and translation, while children are more like a  blank slate, lacking the ability to understand more in-depth  explanation. As an adult, you already know a language that can be used  as leverage to learn another language.I can relate firsthand because I had to  learn English as a second language. I studied English in Poland before I  came to the United States but because I never got any practice and was  not immersed in the language, I could barely even say “Hello.” My  learning started when I was thrown into a class with Americans. However,  it didn’t come without grammar and translation. Every day, I had to go  home and use a dictionary and study grammar. The combination of grammar,  translation, and immersion made me learn the language. So when Rosetta  Stone says that you can learn a language without grammar and  translation, I must question it.Fortunately, for Rosetta Stone, its  clients are mainly Americans who are pretty uneducated about the process  of learning a new language because most of them have never really had  to do it before. Everyone else around the world learned English instead.  Now, the world is changing and Americans are realizing that they will  have to learn another language to stay competitive. As of now, Americans  are still an easy target for companies such as Rosetta Stone whose  marketing implies that learning a new language is fun and easy and can  be done just like a child. But what happens when Americans realize that  learning another language takes a great amount of discipline, time and  effort, and learning like a child is ineffective and wastes time? What  happens when another competitor with greater financial resources starts  running ads telling customers to “learn a language the way it works –  like an adult, because you are not a child?” Rosetta Stone is going to  have a harder time increasing sales, and marketing dollars will produce  fewer and fewer sales.You might say that Rosetta Stone has  tremendous opportunities overseas because it derives less than 10  percent of its revenues from outside of the U.S. I agree with this, but  remember – foreigners are not uneducated about the process of learning a  new language. Many of them already did it before and telling them to  learn like a child might not yield the same results.Performance As I mentioned before, the company  increased revenues from $25.4 million in 2004 to $252.3 million in 2009  which is an incredible performance. Net income increased from $1.9  million in 2004 to $13.9 million in 2008 and dropped to $13.4 million in  2009.When the company went public on April  15, 2009, it was one of the hottest IPOS of the year. There was so much  hype that the stock price increased 39.6 percent during the first day of  trading. By May 5, 2009, shares were trading 75.9 percent higher than  the IPO price of $18 per share. However, by September 2, 2010, the stock  price was below $18 per share. What a disappointment! The reasons were  lackluster sales and the departure of two high level executives. The CEO  explained that sales were disappointing because of changes in the  advertising market. The company usually buys cheap advertising at the  last minute on TV and the prices of these advertising spots suddenly  increased. As a result, the company cut back on advertising and this  hurt sales. This is why I was saying before that its heavy reliance on  marketing expenditures is the company’s biggest weakness. The moment it  reduces or stops advertising, sales decline. ConclusionRosetta Stone has great brand  recognition. It operates in an industry that is likely to grow  domestically and internationally. So far, however, it has been a  disappointment for the investing community, but if it can continue to  grow, it will probably benefit them. For me personally, the negatives  outweigh the positives, and I will stay on the sidelines.Disclosure: The author does not own RST"
254253,22201,2011-02-22T18:11:58-05:00,,"<< Return to Part IThis article continues my series about Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) by analyzing the competitive landscape of its industry: Language-learning materials. Since even this sub-sector is quite broad, this article will focus on Rosetta Stone's closest competitors along with a couple other more tangential players.The first category of competitor consists of competing language courses. Simon and Schuster's Pimsleur (Simon & Schuster is a unit of CBS (CBS)) is a leading competitor in this category. Its programs help you to ""learn like a spy"" by using an auditive approach with 30-minute lessons where the user hears a prompt, says the answer and then hears a native speaker say the answer. If nothing else, users quickly develop a good accent. Pimsleur uses repetition to drill the material it covers. While it won't make you fluent, it will teach you 500 or so words to the point that you'll know them in your sleep, and unlike Rosetta Stone, it also effectively teaches some grammar points. Pimsleur is available in more than 50 languages. Due to its entirely auditory method of teaching, this course is extremely useful for commuters.The most comprehensive of the language courses out there would probably be Assimil. Of the popular ones, it is the only one I'm aware of that actually has taken a significant number of people to fluency without additional courses or classes. The French company that produces Assimil has been around since the 1920s and its well-respected program teaches several thousand words in each of the dozens of languages it offers while using a combination of audio and written dialogs to help users assimilate the language. For 65 euros (less than $100), users get a complete comprehensive course that will take them farther than Pimsleur or Rosetta Stone. One drawback is that it's not as fun as either of those other two.Another popular course is the Michel Thomas series of audio courses (Michel Thomas is a unit of McGraw-Hill (MHP)). These are a series of short (usually 8CD) courses that provide a wonderful and surprisingly painless introduction into grammar and sentence construction for beginners. I've seen people be able to string to together surprisingly complex sentences after only completing Michel Thomas' short audio course. Both Michel Thomas and Pimsleur directly compete with the audio-CD component of Rosetta Stone's software.A number of other comprehensive courses exist. For the sake of brevity, I'll only mention one more as it is especially alarming for Rosetta Stone investors. The Fluenz language-learning system was created from scratch in the past few years, it appears, as a direct attempt to beat Rosetta Stone at its own game. Fluenz has strongly marketed itself as a better alternative to Rosetta Stone and has received a number of high profile endorsements that seem to agree, along with raving reviews at Amazon.com. Fluenz is now appearing on high-profile outlets such as CNBC. Fluenz notably only offers four languages thus far as it takes the time to make a separate culturally relevant course for each language. This contrasts to Rosetta Stone which merely translates the text associated with the same ubiquitous pictures that Rosetta Stone uses for all its courses. If Fluenz is able to maintain its high product-quality across additional languages while maintaining its aggressive advertising, it could be a Rosetta Stone-killer.Since Rosetta Stone has entered the online arena, it now directly competes with Internet-based language-learning solutions. The most widely-known of the online competitors is LiveMocha, which has more than 8 million users learning more than 35 languages (LiveMocha also is preparing for an IPO). The site offers social interaction, classes and games among other features. Its worldwide Alexa rank is in the 4,000s, putting it far ahead of Rosetta Stone's website in terms of popularity. LiveMocha has also received at least $14 million of venture capital funding. If LiveMocha were to go public, it would serve a devastating blow to Rosetta Stone investors who think are invested in the only language-learning company out there.Another rising competitor is LingQ which is the cheapest of the paid online language sites. Many of its features are entirely free. The most innovative of these is the site's ""lessons"" which provide a native speaker's reading of a text along with a written transcript with a pop-up dictionary and a quick way to identify trouble words and make flashcards out of them. It's quite an innovation. The site also offers live lessons with native speakers and writing correction at prices much below Rosetta Stone.There are additional less obvious competitors to Rosetta Stone. For extroverts, Skype has emerged as a surprising free language-learning option, as many people have joined places such as LanguageExchange. This site helps match people trying to learn each others languages, for example a Brazilian wanting to practice English can call a Canadian wanting to learn Portuguese with Skype for free.The Web also provides tons of free or cheap blogs, forums and websites which have been increasingly able to replace language-learning courses. The combination of the forum at how-to-learn-any-language.com, Spanishdict.com, and the digital flashcard program Anki taught me more Spanish than anything I had to pay for.Of course, the traditional method of going to a tutor, university or community college for classes and lessons also provides competition to Rosetta Stone. Foreign language enrollment in U.S. universities continues to rise (particularly in languages that offer great career opportunities such as Mandarin and Arabic) and classes at community colleges have drawn renewed interest. Since Rosetta Stone's approach is quite different from a college, I won't discuss this source of competition at length.One note about many of these online competitors is that their Alexa ratings are far higher outside the U.S. than in the U.S. For example, LingQ is a top 25,000 or better site in Canada, Hong Kong, Ukraine, Belgium, Israel, Brazil and Russia - all significant markets. Rosettastone.com earns a worse Alexa rank than LingQ in each of the above mentioned countries. While Rosetta Stone may be more popular overall, it is because it has paid through the nose to establish a brand in the U.S. In overseas markets Rosetta Stone wishes to cultivate, it has already been beaten to the punch as smaller nimble competitors such as LiveMocha and LingQ which already grabbed the first-mover advantage and gained market share. Investors thinking that Rosetta Stone will effortlessly expand abroad will soon be disappointed.Despite Rosetta Stone's aggressive marketing strategy, the company faces intense competition, even in the U.S. market. There are numerous strong and creative competitors, and more like Fluenz will keep emerging if profit margins in the industry remain elevated. I visited my local Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) recently and found four racks of shelf space devoted to non-Rosetta Stone language products including Michel Thomas, Pimsleur, a variety of reputable Barron's and Lonely Planet products, along with dictionaries and grammar books. By comparison, Rosetta Stone had one rack and two end-caps. While Rosetta Stone is still the most prominent product you see in a bookstore's language section, competition is thriving, both at bricks-and-mortar locations and online.Rosetta Stone has not consolidated the field of language learning as investors had hoped it would. In fact, the industry appears to be fragmenting further with new online entrants and well-liked new courses such as Fluenz appearing on the market. The worst outcome for Rosetta Stone would be if a prominent competitor such as LiveMocha launches an IPO and disabuses investors of the idea that Rosetta Stone is the only significant language-learning company out there. In any case, Rosetta Stone will have to fight off increasing competition, both from other courses and from online offerings to maintain its profit margins and market share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: Author recently taught himself Spanish primarily with the help of Michel Thomas, Pimsleur and the above-mentioned websites along with some Spanish study at university.

272512,22201,2011-05-31T08:28:15-04:00,,"Investors have mostly shrugged off Rosetta Stone's (NYSE:RST) appalling first quarter results, released May 9. Rosetta Stone lost $9.3 million, or 45 cents per share. This result was much worse than the 33 cents per share loss analysts had forecast, and represents a huge swing from the same quarter last year, when Rosetta Stone earned 24 cents per share. Furthermore, RST announced that it expects to lose between 41 and 62 cents in the 2nd quarter of 2011 -- far worse than the 7 cent loss analysts had expected.Value investors have been drawn to Rosetta Stone for its debt-free balance sheet and well-known brand name. But it makes no sense to invest in Rosetta Stone as its business becomes obsolete. Unless RST completely overhauls itself and finds a new business model, it will soon become a digital dinosaur. Its shares represent a value trap rather than a genuine bargain. Here are nine reasons why the worst is yet to come for investors in Rosetta Stone.#1: Q1 was no aberrationRosetta Stone faces a powerful secular decline in its core business. For several quarters now, Rosetta Stone's management has tried to paint its worsening results as one-time events driven by outside events such as the recent attempt to blame the Borders bankruptcy for Rosetta Stone's problems in Q4 of 2010. But the truth is that Rosetta Stone's best days are behind it. The company's famed direct-to-consumer sales model (think Foreman grills) peaked several years ago. As Rosetta Stone saturated the market with advertising, its sales pitch lost effectiveness. According to Rosetta Stone's most recent 10-K, nearly 80 percent of Americans are familiar with the Rosetta Stone brand. The easy sales have already been made, as consumers who wanted Rosetta Stone software have, by and large, already purchased it. In addition, the whole software (including languages) industry has been in rapid decline in recent years.#2: Technological change threatens to make Rosetta Stone obsoleteRosetta Stone's core business – selling language software – puts it in the same place as Encyclopedia Britannica two decades ago. Then, Britannica's $500 encyclopedia sets' sales were at an all time high. Britannica's sales have fallen more than 80% as computers and then the internet destroyed its niche.Similarly, Rosetta Stone's niche – high-price branded language software – is being destroyed by the internet. Today, Rosetta Stone faces a strongly competitive market with challengers on many fronts. From other software publishers to downloadable smartphone apps to online language-learning sites, competition abounds. And, some people have decided language learning is no longer a necessity, given the increasing accuracy and speed of automated free translation from sources such as Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Translate.#3: Revenue decline is accelerating; consumer market hard-hitRosetta Stone has been experiencing falling sales across its spectrum of distribution channels; the headline drop in year-over-year revenue was 9.6%. The most shocking decline was the 73% plunge in retail sales to less than $3 million in Q1 2011 versus the same time last year. But all segments except institutional were stagnant or fell (and according to the company, institutional sales are expected to fall next quarter as well). The following table of Rosetta Stone's revenues by segment comes directly from Rosetta Stone's latest 10-K.[Click all to enlarge] In particular, it is worth looking at the decline in Rosetta Stone's retail sector. Retail sales dropped an eye-popping 73% from Q1 2010 to Q1 2011 from $9.6 million in 2010 to only $2.6 million in 2011. This is due to the massive underperformance of Rosetta Stone's products in the 2010 holiday season which led to much slower than normal reordering by retailers. But while the 73% decline is somewhat exaggerated, it is indicative of a larger problem. Retail software sales are in an unrelenting decline. The amount of shelf space across the electronics retailers is falling drastically. Retailers such as Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) have eliminated much of their shelf space for software and further cuts are likely forthcoming. You can't sell product without shelf space.It's worth noting that Rosetta Stone includes Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the retailer channel rather than a Direct-to-Consumer channel (according to its latest 10-Q, page 27) and so the 73% decline in year-over-year sales included Amazon purchases. Rosetta Stone's retail sales are not moving to the internet; they are simply disappearing.#4: Rosetta Stone faces sharp margin compressionIn the face of sharply falling sales, you'd expect that Rosetta Stone costs would also fall so as to preserve the company's margins. The exact opposite has occurred. Though revenues fell 9.6% over the past 12 months, costs of goods sold surged 32.6%, leading to a more than 6 point drop in Rosetta Stone's gross margin (86.3 to 79.9).#5: Operating expenses continue to riseHere is Rosetta Stone's table of operating expenses from its latest 10-Q:Companies can survive falling revenues if their management team handles its business wisely. However, Rosetta Stone's management has shown no monetary restraint over the past year – it has ramped up expenses on all fronts despite the 9.6% drop in total revenue.#6: Company using questionable marketing strategySales and marketing represents the worst offender among the rising costs. Rosetta Stone spent $9.5 million more on marketing in Q1 2011 than in Q1 2010 to achieve a $6 million drop in revenue. That's outrageous. Rosetta was long known for its excellent marketing campaigns. But its latest campaign has reversed that reputation. Rosetta Stone has run a campaign with the puzzling tagline ""Act like a baby."" Making matters worse, recent magazine ads for this campaign have featured naked babies looking at a computer screen. Very few people are going to plunk down $500 for a software program based on this advertising. See for yourself (this ad found in the April 2011 edition of National Geographic magazine):#7: Large management turnoverRosetta Stone had both its CFO and COO leave the company last year. CFO Brian Helman left in August 2010 and was replaced by former Fannie Mae CFO Stephen Swad. COO Eric Eichmann also left Rosetta Stone last summer, and his position was not filled – Rosetta Stone CEO Tom Adams assumed the COO's duties. It seems these departing top executives foresaw the massive problems that were developing with Rosetta Stone's core business.#8: Subscription model not workingRosetta Stone tried a subscription model as early as 2001, and phased out subscriptions entirely in 2008. But with the release of Version 4 TOTALe, the online subscription model has returned. It is unlikely to have any more success than it did previously.Already, we can see the subscription model isn't generating a whole lot of consumer interest. I've displayed four Alexa graphs for Rosetta Stone's web traffic. Since Version 4 TOTALe was released last fall, web traffic should have increased from fall 2010 onward, as subscribers go to Rosetta Stone's web site to use the online features. Instead, web traffic hasn't increased, and users are not viewing more pages or spending more time at Rosetta Stone's site:As you can see, the launch of Version 4 made no discernible impact on Rosetta Stone's web traffic. In addition, Rosetta Stone's free community/language games portal, Rworld, has seen its web traffic continue to trail far behind free competition. Rworld has failed to become any sort of significant social community like Rosetta Stone had intended. Almost a year into its latest online experiment, Rosetta Stone's efforts to expand from software into an internet presence have met with little success.#9: International growth is no magic bulletIt is unrealistic to think that international growth can reverse Rosetta Stone's fortunes. Unlike America, where roughly half of language learners want to learn Spanish, the global language learning market's demands are highly fragmented. The only other market that comes close to that of Americans learning Spanish is the Asian demand to learn English. However, it is highly difficult to monetize this demand, particularly in China, due to rampant software piracy. Rosetta Stone recently sued and won settlements from American software pirates. It would have no such luck in many overseas markets. Even discounting piracy, it is hard to see international growth working. Rosetta Stone spent a great deal of money and energy to build its brand in the U.S. It can't replicate that brand awareness throughout the world on a tight budget. If it wants to build a powerful Direct-to-Consumer business as it has done in the U.S., it will need to figure out the intricacies of overseas retailers, distribution chains, and foreigners' distinct tastes and preferences.These difficulties are already making their presence felt. Rosetta Stone's rising costs and operating expenses are largely due to the aggressive international expansion. And yet, despite the rising costs, revenues continue to fall. Going the way of the dinosaurJust as Encyclopedia Britannica has been decimated from digital competition, Rosetta Stone is also falling victim to technological change. The era of selling $500 software is over. Consumers want cheap or free alternatives. Rosetta Stone is far behind – its web presence is miniscule, and it is almost non-existent in the rapidly growing app space for smartphones and iPads. The company's attempts to switch to a subscription-driven model, combined with international growth are merely rehashes of previously failed strategies.While Rosetta Stone still has a respectable pile of cash on its balance sheet, the company's prospects are dim and growing dimmer. Management has performed poorly, and with the recent loss of both the CFO and COO, there's no reason to expect the remaining management team to regain its touch in the near future. The company's revenues are shrivelling, and Rosetta Stone continues to increase its costs rather than controlling them. The company's plan to save itself through international growth is truly a pie-in-the-sky vision. Rosetta Stone had a great business model years ago. But it has failed to adapt to changing times and is now merely a dinosaur heading toward extinction.An even longer version of this report can be found here.Disclosure: I am short RST."
172663,20856,2009-11-11T03:06:57-05:00,,"The company that allows you to “start learning a new language in less than 5 minutes” is having trouble communicating its message to Wall Street. During the third quarter Rosetta Stone Inc. (NYSE:RST) booked revenue of $67.2 million and earnings of $0.29 per share. The result showed growth over the same quarter last year, but failed to revive investor confidence which had been falling for several months.In August, ZachStocks discussed marketing expenses at Rosetta, explaining that the company was “purchasing sales” by exorbitant spending on sales and marketing in order to reach target revenue rates. While the targets were being hit, profit margins suffered and the stock took a significant hit when third quarter guidance was issued on August 17th. Last week when the company issued the actual third quarter report along with guidance for the fourth quarter, the stock once again gapped lower, this time violating the $18 IPO price.Once again, management tried to paint a positive light on the numbers, stating that the company saw strength in institutional and international markets while acknowledging that there were challenges with the US consumer. While the press release did not break out the international versus domestic sales figures, it did lay out the fact that 76% of sales come from consumers while only 24% are institutional. So it appears that the major portion of the company’s business is under pressure and unlikely to generate meaningful growth in the next few quarters.With Friday’s payroll report showing a worse than expected number of jobs lost and the unemployment level reaching 10.2%, it is unlikely the US consumer will add to sales for Rosetta. While the company was able to land a meaningful contract from the military this month, it is still an uphill battle to generate meaningful sales growth. International sales could pick up, but there is not significant strength in the global economy. One positive could be a weak dollar which makes international sales cheaper, but Rosetta has yet to prove that this source of revenue can add meaningful growth.Initial investors who bought on the IPO have to be extremely frustrated at this point. After experiencing more than a 75% increase within a few weeks of the offering, positive returns have now evaporated. As RST probes new lows and slides below the IPO price, there are now no investors who actually have a profit in the stock. Ironically, this is taking place at the same time the Dow is hitting new highs. As we mentioned in the ZachStocks Newsletter this week, investors are quickly fleeing risky assets and putting capital into blue chip investments. This doesn’t bode well for investors in RST.When discussing the stock in August, I mentioned that I would not be interested in buying the stock unless it reached $15. I stand by that statement but want to add a caveat. As we approach that level (which represents a 16% decline from the IPO price), I do not want to buy Rosetta simply because it reached that price level. In order to buy this name, I want to see a clear picture for how the company will grow revenue and translate that to significant earnings growth. Until the picture for the consumer picks up, or the company proves it can ramp up its institutional business quickly, there is too much risk to own this under performing stock.Disclosure: Author does not have a position in RST"
254261,22201,2011-02-22T18:19:13-05:00,,"<< Return to Part IIThis article continues my series about Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) by examining the company's three-pronged approach to reversing the declining trend in earnings and revenues. The company is seeking to diversify its revenue stream by getting more institutional and more international buyers for Rosetta Stone's software. The company has also made efforts to become an online player that can generate a predictable recurring revenue stream.As bullish fans of the stock, such as the Motley Fool, are most excited about the international element to the company's growth, I'll examine that first. Here's the bull case as laid out by Motley Fool Stock Advisor's Matt Argersinger, who said in a video pitch: It's true that Rosetta Stone has been growing international revenue at more than 100% a year recently. International revenue now accounts for 14% of the company's total revenue. Certainly if international growth keeps up at such a torrid clip, the company's future will be bright. However, I doubt that international revenues will keep expanding rapidly for long.The best thing in Rosetta Stone's favor is that its market penetration is still small enough that it can keep revenues rising just by offering the product in new markets. As best as I can tell, Rosetta Stone isn't even available on Amazon.com's Chinese or Italian websites. However, customer reviews on Amazon's other country sites (Japan, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom) have been less favorable than the reviews I found on Amazon's main American site.There are several reasons Rosetta Stone will be less popular overseas than in the U.S. The first of these is that competitors are far more entrenched. According to a 2005 U.S. Senate resolution urging more foreign language learning, more than 50% of Europeans speak a foreign tongue, while less than 10% of Americans do so. Since Rosetta Stone has almost no market penetration yet in Europe, we can safely conclude that one in two Europeans successfully learned a language using other means than Rosetta Stone. There's a long tradition of using courses, real immersion and other language-learning products in Europe and consumers are used to spending their language-learning dollars on things other than software. Rosetta Stone has to change entrenched consumer behavior to make headway there.This contrasts sharply with the U.S., where most consumers had no previous language-learning dollars, as most Americans have been content to be monolingual. It's much easier to convince an American to buy a Rosetta Stone software package when they've never tried any language learning before. It's much harder to convince an already bilingual European to trust software as compared to a method they've already used successfully. Europeans understand how to learn languages and as such, are less likely to be swept up by flashy advertising and huge promises.Rosetta Stone doesn't just have to overcome competition from traditional courses. Online language-learning websites such as LiveMocha and LingQ are far more popular overseas than they are in the U.S. and their websites garner more traffic in many countries than Rosetta Stone's site does.Also, Rosetta Stone faces another problem in that foreign consumers will demand more. Americans, so used to utter language-learning helplessness, are content (at least Amazon reviews would indicate) with software that doesn't bring them anywhere near fluency. Since English is all you need to survive in the U.S., this makes sense – there's no compelling need for fluency in another language here. But Europeans, Chinese or Indians buying Rosetta Stone's English software because they need it for their career or to study abroad are going to be much less tolerant of partial success. If a foreigner in a developing country buys Rosetta Stone English, it had better work. If English is the ticket to get to the middle class, Rosetta Stone's software better be more than an entertaining experience that teaches some handy phrases and basic conversational skill. As more foreigners buy Rosetta Stone, I expect it to gain negative word-of-mouth from foreigners who pluck down several months of income to buy a program that promises the world and doesn't give them fluency.In addition to the international market, Rosetta Stone is also targeting more institutional buyers. The company made a high-profile sale in New Jersey where a school district laid off foreign language teachers and replaced them with Rosetta Stone to save money. Proponents of the company envision this happening on a large scale. However, this dream is already fading. Institutional sales were much weaker than expected in 2010 as state governments faced widespread monetary crunches. States are not going to buy expensive software when the economy is down because they are broke, and they won't buy expensive software to replace teachers when the economy is up because the unions would have a fit. It's hard to envision our government bureaucracy willingly firing teachers and replacing them with computers as it just won't go over well with voters. However, Rosetta Stone will continue to gain some sales to the military and other such institutional consumers, though these are unlikely to be a game-changer for investors.The final tenet of Rosetta Stone's revitalization plan involves creating online recurring revenue. While focusing on international and institutional sales makes sense, this last priority just doesn't fly. The goal of a company that makes language-learning software should be to make its users fluent, right? If so, then why should there be recurring revenue? Rosetta Stone's software should make consumers fluent as quickly as possible. Once a consumer is fluent, they will no longer need the online service. While there are some people such as me who genuinely enjoy learning languages and could represent repeat business, most Rosetta Stone consumers are just going to learn the one language they need for work, a trip or to please a significant other and then be done. Once fluency is achieved, the subscription is terminated. You can't turn language-learning into DVD rentals; Rosetta Stone isn't going to be another Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Ironically, the online program provides a perverse incentive for Rosetta Stone to not improve its main program. The longer you need tutoring and other online services, the more revenue the company generates. Why make an effective program that leads people to fluency quickly when you can sell them an expensive program that only takes one part of the way to fluency and then forces them to pay you online subscription fees for years? Needless to say, the online initiative spotlights management's incentives. They are monetizing the inefficiency of their own program by tacking online services on as an additional fee to an already expensive software package. While that may be smart business strategy, it belies the inefficiency of the company's base software and should serve as a huge red flag for consumers who are considering Rosetta Stone over a competitor's language-learning solution.None of these strategies will likely turn Rosetta Stone's future around. While international and institutional markets will provide some growth in coming years, it's not at all certain that the growth will be sufficient to offset further declines in the American market. And the online effort is unlikely to be an overall financial boon. It will either fizzle out, or if it becomes successful, end up cannibalizing the main product. Since there are already numerous competitors in the online space and Rosetta Stone has to pay its tutors, online margins should be much lower than what the company gets on its famous yellow boxes. With margin compression and a continuing fall in overall revenues likely in the future, the trend in Rosetta Stone's shares should remain downward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
157025,20856,2009-08-19T09:36:15-04:00,,"Well, it took longer than I expected, but Rosetta Stone Inc. (NYSE:RST) is finally challenging its IPO price. In April, the stock was offered to investors at $18.00 which was above the posted range, and while the proceeds were more than $112 million, roughly half of the capital went directly to the selling shareholders. Shortly after the IPO, ZachStocks noted that RST had significant risk due to a high multiple and weakening consumer traffic in malls as well as airports where a significant portion of sales take place.After peaking at the end of July (at a gain of 83% from the IPO price) the stock has recently given up the majority of its gain and was especially hard hit Monday after a disappointing announcement. Management issued a press release, lowering profit guidance for the fourth quarter. Higher than expected expenses was the headline excuse for the miss, and great care was taken to explain that the lower profit was a result of increased expenses and not a weakening demand for the company’s language teaching products.According to the release, adjusted EPS for the third quarter will come in at $0.25 to 0.27 per share compared to previous guidance of $0.33 to 0.35. Even on the high end of the range, this represents a 20% decline which spooked investors enough to cause the stock to drop 27% in one day’s trading. For the year, RST is now expected to earn $1.14 to $1.18 although analysts now appear to be expecting much lower profits at $1.09 per share. While the information was certainly disappointing, management did the best they could to excuse the shortfall:Quite honestly, the expenses are more concerning than management is letting on. Since traffic in shopping malls and airports has become relatively weak, the company is struggling to find ways to compensate for this lost revenue. In order to track down more sales, the company has been allocating significant capital towards marketing to the point where it has crimped margins. It stands to reason that if you spend enough capital on marketing, eventually you will meet your sales targets. This is the argument that management is taking in explaining that investors should not be overly concerned with the lower profitability.Over time, if the cost of acquiring new customers becomes prohibitively expensive, the company will simply have to accept lower sales figures. But for the time being, the strategy is to buy sales and right now they are paying out the nose for them. Despite the sharp stock decline, I expect future weakness as investors grapple with the prospect of permanently impaired profits or sales (or both).Currently the stock is within striking distance of the $18 IPO price level. If it crosses below that line, you can quickly expect shareholders to bail as they lose patience with a “round trip” IPO. The company is still profitable and has a low debt level which should help to cushion the blow to some extent. But until demand picks up (without increasing marketing budgets) and the company can regain margins, I would not be interested in owning the stock anywhere above $15.Disclosure: Author does not have a position in RST"
253914,22201,2011-02-20T04:57:29-05:00,,"I've long held to the opinion that companies who differentiate themselves based on flashy advertising, rather than on product quality, are bound to underperform. While there are exceptions, such as the Coke (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) duopoly, advertising, by and large, will only get you so far if your product does not outshine competitors' offerings. Rosetta Stone's (NYSE:RST) investors are starting to learn this the hard way, as the company's sales are starting to slide and earnings have all but disappeared.Friday's dismal guidance from the company highlights the increasing peril the company finds itself facing. The company announced preliminary fourth-quarter results with earnings coming in at a very soft 23 cents a share versus expectations of 28 to 38 cents a share. This compares to 58 cents a share for Q4 of 2009 and 29 cents for Q4 of 2008. Earnings are already below even 2008 levels and falling further with a loss expected next quarter. The company blamed soft US consumer demand for the earnings miss along with the recent Borders bankruptcy filing (more on this in a minute).Revenues also fell below even the low end of the company's previously stated expectations. This quarter adds another data point to the developing trend of consistently falling revenues for Rosetta Stone. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $78 million and Friday's announcement stated that the company expects roughly $74 million for the same quarter this year.While surprising to some, this lowering of guidance should not be surprising. The company has long been relying heavily on marketing to try to make a splash in the insanely crowded and competitive market for language learning products. The company's 10-K (see here) was incredibly prescient in laying out the very risk factors that have led to this quarter's massive earnings miss and now reads with hindsight as an eerily dark prophecy.Among the risk factors, the 10-K stated:This has absolutely been a problem. Rosetta Stone appears to have saturated the market with their advertising and demand has declined. Rosetta Stone earned more in Q4 of 2008, when the economy was in crisis, than in Q4 of 2010 when things had turned around. US consumer demand this past holiday season wasn't particularly soft in general, just soft for Rosetta Stone. This is a failure of Rosetta Stone's marketing team to execute.Another risk factor stated that:The 10-K also noted Rosetta Stone's numerous well-respected competitors, stating:>> Continue to Part II"

The company originally filed to go public in April of last year. Now its offering may get a boost from the Obama administration's plans to use more commercial satellite imagery for intelligence gathering, says The Wall Street Journal.

156588,21481,2009-08-17T14:53:01-04:00,,"Ugly news from Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST). The language-study software company reduced earnings guidance for the current quarter and full year. Interestingly, it is not because of a dropoff in sales. The company explains that it is a mix of higher than expected costs to get its new products to market, as well as a pretty serious marketing screwup.“During the current quarter, the company has incurred higher sales and marketing costs and higher product development costs than previously anticipated,” stated Mr. Helman. “In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we frequently test new types of marketing media. In the current quarter, we experimented with a significant amount of internet and television test marketing programs and we did not expeditiously terminate certain of those programs that were not yielding acceptable results. We also changed our media mix, increasing radio and long-form television as a proportion of the mix, which resulted in lower than expected returns during the current quarter.”Mr. Helman further stated, “Due to the success of Levels 4 and 5, which we just released in English (US) and Spanish (Latin America) in May 2009, we have accelerated product development expenses in order to expedite bringing four additional languages to market in levels 4 and 5 prior to the 2009 holiday season.”While the company kept revenue guidance in tact, these marketing issues are signaling that those revenues are getting harder to come by. Aware that this announcement would spook the street, a group of selling stockholders decided that this is not the time to unload their shares -- only a WEEK after filing to do so.

Now while the deal rate is still well behind the levels seen in the middle of this decade, the trend is certainly encouraging. And not only are the deals getting priced, but at this point all three deals are trading above their offering price - a positive sign of demand.Rosetta Stone Inc. (NYSE:RST) was the most recent company to come public and the stock was met with energetic buying. According to the prospectus, the stock was expected to price between $15 and $17. This range is usually driven by the underwriter’s analysis of the company and the price at which these underwriters believe they can sell the right amount of stock. There is a fine line with these pricing ranges because underwriters want to get the most they can for the company selling shares (Rosetta in this case), but they also want to make sure investors who buy on the deal get some initial profits. Otherwise it will be difficult to sell the next deal that comes down the pipeline.When the time came to actually price the deal, Morgan Stanley and William Blair & Co. actually had enough buyers to sell the stock for $18 - and they were able to get $6.25 million shares sold for a total of $112.5 million before underwriting commissions. Half of the proceeds will go directly to the company, with the other half paid to selling shareholders (the original owners of the company).Rosetta will use about $10 million to repay debt, another $8 million for tax withholdings, and will have the flexibility to use the rest of the capital as they see fit. While the successful launch of the stock is certainly a positive sign for the market (along with the IPO of Changyou.com (NASDAQ:CYOU) and Bridgepoint Education (BPI)), RST may be vulnerable to a sharp pullback in coming weeks. Typically there can be a good bit of excitement surrounding such an offering - especially when the market is trading sharply higher as we have seen in the past 5-6 weeks. But IPOs often need some time to cool off before establishing a strong upward trend.The Wall Street Journal compared RST to Intrepid Potash Inc. (NYSE:IPI) which also saw significant gains in its first day of trading. However, IPI still took more than a month to consolidate those gains before pushing higher, and after that the stock dropped more than 80% from June to December of last year.Rosetta earned just 68 cents per share in 2008, and has noted that weakening traffic in malls and airports could hamper growth. Yet the stock is trading for more than $28 per share as I write which is quite an aggressive multiple. Obviously the company is young and could grow tremendously in the coming years, but the stock is priced so that there is significant risk to investors.Another problem with new issues is the lack of visibility. Research firms who know the company the best are currently in the silent period and not allowed to issue recommendations. Once this silent period is over, they still have a conflict of interest which may bias their opinion to reveal more positive facts about the company and less of the risk. Until the stock has been trading for a few months, it may be difficult for the average investor to get quality information on the company.During strong bull markets, IPOs usually offer great investments for supercharged returns. But in today’s volatile (and arguably overbought) market, the potential for gains may be dwarfed by the risk. It may be difficult to borrow shares to short RST until the stock has been trading for a week or so, but at some point over the next week will likely become a good candidate to play from the short side. I truly enjoy investing in IPOs during favorable market conditions, but the opportunity in RST does not currently appear very attractive. Disclosure: Author does not have a position in RST."

Pricing had been expected between $15-17.  The shares will begin trading on the NYSE under the symbol “RST” Thursday morning.The strong pricing of this I.P.O. shows how hungry the market currently is for growth companies.  While most consumer oriented companies are happy to simply make estimates these days, Rosetta Stone has been growing its revenues mightily the past few years.  In 2008, RST’s revenues grew 52% to $204 million, with net income of $13.9 million.While these numbers are impressive, one has to wonder why insiders are selling 3 million shares in this I.P.O.  If business is poised to keep growing, why would they be selling so much stock themselves?Even with these insiders ringing the register, I still think the stock is a buy Thursday on the opening as long as you can get it for under $20.  With the market devoid of many niche growth companies, look for institutional investors to jump right into RST on the opening Thursday and for a quick move into the mid-20s by next month.  While it is not the next Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Netscape, buying RST for under $20 Thursday seems to offer a good risk/reward on a trade that will not blow up on you and should provide you with quick upside as the market rewards any and all companies that are able to grow nicely through this recession.Disclosure:  I am not long the stock but will be Thursday morning as long as I can get stock for under $20."
131398,20145,2009-04-17T05:19:12-04:00,,"On April 6, Bill Simpson wrote an analysis of Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST). In their market debut Thursday, April 16, shares finished their first day of trading up nearly 40 percent. The company opened trading at $25, on the morning after it priced its IPO at $18, exceeding the estimate range, and it sold 6.25 million shares, netting proceeds of $112.5 million.The text of Mr. Simpson's original writeup follows:• • •Rosetta Stone plans on offering 7.25 million shares (assuming overallotments exercised) at a range of $15-$17. Insiders will be selling 4.125 million shares in the deal. Morgan Stanley and William Blair are leading the deal; Jefferies, Robert Baird, and Piper Jaffray co-managing. Post-ipo RST will have 20.3 million shares outstanding for a market cap of $325 million on a pricing of $16. The bulk of ipo proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.   ABS Capital will own 25% post-ipo. ABS Capital is also the majority shareholder of 2007 ipo American Public Education (NASDAQ:APEI).   From the prospectus:  'We are a leading provider of technology-based language learning solutions. We develop, market and sell language learning solutions consisting of software, online services and audio practice tools primarily under our Rosetta Stone brand.'  RST's language learning approach does not utilize the traditional second language approach of translation or grammar explanation. Instead, RST utilizes audio & video to replicate the natural language learning ability that children use to learn their native language. RST calls their proprietary language learning approach 'Dynamic Inversion'. RST currently offers their self-study language learning programs in 31 languages.   Language Learning - Children learn their native language without using rote memorization or adult analytical abilities for grammatical understanding. They learn at their own pace through their immersion in the language spoken around them and using trial and error. They do not rely on translation. Traditionally the majority of second language learning programs in/out of the classroom have focused instead on translation, grammar and rote memorization. The majority of alternative second language courses have focused on in-country immersion and private study, both expensive alternatives to the traditional memorization approach. RST's solution brings the immersion approach to one's computer.  Rosetta Stone solution - As noted above, RST aims to replicate the process in which children learn their native language. The student learns at their own pace. The RST content library consists of more than 25,000 individual photographic images and more than 400,000 recorded sound files. Each language has 1-3 proficiency levels which can be purchased individually or bundled. Individual proficiencies (such as Spanish I) retail for approximately $250 while the complete language bundle (Spanish I, Spanish II, & Spanish III) retails for approximately $550. Each proficiency level offers approximately 40 hours of instruction. In addition, RST offers an online peer-to-peer practice environment called SharedTalk, at www.sharedtalk.com, where registered language learners meet for language exchange to practice their foreign language skills. During 2008, RST had more than 100,000 active SharedTalk users.   Effectiveness - According to a self-commissioned study, after 55 hours of Spanish study using Rosetta Stone, the learning was sufficient to fulfill the requirements for one semester of university study.  Sector - RST generates 95% of revenues in the US. The US language learning industry generated $5 billion in revenues in 2007, of which $2 billion was for self-study. Assuming these numbers are correct, RST has approximately a 10% share of the self-study revenues in the US and is the far and away leader in their niche.   Customers:  Consumer sales accounted for approximately 80% of 2008 revenues. Direct-to-consumer channel sales accounted for 58% of consumer sales. These are sales made via RST's website or call centers. RST's 145 retail kiosks (located in airports and malls) accounted for 22% of consumer revenues and sales to retailers accounted for 21% of consumer revenues. The bulk of retailer sales were to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), and Borders (BGP).  Institutional sales accounted for 20% of 2008 revenues. Primary/secondary schools represented 44% on institutional sales, government & armed forces 19%, homes schools 20% and businesses 10% and non-profits 5%.   60% of RST customers earn more than $75,000 annually with 44% earnings more than $100,000. In a self-commissioned study, 92% of respondents expressed satisfaction with RST products and 76% have recommended Rosetta Stone to others.  Growth potential - RST feels their growth prospects going forward lie in the international markets. In 2008, just 5% of RST's revenues were derived outside the US.   Risk - 80% of RST's revenues are derived from US consumers. The big risk here would be a recession negatively impacting consumer discretionary spending coupled with a slowdown in international travel. We've certainly seen the first with consumer discretionary spending falling off a cliff in mid-September 2008. As RST is the first consumer discretionary ipo in quite awhile, this is a definite concern.Lets look at RST's 4th quarter of 2008 and see if revenues were impacted. In the 4th quarter of 2008, RST booked their best quarter in operating history in terms of revenues while maintaining gross margins and dropping sales and marketing expense in terms of percentage of revenues (a positive). Now seasonality plays a factor here, as the 4th quarter annually has been RST's strongest due to holiday spending. RST, however, booked very solid revenue growth in the 4th quarter of 2008, much as they did a year prior in the 4th quarter of 2007. Quarter to quarter revenue growth in the 4th quarter of 2008 was a strong 11%, compared to 4th quarter of 2007 quarter to quarter revenue growth of 24%. Factoring in a near doubling of the revenue base in 2008 coupled with the difficult consumer spending environment in late 2008, the 4th quarter of 2008 for RST looks strong to me.   Returns - RST offers a 6 months 'no questions asked' money back guarantee on their products. In 2008 approximately 6% of all revenues were returned.   Competition - Berlitz International, Simon & Schuster, Inc. (Pimsleur), Random House (Living Language), Disney (NYSE:DIS) Publishing Worldwide and McGraw-Hill (MHP) Education. There is no pure public comparable to RST.  Risk – As mentioned, 80% of customer base in 2008 were individuals. As a result, RST revenues could be affected by any trend changes in discretionary consumer spending and retail shopping patterns. Slowdown in international travel too carries a risk due to sales from airport kiosks forming almost a fifth of consumer driven revenues.   Financials  $2.67 in cash per share post-ipo, no debt.  Growth has been very strong in the past two years. As is often the case with software related ipos, gross margins are also impressive. Revenue growth was 50% in 2007 and actually increased in 2008 by 52% more. Rarely do you see a company deriving significant revenues and accelerating revenue growth year to year. That RST did so in a tough consumer 2008 environment is very impressive. The revenue growth here the past two years with back to back 50%+ growth is easily reason enough to recommend this ipo.  Seasonality - RST's best quarter tends to be the 4th quarter annually as they derive holiday related revenues.   RST's first profitable year was 2007.  2008 - Revenues were $209.3 million, a 52% increase over 2008. Gross margins were fat at 86%. As one would expect, sales and marketing expenses make up the bulk of RST's operating expenses. While in 2008 sales & marketing expense ratio was 45%, it did mark a decrease from 2007's 48% and 2006's 50%. Good sign, all things being equal, you want to see sales and marketing expenses growing slower than actual revenues, allowing a company to filter more of those revenues to the bottom line. Operating expense ratio is also decreasing annually, exactly what one wants to see. Fast growing revenues and declining operating expense ratios are the ingredients of a top notch ipo. Operating expense ratio in 2008 was 72%, compared to 79% in 2007 and 80% in 2006. This number is still quite high in 2008, however the trends are improving and if RST can continue at this pace over the next 2-3 years, they will become a very profitable operation.   2008 operating margins were 14%. Plugging in anticipated post-ipo tax rate of 37%, net margins were 9%. Earnings per share were $0.91. On a pricing of $16, RST would trade at 17-18 X's trailing earnings with a 50% trailing revenue growth.   2009 - I just do not feel comfortable forecasting another 50%+ jump in annual revenue for 2009. Having written that, RST is poised to have a very strong 2009. In what was a difficult environment in 2008 with consumer discretionary spending falling precipitously overall, RST shined. Looking at quarter to quarter revenue growth at the end of 2008 and factoring in seasonality with a much slow first half of the year for RST historically....I would project very conservatively that RST can grow revenues 20% in 2009 to approximately $250 million. Gross margins should remain strong and I would project operating expense ratios to continue to decline, increasing operating and net margins. On a $250 million run rate, with 86% gross margins, 16% operating margins and 10% net margins, RST would earn $1.23 in 2009. On a pricing of $16, RST would trade 13 X's 2009 earnings.   Conclusion  How has RST thus far managed to sidestep a massive consumer spending slowdown? 22% of RST buyers responded in a survey they did so based on the personal recommendation of another. That is pretty powerful word of mouth marketing when annual revenue tops $200 million. Digging into this ipo, the one constant appears to be customer satisfaction driving growth. You really could not ask for much more with a consumer based ipo. RST looks poised to grow strongly in 2009 and is trending well in every facet of their business. If RST is able to build on their United States success globally over the next few years, this could be a huge long term winner coming public at just a $325 million market cap (based on a $16 pricing).  RST is a unique, and difficult to value, sector leader with fast growing revenues, strong gross margins and improving operating expense ratios. All this equals a top-notch ipo. If RST can continue current trends for even another 2-3 quarters, the range of $15-$17 here is far too low. This is a strong recommend in range and one to pay up for if need be. The CEO describes his company as a 'disruptive value proposition' in language learning. I agree."

255176,23469,2011-02-25T18:47:03-05:00,,"ProfileRosetta Stone Inc. (NYSE:RST) is a technology-based language learning provider that develops, markets and sells its own language learning software through packaged software, online services and other practice techniques. The company offers products in 31 languages. The software uses Dynamic Immersion, which eliminates translation and grammar to work on speaking the language over all other techniques. The company markets to individuals, institutions, businesses and government agencies. The company went public in 2009 and is headquartered in Arlington, VA.ThesisThe language business is surprisingly larger than one might expect with some $30B in global sales and training to learn other languages. One company that has attempted to leverage the educational process into a profitable corporation is Rosetta Stone. The company, which went public in April of 2009, has thus far been successful with being profitable, but the company faces a major concern about its growth capabilities. These concerns weigh on the stock, and until they are solved, the upside to the stock is limited.Our current position on the stock as a Hold represents our concern that the company is facing a declining to stagnant retail market that limits growth potential combined with uncertainty about the company’s ability to grow internationally and institutionally. The company in its Q3 and expected Q4 saw a significant drop in the retail side of the business despite the release of the company’s Version 4 of Totale software, which combines an online software capability with real tutors and conversation practice. The company had a disappointing Q3, but only two weeks of Totale release were factored into that result.This month, however, the company reduced expectations for its Q4, which does not bode well for the results of Totale showing much growth for the company. While the lack of growth does not mean that the company cannot maintain profitability and be a company that offers similar stagnant results, this does not bode well for stock growth. The company has shifted its focus from the retail sector to the international and educational institution side of the business, which are both a small part of overall sales.The international language learning business is far greater in size than the U.S. market, and this represents a great growth possibility for Rosetta Stone. The only issue is that the company has not proven it can be successful in international markets for a sustained period of time. The company has seen growth in this market YoY, but as that pies grow, the retail pie drops in the U.S. A sustained level of growth here needs to match domestic sales and grow significantly to raise share valuations.Further, the company believes that Rosetta Stone can be a useful tool in the classroom. There is definitely some major potential for this to occur, but the product does not currently supplement a teacher. Rather, Rosetta Stone is an either/or sort of software. The company would be much more attractive if it worked more like a textbook industry offering software that worked hand-in-hand with instructors. Nothing in the pipeline seems to be like this, and until that occurs, its growth on the educational institution may be limited.Even with growth of 5%-7% in operating income in the next few years, this stock still seems a bit high at current prices. We are not ready to value this as a sell given the fact that the company is still navigating toward what its business will be in the future. Yet, if the company cannot adopt programs that are more attractive to educational institutions and grow its international presence substantially, it will be stuck in the teens to single digits.One positive that the company has going for it is that they have maintained strong cash flow and strong gross margins. As the company can grow its presence, these two factors signal that the company’s top line and bottom line will both be positively impacted. The company operates a FCF margin above 13%, which is very positive, and they have a gross margin nearing 90%, which is also outstanding.Further financials can help us paint a more realistic picture of Rosetta Stone’s potential. While the company has significant gross margins, operating margins are drastically lower at only 11% in the TTM. The problem here is that has significant S,G, and A costs and has to put a lot of money into developing product that causes operating margins to be much less than gross margins. This is not a significant issue only in that the bottom line will continue to struggle unless they can raise these margins.The company is growing its ROE and ROIC, which are both positives and solid reflections on the management, as the company is bringing a better return on all investments. They dipped in 2009 when the company went public, and the growth since its IPO is positive to see.Additionally, the company shows solid financial health. The company has no debt, and they operate a healthy current ratio of 2.23. The company’s quick ratio is very positive at nearly 2 as well. We want to see 2 and 1 for these ratios, respectively.One of the signs of weakening retail market, though, is seen in the company’s efficiency. They have increasing days sales outstanding, days inventory, and cash conversion cycle in the last year. All three categories have went up with days inventory growing from 76 to 101. That is a pretty significant growth and that means the company is holding product on shelfs longer than before.Overall, Rosetta Stone is a company right now that offers a quality product, but that does not simply translate into positive stock. What the company needs to show for its stock valuation to be tremendous is that they can sustain growth at more than 5%-7% in the next few years. This will mean a significant introduction into international markets that has not yet occurred.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

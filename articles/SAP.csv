4361474,103480,2020-07-28T15:53:51-04:00,"SAP has emerged as one of the safest, ""sleep at night"" tech stocks in the market.
        The company continues to grow its cloud business, capitalizing on its existing dominance in ERP.
        Cloud margins and operating profits all swung sharply upward in q2.
        SAP's decision to re-take Qualtrics public (likely at huge profit to the acquisition cost) may also drive optimism for the stock.","SAP (SAP), the world's largest maker of ERP software and a significant heavyweight in other areas like procurement, HCM, and customer experience management, continues to prove to the world that it's one of the most durable software stocks in the market. While the rest of the world economy is still struggling to recover from the impacts of the pandemic, SAP continues to roll on in ""business as usual"" fashion, executing well in the current quarter while still driving toward its long-term target of tripling cloud revenues by 2023.SAP was one of the first large-cap enterprise software companies to report earnings in Q2. As usual, SAP offered no major surprises, but shares dipped ~2% in the aftermath, likely due to profit-taking after SAP has already enjoyed one of its strongest first-halves of a year in recent history, with shares already up ~20% year-to-date.In spite of that year-to-date strength, the best move for investors is to continue holding onto SAP for the long term. My bullish thesis on the stock is underscored by several key drivers:SAP isn't as exciting to invest in as a high-profile, high-growth software stock, but it has proven over the past several years to be consistent in delivering market-beating gains thanks to its strong and steady execution. Continue to hold on for the long term here. Let's now dive into SAP's most recent second-quarter update in greater detail. The quarter highlights are shown in the snapshot below:Figure 1. SAP 2Q20 resultsSource: SAP 2Q20 earnings releaseAs can be seen above, cloud remains the big highlight for SAP, with revenues growing 21% y/y to €2.04 billion. The effect of shifting customers over to the cloud and away from upfront bookings drags down the license piece of SAP's revenue (-4% y/y), but the company was still able to maintain overall growth at +2% y/y.A couple points of strength to call out in the quarter. SAP's core ERP system, S4/HANA, saw its customer base grow by 20% y/y - which is quite significant for a longstanding product. Across the overall product, SAP noted in its quarterly commentary that ""business activity gradually improved over the course of the second quarter"" and that software license revenues ""while still below normal levels, recovered more than expected."" SAP additionally noted that the company's process of closing deals and onboarding customers is largely continuing in business-as-usual fashion, with the company onboarding 17k new customers in Q2 and with go-lives in cloud products happening in weeks, versus months previously. SAP also made some COVID-19 specific tweaks to its product portfolio, giving open access to SAP Ariba Discovery that allows procurers to seek immediate sourcing needs, and also working with Deutsche Telekom to develop the official coronavirus tracing app of Germany, which has been downloaded 16 million times. To take SAP's growth further, the company intends to double down on verticalized, industry-specific solutions - a playbook that has been more widely used among large cloud companies like Salesforce.com. Per CEO Christian Klein's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:We also note tremendous profitability gains in the quarter. Despite the impact of the coronavirus in the early part of the quarter and the associated hit to software license revenues, SAP managed to lift its overall cloud gross margins by 160bps y/y to 69.5%, while smaller gains in software license margins also allowed SAP to expand its total gross margin up 120bps to 72.6% in the quarter.Figure 2. SAP margin trendsSource: SAP Q2 earnings deckAlso owing to the fact that its sales teams were grounded and unable to travel, SAP also managed to reduce its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue by 2.6%. This, in turn, helped to produce tremendous cash flows, which in the first half of 2020 are up 59% y/y to €3.12 billion:Figure 3. SAP cash flow trendsSource: SAP Q2 earnings deckWe note that this represents a rich 23.5% FCF margin, sharply higher than just 15.3% in the year-ago quarter. In recognizing its FCF strength in the quarter, SAP also lifted its full-year FCF outlook to €4.0 billion (+76% y/y), higher than its prior outlook of €3.5 billion.With continued volatility in the markets - especially recently with sharp, unexplained pullbacks in tech stocks - it's wise to bank on large, proven quantities like SAP with demonstrated progress in increasing cloud operating leverage and boosting cash flows. Stay long here."

As they push for greater cloud uptake, this will only increase margins and thus profitability. Being a European multinational software firm could mean that it has a better position in regards to the current US and China tech trade issues. But management must prove execution in this ongoing turbulent climate. SAP has a proven track record spanning decades during which they have developed enterprise software that form the backbone of many firms. These offerings cover database and database management (SAP HANA), Analytics (BusinessObjects BI), Enterprise Resource Planning (S/4HANA), Human Resources (SuccessFactors) and also Procurement (Ariba, Concur). In addition, SAP offers services and support for their portfolio of software and technology. This provides another avenue of revenue.It’s the biggest company by market cap trading on the German DAX, the largest software company in Europe, and has over 440,000 customers in over 180 countries worldwide.The last decade saw the market cap of SAP triple to today’s nearly $195 billion. Along the way, they have been making some major acquisitions and paying top dollar too. The notable purchases have been Sybase (bought in 2010 for US$5.8billion), SuccessFactors (bought in 2011 for US$3.4 billion), Ariba (bought in 2012 for US$4.3 billion), Concur (bought in 2014 for US$8.3 billion), Callidus Software (bought in 2018 for US$2.4billion) and another 2018 purchase was Qualtrics (bought for US$8 billion).These are not small sums of investments and market reaction was not always positive on announcement of the news. Also, such regular outlays serve to keep the company in integration mode rather than focusing on improving the current situation. Indeed, it is with this backdrop last year saw the arrival of Elliot Management into SAP. The activist investor revealed in April 2019 that it had taken a 1.2 billion Euro stake in the software giant.Since then, there have been some notable changes at the firm, including the departures of the CEO, CTO, initiation of a buyback scheme, implementation of a cost-cutting scheme and initiation of a strategic review.Let’s talk about the cloud, le mot du jour for the market, and for SAP this is no exception. There has been a clear concerted effort over the past few years to increase revenue from the cloud, a reported $70 billion was spent over the last 10 years investing in this transformation. This can be no clearer seen than by the management incentives set for the executive board, including CEO Christian Klein. Initially beginning as co-CEO in October 2019, he has since taken over the single CEO role as of May 2020. Given his short tenure so far in the corner office, any judgment of his performance would be unfair, but what can be clearly identified is the emphasis on increasing cloud revenue.The headlines of the Q2 2020 quarterly result immediately emphasis the cloud results:Source: SAP Quarterly Statement Q2 2020This emphasis and aim to increase the cloud revenue can also be seen in the compensation package for the executive board. The 2020 Short-term Incentive compensation package will be calculated based on the following factors:Source: SAP 2019 Integrated Report75% of the financial KPI for the executive board is related to improving cloud revenue.This concerted effort for greater cloud revenue is part of their longer-term aim:More predictable revenue is defined as: the sum of the cloud revenue and the software support revenue. Therefore, the share of more predictable revenue is defined as: the total of cloud revenue and support revenue divided by total revenue.Source: SAP 2019 Integrated ReportThe prediction for 2020 was a more predictable revenue of 70%.This strategy should provide for a more stable and consistent earnings view which can only be of benefit for the market valuation of the firm given that reoccurring revenue either through subscriptions or, in this case, support contracts removes some investor uncertainty.It is the aim of the firm to additionally improve cloud gross margins. As mentioned above, the goal is to reach 75% by 2023 and the table below shows the development over the last 5 years:Source: SAP 2019 Integrated ReportOverall, we see a firm that has a clear strategic growth focus on cloud and support related revenue. Indeed, the structuring of the executive board incentives and the stated 2023 aims underline the trends started in previous years. Elliott Management is well-known for taking stakes in firms where they believe there is potential for greater returns that should be unlocked by management. In order to achieve this potential, all options are on the table and past deals have often seen changes in the executive board post activist investor stake. This is not necessarily a bad thing, indeed, in this case, it could be said that after years of growth acquisition, a stronger focus on improving margins may well be a better allocation of resources.Competition is never too far away, and as the recent headline grabbing Snowflake (SNOW) shows, it is not necessarily always existing large cap corporations that may provide this rivalry. However, the current landscape is such that the majority of SAP’s rivals are North American companies. As part of their long-term incentive program, SAP itself lists its peer group as the following:Source: SAP 2019 Integrated Report All these listed peer group competitors are American and, as mentioned in the introduction, SAP is the largest European software company. I only mention this given the backdrop of the ongoing US and Chinese trade tensions and the benefits this may endow SAP within this scenario. China is, of course, a huge and growing market which was predicted by the prior CEO Bill McDermott to emerge as the largest market for SAP by 2025. The situation as it is between the world’s two largest economies has seen reports stating that some of SAP’s North American competitors being blocked from dealing with Chinese firms. This includes, for example, Microsoft (MSFT) denied business with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) saying Chinese state-owned firms will no longer allow them to bid on contracts because of trade tensions.Most recently, there has been reporting of a Chinese Blacklist of U.S. companies, although details of exactly which firms are affected are currently unknown.It’s not all straight-forward for SAP since it may face some restrictions on its products, especially those produced in the United States, but overall, the company has many offerings where these restrictions would not apply. A distinct advantage over its rivals given today’s political setup.The dividend policy of SAP is to pay a dividend totaling 40% or more of profit after tax.This has led to increasing payouts each year, shown below:Source: SAP Investor Relations siteIf estimations and the aims of the company’s future plans bear fruit, then one could reasonably expect the payouts to steadily increase in future too.The dividend yield over the years does not give much to write home about:Data by YChartsBut as mentioned, expectations of a reliable, consistent and increasing payouts should mean that any investment in the firm today would naturally lead to increased yield in the future.Like a lot of known tech companies, SAP’s stock price has shown solid growth over the past few years. Over the last 5 years, the stock price has had an impressive 140% improvement. However, when we compare the stock price development versus the highest-weighted named peers of SAP (Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Microsoft, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)), then we see that SAP has only outperformed IBM and Oracle:Source: TradingViewThe TTM P/E ratio of SAP currently stands at 36. Concentrating on the better performers from above (Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce), we see that Microsoft also has a TTM P/E of 35, Adobe has 59 and Salesforce of 92.It should be noted that neither Adobe nor Salesforce pay a dividend.Looking at the historical P/E valuation of SAP, we see the following:Source: TradingViewLooking historically, we see that SAP has a 5-year P/E high of just over 46 and a low of 23. Its current valuation puts it exactly in the middle of these two points.Without going into in-depth comparisons, at current prices, it’s hard to argue why one should favour SAP over, say a Microsoft, when both show comparable P/E valuations at the moment.However, SAP has certain things going for it such as its growth in the cloud which is set to continue and should be coupled with improving margins. Its positioning as a non-American tech company may prove advantageous with the current trade tension climate which we now see spilling over into the usage of specific apps. It has a consistent and growing dividend payout which should also not be sniffed at.When viewed against its historical valuation, its current pricing is not by any means cheap, but this is a company to keep an eye on, and if valuations become more tempting, then this is a stock that could provide tech diversification away from the mainly US companies and still deliver decent future growth."
4361148,65243,2020-07-27T17:42:02-04:00,"SAP managed to steadily grow its revenue in the past and reported strong Q1 and Q2 numbers.The company co-developed a ""corona-warning-app"" on behalf of the German government.Restated guidance for 2020 is only slightly lower than the original one.","The German multinational corporation SAP SE (SAP) offers enterprise software for industries and major businesses that provides them with an integrated management of resources and processes such as distribution, accounting, customer services, procurement and many more. As well over 70% of world's transaction revenue is made via a SAP system (according to the company), this underscores that their software is an all-weather product portfolio that should be profitable even in hard times like a pandemic. Furthermore, its Hana software is one of the most advanced database system currently on the market. Further analysis of their balance sheet and their newly reported numbers gives a furnished proof of this thesis.SAP SE is well known for its profitable business. A quick look at their balance sheet reveals a steadily improving revenue over the last five years. The relatively high net income results in a net profit margin of 14.7% in 2015, 16.5% in 2016, 17% in 2017, 16.5% in 2018 and 12% in 2019. The fact that their TTM net profit margin is again greater than 15% makes it a reasonable assumption that 2019 was somewhat of an outlier. This might also be due to the fact that in the same year costs for research and development increased by 16% compared to 2018 that increased their overall operating expenses for the same period.This success story is also reflected in the company's stock price. In Fig 1. one can clearly see how SAP outperforms its competitors in regard to their stock appreciation.Fig. 1Data by YChartsEarnings per share increased from $2.78 in 2015 to a level of roughly $4.00 in 2017 and 2018. Again, we see a decrease in 2019, yet a strong rebound TTM. The book value per share steadily increased from $21.09 in 2015 to $28.89 in 2019. The current PE ratio of their stock hovers at around 40, while the PE ratio of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which also offer integrated cloud services, is 13.7 and 31.3, respectively. SAP's quick ratio oscillates between 1.05 and 1.58 since 2015, while the TTM quick ratio stands at 0.99 as the company seems to be fairly leveraged. So, what is the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on SAP's business?On behalf of the German government, SAP, Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF) and minor partners teamed up to create a warning app that lets its users know whether they came close to a person who got already tested positive. The app has been developed within 50 days and is available on Google Play both for iPhones and for Android. It has been downloaded more than 8 million times by the midst of June. It can be run passively in the background without using up an enormous amount of the battery, so that users will not have to suffer a large decrease of their phone's capacity.As data protection is a major issue in the current political climate of the European Union, the app is specifically designed to meet the strict EU policies and regulations on that matter. A user does not need to give away personal information. Neither an e-mail address, nor a name or even a birth date is required in order to run it. The app generates random codes that are passed from phone to phone. The codes themselves make it impossible to track the device behind the code. Creating this app, Deutsche Telekom and SAP actively cooperated with the German Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (Federal Office for Information Security). While the German government commissioned the app, its use is voluntarily. The credo is this: It will already be effective, if the majority - not necessarily all of the citizens use it.However, their app is not free of criticism. According to the German newspaper tagesspiegel, the development already cost the German government roughly €20 million (roughly $23.4 million), whereas 47.5% of the amount were paid to SAP, and about 39% were paid to Deutsche Telekom. Yet, critics pointed out that total costs for the app could amount to more than €69 million (roughly $80.7 million) until the end of 2021. Major costs will likely incur for maintenance and anti-hacking provisions (Source).Another point that got criticised in the app's early days was the fact that the app didn't actively warn some users when they came close to a contagion risk, but only after they actively started the application. Both the German government and the developers ceased to inform the app's users immediately.Yet the fact remains that the app is regarded as highly efficient and as a success story - both for SAP and for Deutsche Telekom.When former CEO Bill McDermott purchased the American Qualtrics, a market research firm, many investors were appalled by the high price of that acquisition of $8 billion. An acquisition of this magnitude set a new record for SAP SE. Many doubted that Qualtrics would ever turn out to be that valuable as McDermott seemed to believe. Some say, the company's plan to let their acquisition go public seeks to at least ameliorate the former CEO's decision. SAP, however, states that this strategy could give Qualtrics some more opportunities to grow their customer base and product. SAP's current CEO, Christian Klein, affirms that this decision has been made in accordance with Qualtrics' management. (Source)Whether this strategy will be profitable for SAP in the long run or not remains to be seen. Yet, one should note that Qualitrics' revenue also rose by 34% in Q2 '20. And despite the fact that Qualtrics will be able to raise more capital with its IPO while diluting its ownership at the same time, SAP will remain the majority owner of this company. So, if the company finally turns out to be as profitable an investment as McDermott has thought, SAP will still be able to reap its benefits.Despite the ongoing crisis, SAP managed to report a very strong first quarter of 2020 and even an impressive quarter-on-quarter growth when compared to Q1 '19. Revenue increased by 5.2%, while total operating expenses are down by 3.9%. And although that net income was negative in Q1 '19 (-$127.9 million), it was well positive in Q1 '20 with $897.1 million. That was Q1!Q2 is even better: Numbers just reported of the second quarter are strong as well. According to the dpa, net income increased by 52% on a quarter-to-quarter basis to €885 million - that is roughly $1.039 million. Revenue increased by 34%. (Source)SAP is known for its relatively stable net income that can be easily seen in Fig. 2. Whether the company remains to be as stable despite the pandemic remains to be seen. However, its newly reported numbers make this very likely.Fig. 2Data by YChartsAlthough these numbers seem very impressive given the fact that the pandemic hit most companies of the German DAX, the company slightly lowered its guidance for 2020. While according to the original guidance revenue was expected to be in between €8.7 billion and €9.1 billion (roughly $10.18 and $10.65 billion) at the end of the year, this prospect is now lowered by 4.6% to a range of between €8.3 and €8.7 billion (roughly $9.71 and $10.18 billion). According to the company, this guidance factors in a rebounding demand in Q3 and Q4 and no lockdown at the end of the year.One major reason for the company having lowered their guidance this April was the weak revenue coming from their software licensing business that plummeted by 18% due to the pandemic. On the other hand, this was still a non-negligible improvement compared to Q1 and gives investors a good reason to believe that the second half of 2020 will be even stronger in terms of profitability.Despite the fact that SAP slightly lowered their guidance for 2020, the company proves to still be a profitable business that provides its customers - including the German government - with attractive software solutions. Even though the licensing revenue took a hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic, investors saw a profound recovery as early as Q2 '20 in their licensing business. The road ahead still looks bright for the biggest constituent of the German DAX."
4382005,35181,2020-10-28T07:24:28-04:00,"SAP Q3’20 quarterly results disappointed investors and the share price plummeted 23%, stemming from lower-than-expected revenue and lowered guidance. ‘Ambition 2023’ has now become ‘Ambition 2025’.Several factors given for the results, including currency headwinds, reduced transactions due to Covid-19, business model transition, and strong Q3’19 comps.The big worry is that SAP has been slow off the mark with its own business transformation and is missing the opportunity presented by the pandemic.SAP is the second-largest European technology company, dominates ERP, and has a plan that should see strong results starting in 2023.The current drop in share price is an opportunity to get in at a fair price. Long SAP.","(Source: shutterstock)SAP SE (SAP) is the talk of the town, but for all the wrong reasons. The positive sentiment that management had exuded during the prior-quarter Q2’20 earnings call was noticeably absent in the Q3 earnings call released on Monday. There was not only a shortfall of revenue in the latest quarter but also a cut in guidance. To make matters worse, the company's business transformation, referred to as ‘Ambition 2023’, is now called ‘Ambition 2025’, after being pushed back by two years.But it gets worse. SAP management has warned investors that they should expect subdued revenue and depressed margins until 2023. Clearly, something went amiss or changed in Q3 to change management’s message of optimism from the previous quarter. Needless to say, Mr. Market was not happy with the quarterly presentation and SAP’s share price dropped 23% in Monday’s market. The stock price has fallen to a local support level of ~$115. If this level does not hold, then the next stop down is ~$95.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Up until Monday, it appeared that SAP was one of the safest investments around. After all, it is one of the largest European technology companies and completely dominates the Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) market. The company has a large stable of partners and software applications, is very profitable (unlike most software companies), and pays a dividend.But appearances can be deceiving as confirmed by Monday's activity. Instead of torturing readers with a rehash of what went wrong, I am going to direct you to an excellent article by Gary Alexander titled ‘SAP: I See No Reason At All To Panic’. This article explains the Covid-19 impact, reduced transactions, FX headwinds, and SAP’s shift to the cloud. I would like to make one additional comment in that Q3 was being compared against strong comps from the previous year (Q3’19).Apart from the disappointing results, there is one big concern that has arisen and that is that SAP may be missing a huge opportunity during the pandemic as a result of its current (chaotic) business model, which is primarily perpetual sales of isolated software applications.One of the big-ticket items that SAP has on the go, of which there are many, is its own transition to becoming an end-to-end business transformation platform in the cloud. This is a multi-year activity that is currently in progress.The result will be a big improvement over the current situation which consists of a collection of isolated software applications, mostly acquired via acquisitions and run at various locations. The cloud-based business platform will make it easier to grow and expand customer relationships by way of cross-selling and up-selling. And as other SaaS companies have discovered, recurring revenue is a lot more profitable than perpetual sales as the customer lifetime value increases significantly. Originally, the shift to the cloud was to be (essentially) complete in 2023, but with the ongoing pandemic, the end date has now been pushed out to 2025.(Source: SAP)SAP management has warned that revenue and margins will be impacted up until 2023 during the initial phase as perpetual licenses with upfront revenue recognition are replaced by recurring revenue spread across the duration of the contract. This is a known phenomenon for S/W businesses that are converting to a SaaS business model.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 170+ stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward gross profits estimate, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how SAP stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the accepted valuation.In this instance, SAP is positioned near the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is fairly valued relative to its peers. I have also accented large platform providers salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) comparison purposes. Salesforce.com appears to be slightly undervalued whereas ServiceNow is somewhat overvalued but perhaps deservedly so due to its financial performance and expected future growth.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability.For the time being, I am foregoing my normal Rule of 40 calculation and instead presenting a similar forward-looking calculation that I refer to as the Efficiency Score Estimate (“ESE”).The ESE is based on analysts’ estimates mean value of next year's (""NY"") sales growth plus NY earnings margin. The formula for earnings margin is:100% * (NY EPS estimate * shares outstanding) / NY sales estimate(Source: Portfolio123/private software)As can be seen from the above chart, the ESE for SAP is approximately 30%, about average for stocks in my custom software universe. Keep in mind that analysts’ estimates are usually quite conservative and 30% on a forward-looking basis is the new 40% for historical data. And as I stated before, SAP’s business transformation is inhibiting its revenue growth; so all-in-all, SAP’s ESE score is not all that bad.The ESE score suggests that this company has an average balance between growth and profitability as compared to the rest of the stocks in the digital transformation stock universe. Both salesforce.com and ServiceNow score higher than SAP, but then again, they are not transforming their business models.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in SAP. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent of the dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Technology stocks were performing well beyond what many analysts considered acceptable valuations. It wasn't long before the market turned into a disaster, and the same could happen here, although I believe that there is much more substance behind the internet companies than existed 20 years ago.SAP's future performance is very much tied to economic recovery. No one really knows how long the recession will persist or how deep it will get.This investment also depends on SAP’s own digital transformation. It has already been pushed out by two years and this could happen again depending on how the pandemic plays out. If the company doesn’t shift to the cloud fast enough, it could lose market share as a business transformation platform.With $31 billion in annual revenue, SAP is one of the largest technology companies in Europe. Until recently, many investors considered SAP to be a fairly safe investment. But with the release of SAP’s Q3’20 quarterly earnings report all of that changed. The investment community reacted strongly, and the stock quickly sold off by ~23%. The selloff was in reaction to falling revenue, reduced forward guidance, and the delayed completion of the company’s transformation. In addition, alarm bells were going off over the fact that SAP may have missed the boat with pandemic-related opportunities as the company has been slow to provide a cloud-based business transformation platform. The company’s slate of isolated products is not conducive to capturing business related to the work-from-home seismic shift.In my opinion, the recent price drop is an opportunity to get in on a stable long-term investment at a good price. SAP is the dominant player in Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”). This alone provides the company with a good starting point in the war of large SaaS platforms as the company will inevitably bump elbows with the likes of salesforce.com and ServiceNow as they expand outside their original applications, encroaching on each other's territories.Investors need to understand that SAP is an elephant, and elephants cannot turn on a dime. But once this company gets moving on its cloud-centric applications then it will be growing by double-digits for the foreseeable future. The company is increasing its profitability and free cash flow and revenue will start to take off in 2023. I believe that the depressed stock price is a good opportunity to enter into a long-term investment. For these reasons, I am giving SAP a Buy rating."
4370984,104608,2020-08-26T19:03:53-04:00,"SAP reported Q2 revenue and margins that were above expectations as cloud revenue showed strength during the quarter.Management reiterated 2020 guidance, which now seems somewhat conservative, and also reiterated their 2023 ambition goals.Valuation has expanded quite a bit, and at ~28x forward P/E, I find it a little challenging to put new money to work at current levels.","The coronavirus has caused several companies to emerge as leaders in their respective industries, and SAP (SAP) has ridden the wave of strong cloud performers. The company recently reported Q2 revenue that was slightly above expectations and margin expansion that was also better than expected. The company's strong cloud and software presence has helped insulate their revenue from material deterioration during these challenging times.In addition, the company reiterated their 2020 guidance, and while some investors may have looked for a slight guidance raise, given the quarterly earnings beat, I believe management left some conservatism in the guidance. 2023 ambition goals were also reiterated as the company maintains their bullish outlook over the next few years, especially around cloud growth.Data by YChartsData by YChartsSince reporting earnings a few weeks ago, the stock is only down ~3% as investors were likely expecting a little bit more in terms of a guidance raise. Nevertheless, the stock has remained a clear winner over the past year and is up nearly 20% so far this year. Investors who have patiently held on to this stock have been nicely rewarded.However, with a strong bullish performance also comes higher valuation. While I believe, over the long term, the company's cloud revenue growth will propel both revenue acceleration and margin expansion, I believe valuation has reached a level where new money should be a little cautious. The stock currently trades at ~28x forward P/E, where, in the past, the stock has tended to trade close to ~24x P/E.Yes, the higher valuation is somewhat warranted, given the strong operating performance over the past several quarters and bullish outlook. However, investors should be cautious with new money.During the quarter, overall revenue grew by 1% in both constant currency and in reported terms to €6.74 billion, which was slightly ahead of expectations for ~€6.70 billion. While revenue growth did decelerate from the 5% constant currency growth last quarter, the economic environment was much more difficult in recent months.Source: Company PresentationWhile growth across the different geographies varied, the one common denominator was, cloud revenue continues to drive growth across the globe. For example, cloud revenue grew 13% constant currency in the Americas, 18% constant currency in APJ, and an impressive 29% constant currency in EMEA. Even though overall revenue growth was slightly above 0%, the strength in cloud should reassure some investors that were concerned that cloud revenue would not hold up during more challenging economic times.Source: Company PresentationOperating margin during the quarter came in at an impressive 29.1%, which was ~180bps higher than the year ago period of 27.3%. The two biggest drivers behind the margin strength during the quarter are cloud and less discretionary spending. Cloud revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than the company's overall revenue growth. With cloud having higher margins, this means that, over time, margins should expand higher as cloud revenue represents a greater portion of overall revenue. Also, the company spent a lot less on discretionary items, such as travel and entertainment expenses.With revenue coming in slightly better than expected and margins remaining strong, this led to EPS of €1.17 for the quarter, which was ahead of expectations for €1.14.Source: Company PresentationDespite the many uncertainties in the global economic environment, SAP was able to reaffirm their 2020 guidance in addition to their 2023 ambition targets. The strength and resilient nature of cloud revenue was likely one of the main reasons why the company was able to reiterate their previous guidance ranges. With cloud revenue expected to represent ~30% of overall revenue and cloud/software revenue representing nearly 85% of overall revenue, the highly recurring nature makes it easier to predict revenues.Below is an excerpt I’ve previously discussed concerning the company’s 2023 ambitions:Even though the company beat quarterly expectations on top of reiterating both their 2020 guidance and 2023 ambition plans, investors seemed to feel only mediocre about the results. Since reporting earnings, the stock has fluctuated up and down, though currently remains down ~3% from pre-earnings levels. However, the stock has been a great pick throughout the global pandemic market shakeup, with the stock up nearly 20% so far this year. I believe investors have realized that SAP can deliver good growth trends, led by strong cloud solutions.With 2020 guidance being reiterated, I believe this should give investors underlying confidence in the business throughout the remainder of the year. While many investors were likely looking for a raise, this could also mean that guidance for the rest of the year is a little more conservative now than it was just a few weeks ago.Data by YChartsThe above peer group has seen their valuation expand quite a big since the late March/early April lows a few months ago. Investors quickly realized that these large-cap software companies have the wherewithal to withstand a significant economic shock without needing to alter their long-term strategy or trajectory.While the 2020 guidance seems to bake in some level of conservatism, I am more satisfied with the 2023 ambition goals being reiterated. This essentially means that management does not believe the current health pandemic will cause any material changes to the company's longer-term goals. Cloud revenue will continue to be one of the biggest revenue growth and margin expansion drivers for the company over the next several years, and investors will closely follow any trends in the market.Nevertheless, while I do like the company a lot over the long term, valuation has reached a level where I would not put new money to work. Though the company's bullish cloud revenue may signal revenue growth acceleration on top of continued margin expansion, investors need to weigh that against relative valuation.The stock has been a winner so far this year, and investors should continue to hold onto their positions in their portfolio as this name is a long-term winner. However, investors should use a little more caution if looking to put new money to work, given current valuation has expanded quite a bit over the past several weeks on top of strong cloud trends.Risks to the company include cloud revenue growth decelerating either due to increased competition or a change in market preference. In addition, if the company is unable to successfully expand their margins over time, investors may punish this stock. Competition could also increase during times of uncertainty, and newer, more specialized technology companies could increase the level of competition."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Up until the third quarter, SAP (SAP) had been one of the least volatile and most predictable software stocks in the software sector. The German-based software maker, which just underwent a torrent of recent leadership changes (longtime leader Bill McDermott left SAP to take the top job at smaller company ServiceNow (NOW), replaced by a brief dual-CEO model, then finally reverting back to a single CEO) and is best known for its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, has been hit heavily by the pandemic, especially by the rise in COVID-19 cases in its domestic European markets. Add that on top of existing instability due to the company's planned transition toward becoming a predominantly cloud-based vendor, and we have a lot of volatility in near-term results that investors have rejected. After reporting Q3 results and making a surprising guidance cut, shares of SAP plummeted more than 20% - one of the stock's worst one-day performances yet.Data by YChartsTo me, this drastic stock price crash is a dramatic overreaction to SAP's latest update. While it's true that the company's revenue decline is rare and surprising, I'm less inclined to put much stock in near-term results for two obvious reasons:Though I'm disappointed in SAP's quarterly print and its accompanying guidance cut, I hardly think the cratering share price is commensurate. In my view, the long-term bullish thesis in this stock remains unchanged: SAP holds a leadership position in many areas of software, including ERP, supply chain, procurement, HCM, and many other categories - giving it ample opportunity to expand its wallet share within its existing customer base.The bottom line here: Investors who are already holding positions in SAP shouldn't be afraid to hold on to this stock, and those who have been waiting for an entry point in SAP have a rare opportunity to nab the stock on a huge dip. Let's kick off the discussion with a look at the weak areas that sank SAP's stock. The Q3 earnings highlights are shown below:Figure 1. SAP Q3 highlightsSource: SAP Q3 earnings materialsSAP showed a rare decline in revenue this quarter, sinking -4% y/y to €6.54 billion. This was a substantial miss versus Wall Street's expectations of €6.85 billion (+1% y/y), and representing six points of deceleration versus 2% y/y growth in Q2. Similarly, SAP's closely-monitored cloud revenue line saw growth of only 11% y/y to €1.98 billion, a dramatic slowdown in growth versus 21% y/y in Q2.Here's the point that investors should be aware of, however: this growth slowdown, as well as the accompanying guidance cut, can be explained by very specific drivers:None of these factors, in my view, has any bearing on the quality of SAP's products or its long-term traction with customers. Let's review them each in turn.Unlike many other SaaS companies that price exclusively per seat (as in, $30/user/month or something similar), SAP has several products - and in particular, Concur - that generate revenue based on the volume of transactions on the platform. For those who are unfamiliar with Concur, this application is one of the leading tools for T&E (travel and entertainment), and it's priced on a pay-as-you-go model that is directly impacted by the stoppage of business travel around the globe. Concur makes up a hefty ~15% of SAP's cloud revenue. As you can see in the segment results below, Concur revenue fell -15% y/y in Q3, while all other revenue categories maintained positive growth:Figure 2. SAP Q3 results by segmentSource: SAP Q3 earnings materialsChristian Klein, SAP's CEO, expressed confidence that Concur's recovery is just a matter of timing, and excluding Concur in this quarter's results, SAP's cloud revenue would have seen normalized ~20% y/y growth. During the Q&A portion of the Q3 earnings call, Klein remarked:The second driver behind SAP's revenue miss is a far steeper than expected currency impact - which, again, I view as an external and non-fundamental factor that will course-correct over time. The strengthening of SAP's native euro currency versus the dollar (the euro has risen from ~$1.10 at the beginning of the year to ~$1.18 now, a ~7% jump. As of the time of writing, the euro has outperformed the gains in the S&P 500!) has hurt SAP's reported revenue. In the absence of currency impacts (sized at roughly 4 points of growth), Q3 revenues on a constant-currency basis would have been flat instead of -4%. SAP is carrying this FX headwind forward into Q4 as well, another driver behind the FY20 guidance reduction.Figure 3. SAP FX impactSource: SAP Q3 earnings materialsThe third headwind to revenue is SAP's cloud transition. As seasoned SaaS investors are aware, transitioning from on-prem license revenues to cloud subscriptions will actually hurt revenue growth in the near term - because the lumpy boost of revenue that would have happened in a single quarter or year is now spread out into several years. In the slide below, SAP illustrates a typical on-premise deal involving a large year 1 revenue gain followed by several years of thinner support revenue. In contrast, a cloud deal bakes in a higher and more stable recurring revenue base over every year, but without the Y1 bump. Figure 4. SAP cloud transition - customer revenue exampleSource: SAP Q3 earnings materialsSo counterintuitively, the better SAP is doing at migrating its customers to the cloud, the less favorable its near-term revenue will be. Though uncomfortable for earnings in the near term, we've seen with other companies that have successfully completed this transition like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK) are eventually rewarded with leaping share prices.In the end, SAP's Q3 miss was also accompanied by a reduction in its FY20 outlook, with the company now forecasting €8.0-€8.2 billion in cloud revenue, or 14-17% y/y growth (a five-point reduction at the midpoint versus the prior outlook, driven by the Concur slowdown as well as FX impacts). Total revenue, meanwhile, is now forecasted at €27.2-€27.8 billion or -2% y/y to +1% y/y growth, representing a two-point reduction in growth at the midpoint driven by Concur, FX headwinds, plus the headwinds from converting license revenue to cloud.Figure 5. SAP 2020 guidance updateSource: SAP Q3 earnings materialsIt's important to note that it isn't all bad news, however. SAP has continued to overachieve on profitability and cash flow, primarily driven by a reduction in sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue. In spite of the revenue cut, SAP has boosted its free cash flow expectations for the year to €4.5 billion, versus a €4.0 billion outlook previously. And while SAP has flowed forward some of the recent near-term weakness into its ""Mid-Term Ambition Plan"" (which it has not refreshed prior to the full brunt of the coronavirus hitting), the company is still expecting to approximately triple its cloud revenue to >€22 billion by 2025.Figure 6. SAP medium-term outlookSource: SAP Q3 earnings materialsWhen we take a step back from the near-term disappointments that SAP delivered, we're still looking at a global software giant that has massive growth ambitions in the cloud and is already deeply entrenched in more than a few critical areas of enterprise software. Hold your nose and dive in; treat the dip as a buying opportunity."
4382108,105625,2020-10-28T13:01:39-04:00,"SAP cuts guidance significantly for this fiscal year and the following years.SAP's cloud backlog is shrinking.Long term, the company continues to be well-positioned to profit from the cloud.The current valuation is modest and creates a sufficient margin of safety.","Europe's largest software company SAP (SAP) released their third quarterly report of the fiscal year 2020 on Monday, and the market did not like it, sending SAP's stock down 22%. Just like other tech stocks, SAP's stock price recovered at an incredible pace after the COVID-19 dip and hit a new all-time high just months later, but now SAP's stock is ready to break this year's lows.There were two surprises for the market at SAP's third quarterly report:Let's start with the cloud backlog. Like many other software companies, SAP built an extensive cloud platform over the last few years for enterprises. The cloud has been SAP's growth darling, and investors saw the cloud net bookings - and so cloud backlog - grow significantly every single year. Since COVID-19 impacts many enterprises, they have delayed projects, and this is noticeable in SAP's cloud backlog. SAP's cloud backlog has actually started to shrink QoQ since Q3 2020. Revenue backlog is a meaningful indicator for future revenue growth; when the backlog is no longer expanding, that is a negative sign for future revenue growth. (Source: Visualized in Excel, data from Q3 report)SAP also updated its guidance: in April, SAP previously guided for revenues in 2023 to be €36 billion, now it's guiding for revenues of €36 billion in 2025, clearly SAP's growth expectations have been lowered significantly. In 2020, SAP is expecting revenue to be €27.2-€27.8 billion; to put that into context, SAP's revenue in 2019 was €27 billion. With backlogs shrinking, it is clear that SAP's growth potential over the next few years has diminished significantly. SAP's guidance implies that the resurgence of COVID-19 in most of the Western world has led to a slowdown in demand for enterprise software.SAP's report is a warning to the market that SaaS companies are also not immune to COVID-19. When enterprises are struggling, interest for cloud solutions will be muted, and this will obviously have an impact on the results of these cloud providers. However, there are some side notes I want to make about SAP's results:SAP's results were negatively impacted by the surge of the euro compared to the dollar and other currencies. This impact is not minor; for example, total revenue in Q3 2020 declined by 4% YoY, but when accounting for constant currencies, the revenue growth would actually stagnate at 0%. Additionally, SAP's exposure to travel is disproportionately large with its flagship SaaS package Concur. Concur is a travel and expense management service, and was bought by SAP in 2014 for $8.3 billion. It was a segment with relatively high growth rates until the COVID-19 crisis, but this segment - making up approximately 10% of SAP's total revenue - is experiencing falling revenue backlogs, which indicates revenue growth over the next years will shrink. Revenue has already declined 15% YoY in Q3 2020.What does this mean for tech in general? SAP is a massive billion-dollar software company with tons of insight into Fortune 500 companies. So, when it announced their new lower guidance, this obviously sent a shiver around the financial markets; it was the first sign that the economic recovery is slower than expected. SAP affirmed that tech companies are also impacted by COVID-19 - they are not immune - and that SAP specifically is disproportionately largely impacted by COVID-19. SAP is trying to transform itself into a cloud service provider; historically, it has licensed software to enterprises, but since the exception of the cloud, this has slowly but surely become outdated. Now that transition to the cloud is accelerating, it is putting pressure on SAP's margins.A majority of SAP's revenues continue to be from software; SAP needs to transform its software clients into clients of its cloud services. SAP's biggest service is SAP ERP, which is an enterprise resource planning software. Historically, SAP ERP's churn has been low due to the high costs associated with changing one's enterprise resource planning software. SAP is trying to become a massive cloud service company and is utilising its dominance in other market segments to force cloud services onto existing customers.SAP is a free cash flow machine. Still, the company's price to free cash flow is one of the lowest in the industry. The stock is returning a 1.51% dividend yield with a payout ratio of 40%. However, management has clearly warned the market that the next few years will contain headwinds, which indicates there might be less or no dividend raises in the coming years.SAP is selling at a trailing twelve-month EV to EBITDA ratio of 22.41, this modest valuation creates a margin of safety. SAP's ERP business has a strong moat, and SAP can grow its cloud business by utilising their dominance in other market segments. Considering the modest valuation, SAP provides a unique opportunity to invest in the cloud."
4340236,104608,2020-04-27T12:10:15-04:00,"SAP reported a good quarter to start their fiscal year, with cloud revenue showing strength across all geographies.Management lowered their full-year guidance which could now be somewhat conservative.Medium-term ambitions were reiterated which include tripling cloud revenue and expanding operating margins ~500bps.Valuation remains near the average of legacy technology companies, though investors should constantly look to buy the dips.","While it seems like the coronavirus is pulling everything to zero demand, SAP (SAP) reported a good Q1 earnings and answered the question to how much impact the global pandemic has. Management lowered their overall revenue growth to 1-3%, down from previous guidance of 7-9%. Cloud revenue growth is now expected to be 18-24%, down from the previous range of 24-28%.However, SAP's medium-term 2023 ambitions all remained the same, with cloud revenue expected to triple over that time and operating margins expanding ~100bps per year. I believe this reiteration demonstrates management's underlying confidence in their business growth and also demonstrates that their clients will continue to invest in SAP.The stock was down slightly after reporting earnings and remains down ~15% from the pre-coronavirus highs. I believe investors should look to buy the dip and watch the stock trend higher over time.Data by YChartsData by YChartsBeing a legacy technology company, SAP continues to find new ways of sustainable revenue growth. However, due to the law of large numbers, SAP is not likely to grow as fast as newer technology companies.Large cap companies tend to have more stable financial results, which makes it difficult to consistently outperform the market. The above chart does a good job showing normalized growth between SAP and the market. While the trends remain pretty similar, there are periods of dislocation, which investors should take advantage of.Since reporting earnings, SAP has fallen more than the market. Given there was nothing overly concerning in these results, I believe strategic investors will look to buy the dip here. Medium-term guidance was reiterated and the downward revised 2020 guidance could be somewhat conservative as SAP likely wants to set themselves up for a few beat and raise quarters.During the quarter, revenue grew 5% in constant currency (7% growth in reported terms) to €6.52 billion, which decelerated from the 10% constant currency growth last quarter. Cloud revenue continues to be the leading factor of growth, growing 25% in constant currency this quarter, and now represents over 30% of total revenue.Source: Company PresentationWhile growth across all geographies showed some signs of deceleration, there were some pockets of strength. Cloud revenue continues to remain healthy across all regions, with Americas growing 21% constant currency, EMEA 34% constant currency, and APJ 24% constant currency. While there were likely some headwinds related to lower spending due to the global pandemic, the transition to cloud services will continue to drive revenue growth for the next several years.Source: Company PresentationOperating margins during the quarter were down ~130bps compared to the year-ago period, though the company is still investing into their restructuring, which will ultimately benefit operating margins over the long term. As cloud revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than the company's overall revenue growth, we should continue to expect operating margin expansion over the long term. Typically, Cloud and Software revenue comes on at higher margins, given the lack of hardware and cost of goods sold. In addition, SAP noted they are becoming more disciplined with their expenses given the coronavirus pandemic. While operating margins may remain somewhat pressured in the near term, they are poised for longer-term expansion.The below chart does a great job giving an overview of SAP's growth outlook for the remainder of 2020 as well as medium-term ambitions through 2023. Let's dive a little deeper into 2020 first.To start, the company noted that the coronavirus will have limited impact on their 2020 results, as core demand for SAP remains pretty healthy. The company continues to move towards a more subscription-based model, and given the cloud revenue strength, the company remains somewhat more isolated to coronavirus impacts than other legacy technology companies.Source: Company PresentationOverall, revenue growth was revised downwards as the company is now expecting only 1-3% growth, compared to their previous guidance range of 7-9% growth. While this is a big change in a normal economic environment, the downward revision is not nearly as bad as other companies which are suffering from economies shutting down. Not surprisingly, SAP noted software licenses had the biggest negative impact, though management talked about this demand being pushed out, rather than completely lost.Cloud revenue is now expected to grow 18-24% during 2020 compared to previous guidance of 24-28%. This was a slightly larger downward revision compared to overall revenue growth, which could be somewhat concerning. In addition, SAP noted they will no longer report new cloud bookings but will focus more on cloud backlog. Backlog tends to be more stable in nature as bookings can be impacted by lumpier, larger deal wins. Investors will surely keep a close eye on cloud growth and look for any longer-term deterioration trends.Finally for 2020, the company noted they expect to have 72% of their revenue coming from recurring streams, which continues to trend upwards as SAP focuses more on cloud software. Investors tend to favor companies with a high percentage of their revenue being recurring due to the increased visibility and predictability of revenue.When looking at the company's ambitions for 2023, their goal remains to triple their cloud revenue and to reach a cloud gross margin of 75%. Operating margins are expected to expand by 500bps, which equates to ~100bps of margin expansion each year. The transition to more cloud revenue will enhance margins and ultimately profitability and cash flow over the long term.Management’s plan includes total revenue of over €35 billion with recurring revenue reaching 80%. Given the fact that nothing changed from these plans, this should be viewed as a positive as nothing fundamentally changed with the business or outlook since last quarter.Similar to many companies throughout the market, SAP remains down ~15% year-to-date. However, SAP has been relatively resilient as the stock is actually up ~10% over the past month and remains only down ~15% from their pre-coronavirus highs. Cloud growth continues to impress and will likely remain strong over the next several quarters given the expanding relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Over time, we investors should see margins continue to expand, leading to increased profitability.Management lowered their 2020 revenue guidance given the impact of the coronavirus, though I believe the downward revised guidance was not as bad as feared. In addition, SAP reiterated their medium-term 2023 targets which demonstrate their underlying confidence in business fundamentals over the next several years.Data by YChartsCompared to other larger cap software competitors, SAP trades at a forward P/E ratio near the middle of the pack. Even though each of these competitors have an international presence, SAP's exposure to both Europe and Asia Pacific puts them at higher scrutiny considering current international economic conditions seem to be under pressure.However, by SAP reiterating their medium-term 2023 targets which include operating margins expanding by ~500bps, I believe profits will continue to expand over time. Driven by strength in cloud revenue, which is also expected to triple in the medium term, revenue growth will continue to impress and cash flows will continue to improve.More important than valuation, management revised their 2020 guidance lower to include the impacts of the coronavirus. If anything, management was more conservative with their lowered guidance, which could set them up for some beat and raise quarters throughout the remainder of the year.While it is challenging for some of these legacy technology companies to rapidly grow given their scale and law of large numbers, I believe SAP continues to place itself in areas of success, such as strong cloud revenue growth and operating margin expansion. These factors will continue to drive strong EPS growth, and thus, will drive the stock up over time.For now, I continue to look to build a position in this name and would be eager to buy on dips. Over the long term, margin expansion will drive improved profitability, thus growing EPS at a steady rate.Risks to SAP include software license growth continuing to decline as the coronavirus impacts enterprises' investment decisions. While this remains a relatively small portion of the company's overall revenue, a meaningful deterioration in this revenue stream could impact overall revenue growth over time. Competition could also increase during times of uncertainty and newer, more specialized technology companies could increase the level of competition."
4339829,103480,2020-04-24T13:03:54-04:00,"SAP became one of the first large-cap software companies to report earnings post-coronavirus; shares have fallen modestly since the announce.
        Overall, the company expects a relatively modest four-point impact to revenue growth this year from the coronavirus.
        On the plus side, SAP expects its transition to recurring revenues to happen faster than expected, with its share of recurring revenue rising to 72% by year-end (previously 70%).
        The company retains its""2023 Ambition"" plan that calls for a tripling of cloud revenues. It's also affirming plans for robust cash flow growth in 2020 thanks to 2019 cost-cutting measures.
        Among the surprise announcements is that recently-elevated co-CEO Jennifer Morgan plans to exit the company, reverting SAP to a single chief.","SAP (SAP), the German software titan, became the first mega-cap software company to report earnings after the outbreak of the coronavirus. The two main takeaways: first, though the expected revenue is small and a higher mix of recurring revenue helps to soften the blow, the impact is not nonzero; secondly, the impacts of the virus this year aren't disruptive to long-term plans. Still, with SAP slightly missing Wall Street's estimates this year, plus a few administrative surprises, shares are down roughly 5% since the earnings release:Alongside the earnings release, SAP also announced two major shockers on the housekeeping side, which may have been the larger driver pulling shares downward:All in all, however, I find it heartening that SAP has more or less confirmed that the coronavirus will be just a minor blip on SAP's 2020 results. The core bullish thesis for SAP is still intact: a global software giant sitting in the pole position of many software categories, including ERP, procurement, and others. SAP's continued pivot into becoming a nearly pure recurring/subscription company is also still underway, as is its plan to triple cloud revenues within three years. Stay long here.Let's now walk through SAP's updated expectations in more detail. The company's new guidance plan is shown in the snapshot below:Figure 1. SAP 2020 revised outlookSource: SAP Q1 investor presentationThe key highlights here: SAP had previously called for 24-28% y/y growth in its cloud unit to €8.7-€9.0 billion in revenue; now, the company is moderating that forecast to €8.3-€8.7 billion, or 18-24% y/y growth. This means that the impact of the virus on SAP's cloud revenue is approximately four to six points, and potentially why the company also chose to stop disclosing new cloud bookings.The impact on SAP's overall revenue, however, is slightly more sanguine - as the majority of SAP's install base faces little disruption in usage or consumption. Though the company had previously called for 7-9% y/y revenue growth, SAP is now forecasting 1-4% growth instead.Previously, we were in the dark about how the global shutdowns would be impacting SAP's business this year; this update offers a bit more clarity that offers investors some comfort. Though SAP's growth is impacted by a few points, at least the company is still pointing to flat/slight growth for the year, unlike many other S&P 500 sectors that are expecting to end this year significantly down. Importantly, SAP's new sole CEO Christian Klein noted that even though the company saw new deals suffer, he sees no indication that the business has been lost, and is instead being deferred to later quarters. Per his remarks on the Q4 earnings call:He went on further to say that the current shutdown conditions haven't fully prevented new customer go-lives. SAP onboarded 500 new customers onto its flagship S/4HANA ERP system in Q1, with customers accepting remote services from SAP's support and implementation teams. Among the new customer adds this quarter are Sun Life Financial and a subsidiary of famed automaker Rolls Royce.There are some upsides to this guidance update as well. We note that SAP's expectation is now to end the year with 72% of revenue in recurring streams, up two points from the prior year. Many investors had long considered SAP, along with Oracle (ORCL), as laggards in transitioning to the new cloud-dominated software ecosystem; the improvement in recurring revenue mixes is a big step in the right direction. SAP also has re-affirmed its ""2023 Ambition"" of tripling cloud revenues within three years, indicating that SAP believes the current year's criss to have no impact on the company's longer-term execution. In other good news: SAP plans to hold its dividend steady at €1.58 per share, translating to a roughly ~1.5% yield at current share prices.Recall that 2019 was an investment year for SAP, as the company invested into restructuring that were expected to lower future operating costs. In addition, the company completed the migration of its popular SuccessFactors HCM into the HANA platform. These efforts have yielded continually improving gross margins in SAP's cloud segment, on which the company is pinning its hopes for the future. The bottom of this chart below shows cloud gross margins expanding 310bps year-over-year to 69.3% on a pro forma basis:Figure 2. SAP margin trendsSource: SAP Q1 investor presentationOn the operating expense side, the company has also adopted a culture of expense discipline in the wake of the coronavirus, building on the position of strength that SAP achieved through its restructuring. Longtime CFO Luka Mucic noted as follows on the Q4 earnings call:As a result of boosted cloud margins and expected cost efficiencies amid a roughly flat year for revenue, SAP is still expecting strong cash flow growth in 2020. Though it has cut its cash flow expectations from its original FY20 guidance, SAP is still planning for €5.0 billion in operating cash flows and €3.5 billion in free cash flow. That represents 43% y/y and 54% y/y growth in OCF and FCF, respectively. In Q1, SAP generated €2.58 billion of FCF (traditionally its biggest quarter for cash flows), indicating that for the rest of the year it expects to intake an additional ~€1 billion in FCF - distinguishing SAP from other companies that expect the shutdowns to force them into a cash-burning position. The market may be reacting more in the near-term to the news of a co-CEO departure and the non-disclosure of cloud bookings, but SAP's underlying business is healthy. SAP has provided clarity on its expectation that the coronavirus would impact revenue growth this year by roughly four or five points, but its expectation of robust cash flow growth in 2020 and its goal of tripling cloud revenues by 2023 still remain. In addition, SAP has maintained its ~1.5% dividend yield. In my view, SAP remains a ""safe harbor"" stock that investors can safely turn to amid choppy markets."
4321687,20599,2020-02-05T14:56:15-05:00,"While SAP SE had a mixed Q4 earnings report, they both beat on EPS and raised guidance for 2020.The fundamentals look strong here, and the recent pullback should be viewed as a buying opportunity.There are a few risks to consider with this company, especially with regards to competition.","SAP SE (SAP) is underappreciated in my opinion, as this company has a lot going for it. The rapid shift of applications to the core applications to the cloud, the move of clients to their S/4HANA platform, and potential operating margin expansion are the main reasons to own the stock, especially given the recent pullback in price off of a solid earnings report. Given the company's improving execution, as evidenced by recent earnings, I believe this stock warrants a higher premium and will be higher in the long run.On January 28, 2020, the company reported mixed Q4 earnings. They had reliable license performance and margin discipline; however, cloud revenues and bookings were impacted by recent macro volatility in the Asian-Pacific areas. I think this is a temporary setback, and if you hold this company long term, you will be rewarded. 2020 total revenue and operating income targets were raised, while cloud revenue ranges tightened, and 2023 ambitions were reaffirmed. SAP is aiming for more broad, steady growth, and they estimate that the margin leverage story will take hold eventually - I agree. For one, cloud bookings have a lot of room for growth. In the last quarter they grew to €878 million - 17% growth year-over-year. The cloud business is booming; although there is a ton of well-equipped competition that I will go over further down, the business is also expanding at rates that are underappreciated. EPS this quarter was €1.82, above the consensus at €1.70, driven by the operating margin expansion, which came in at 35.3% vs. consensus 35%. Although they missed on revenues, SAP did hit the €8 billion revenue mark with €8.04 billion, which was still up 8% year-over-year. Of course, despite the news being relatively good and the guidance for this year put higher, the stock was punished, now almost 6.5% off of its 2020 high. For me, that's a buying opportunity.While the dividend yield isn't large, at about 1.26% trailing, it is a bonus to get as a shareholder from a software company. For one, it shows the dedication to its shareholders by being able to return capital to shareholders. This is more common of European companies compared to American ones, but given that I believe we are in an extended market rally, it is nice to be able to collect a dividend. Its payout ratio stands at a comfortable 54% as well, which means that you don't have to worry about a cut anytime soon (perhaps a dividend increase will be in its future if earnings continue to beat). Sometimes, though, it is not the size of the dividend that matters, but the implication that they are prioritizing shareholders enough to pay out a dividend is good news for the long-term viability of being a stockholder.As I mentioned on the Lead-Lag Report last week, while the cloud business is expanding at a faster rate, there is a ton of competition to be wary of. Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL) are all big competition in SAP's markets. As an example, Oracle fights for a lot of the Enterprise Resource Planning business that SAP is, and Oracle has good software as well and could start to take some of their multinational contracts away. Salesforce.com has come to the forefront of the customer resource management business as well, which SAP may not be able to replicate, especially in North America. Microsoft's purchase of Azure is also growing at a faster pace than expected, which could take market share away from SAP. Not only might they suffer from the increased competition, there is also the possibility of a global slowdown that would affect the share price, given their higher exposure to international companies. They need to evolve their products to stay off the more specialized giants that are already around, as well as ones to come in the future.The reason I like SAP, though, is how far it can go to catch up in the space of returns, especially as you look at the comparison of returns over the past three years. There are differences in the companies but look at how well CRM and ADBE have done in the space. SAP has a growing consumer base and is one of the go-to companies in Europe and APAC. Microsoft's recent stock winnings have come at the benefit of their Azure cloud computing services, which grew at an astonishing 62% over the last quarter. The difference is Microsoft was rewarded handsomely after its earnings release. Cloud bookings have a lot of room to go for SAP, and that is why I think they raised their guidance for 2020. There has been some short-term volatility in the stock that has pushed the price lower, but astute investors take advantage of panic selling like this. Take advantage of it and start to build a position.From a technical analysis perspective, there is some reason to worry about buying the stock here. The stock needs to hold that 200-day moving average around the $128 level after breaking down through the 50-day moving average in the last week of January. I think that this is set up as a higher-low, however, and will rebound in the following weeks after the earnings are digested better. I also believe that the earnings season is going well so far overall and that global economic health should be okay in 2020. There is a transitory shift towards cloud-based companies, and with the incredible margins SAP is pumping out of earnings, if it is growing, it is a company to own.*Like this article?

Of all software companies, SAP has one of the best track records for selective acquisitions.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. This article was highlighted under our Tech vertical. Find out how you can get access to the best content on Seeking Alpha here.SAP (SAP), one of the world’s largest software companies, has just closed out its fiscal 2019 - and for the most part, investors aren’t impressed. Since the company reported earnings last week, shares have fallen roughly 5% (a deeper cut than the broader market, which is still reeling from coronavirus-related scares):Data by YChartsReactions to SAP’s quarter were mixed. While the company performed well against Q4 expectations, Wall Street questioned the strength of the company’s guidance in its all-important cloud division for 2020. Take a look at that guidance update below:Figure 1. SAP guidance update 2020Source: SAP Q4 earnings deckThe core message in this update: SAP has tightened its cloud division’s revenue range from a prior range of €8.6 - €9.1 billion to what is now €8.7 - €9.0 billion, or 24-28% y/y growth (compared to Q4 cloud revenue growth of 32% y/y). Many investors took the shaving off of the top end of that prior guidance range to mean that SAP is expecting significant deceleration in 2020.My take: I wouldn’t read too much into SAP’s guidance range shrinking, as the company has built in a history of guiding conservatively and exceeding its forecast. SAP’s cloud revenue growth has consistently stayed in the ~30% range for several quarters, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company achieve a few points higher than its guidance forecast in 2020. We also find comforting the fact that SAP has reiterated its ""2023 ambition"" of tripling cloud revenues, indicating that SAP's total market opportunity in cloud is still massive. Exiting metrics in Q4, which we’ll discuss shortly, are trending incredibly strong. Aside from strong cloud revenue, driven in part by conversions from current on-prem customers, SAP has also driven tremendous cloud margin gains that have allowed the company to continue growing overall operating margins and EPS. In the midst of a market reversal where many investors have criticized tech companies’ growing losses, profit-rich companies like SAP that are still capable of showing ~30% cloud growth (despite the cloud business nearly reaching $10 billion in annual revenues) can distinguish themselves from peers in the software sector.Then there’s also SAP’s cash-rich balance sheet, which as of the end of Q4 contained €7.95 billion of cash and “financial assets”. Peers like Salesforce (CRM) have been incredibly active on the M&A front in 2019, buying up marquee names like Tableau in order to extend its TAM and continue growing in the cloud. If there’s ever a concern on SAP’s cloud growth, it can always turn to a tried-and-true M&A playbook to add revenue to its books. SAP perhaps has the best track record for M&A integration across the large-cap software space, with its powerhouse subsidiaries like Ariba and Qualtrics all coming from acquisitions.The bottom line on SAP: the company remains a strong long-term hold, due to its rich and growing operating margins and continued progress in shifting its business toward a subscription-oriented, cloud-first product. Stay long here and use the dip to add to your position.A look at SAP's fourth-quarter results gives us a good sense that SAP's business - and specifically, its progress in cloud - is well on track. Take a look at the company's Q4 earnings summary below:Figure 2. SAP key metrics Source: SAP Q4 earnings releaseThe company generated a massive €1.9 billion in cloud revenues in Q4, growing 35% y/y (32% y/y on a pro forma basis after stripping out currency impacts). As previously mentioned, when comparing SAP's exiting fourth-quarter cloud growth rate with its top end guidance range of 28% y/y for 2020 (which investors thought was a touch light), we can gain with the possibility of SAP outperforming its forecast for next year.A couple areas of strength are worth pointing out. The Europe region, SAP's home base (the company is headquartered in Germany), saw staggering 50% y/y growth in cloud revenues in Q4. Asia Pacific, including Japan, was also trailing slightly behind at 38% y/y growth. SAP gives investors great exposure to revenue growth outside of the United States.On a product basis, SAP's flagship ERP system, S/4HANA, continues to be the powerhouse growth engine for the company. S/4HANA has reached 13,800 total customers as of the end of Q4, marking a 24% y/y growth rate in customers (some gained from existing on-prem customers). Of this customer base, 2,000 are cloud customers. The fourth quarter also brought several big-ticket wins, including from some of the S&P 500's largest companies - Ford (F), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Christian Klein, SAP's newly appointed co-CEO (serving alongside Jennifer Morgan), has highlighted that the company's major focus for S/4HANA's growth in 2020 and beyond will be on verticalized solutions - that is, versions of the product that are tailored toward specific industries. Per his prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call (key points emphasized):Co-CEO Morgan also pointed out that SAP's pipeline for 2020 is ""robust"", and the fact that nearly 70% of SAP's revenue comes from recurring sources also gives management plenty of confidence in hitting its forecast. Turning aside from strong growth numbers as well as bullish anecdotal commentary, we note as well that SAP's profitability metrics continue on an upward tear - which, in a market environment that has become incredibly sensitive to tech companies' bottom lines, will be an important bullish catalyst for the stock. The chart below, taken from the company's Q4 earnings deck, showcases the upward trend in gross margins across the year:Figure 3. SAP gross margin trendsSource: SAP Q4 earnings releaseAs we can see above, SAP's cloud gross margins have risen a full five points since the start of FY19, and improvement has been consistent across quarters. Though cloud itself remains a relatively smaller portion of SAP's overall business, the improvement in cloud margins has driven a 50bps improvement in overall gross margins.This, in turn, has driven an 80bps expansion in overall pro forma operating margins for FY19:Figure 4. SAP pro forma operating marginsSource: SAP Q4 earnings releasePro forma EPS, meanwhile, has risen 18% y/y in FY19 to €5.11.There's a lot to be said about SAP as a defensive investment in the technology sector as the broader market continues to touch all-time highs amid renewed volatility. SAP's ability to continue growing its cloud division at a ~30% rate while consistently improving its margin profile will be a key differentiator for the stock. Stay long here and use any near-term dips to buy."
4319691,104812,2020-01-29T01:50:02-05:00,"SAP reported Q4 and full-year 2019 earnings highlighted by firming margins and continued momentum in cloud ERP.The headline EPS for the quarter beat expectations but the stock sold off on the report, possibly based on soft forward guidance.We see the SAP's current valuation as a headwind for upside in the stock price in the context of an outlook for moderating growth going forward.","Germany's SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a global leader in enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") and database management software. The company just reported its latest quarterly results, which represented continuing momentum in its strategic shift towards cloud-based solutions with customers including major multinational corporations transitioning to the new platforms. This was an overall mixed report with positive operational and financial trends balanced by soft guidance. The stock sold off on the earnings release, which is in the context that shares were already trading near an all-time high. We take a look at recent developments and our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: Finviz)SAP SE reported its fiscal 2019 Q4 earnings on January 28th with non-IFRS EPS of €1.82 that was €0.11 ahead of expectations, while IFRS EPS of €1.37 missed slightly by €0.07. The spread here was based on some restructuring charges and share-based compensation. Revenue in the quarter of €8.04 billion was up by 8.2% year over year and effectively in line with estimates, missing by just €50 million.(Source: Company IR)Q4 cloud bookings rose 19%, but below stronger trends from earlier in the year. Based on the adjusted non-IFRS measures, cloud revenue up 32% in Q4 and up 35% for the full year supported the weaker software licenses and support business, up just 1% in Q4. The company's co-CEOs, Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein, added the following comments in the press release:(Source: Company IR)The firm-wide gross margin reached 75.3% in Q4, up from 72.3% in Q3 to end the year at 72.3%. Favorably, margins increased across all segments, with notable strength in cloud, which reached 68.2%, up 500 basis points from 63.2% last year. These trends also supported a higher operating margin. EPS for the full year at €5.11 was up by 18% compared to 2018.(Source: Company IR)Other notable items for the quarter and the year was operating cash flows pressured by restructuring charges and share-based compensating. Free cash flow for the year decreased by 20% year over year to €2.28 billion. At year end, gross debt reached €13.7 billion, supported by a cash position of €5.3 billion. Overall, the balance sheet and liquidity position are stableThe company issued 2020 guidance with a range of revenue growth across the core segments below the 2019 results. Cloud revenue growth between 24% and 28% compares to the 35% growth in 2019. Similarly, the total revenue growth target for 2020 between 6% and 8% is also below the 9% result for 2019. This follows a revenue growth of 10% y/y in 2018 and 9% in 2017.(Source: Company IR / author annotation)Management includes guidance for longer-term targets with its ""2023 Ambition"". A projection of total revenue of €35 billion by 2023 implies an annual growth rate of 6% on average over the 2019 result. The company expects cloud gross margin to reach 75%, compared to 68.2% in 2019. The trend is for a higher proportion of recurring ""predictable"" revenue and overall firming profitability.Taking a look at the consensus revenue and earnings expectations, the market estimates revenue growth around 7.5% for the next two years, while EPS of $6.05 in 2020 and $6.73 in 2021 represents an increase of 8.2% and 11.3% year over year respectively. Keep in mind, these estimates have not yet been revised to incorporate the latest Q4 results and forward guidance. The broader point here is that the outlook is for a deceleration in earnings and top line growth compared to the latest 2019 results.(Source: Seeking Alpha Premium)Recognizing what remains an overall positive outlook with steady growth and a path for higher profitability, the concern here comes down to valuation. Across multiples including a forward P/E of 23x and forward P/S of 5x on the 2020 consensus estimates, these ratios are in the context of relatively modest growth under 10% expected for both revenue and EPS. Other measures like EV-to-EBITDA and price-to-free cash flow is also at elevated levels relative to a longer 5-year and 10-year average for SAP.Data by YChartsThe outlook suggests a valuations multiples expansion would be necessary for the stock to climb higher, or growth would need to significantly outperform expectations. We typically want to see growth and earnings accelerating to justify a multiples expansion. We see valuation as a headwind, with much of the positive trends potentially already priced in.Anecdotally, the size and scale of SAP as the largest in the segment is a hindrance to its growth outlook. On one hand, the company already counts on several multinational corporations as core customers, suggesting the low-hanging fruit for ERP systems and cloud-based solutions has already been captured.There is also a consideration of intense competition between large and small competitors with similar solutions. Oracle Corp. (ORCL), for example, is fighting for much the same type of new cloud ERP business. SAP is the largest in what remains a highly dynamic and evolving space. Over the past decade, Salesforce.com (CRM) has taken the lead from SAP in the customer resource management applications market.(Source: Company IR)SAP's other operating segments feature competition from emerging application software companies utilizing the software-as-a-service model for specialized niches that further challenge the company's market position. We highlight Workday Inc. (WDAY) with revenue growth of 26% in the last quarter as a company essentially capturing market share from SAP in human capital management (""HCM"").SAP ended 2019 with a continued trend of steady growth and firming profitability as the market transitions to its cloud-based solutions. Softer guidance for the year ahead, along with a broader deceleration compared to 2019, may weigh on sentiment in the near term in the context of an already pricey valuation.We take a cautious view on shares at the current level. Going forward, monitoring points include trends in growth and the evolution of the products segment gross margin as a key metric. Beyond the risk of a global cyclical slowdown, we see intense competition from emerging software application players offering specialized and point solutions as a challenge for SAP's growth outlook."

His successors Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein are highly qualified as well.McDermott leaves at a good point in time with the company being stronger than when he was first appointed in 2010.The growth of the cloud business is impressive.Going forward, the primary challenges will be better integration of the company's various services and margin improvements.","Europe's largest software company, German SAP SE (SAP), announced on Friday, October 11, that CEO Bill McDermott will step down from his role. His successors as Co-CEOs are Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. McDermott, who has been leading the company since 2010, will remain in an advisory role until the end of the year. His departure comes as a surprise to many, myself included. He had a contract until 2021. Given his relatively young age of 58 years, it wouldn't have been surprising if the contract had been renewed once more. And yet, I do believe that this move comes at a favorable point in time given where the company stands.The outgoing CEO Bill McDermott; source: SAP SEThere is little doubt that Bill McDermott was a very successful CEO. First and foremost, he has a reputation for being one hell of a salesman. A former Xerox (XRX) executive, the Long Island-born son of a blue-collar worker had been with SAP since 2002. He would have had to announce his decision whether to renew his contract or not by the beginning of next year. Since he already decided not to renew, he opted to leave earlier in order to hand over the helm at an optimal moment (which I believe speaks much in his credit as a leader).Indeed, SAP made tremendous progress in the near-decade since he became CEO. Most importantly, he focused the company on the cloud computing business, including numerous acquisitions. This way, SAP was able to establish itself as a leader in this field.The preliminary financial results for Q3 underline SAP's financial strength. Cloud revenues increased 37 percent YoY (+33 percent currency adjusted) to €1.79 billion for the quarter (€5.04 billion for the nine-month period; +40 percent). Revenue overall grew by 13 percent to €19.51 billion for the first nine months. The dividend will be raised to €1.50 from €1.40 pending the general meeting's approval.Bill McDermott's departure as CEO is, of course, a loss, as it would be for most companies I imagine, but his successors are qualified managers too.McDermott and his designated successors Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein; Source: SAP SEJennifer Morgan has formerly been in charge of the cloud business, hence she was responsible for the company's most important products including its Ariba, SAP Concur, SuccessFactors, and C4/HANA software solutions. Prior to this, she had been president of SAP North America as well as SAP Asia-Pacific/Japan. Like McDermott, she has a talent for sales and will probably take on the role as the face of SAP to the public in the future. Notably, Morgan will be the first female CEO of a DAX-30 company.Christian Klein who formerly served as COO, on the other hand, has been responsible for the integration of acquisitions and optimized internal processes. 39-year old Klein is a company veteran who spend his whole career at SAP. In this capacity, he contributed to recent margin improvements (24.7 percent operating profit margin as of Q3, up 4.2 percent points).It appears likely that Klein's focus will remain on the improvement of internal processes and the integration of the various services with one another.The two new Co-CEOs have complementary abilities and profiles, so I do believe that they will harmonize well. Notably, McDermott himself shared the CEO-position with Jim Hagemann Snabe - now the chairman of both Siemens AG (OTCPK:SIEGY, OTCPK:SMAWF) and closely-held A.P. Moller Maersk - until 2014.Morgan and Klein will have to perform right from the start as there are some challenges ahead for SAP. The market for cloud software is quite a battleground. In this competitive environment, growth comes at the expense of profit margins. For the first nine months, the operating profit margin fell to 12.1 percent (after 19.1 percent in the previous year). The operating profit during the same period decreased 28 percent to €2.37 billion. The new leadership will have to improve profitability.In order to do so, it is crucial to better integrate the services company's various services with one another. This is also what customers reportedly demand. All that needs to be done while at the same time continuing to grow revenue and constantly innovating.Those are certainly no small challenges, but I think that the new leadership is well prepared to take them on. The shared responsibility might make it even a bit easier as each of the two can focus on their respective specialties.Bill McDermott sure is an exceptional manager. He has, without doubt, many achievements to his name at SAP. Nonetheless, no one can be CEO forever and even if he could have stayed on board for a while, I believe that the leadership change comes at a good time.The company is in an advantageous position to take on the challenges ahead and the new CEOs are well prepared to do so successfully. Therefore, I remain optimistic with regard to SAP even without Bill McDermott at the helm."

The disappointing results led to a 7% slide in its stock price.Among the acquisition prospects for SAP, Zendesk and Splunk would be the best alternatives that can add value to SAP’s bottom-line and strategy.","Originally published July 24, 2019Last week, SAP reported results of its second quarter, which were just short of analyst expectations. A major cause for worry was the 5% decline in software license revenue. The disappointing results led to a 7% slide in its stock price.SAP’s FinancialsSAP’s second quarter revenues grew 11% over the year to €6.6 billion ($7.4 billion) compared with the market’s forecast of €6.7 billion. Adjusted profit grew by 11% to €1.8 billion ($2.02 billion), falling just shy of analyst estimates.During the quarter, Cloud computing revenue increased 40% to €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Software license revenues declined 5% to €948 million ($1.06 billion) mainly due to the uncertain business climate and the trade war between US and China. Software support revenue grew 4% to €2.85 billion.By segment, SAP’s Intelligent Spend Group revenue was up 22% to €786 million. Revenue from the Customer Experience segment which includes the $8 billion acquisition of Qualtrics grew 81% to €365 million. Applications, Technology & Services revenue grew 6% to €5.38 billion.During the quarter, SAP S/4HANA added 600 customers and now has over 11,500 customers, up 29%. SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, which is the flagship of SAP’s HCM offering, added more than 180 customers in the quarter and has now more than 3,350 customers globally. Competitive wins included Keolis, Claas, Burger King Brazil, and CONA Services.The company continues to expect full year 2019 non-IFRS cloud revenue to grow 33% to 39% in the range of €6.7 to €7 billion compared to €5.03 billion in 2018. It expects non-IFRS cloud & software revenue to increase by 8.5%-10% in the range of €22.4 to €22.7 billion. It expects non-IFRS operating profit to be in the range of €7.85 to €8.05 billion.For 2020, SAP expects €8.6 – €9.1 billion non-IFRS cloud revenue and €28.6 – €29.2 billion($31.87-$32.54 billion) non-IFRS total revenue, which is below the average analyst forecast of $33.05 billion.By 2023, SAP expects to more than triple non-IFRS cloud revenue from €5.03 billion in 2018. It expects to grow to more than €35 billion in non-IFRS total revenue.SAP’s OfferingsDuring the second quarter, SAP launched HANA Cloud Services, which acts as a gateway to this single source of truth, making the data available to people, algorithms and data-driven applications in the cloud. It provides low total cost of ownership (TCO), elasticity, serverless principles, high availability, resilience, and autonomous capabilities.SAP also introduced new editions of its SAP C/4HANA solutions leveraging Qualtrics CustomerXM. This enables organizations to combine customer feedback and operational data to listen, understand and act in the moment to improve the customer experience.What can SAP acquire to meet its revenue shortfall?Last year SAP acquired customer experience management platform provider Qualtrics for $8 billion, AI-powered field service management platform provider Core Systems was acquired for an undisclosed amount, cloud-based Lead to Money (Quote-to-Cash) solutions provider Callidus was acquired for $2.4 billion, and leading conversational AI bot platform Recast for an undisclosed amount.The last acquisition that SAP made was that of Qualtrics (XM) in November 2018. Qualtrics was about to go public before it was acquired. It had revenue of $289.9 million and net income of $2.6 million in 2017.We have suggested several acquisition prospects for SAP in the past such as enterprise collaboration players Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) or SmartSheet (NYSE:SMAR), financial software provider BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL), enterprise planning services provider Anaplan (NYSE:PLAN), inbound marketing software leader Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS), CRM players Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) or Freshworks, and big data player Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK). Among them, Zendesk and Splunk would be the best alternatives that can add value to SAP’s bottom-line and strategy.With the acquisition of Zendesk, SAP could move up in the CRM customer engagement space and increase its value. Zendesk reported revenue of $181.5 million and non-GAAP net income of $5.1 million in the first quarter. Its annual revenue in 2018 was $598.7 million and it is trading at a market cap of $10.03 billion.Splunk would be an apt fit for SAP’s IoT strategy. Splunk reported revenue of $429 million and non-GAAP income was $3.2 million or $0.02 per share in the first quarter. Its annual revenue in 2018 was $1.8 billion and is trading at a market cap of $20.7 billion.These acquisitions would help SAP meet its quarterly revenue shortfall of €0.1 billion and also help its meet its 2023 target of tripling its cloud business by 2023.SAP’s stock is trading at $125.63 with a market capitalization of $154.3 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $140.62 early this month and had fallen to a 52-week low of $94.81 in December last year."

With both revenue and EPS coming in short of consensus expectations, the pullback in the stock makes sense.While total revenue grew 8% in constant currency to €6.66 billion, this was well below consensus expectations for €6.71 billion. In addition, operating margins were relatively flat compared to the year ago period, which led to EPS of €1.09, just shy of consensus expectations for €1.11.However, and probably more important than the earnings, management maintained their FY19 and mid-term guidance. The weakness in the quarter was partially driven by a soft market in the Asia region, with management noting deals slipped from Q2 into Q3.Data by YChartsDespite the weaker than expected earnings, I believe SAP remains a solid long-term play and with the stock now below $120, this provides a great buying opportunity. With the company still pouring resources into their SaaS platform, the company has made recent acquisitions (Callidus and Qualtrics) which has helped expand their footprint. As customers continue to shift towards the subscription-based offerings, we will start to see margins, and ultimately earnings, expand.Revenue for the quarter grew 8% in constant currency (11% growth in reported terms) to €6.66 billion, which missed consensus expectations for €6.71 billion. Cloud growth continues to remain impressive, growing 43% during the quarter (37% on a constant currency basis), which decelerated from 41% constant currency growth last quarter.Source: Company PresentationGrowth in the EMEA market remains healthy, with cloud revenue growing 44% in constant currency led by both Germany and Spain. The Asia-Pacific-Japan regions experienced a bit of deceleration for the quarter, which was largely driven by trade uncertainty between the US and China, as well as some deals slipping from Q2 and into Q3. Given the fact that trade tensions seemed to have waned over the past few weeks and some deals moving into Q3, we could see this region perform above expectations for Q3.Over the long-term, investors should continue to focus on cloud growth and margin expansion. The one troubling reported financial metric was cloud bookings growing ~15% constant currency, which seemed to be well below expectations for closer to 20% growth. This was likely one of the main reasons for the stock trading down over the pursuing days.When looking at margins, SAP saw some challenges in Q2 given some near-term revenue headwinds. Operating margins remained flat at 27.3% during the quarter, which was likely a little bit below expectations. However, as cloud revenue continues to grow faster than overall revenue, we should continue to see operating margins expand over time. This will help drive increased profitability and ultimately encourage investors to place a higher multiple on valuation.Source: Company PresentationWith revenue falling short of expectations and margins remaining flat compared to the year ago period, this resulted in EPS of €1.09 for the quarter, which was slightly below expectations for €1.11.One of the biggest positive outcomes of the quarter was management reiterating their mid-term growth expectations and FY19 guidance, a signal that the underlying business fundamentals remain healthy amid trade war speculation. I believe this reiteration is what prevented the stock from tumbling 10%+ following earnings.Source: Company PresentationOver the mid-term, management’s goal is to 3x cloud revenue in addition to expanding margins by 500bps (equivalent to 100bps of margin expansion each year). This plan was first announced last quarter and was met with a very positive reaction. Management’s plan includes total revenue of over €35 billion with recurring revenue reaching 80%. Given the fact that nothing changed from these plans, this should be viewed as a positive as nothing fundamentally changed with the business or outlook since last quarter.Source: Company PresentationManagement also reiterated FY19 guidance, underpinning the fact that Q2 was just a small hiccup in the long-term bull case. For FY19, management expects cloud subscription and support revenue of €6.7-7.0 billion, representing 39% constant currency growth. Cloud and software revenue is expected to be €22.4-22.7 billion, representing 10% constant currency growth.With the stock still down ~5% since reporting earnings, now it a great time to pick up some shares. Cloud growth and margins continue to improve over time and despite being one of the later SaaS adapters in the market, SAP remains a software leader. Over time, cloud revenue will continue to grow faster than overall revenue and represent a greater portion of revenue, leading to margin expansion and increased profitability.Management’s reiteration of the mid-term targets and FY19 guidance should reinforce the business fundamentals and encourage investors that Q2 was only a slower quarter than expected. With news of China-US trades wars seemingly slowing down and will ultimately not be as impactful as talked about, we could see an uptick in Q3 growth. Some of the reason Q2 revenue was weaker than expected was due to some deals slipping from the quarter into Q3, which will ultimately help next quarter’s growth.Data by YChartsWhen looking at P/E, SAP trades near the lower end of the large software competitors. Although all of these competitors have an international presence, SAP’s large European and APJ presence puts them at heightened scrutiny in the investment community. With trade tensions easing and mid-term targets and FY19 both reiterated, I believe the shares just got a little cheaper with nothing changing in the long-term.While the quarter was not exactly what investors were looking for, it provides a great opportunity to build a bigger position in the name by picking up some shares. SAP continues to have a solid pipeline with some deals that slipped in Q2 expected to close in Q3, which could lead to upside on the revenue and margins. Ultimately, over time, this name will be a winner and should continue to be held onto in your portfolio."
4298656,104608,2019-10-24T13:15:58-04:00,"SAP reported a strong Q3 with constant currency revenue growth ahead of expectations and similar to their pre-announcement a few weeks ago.Despite the company noting the CEO’s departure, the stock is up ~15% since the pre-release.Management reiterated both their medium-term and FY19 guidance, reinforcing their underlying confidence in the business.","SAP (SAP) reported a strong Q3 earnings this quarter with revenue growing 10% constant currency, which was the same as what was pre-released a few weeks ago. Also during the pre-release, the company noted that CEO Bill McDermott would be transitioning out of his role. Since pre-releasing earnings, the stock was performed exceptionally well, up ~15%.Total revenue during the quarter grew 10% on a constant currency basis which was led by cloud revenue, which grew 33% on a constant currency basis. Both revenue and margins were above consensus expectations, ultimately leading to a better than expected EPS for the quarter.Management also reiterated their 2019 and 2020-2023 guidance targets. While these metrics were not raised, reiterating their longer-term guidance should be seen as a positive given the amount of turmoil currently going on in the market regarding a global economic slowdown, China, and Brexit.Data by YChartsAfter reporting a strong quarter and seeing the stock pop around 15%, it seems like valuation has reached a sweet spot and is no longer undervalued. While it may be difficult to become comfortable around putting additional money into the name at these levels, investors should be very confident about the long-term investment in SAP.During Q3, revenue grew 10% in constant currency (13% growth in reported terms) to €6.81 billion, which was slightly better than last quarter’s 8% constant currency growth and was above consensus estimates for ~9% growth. The strong growth during the quarter was largely led by cloud, which grew 33% in constant currency to €1.81 billion, representing ~26% of total revenue.Source: Company PresentationGrowth in EMEA remained strong at 46% in constant currency (up slightly from 44% last quarter). Management noted growth was driven by both Germany and UK in Cloud and Software revenue, which grew 9% in constant currency. Despite the worries of a slowdown in Europe and concerns about Brexit, the EMEA market seems to operate above expectations. APJ growth also remained healthy at 37% growth in constant currency and 5% growth from Cloud and Software. However, management noted they are starting to see a slowdown in China as customers are taking a little longer to finalize contracts given trade war tensions.Cloud bookings were also strong during the quarter, coming in at 34% growth in constant currency. While this does include some bookings benefit from IaaS and Microsoft, it seems like investors were content with this outcome. SAP’s relationship with Microsoft Azure should lead to increased cloud bookings over the next several quarters which could ultimately bleed into other areas of the business, providing further upside from here.Over the longer-term, investors will continue to focus on cloud growth and margin expansion. With the new established relationship with Microsoft, cloud bookings are off to a great start.When viewing margins, SAP saw their operating margins expand ~170bps to 30.6% during the quarter, which was above consensus expectations for margins of ~29.5%. As cloud revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than the company’s overall revenue, we could continue to see operating margins improve. Typically, Cloud and Software revenue has higher margins, given the lack of hardware and cost of goods sold. Thus, over time, operating margins could have a pathway to improvement.Source: Company PresentationWith revenue slightly above expectations and operating margins coming in strong, SAP saw their EPS reach €1.30, which was slightly ahead of consensus expectations.Management also reiterated their medium-term outlook and FY19 guidance. This should be a positive signal for investors given the recent market turbulence surrounding global economic slowdown and trade war speculation. Along with better than expected earnings, the reiteration of FY19 and medium-term guidance likely helped the stock price over the past few weeks.Source: Company PresentationOver the mid-term, management’s goal is to triple cloud revenue in addition to expanding margins by 500bps (equivalent to 100bps of margin expansion each year). This plan was first announced in Q1 and was met with a very positive reaction. Management’s plan includes total revenue of over €35 billion with recurring revenue reaching 80%. Given the fact that nothing changed from these plans, this should be viewed as a positive as nothing fundamentally changed with the business or outlook since last quarter.Source: Company PresentationManagement also reiterated FY19 guidance, demonstrating continued confidence for the remainder of the year. For FY19, management expects cloud subscription and support revenue of €6.7-7.0 billion, representing 33-39% constant currency growth. Cloud and software revenue is expected to be €22.4-22.7 billion, representing 8.5-10% constant currency growth.Operating profit for the year is also expected to be €7.85-8.05 billion growing 9.5-12.5% in constant currency, which was raised slightly from prior guidance of growth of 7.5-11.5% in constant currency.While the stock remains up ~15% since pre-releasing earnings and the announcement of their CEO departing, the stock is still down over 5% since their July high of ~$140. Cloud growth continues to impress and will likely remain strong over the next several quarters given the expanding relationship with Microsoft Azure. Over time, we investors should see margins continue to expand, leading to increased profitability.Management reiterated both their medium-term targets and FY19 guidance, which should reinforce their underlying confidence in the business fundamentals despite the several unknown market conditions (potential economic slowdown, trade wars, Brexit).Data by YChartsCompared to other larger cap software competitors, SAP trades at a forward P/E ratio near the middle of the pack. Even though each of these competitors have an international presence, SAP's exposure to both Europe and Asia Pacific puts them at higher scrutiny considering current international economic conditions seems to be under pressure.However, by reiterating both FY19 and medium-term targets, I believe management remains very confident in the next several years of their business growth and investors should look forward to the next few years of success.Q3 provided a strong quarter for investors to become more confident around the name. While Q2 was a bit of a disappointment, it seems like the company is now operating at full power. The expanded relationship with Microsoft Azure gives SAP additional firepower to expand margins and increase their profitability.While it is a little more challenging to say now is a better time to build up a position in the name compared to a few months ago, I believe investors will continue to be rewarded over the long term. For now, I would remain long in this name and look to pick up additional shares on any dips."

The market is very pleased with SAP's strong cloud initiatives.SAP's third-quarter revenues grew 13% over the year to €6.82 billion (~$7.57 billion), ahead of the market's estimates of $7.37 billion. Net income grew 28% to €1.25 billion (~$1.40 billion). Adjusted EPS was €1.30 (~$1.45), marginally ahead of the market's forecast of $1.31 for the quarter.By segment, Cloud and software business revenues grew 13% to €5.647 billion with cloud revenues growing 37% to €1.807 billion (~$2 billion). Software licenses & support revenues grew 4% to €3.840 billion. Cloud revenues pertaining to SaaS and PaaS segments grew 34% €1.582 billion and cloud revenues for IaaS grew 29% to €170 million. Services revenues accounted for 17% of the quarter's revenues and grew 15% to €1.162 billion.For the current year, SAP reiterated its view of cloud and software revenues of €22.4-€22.7 billion (~$25.2-$25.9 billion).During the quarter, SAP remained focused on growing its Cloud revenues. It recently announced a tie-up with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) through a partnership called Embrace. The agreement was SAP's response to address concerns from its customers regarding the difficulty they face in shifting from SAP's traditional on-premise model to remotely hosted services.The three-year agreement will help SAP's large enterprise customers move their business processes into the cloud. They will be able to run operations hosted at remote servers supported by SAP's S/4HANA database with Microsoft acting as their reseller. The partnership is expected to accelerate and simplify customer migration to S/4HANA on Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft will embed SAP Cloud platform solutions and related services within Azure Cloud Services. SAP expects the tie-up to help generate an estimated $84 million in annual revenues.This is not the first tie-up for Embrace. SAP has already entered into similar agreements with AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to offer its software for use on their infrastructures. While the move deprioritizes SAP's own IaaS offering, in the longer run, it is expected to help SAP improve market reach and margins.Earlier this month, SAP announced significant enhancements to its business technology platform to include advanced BI capabilities. Its business technology platform now includes the Data Warehouse Cloud solution, SAP HANA Cloud, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP HANA Cloud Services. By integrating all data and analytics capabilities, SAP is able to offer a complete interconnected service that can store, process, govern, and analyze large volumes of data.Additionally, the self-service solution makes it easier for businesses to quickly connect their data together and translate it into valuable information. The Data Warehouse Cloud can be deployed either standalone or as an extension to SAP's existing on-premise offerings. The service is offered through a flexible pricing model so that customers don't have to provide for high up-front investment costs.SAP's cloud initiatives appear to be delivering strong results already. While its rival Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is struggling to grow its revenues, SAP has delivered double-digit revenue growth. Unfortunately, Oracle does not give a detailed breakout of its cloud business performance, making it difficult to truly compare the two players.SAP announced a change in leadership. Long-term CEO, Bill McDermott, is stepping down. He will remain in an advisory capacity till the end of the year. He will be replaced by executive board members Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein as co-CEOs. The market is looking up to the duo to help SAP compete with younger companies like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and continue to drive higher performance from the Cloud.SAP's stock is trading at $132.71 with a market capitalization of $163.3 billion. It had climbed to a 52-week high of $140.62 in July this year. It hit a 52-week low of $94.81 in December last year.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4276473,103480,2019-07-22T13:15:59-04:00,"Shares of SAP have pulled back approximately 7% since releasing disappointing Q2 results that slightly missed Wall Street's targets on the top and bottom line.
        Cloud strength continues, however, driven in part by SAP's recent acquisitions. Cloud revenues are up 40% y/y in the quarter.
        The company is attributing softer revenue growth in other parts of the business to the global trade war. Revenues lost this quarter may resurface in future quarters.
        Importantly, however, SAP has reiterated its long-term outlook - which includes a tripling of cloud revenues and a 500bps improvement in operating margins by 2023.","It seems that SAP (SAP), the German software titan, continues to alternate between good quarters and bad. Q2 caught SAP on the downswing: revenue growth decelerated from last quarter while operating margins remained flat, leading to a broad miss to Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom lines. As a result, shares have pulled back about 7% since releasing the results:In spite of SAP's small speed bump, I believe the company to be a compelling long position; and the post-earnings dip offers a tremendous opportunity to buy into a strong global franchise with an entrenched customer base. SAP's most compelling driver remains its potential in cloud. Like Oracle (ORCL), SAP was a bit of a late-starter to the SaaS game, whereas Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was an early mover and is now reaping the benefits of tremendous Azure gains. But with a couple of recent acquisitions like Callidus under its belt, plus the conversion of its existing customer base to more subscription-based offerings, SAP is beginning to set a strong pace in the cloud. Despite what many investors perceived to be a weak second quarter, SAP's cloud revenues still grew at 43% y/y in Q2 on an as-reported basis (or 37% y/y on a constant currency basis), decelerating just four points from last quarter's 41% constant currency growth rate. On a regional basis, the company continues to see strong 44% y/y constant currency cloud growth in its home EMEA market, as shown in the chart below:Figure 1. SAP cloud revenue by regionSource: SAP Q2 earnings presentationIn my view, investors should remain focused on SAP's progress in cloud as well as its continued improvements in both gross and operating margins (cloud gross margins, by the way, saw a minor 4bps bump this quarter). The resolution of the U.S.-China trade war is a matter of when rather than if, and near-term noise impacting a single quarter's results should be overlooked.Perhaps one of the most salient updates that SAP gave this quarter is the fact that the company is holding on to both its short-term and longer-term outlooks, indicating that the current near-term weakness will be made up in future quarters and has no bearing on SAP's forward outlook.Here's a refresher on what that plan looks like:Figure 2. SAP four-year planSource: SAP Q2 earnings presentationThe most critical points about the 2023 plan: SAP plans to triple its cloud revenue while improving operating margins by 500bps, at a rate of approximately 100bps per year. Recall that shares of SAP shot up by 10% when SAP unveiled this plan last quarter. Now, shares are sitting comfortably below the $129 mark at which they were trading after last quarter's earnings release, despite the fact that the bullish outlook underpinning last quarter's rally has not changed.I continue to view SAP as an undervalued growth story. Among the large-cap software stocks, SAP has one of the lowest PEG ratios, as shown in the chart below; while its P/E ratio is second-lowest only to Oracle (ORCL) - whose own cloud execution also sees periodic rocky bumps:Let's dive into SAP's Q2 results in further detail:Figure 3. SAP 2Q19 resultsSource: SAP Q2 investor letterOn a non-IFRS basis, SAP's revenues grew 11% y/y (8% y/y on a constant currency basis) to €6.66 billion, missing Wall Street's mark of €6.71 billion (+12% y/y) by a slight one-point margin. Perhaps predictably, SAP's CEO Bill McDermott blamed this quarter's top-line miss on the ongoing U.S.-China trade uncertainties, which he claims pushed out several deals:If we believe management's assessment, then we should believe that instead of SAP ""missing"" its targets this quarter due to lost deals, these deals simply got pushed out to future quarters. Furthermore, pushing out these deals may increase their size, due to SAP clients' geographic expansions in response to the growing trade war. McDermott also said that he spent one-on-one time with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, and is confident on the strength of the Chinese economy as a whole.Trade-related weakness aside, we also note several other positive points in SAP's second-quarter results. As previously mentioned, cloud revenues saw robust 37% y/y constant currency growth. We can also see the benefits of the growing cloud revenue mix in SAP's ""predictable revenues,"" which are up 3 points as a percentage of revenues to 69%. The increased visibility that SAP now has into its future revenues gives us greater confidence when the company maintains its aggressive outlook.On the profit side, the near-term revenue headwinds prevented SAP from making operating margin improvements this quarter. Pro forma operating margins remained flat at 27.3% in Q2, following a 50bps operating margin gain last quarter:Figure 4. SAP operating margin trendsSource: SAP Q2 earnings presentationStill, operating profits rose 11% y/y to €1.82 billion. Pro forma EPS also rose 11% y/y to €1.09, though that slightly missed Wall Street's expectations of €1.11 by two percentage points. SAP's post-earnings dip represents a well-timed opportunity to buy into a dominant, global software leader that is just making strides in cloud. SAP continues to lead in several categories of enterprise software, most notably ERP and more recently, experience management (XM) thanks to SAP's $8 billion purchase of Qualtrics last November. Though this quarter's results are slightly disappointing, if we believe management's assessment, SAP's pipeline continues to grow - and any revenues lost this quarter will resurface in future quarters as deals get picked back up. Stay long here."
4243142,104700,2019-02-21T21:56:18-05:00,Strong dividend growth in the past few years.Cloud business with a lot of potential.Financial crisis hardly impacted revenues and profits.,"SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Germany's most valuable company as well as the world’s fourth largest software manufacturer. The software produced by SAP is used in more than 425,000 companies across 25 different industries. The company grew to a key pillar of the global economy. Its customers brew 77% of the world’s beer production, produce 79% of the chocolate on this planet and distribute 76% of healthcare products worldwide.Figure 1: Companies which use SAP(Source: Company presentation, September 2018)Th software can only be replaced at extremely high costs. Therefore, SAP has nearly guaranteed its future revenues and profits. This gives the company an extremely big moat against competitors.SAP was founded by five IBM engineers who were told that IBM was abandoning their project, and they founded SAP in June 1972 as “Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung” (System Analysis and Program Development). They started first to develop a mainframe program for payroll and accounting. Afterwards, they grew the product portfolio to other areas like material management and production planning. That was the story till the mid-1990s. The first enterprise resource planning (ERP) software was developed in 2004. Now, SAP offers a software that can handle almost all business processes (accounting, controlling, sales, purchasing, production, warehousing, personnel). Companies often use many different systems to manage their data and tend to be inefficient with that much different software. SAP is offering an all-in-one solution.Figure 2: Overview of SAP's functions(Source: How Does SAP Work? - Easy Explanation with An Example)The next mayor step was to get involved into cloud business in 2012 and the launch of SAP S/4HANA. SAP HANA offers customer a faster way to analyse and access their data with a smaller data footprint. SAP is focusing on developing a software to improve the processes of business and to improve people’s lives.The company will do that by way of a reduction of administrative complexity and transitioning its customers to a sustainable, fully digital enterprise.Figure 3: Development of SAP(Source: Company Presentation 2018, Capital Markets Day)SAP HANA offers a real-time analysis of huge amounts of data. It is possible to collect data from production, to analyze it in real time and to intervene at an early stage.The software helps its customers to keep track of their business and business processes. Due to increasing globalization, companies need to manage their supply and sales chains effectively to compete with their competition.Figure 4: Revenue breakdown(Source: Investor Relations Fact Sheet January 2019)In my opinion, SAP has a very strong business moat. The operative margin is at around 20% and the return of equity is at 16% - a clear sign of a strong moat.The reasons for this is that the costs for changing the software are extremely high, so maintaining the status quo is almost always the cheaper alternative. Data is customized for SAP, employees have been trained in the program and alternatives are not always much cheaper or better. Customers are tied up in the long term, and over time, more products from SAP can be sold.76% of all business transactions worldwide are handled by an SAP software system. That’s a stunning USD 2.9 trillion in commerce annually. If SAP were to disappear overnight, over 425,000 customers would be technologically back in the 1970s and would not be able to operate.SAP supports its customers in their digital transformation, as data is the most important raw material of our modern society and of every company. In the near future, it will be more important than ever for all companies to learn from their data and to optimize their processes. Data is the new ""currency"" in an enterprise. A faster and more efficient way to use it will give companies a competitive advantage.Business can simplify their IT environment, leverage data and accelerate business processes. Additionally, SAP offers machine learning and the Internet of Things for new business processes and real-time analytics to control the business processes.SAP has a strong outlook for the upcoming years. Its cloud subscription should grow >30%, and operating profit should grow between 7.5% and 11%. Also, the company's outlook till 2023 is impressive. Its revenue should grow to over EUR 35 billion and operating profits with 10% CAGR. The outlook is the basis of my earnings model below.In my opinion, the fast-growing cloud subscriptions and support is the most interesting aspect of the whole outlook.Figure 5: Outlook(Source: Investor Relations Fact Sheet January 2019)The fast-growing cloud business and the growth in support revenue will drive a higher share of more predictable revenue.CEO William McDermott has led the company since 2002 and is the highest paid CEO in Germany. The track record of the past is respectable. Under him, the company has been able to increase its dividend significantly. The current dividend yield at 1.4% is not that high, but the growth is what to look at.Figure 6: Dividend history(Source: Investor Relations Fact Sheet January 2019)The switching costs are high, and therefore, the current revenue should be relative stable. I see risks with the general economy. The expansion of IT structure is necessary, but in a recession, companies could postpone their IT projects. However, the economic dependence of SAP is very low. In the financial crisis of 2009, revenue and profits hardly fell, and they were even higher in the next year as before the crisis.Figure 7: Financial overview(Source: Morningstar)A further risk is from its competition. Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) or a new company could develop a more attractive and cheaper product in the long run. The result would be a declining market share, revenue and profits. SAP is working against that with a stunning 28% of its whole workforce (23,000 employees) in research & development.Another difficult-to-value risk is the possibility of an attack from hackers or gaps in the software that can be used for espionage. These scenarios would lead to legal claims and damage to the company's image.The debt is no risk in SAP, as for Q4 2018, it was holding nearly EUR 8.6 billion in cash against around EUR 11.6 billion in debt.I have made an earnings model with three different scenarios. For all of them, I used a discount rate of 10% and a terminal multiple of 10.The first scenario indicates the worst case. That means SAP is not able to increase its margin and cannot grow its cloud business as expected.Scenario 2 is the best case. Here the growth exceeds expectations, and the cloud business explodes.Scenario 3 is the normal case. The growth is like the management expects it to be.Figure 8: Earnings model(Source: Author's own calculation)The fair value is at around EUR 74, the price level of July 2016. If we were to increase the terminal multiple to 15, the fair value would be at EUR 91.SAP is quality company and a growth machine, but a lot of the growth is already priced into the stock currently. If the company falls to the levels of 2016, I would happily buy more of it. At the current stock price, I think there are better investments out there, even though I really like the story behind SAP. Many companies would not be that efficient without the use of SAP software."

        Revenue growth accelerated to +16% y/y, seven points stronger than last quarter, driven by the Callidus and Qualtrics acquisitions.
        Management also noted a goal of improving operating margins by five points through 2023.
        Overall, SAP's cloud business continues to add recurring billings as it grows both organically and through M&A, while margins and cash flow are trending upward.
        SAP remains one of the true value names among large-cap software stocks.","Though German software giant SAP (SAP) has often lagged behind its large-cap U.S. counterparts like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM), the company has begun to turn the corner. The company kicked off its fiscal 2019 with a bang, accelerating its pace of revenue growth through newly acquired cloud subsidiaries Callidus and Qualtrics, which extend SAP's reach into both CPQ (to compete with Salesforce) and customer experience, respectively. Investors applauded SAP's results as well as its commitment to boosting future operating margins, sending shares up 12%:It's fairly safe to say that SAP is an often-overlooked technology stock. To its chagrin, SAP often gets lumped in with names like Oracle (ORCL), branded as a legacy software company that is struggling to make a full pivot into cloud. Yet the difference between Oracle's and SAP's progress in cloud couldn't be any starker - concerns about Oracle's growth rates pushed the company to consolidate cloud and non-cloud software sales into a single revenue line, masking the company's underlying cloud growth rates, whereas SAP's cloud bookings are growing north of 40% y/y. Granted, a lot of this growth is M&A-driven - but at least that shows that SAP is making some smart buys.With cloud growth and management's renewed focus on improved operating margins (to be discussed further in this article) acting as tailwinds to the stock, I'd argue that a ~23x forward P/E ratio and a ~0.7x PEG ratio represents a fairly good entry point into SAP as it continues to transform its business into an agile, higher-margin cloud subscription business. Given the solid momentum that SAP has built up coming out fo the first quarter, it's a good time for investors to review the bullish thesis on this stock and continue building up a long position. First, a quick download on the headline results in Q1:Figure 1. SAP 1Q19 resultsSource: SAP 1Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 16% y/y to €6.09 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of €5.93 billion (+13% y/y) by a wide three-point margin. Note that the seven-point acceleration from last quarter's growth rate of 9% y/y was largely due to acquisitions. Still, however, it's important to highlight the 45% y/y growth in cloud bookings. It's also worth noting that SAP's top-line strength was broadly distributed across all key regions. Cloud growth was particularly strong in Asia, where a boost in China and Japan deals led to a 51% y/y growth rate (on a constant currency basis) in cloud revenues:Figure 2. SAP growth highlights by regionSource: SAP Q1 earnings deckOn the profitability front, cloud gross margins also advanced three points to 66.2%, while operating profits advanced 19% y/y to €1.47 billion. The company managed to pare down sales and marketing costs (its largest expense category) by 90bps as a percentage of revenues. Pro forma EPS of €0.90 also beat analysts' consensus of €0.83 with 7% upside, while free cash flows advanced 10$ y/y to a whopping €2.37 billion, representing a rich 39% FCF margin . Let's dive deeper into SAP's growth in the cloud. SAP has built up a dominant position in on-prem software by being a ""one-stop shop"" across many different software categories - ranging from ERP, supply chain, and CRM. The company is now trying to replicate this strategy into the cloud, as evidenced by its aggressive M&A-driven push into new software categories.So far, this strategy has worked. Though pure-play cloud names tend to get all the attention (popular stocks like Workday (WDAY) and Zendesk (ZEN) come to mind here), it's easy to forget that SAP also operates some category-leading brands. Ariba is the primary example here - by far, Ariba is the go-to platform for enterprise procurement, with the company's total $3.1 trillion in annual spend under management (per CEO Bill McDermott's commentary on the Q4 earnings call) dwarfing the pure-play competitor Coupa (COUP), a highly popular stock which trades at a double-digit forward multiple of revenues. Qualtrics is another highlight here. Prior to acquiring the popular survey/user experience platform, SAP had virtually no presence in the space. Now, it's a venerable threat to names like SurveyMonkey (SVMK) and newer unicorn Medallia. Qualtrics' ~40% y/y revenue growth rate also certainly helps the optics of SAP's cloud growth. Here's some further color from McDermott's earnings call commentary, asserting that SAP is one of the fastest-growing cloud businesses at its scal (key points highlighted):Cloud is also more than just a buzzword; the fact that SAP is shifting its business into primarily subscription-based deals has also made its revenue stream much more reliable. The company now estimates that 72% of its revenues come from ""highly predictable revenue streams,"" including the lower-margin (but consistent) on-prem support services business. Perhaps most encouraging about this quarter's update, however, was SAP's commitment to further margin growth. SAP's CEO stressed that this margin effort is ""not about cost reduction,"" but instead about making more intelligent hiring decisions and operating more efficiently across the board.SAP laid out a new five-year plan that will target 100bps of operating margin improvement per year through 2023, with an expected total margin boost of five points through the end of that window. For comparison's sake, SAP ran at a 24.0% pro forma operating margin in Q1 (+50bps on a y/y basis). Figure 3. SAP long-term targetsSource: SAP Q1 earnings deckWhile a 1% shift in operating margin appears small at first glance, it's actually quite sizable for a company of SAP's scale. With a total annual revenue run rate of approximately ~€25 billion, one point represents €250 million - a ~3.5% y/y bump on FY18's operating profits alone. A five-point improvement by 2023 translates into €1.25 billion at today's revenue scale, and 17.5% of operating profit growth relative to last year's results - and this does not yet factor in profit growth from revenue growth, particularly on the cloud front.SAP has put forth an ambitious five-year plan that includes a tripling of cloud revenues, a revenue stream that is ~80% recurring, and a whopping five points of operating margin growth. Its strong Q1 results offer a clear signal that the company is making steady progress toward both its top- and bottom-line goals.Though often overshadowed by more popular cloud stocks, investors should take note that SAP is the parent company behind an array of cloud powerhouses like Ariba, SuccessFactors, and now Qualtrics/Callidus. Stay long on this name and buy into the momentum."
4213075,103480,2018-10-22T07:21:36-04:00,"SAP shares sank after reporting Q3 results, largely due to disappointing bottom-line results and a contraction in operating margins.A faster-than-expected mix of cloud revenues pulled operating margins down, as cloud revenues have a lower margin profile in the near term.However, cloud gross margins are up, and the better-than-expected bookings have prompted SAP to lift its revenue growth outlook.Despite the tremendous improvement in SAP's business over the past year, specifically on the cloud transition front, SAP's stock has moved largely flat.While it's true that startups are gaining market share in many of SAP's key areas, SAP will always be the goliath in products like ERP, procurement, and supply chain tools.","Earnings releases are seldom positive events for SAP (SAP), the German software giant whose stock has whimpered all year long despite notable advances in its cloud efforts. After posting Q3 results, SAP's shares slid yet again, adding further injury to a stinging October correction that quickly pulled SAP down from a year-to-date high of $127 reached in late September.Like its unfortunate peer in the large-cap software sector, Oracle (ORCL), SAP has been a laggard for an extended period of time. While investors have latched onto high-growth SaaS startups (though in October, investors quickly pivoted out of these names), Oracle and SAP are enduring extended punishment for not transitioning quickly enough into the cloud. SAP's cloud growth is soaring now - cloud bookings growth hit nearly 40% y/y this quarter and accelerated sequentially from Q2 - but still nothing seems to stoke investors' enthusiasm in SAP any longer. The company has become quite the value stock - something that's quite rare in the technology space.SAP data by YChartsThere's no doubt that SAP is not the most exciting stock in which to invest in the technology space. The company is decades old - and if you strip out the company's cloud growth, overall revenues are barely moving an inch (due to the fact that cloud bookings are essentially cannibalizing what would have been larger upfront billings for perpetual license software). But even so, SAP is stable in the IT landscape. And despite competition from both startups and fellow large-cap peers like Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle in virtually every category of software it competes in, SAP has managed to drive stable top-line and earnings expansion across its broad portfolio of apps.Take the procurement space, for example. Coupa (COUP), which went public two years ago with its fast-growing procurement tool that aimed to be the Amazon (AMZN) of B2B purchasing, is certainly a fast-growing company. But SAP Ariba still towers over it. This quarter, SAP's Business Network segment (which primarily houses the Ariba product) grew revenues at 22% y/y on a constant currency basis, making up about 11% of SAP's overall revenues. Per SAP's own press release, Ariba remains the ""largest commerce platform in the world with approximately $2.6 trillion global commerce annually transacted in more than 180 countries."" At present, no other company can match that.SAP isn't sitting still on its core strengths, either. Last quarter, the company made a big deal out of its Callidus acquisition, which extends its reach into CRM and positions it as a future competitor to Salesforce.com's (CRM) traditional dominance in sales and marketing software. The key point here is: SAP has a lot of different application categories - in some of which SAP is the clear leader, and others in which it's an emerging contender. It has planted seeds in many different areas of enterprise software, and that gives the company a high degree of long-term survivability.Buoyed by the company's results in the third quarter, SAP's management even raised its guidance outlook for the full year - it's not expecting cloud subscription and support revenue that's €100 million higher (a ~4% bump) than its prior range. The company is also lifting its operating profit forecast for the year by another €25 million.Figure 1. SAP updated guidanceSource: SAP investor relationsIt's difficult to find any kernels of negative news coming out of SAP, so I'd stick to my guns and stay long.Let's dive deeper into the results of SAP's third quarter, which investors reacted negatively to. Here's the full financial table below:Figure 2. SAP 3Q18 resultsSource: SAP investor relationsYou'll note above that total revenues saw rather weak 8% y/y growth to €6.02 billion. However, note that in constant currency, SAP said its revenues actually grew by 10% y/y. This is flat to last quarter's constant currency growth rate of 10% y/y, and an improvement in nominal terms (as SAP had only grown its top line on an unadjusted basis by 4% y/y last quarter).The main culprit for slowing overall growth, ironically, is better-than-expected cloud strength, as this shifts more revenues out into future quarters. Cloud subscription and support revenues grew 39% y/y this quarter (and 41% y/y in constant currency terms), accelerating two points over last quarter's constant currency growth of 39% y/y.New cloud bookings also hit €411 million this quarter and grew 37% y/y, ensuring a robust pipeline for future revenues. Note also that the share of SAP's predictable/recurring revenues grew three points to 68% of revenues. Despite not being as celebrated as other companies that transitioned successfully into the cloud like Adobe (ADBE), there's no doubt that SAP is now primarily a subscription-oriented business, which is what Wall Street wants to see.Figure 3. Cloud bookings and other key metrics Source: SAP investor relationsThis cloud strength - while a positive for the long term - hurts near-term profitability, as cloud gross margins are currently lower than license gross margins. Cloud gross margins, however, did improve by 380bps to 58.6% on an IFRS basis, so this is what we should mostly focus on. The greater mix of cloud revenues relative to license revenues, however, pulled overall operating margins down to 20.5%, as shown in the margin trends below:Figure 4. SAP margin trendsSource: SAP investor relationsAs a result, operating profits slipped -6% y/y on an IFRS basis to €1.24 million. Earnings per share, too, were flat at €0.82. The post-earnings selloff on SAP is likely due to investors seizing upon the near-term profit weakness instead of emphasizing the strength in cloud revenues and bookings. Cloud gross margins are going up too, which means the future impact to operating margins won't be as heavy.In my view, SAP's sluggish stock price performance hasn't adequately reflected the tremendous progress that SAP has made on the cloud side, nor its nascent efforts to expand into categories like ERP. SAP is an irreplaceable titan of both the tech sector as well as the Eurozone economy - and as such, it's a safe stock to bank on for the long term. Focus on the company's cloud bookings, cloud margin improvement, and guidance raise - the rest is mostly short-term noise."
4221391,101421,2018-11-12T14:03:58-05:00,"SAP intends to acquire Qualtrics for $8 billion just prior to the target's IPO.Qualtrics provides software that enables enterprises to collect and manage experience data from customers, employees, and partners.The deal is very pricey and SAP is taking on significant debt to finance the acquisition.","SAP (SAP) has announced an agreement to acquire Qualtrics (XM) in an $8 billion all-cash deal just prior to Qualtrics’ IPO.Qualtrics has developed a software-as-a-service for enterprises to enable them to collect data from employees, partners, and customers.SAP is taking on significant debt to finance the expensive deal, which won’t provide a catalyst until late 2019 or 2020 at the earliest. Investors should exercise caution in the interim.Provo, Utah and Seattle, Washington-based Qualtrics was founded in 2002 to provide software as a service that empowers organizations with the data they need to keep their customers satisfied through various stages of the customer journey.Management is headed by Co-Founder and CEO Ryan Smith, who previously served in Brand Management at Ford Motor Company.Qualtrics has developed its Experience Management, or XM, platform which it says enables organizations to:The firm’s focus industries, throughout which the company’s solutions are utilized include but are not limited to, B2B, automotive, government, travel & hospitality, financial services, media, airlines, and retail industries.Investors in Qualtrics include Grandview Holdings, Accel, Sequoia Capital, and Insight Venture Partners.Market & CompetitionAccording to a 2018 market research report by Research and Markets, the global customer experience management market is projected to grow to $21.3 billion by 2024, representing a very strong CAGR of 22% during the period between 2018 and 2024.The main factor driving market growth is the increasing need for personalized customer experience.Major competitors that provide or are developing customer experience management services include:Major competitors that provide or are developing services that compete with some of XM’s features include:SAP disclosed the acquisition price as $8 billion in cash. Management said it had obtained financing commitments for EUR7 billion to cover the purchase price. It expects the deal to close in 1H 2019.SAP is acquiring Qualtrics as part of a strategy to combine experience data with operational data to improve enterprise results for its client base of over 413,000.As Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, SAP’s stock price has dropped 10.6% vs. the S&P 500 Index rise of 3.4%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaSAP wants Qualtrics for a number of reasons, including the overarching combination of Qualtrics’ experiential data collection system with SAP’s operating data capabilities.SAP has a 15,000-strong sales force that generates 68% of the firm’s revenue outside the U.S., whereas Qualtrics only generates 22% of its revenue outside the U.S., so there are opportunities for geographic complementarity.Qualtrics is growing revenue at a much faster rate than larger and slower-growing SAP and has been free cash flow positive and generating earnings, albeit on a much smaller revenue base than SAP.SAP views the deal in the context of its ‘Intelligent Enterprise’ initiative where it has focused its efforts on cloud-based solutions for the multi-decade enterprise transition from on-premises systems to the cloud.Management provided an investor presentation about the acquisition and highlighted its cloud growth trajectory since 2010:Source: SAPSAP’s stock performance in the past 12 months has been disappointing, yet analysts seem to continue to like the stock and together view it as undervalued at the current price of $101 vs consensus target price of $130.55:Source: Seeking AlphaIn the immediate wake of the deal announcement, the stock sold off and is down 6% on a generally down day for technology stocks, so it is difficult to estimate how much of the downdraft is due to investors not liking the acquisition or other, unrelated issues.SAP is paying 21.5x TTM revenue for Qualtrics, which is at the very high end of recent blockbuster tech software M&A deals, as the graphic below shows:Source: Tomasz TunguzSince SAP is paying such a high price for Qualtrics and taking on nearly $8 billion in debt to do the deal, management will have some serious execution requirements to show the deal can pay off.The transaction isn’t scheduled to close until 1H 2019, so investors won’t begin to see the results until late 2019 or, more probably, 2020.That’s quite a long wait in my view. Investors may want to take a wait-and-see approach to SAP stock in the interim as the deal won’t generate a meaningful catalyst until at least 12 - 24 months from today.The enterprise software market is on fire right now and SAP's deal for Qualtrics is another data point, and an extreme one, indicating legacy software firms are increasingly motivated to acquire growth, even if it means paying nosebleed prices for it."
4165682,103480,2018-04-25T12:44:26-04:00,"SAP reported a surprise beat to Q1 earnings, and shares popped 2.5% amid a market that has struggled with correction territory.Cloud subscription revenues, possibly the most-watched metric in the company, showed strong acceleration on a constant currency basis over last quarter.This distinguishes SAP highly from Oracle, which failed to meet cloud expectations in its most recent quarter.With shares having traded sideways for an extended length of time, SAP still remains undervalued relative to other large-cap software peers.","On a day that the entire market was crashing in response to rising treasury yields, and the tech sector digested mixed earnings from Alphabet (GOOG) that included a huge unforeseen jump in expenses, SAP (SAP), the German software giant, emerged as one of the only bright spots in an otherwise bleak market. Coming off an extended period in which the company's shares have pulled back and not really moved much since, SAP looks particularly compelling in the face of upbeat prospects for its ever-more important cloud business.SAP's U.S.-traded stock has fallen from levels near $120 and spent the better part of the last three months hovering in the low $100s:SAP data by YChartsIt's pretty safe to say that SAP's results are largely unexpected. Database giant Oracle (ORCL) is essentially in the same spot as SAP when it comes to cloud transitions, and just last quarter, Oracle reported dismal cloud results that showed massive deceleration from prior growth levels and caused the stock to spiral. Investors were probably conditioned into thinking SAP would more or less report the same flavor of results. Unexpectedly, however, the company pulled off a surprise acceleration in cloud subscription revenues.Adding icing to the cake, SAP bumped up its FY18 guidance ranges significantly above consensus expectations - we must note, however, that the majority of the raise was due to the addition of Callidus (NASDAQ:CALD), a CRM platform that SAP acquired for $2.4 billion in Q1. SAP isn't alone in relying on acquisitions to juice cloud growth, however; as Oracle itself snapped up NetSuite (NYSE:N) for nearly $10 billion a little more than a year ago.Overall, SAP is looking more and more like an overlooked stock whose story is falling into the right places. Mega-cap tech investors have flocked heavily to the likes of Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) in recent months as the rest of the tech sector lagged, but names like SAP showing impressive cloud growth and rebounding profits are clearly the more value-oriented choice. Stay long on this name.I'm using the phrase ""earnings beat"" a bit loosely. On a headline metric basis, SAP's results were actually quite mixed, but the upside on cloud revenues and FY18 guidance certainly swung the reaction into the ""beat"" corner.Here's a look at the company's first quarter results:Figure 1. SAP Q1 resultsSource: SAP investor relationsSAP's total revenues, on an IFRS-reported basis, were actually flat at €5.26 billion. This was a bit lower (€40 million deficit) to what Wall Street was expecting, though, on a percentage basis, the gap is almost inconsequential. You'll notice, however, that constant currency revenues actually grew 9% y/y. Just like last quarter, the weakness of the U.S. dollar against the euro has put a huge damper on SAP's results. However, in an FX-neutral year, the company actually achieved quite a significant leg of growth. Add that to the fact that constant currency growth last quarter was only 6% - the 300bps acceleration is extremely meaningful for a company of this size.When we look at the company's revenue composition, this is where the cloud strength becomes readily apparent. As we expected (and as we want) SAP to do, the company is progressing heavily toward its goal of converting on-prem license customers to cloud subscription contracts. Subscription revenues not only provide more stable and recurring revenues but are also high-margin in the long term as they don't typically require heavy sales expenses to renew.Cloud revenues grew 18% y/y on an IFRS basis to €1.07 billion, dipping below the 20% growth SAP saw last quarter. However, on a constant currency basis - which is the better picture of business health - the cloud segment saw 31% y/y growth, accelerating over 28% y/y growth in Q4. Of course, this is much lower of an acceleration than we typically see among high-growth startups, but when a company like SAP with >$20 billion in annual revenues is able to show increasing growth rates from quarter over quarter, that's a hugely positive sign.SAP also reports a pro forma metric called ""share of predictable revenue"" that rose 200bps y/y to 71%. This includes cloud revenues and all the other portions of license and tertiary revenues that are expected to recur on an annual basis. With both cloud revenues and ""predictable revenues"" taking over a greater slice of SAP's revenue mix, the company has solid long-term footing ahead of it.On the profit side, SAP also came out on top. Gross margin stood at 70.2% in the quarter (already a sky-high margin), rising modestly over 69.9% in 1Q17. Operating profit, however, was the highlight of the earnings release, with IFRS-basis operating profits growing to €1.025 billion, up 52% y/y and representing a solid 19.5% operating margin (up massively from 12.7% in the prior-year quarter). In addition to the gross margin improvement, SAP also drove some reductions in sales and marketing as well as general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenues.The uptick in operating profits (along with the recognition of Callidus' contribution) was a major reason for an upwardly revised FY18 guidance, the main impetus for sending shares up post-release. The chart below, also taken from SAP's earnings materials, showcases the movement in guidance ranges:Figure 2. SAP guidance updateSource: SAP investor relationsThe revenue outlook of €24.8-25.3 billion (representing 5.5% to 7.5% y/y growth) is a solid outlier above Wall Street's expectations for €24.3 billion. It's a natural reaction to think this upside is due to Callidus, but looking at Callidus' recently published 10-K, the company had $253.1 million of revenues at a 22% y/y growth rate (roughly €309 million at today's exchange rates). There is some organic upside baked into the new forecast as well.In recognition of SAP's outlook bumps, its wide valuation gap to Microsoft (MSFT) seems a bit unfounded. SAP is trading richer than Oracle because the latter missed cloud expectations, but with cloud momentum on its side, SAP should be able to eventually close the gap to its largest rival, Microsoft - especially when you notice that Microsoft's valuation has only gotten richer while SAP's and Oracle's have crumbled. In the not-too-distant past, SAP traded at parity with Microsoft, even exceeding Microsoft's valuation at certain stretches.ORCL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe bottom line for SAP: SAP is a good buy for exposure to both large-cap software and the eurozone in general. Most of SAP's growth in the quarter came from its outperformance in EMEA, a trend that could continue should the U.S. and China continue flinging trade threats. With SAP's fundamentals assured after a strong Q1 release, now is an opportune time to buy into a somewhat overlooked name in technology."
4188974,103480,2018-07-22T09:40:53-04:00,"SAP shares have slid downward despite strong Q2 results.
        The company posted 30% growth in cloud revenues and bookings, even stronger than Q1 earnings numbers (where the stock rallied in response).
        The acquisition of Callidus and an announced intention to drive deeper focus in CRM will remain another major cloud growth driver for SAP.
        SAP's business has become much more recurring, with ""predictable revenues"" hitting 66% of total revenues (up 3 points year over year).","Among technology stocks, the name SAP (SAP) has never exactly been one of the most popular. Stocks like Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) are ""hot names"" in the internet space (though perhaps not the latter after the most recent earnings report), while Microsoft (MSFT) has dominated the majority of hype for the software space ever since Satya Nadella took the helm and refocused the company away from Windows and onto cloud services.While we'll acknowledge that SAP's push into the cloud has been behind that of Microsoft, the entire group of large-cap software companies have been slower to change. Microsoft spent years building out its cloud services in Office 365 and CRM tools like Microsoft Dynamics and Microsoft PowerBI, while Oracle was a noticeable laggard in transitioning its backend database and frontend applications to a cloud-based consumption model. SAP is not alone in this regard. Yet while Microsoft's stock continues to soar to new heights, especially after the Redmond giant's Q4 earnings release last week, SAP has largely traded flat.While investors in SAP have been impatient for it to get off the ground, I still find the stock to be extremely attractive, both in terms of its relative valuation to peers as well as for exposure to one of the Eurozone's largest companies. On both an earnings and revenue basis, SAP trades at a substantial discount to Microsoft, which has risen 24% year-to-date while SAP has barely remained above flat:In my view, SAP is a strong buy at this juncture, especially after the post-Q2 selloff. Despite typical investors' allergic reaction to SAP's earnings releases, the company is still a high-technology stalwart which has successfully converted the bulk of its revenues into the cloud and continues to dominate leaderboards in some of the most vital categories of software, most notably ERP. SAP's Q2 earnings confirm that the company is on strong footing, though temporary currency effects have blunted the company's revenue metrics in the current quarter. Most Fortune 500 companies, in some fashion or another, rely on SAP for a mission-critical piece of their business - and I find it hard to believe that a company that performs as consistently as SAP isn't worth buying on dips.Here's a look at the company's results in the second quarter:Figure 1. SAP Q2 earnings resultsSource: SAP investor relationsYou'll notice immediately that SAP's revenue growth has been heavily impacted by FX headwinds - the underlying business has performed extremely well, but the massive euro-dollar price swings in the first half of this year have severely cut into SAP's growth. Had currency rates been constant, SAP's €6.0 billion in revenues would have represented 10% y/y growth instead of 4% y/y. Where SAP continues to impress regardless of FX swings, however, is in its cloud business - which is where all the focus has been for the company in the past few years. Cloud subscription revenues grew 30% y/y on a nominal basis (and 40% y/y on a constant currency basis), one of the strongest quarters of cloud growth in a while. Last quarter, SAP had produced 18% y/y cloud growth (31% y/y constant currency) and the quarter before that, 20% y/y cloud growth (28% y/y constant currency). In other words, SAP has consistently been accelerating its cloud growth rate. Of course, not all of this growth is organic. SAP recently acquired the CRM company Callidus, which is at a ~€250 million revenue run rate, but what large-cap software company is innocent of using acquisitions to drive growth? M&A has long been the cornerstone of Oracle's cloud growth strategy, having acquired Netsuite in late 2016 for nearly $10 billion, while Microsoft recently made a major play for GitHub. What I find most encouraging about SAP's cloud business is that there is still unpenetrated territory left to conquer. A Reuters report cited by SA News revealed that SAP intends to double the size of its CRM business within two years. SAP has long been rooted in ERP and supply chain-oriented software like Ariba and Fieldglass, but CRM has never been one of its strong suits. With the addition of Callidus and a public intention to pursue the space more heavily, SAP can gain incremental traction against heavyweights like Salesforce (CRM). CRM has long been known as one of the most lucrative categories in software with one of the largest addressable markets - simply due to the fact that, as most software subscriptions and licenses are priced on a per-seat basis, there are more sales and marketing-oriented employees that are applicable users of CRM tools than any other function in a company.SAP's encouraging results in cloud are also accompanied by improvements on the profit side. Most notable is the fact that SAP has been able to drive down its sales and marketing expenses, the largest component of its operating costs, down 60bps as a percentage of revenues:Figure 2. SAP Q2 margin trendsSource: SAP investor relationsThis is also further helped by the fact that the company improved its cloud gross margins in the quarter, as well as an increased mix of cloud revenues. All in all, SAP's IFRS-based operating profit in the quarter jumped 13% y/y to €1.04 billion, achieving 40bps of operating margin improvement.Despite the mildly negative market reaction to SAP's Q2 report, I find nothing negative about SAP's results - in fact, the acceleration in cloud revenues despite currency headwinds is a strong point in SAP's favor. Adding further context to SAP's outperformance, the company has also lifted its cloud outlook for this year as well as in its long-term roadmap:Figure 3. SAP cloud growth trajectorySource: SAP investor relationsIn a prior Q1 guidance target, SAP had initially indicated 31-36.5% y/y growth in cloud subscription revenues (€4.95-€5.05 billion in revenues, already higher from the initial FY18 target of €4.80-€5.00 billion); now, the company is forecasting 34-38% y/y growth to €5.05-€5.20 billion, a strong three-point shift at the midpoint. The company also noted that this guidance range fully bakes in unfavorable currency impacts.By 2020, SAP has also indicated that it intends cloud subscriptions to hit €8.2-€8.7 billion - if we take the midpoint of that range, it implies a 28% CAGR from 2018 through 2020. That's not bad at all - for comparison, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud division posted 20% y/y revenue growth in Q4 (calendar Q2).SAP continues to be an underrated stock whose cloud potential is often overlooked. It has category-leading offerings in a wide variety of critical software areas, with ambitions to drive more business in areas like CRM. Its time for an outbreak will come."
4141575,103480,2018-01-31T07:38:49-05:00,"SAP reported Q4 earnings results that beat analyst earnings expectations.The company's cloud transition has picked up steam, with 26% growth. SAP's outlook through 2020 implies near doubling of the cloud run rate.SAP also recently announced the acquisition of Callidus, a cloud sales management software platform.Callidus will increase SAP's edge in an area it's traditionally lagged behind Xactly and Salesforce.SAP's recent pullback puts it at an attractive valuation relative to large-cap software peers.","As shares of U.S. large-cap software names like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) and Workday (NYSE: WDAY) continue to tick up (aside from the market-wide pullback in the last few days of December), I've increasingly turned my eye toward SAP (NYSE: SAP), the German software giant that's best known for its market-leading ERP systems.A lot has been riding on SAP's cloud transition. Though SAP's backend-oriented infrastructure software and systems businesses are slightly more immune to customer churn (due to the sheer complexity of setting up ERP systems and how ingrained they become in business processes), it's been clear over the past few years that SAP would eventually need to step up its pivoting into SaaS solutions. In SAP's fourth quarter release, the company delivered well above targets. A total of 150 million unique subscribers are now on SAP's cloud apps, and new cloud bookings accelerated to 31% growth in the quarter.SAP's share of ""predictable revenue"" - aka, cloud revenues as well as other recurring software billings - represented 63% of the company's revenue mix, nearly two-thirds of revenue and up 1 point from 4Q16. This has a huge stabilizing effect on SAP's revenue base, as subscription revenue is revenue that doesn't need to be chased again at the end of a fiscal year.This shift of revenue mix toward cloud will be further accentuated by SAP's dealmaking. The company recently announced its $2.4 billion acquisition of Callidus (NASDAQ: CALD), a cloud software platform for sales management and CPQ (configure, price, and quote) solutions. Unlike other large-cap tech companies (Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL), in particular), SAP makes splashy acquisitions a bit less frequently - but every single time it does, it opens up a huge new category that wasn't previously open to it.Take SuccessFactors, for example. When SAP bought it in 2011 for $3.4 billion, it gained instant access to the cloud HCM market - a space dominated by Workday. SuccessFactors is now a Gartner-designated market leader and contributes hundreds of millions to SAP's cloud platform bookings. Ariba is another (and possibly the best) example. Through Ariba, SAP controls the largest B2B purchasing network in the cloud, with >$1 trillion in spend on the platform in the trailing twelve months.Callidus will give SAP a distinct edge over Salesforce - with SAP's focus on backend enterprise systems, it hasn't clashed all that much with its San Francisco cloud rival. But Callidus' CPQ module will pit it directly against Salesforce, which a few years ago acquired Steelbrick CPQ for $360 million. These new categories - CPQ, HCM, procurement - each shepherded by a major SAP cloud acquisition - will continue to drive the company's cloud trajectory as it aims for €8-€8.5 billion in cloud subscription revenues by 2020, more than double the €3.77 billion it achieved in FY17.Let's turn to SAP's results in the fourth quarter (which was probably ill-timed - despite strong top and bottom-line results as well as a strong outlook, SAP still fell 2.4% in tandem with the broad market selloff):Figure 1. SAP Q4 resultsSource: SAP investor relationsSAP posted total revenues of €6.81 billion, roughly flat y/y on an IFRS basis. The weakness of the U.S. dollar has seriously impacted the company's results in the Americas as well as Asia-Pacific, but in constant currency terms, total revenues were up 6% y/y.Cloud subscription revenues, as shown above, grew 21% y/y (and 28% in constant currency) to €827 million, and new cloud bookings grew 22% y/y (31% in constant currency) to €591 million. Cloud backlog - equally important for a large-cap software company, as it represents SAP's forward-looking cloud revenue pipeline - also grew to a massive €7.5 billion, up 38% y/y. Surprisingly, despite strength in cloud revenues, SAP didn't cannibalize license sales either - at least in the full year 2017. Software licenses still grew 2% on a constant currency basis for FY17, with customers still trending toward ""high renewal rates"" for support contracts.On a geo basis, SAP's non-Americas cloud revenues led the charge - which presents a compelling case for SAP as an investment to diversify exposure into international economies. SAP's 16% constant currency cloud growth in the Americas paled in comparison to 56% y/y growth in EMEA and 49% y/y growth in APAC. Cloud has become more of a commonplace installment in U.S. companies, but not so overseas. As international companies play catch-up in upgrading to cloud solutions, SAP - possibly the most internationally focused of all large-cap software names - is best positioned to capture the tailwinds.On an earnings basis, SAP achieved EPS of €1.55, up 21% y/y. The company also delivered 9% y/y growth in operating cash flows to €5.05 billion and 4% y/y growth in free cash flows to €3.77 billion.SAP's guidance also points to full steam ahead. See the company's guidance summary below:Figure 2. SAP guidanceSource: SAP investor relationsThe company continues to expect strong double-digit cloud growth to €4.8-€5.0 billion next year, with an eye toward €8.0-€8.5 billion by 2020 - more than double today's cloud revenues. As cloud revenues tend to carry stronger operating margins over time, this has huge trickle-down implications to the company's bottom line.At a ~20x forward P/E, SAP is still being valued as a growth company. But relative to its closest large-cap peers, Microsoft and Oracle, SAP still carries a P/E ratio substantially below Microsoft and an EV/forward revenue multiple below both Microsoft and Oracle:SAP PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAs previously mentioned, SAP also provides unique exposure to increased technology (particularly, cloud) adoption overseas. With a narrative of ""synchronized global growth"" overtaking economic headlines, along with strong expectations for worldwide IT spending, investors would be smart to increase their exposure to international companies.Though its fate a few years ago was rather murky, SAP has proven its chops in a cloud-first world. Its acquisition of Callidus will increase its traction in frontend applications and complement its traditional strength in backend enterprise systems. With cloud growth in excess of ~30% (second only to Oracle in the large-cap software world, though Oracle's cloud growth has wobbled as of its most recent quarter) and a goal of reaching as high as €8.5 billion in cloud revenues by 2020, SAP is a strong horse to bet on.In the last three months, SAP stock has largely traded sideways - falling 5% as the S&P500 has risen 10% in the same timeframe, and Microsoft by 11.5% in particular. As the valuation gap between the two grows wider, SAP becomes an increasingly attractive investment in the ""safe"" growth technology space. The stock has been eyeing moves below $110 for the first time in months - if SAP fails below that key support level and hovers closer to the $100 mark, it will be a good time to pick up shares for a rebound."

The firm has featured 10% sales growth in last five years along with superior margins compared to its peers. SAP’s enterprise resource planning applications touch 77% of global transaction revenue and has 150 million subscribers in its cloud applications. In its latest quarter, operating profit growth was double digit along with 200 bps increase in share of predictable revenue as percent of total revenue (66%), reflecting high quality sales. Growth was driven by a number of factors, new cloud bookings grew 24% (29%at constant currencies) in the second quarter and reached €421 million while cloud subscriptions and support revenue grew 30% yoy to €1.21 billion. On the other hand, software revenue was down 9% yoy to €996 million. SAP has raised its expectation for 2018 which indicates 6.5%-7% Non-IFRS revenue growth at constant currencies and has ambition to reach €28-€29 billion in Non-IFRS revenue, which reflects a minimum of 19%+ growth compared to 2017 results. However, my valuations indicate that SAP is overvalued and may exhibit better entry points.“This quarter is exemplary for the road we have chosen: rapidly transforming the company to the cloud while substantially growing profits and margins. I am very confident that this momentum will continue to expand. That’s why we raised our 2018 outlook and 2020 ambition.”- Luka Mucic, Chief Financial Officer, SAP SEPerformance AnalysisFor a broad comparison, I have taken five industry peers which include Oracle (ORCL), Workday (WDAY), Salesforce (CRM), Accenture and VMware (VMW). The stats suggest that SAP has outperformed its peers, demonstrating higher profitability as well as consistency.Source: Data from Stockrow, data processed by the author.SAP has also maintained good FCF margin along with nice dividends (DPS, dividend per share), both fluctuated at a very narrow range.Source: Data from stockrow, data processed by the author. ValuationMy DCF valuation indicates that SAP’s intrinsic value is $105, implying an overvaluation of roughly $15 per share (SAP trading at $120). My initial growth rate assumption was 6%, which is in line with management’s expectations, which then increases by 100 bps for next two years and then declines by 1% in remaining two years for the forecast horizon, going back to its initial growth rate of 6% in its terminal year (2022). Cost of revenue, depreciation and tax rates as percentages of sales are held constant, and close to their historical averages whereas SG&A expenses to sales increase by 150 bps linearly from an initial rate of 32%, reaching 34% in terminal year. R&D as percentage of sales also increases slightly every year. My initial capex to sales estimations are rather high compared to historical averages, which increases by 100 bps linearly every year, reaching 8.5% in terminal year. I have estimated weighted average cost of capital ((wacc)) to be 9.09% and took an exit multiple of 14x (EV/EBITDA), which represents an equivalent perpetual growth rate of 1.88%. Source: author’s calculations (forecast inputs are given at the notes section)SAP is currently trading at its highest P/CF and P/B. It reached a similar P/CF level back in July 2016 but it couldn't sustain at those levels. I am not sure whether it could break the current barriers, combining this with my dcf model, it does look like that SAP is overvalued.Source: Seeking AlphaRisk ExposureIn 2017, approximately 72.4% of SAP’s revenue was attributable to operations in foreign currencies, which exposes the firm to currency risk. The firm is exposed to interest rate risk as well. SAP uses derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Nominal volume of financial debt on December 31, 2017, included amounts in euros (€5,150 million) and U.S. dollars (€1,090 million). Approximately 50% of its financial debt was held at variable interest rates, partially swapped from fixed into variable using interest rate swaps. SAP also faces a number of business risks, which revolves around litigation issues (IP infringement & security laws) and market consolidation.Source: 20-FConclusionSAP has demonstrated strong fundamentals over the years, both in terms of accounting incomes and cash flows. The firm has raised its expectations for 2019 revenue, which reflects the management’s increased conviction in their capabilities to generate superior return. However, from a valuation perspective, SAP looks overpriced. As a result I would suggest a hold, and buy if it converges at least partially towards in intrinsic price.NotesThe following table contains historical averages, forecast inputs and implied margins as a result of the inputs."
4236723,103480,2019-01-30T13:06:04-05:00,"SAP shares took a dive after reporting Q4 results, despite beating current quarter revenue expectations and providing a rosy outlook for FY19.The main culprit is a planned restructuring in FY19 which will impact the bottom line by €800-950 million, mostly in the coming Q1.However, the restructuring will achieve annual savings of approximately that much in FY20 and going forward.SAP is positioning itself for long-term success, especially with the addition of fast-growing applications like Qualtrics. The dip is a good opportunity to buy.","As in many previous quarters, investors shunned shares of SAP (NYSE:SAP) after the German software giant reported Q4 earnings. Thus far, in 2019, SAP has been one of the stocks that have yet to benefit from a large recovery rally, and in my view, the Q4 update contained more positive takeaways than negative.Data by YChartsQ4 results were more or less a wash: SAP did well on the top line but slightly missed EPS consensus. What really needled investors the most, however, was SAP's announcement of a large company-wide restructuring to take place in FY19 and impact the bottom line by €800-950 million. See the details below:Figure 1. SAP restructuring planSource: SAP Q4 investor letterMost stocks tend to teeter on restructuring announcements, and SAP was no exception. Tesla (TSLA) and Autodesk (ADSK) are two recent examples of large-cap technology stocks to announce large-scale layoffs and see a share price decline in response. It's too soon to ascertain the ultimate impact on Tesla, but in Autodesk's case, the company's stock ended up skyrocketing after the restructuring helped to improve bottom-line results without impacting growth.In my view, SAP can achieve the same result: it's executing this restructuring from a position of strength (as evidenced by double-digit growth in cloud), and though FY19 EPS will be sorely impacted by this restructuring, the company will achieve savings roughly equal to FY19's layoff expenses in every subsequent year. From a long-term perspective, SAP looks like it's making the right move.Restructuring aside, SAP's outlook for FY19 also looks robust. The company is expecting rapid 33-39% y/y growth in cloud and software revenues, which is a tremendous growth rate for a business of SAP's size. This greater shift into subscription revenues also implies that SAP's revenue mix is becoming more predictable and recurring over time. Note as well that SAP has set a long-term target of tripling its cloud revenues by 2023.Figure 2. SAP FY19 guidanceSource: SAP Q4 investor letterThe bullish case for SAP rests largely from a value standpoint. Over the past twelve months, shares of SAP have shed more than 10% - despite both top-line and EPS growth, as well as initiatives to drive both revenue and margin expansion in FY19 and beyond.Data by YChartsIn my view, SAP continues to be an undervalued, underappreciated stock whose dominance in the enterprise software sector can't be overstated. SAP still leads several critical categories in enterprise software, including and especially ERP - one of the largest service areas within software. Stay long on this name and hold out for a recovery.Here's a look at SAP's fourth-quarter results:Figure 3. SAP 4Q18 resultsSource: SAP Q4 investor letterRevenue was the key highlight of the quarter, clocking in at €7.43 billion (+9% y/y) versus Wall Street's expectations of €7.21 billion (+6% y/y), indicating a large three-point beat. Note as well that this quarter's revenue growth represented a one-point acceleration relative to Q3's growth rate of 8% y/y. It's important to note as well that the Qualtrics acquisition (which SAP purchased for $8 billion right before its IPO) officially closed in mid-December, so Qualtrics's contribution is not included in this quarter's beat. In other words, SAP showed strong outperformance on an organic basis.Also, key to note is SAP's stellar growth in cloud. Cloud subscription and support revenues grew 41% y/y to €1.41 billion. Note that there are very few standalone software companies that can generate >$1 billion in revenues, and fewer still that are growing in excess of 40% y/y. With the addition of Qualtrics beginning to impact SAP's financials in the coming Q1, SAP can also expect to comfortably sustain its pace of growth in cloud.CFO Luka Mucic also added that despite SAP having raised its target for cloud revenues three times during FY18, the company still managed to exceed its full-year cloud revenue target of €5 billion by a healthy margin of ~€200 million on a constant currency basis.Larger scale on the cloud front also lent itself to improved gross margins. Per Mucic's comments on the Q4 earnings call:Despite the gross margin gains, SAP acknowledged that its operating profit margins came in below target. Pro forma operating margins clocked in at 34.3%, 40 bps lower than 34.7% in the year-ago quarter. As a result, SAP's pro forma EPS of €1.41 also missed Wall Street expectations of €1.55, which represented approximately flat EPS to the prior-year Q4. SAP's CFO blamed the operating margin declines to a larger-than-expected mix of lower-margin services revenues, which were necessary to help grow the cloud business. A small bump in effective tax rates also hampered EPS growth this quarter.It's partially as a result of contracting margins in Q4 that SAP is executing its restructuring plan in FY19. This planned restructuring can have a major impact on SAP's profit growth in FY20. For FY18, SAP generated €5.7 billion in operating profits. The projected €750-850 million in annual cost savings beginning in FY20 could add 13-15% of operating profit growth alone, without considering contributions from future revenue growth.Look past this quarter's results and the expected restructuring-related hit to Q1 profits. SAP's long-term thesis is sound: the company has historically been a very prudent acquirer, with subsidiaries like Ariba and SuccessFactors leading their respective categories. Qualtrics is highly likely to achieve the same - per Morgan Stanley's William McDermott on the Q4 earnings call, Qualtrics is expected to contribute just under €600 million in revenues for FY19. In addition to driving both organic and inorganic top-line growth, SAP has bitten the bullet and announced a restructuring plan that can drive tremendous operating margin growth beyond next year.Buy the dip and hold on for a rebound."

Microsoft Inc. (MSFT), in partnership with SAP SE (SAP) and Adobe Systems Inc.(ADBE), announced the launch of the Open Data Initiative, which aims to put customers in full control of their own data by eliminating data silos and combining all the information that companies retain on individual customers into a single real-time and renewable package. The software giants will agree on common data standards that will enable the secure exchange of data across systems.That marked the latest round of collaboration between the software powerhouses and a culmination of the giant cloud deal signed last year between Microsoft and SAP. The two companies have increasingly been cozying up to each other, something that belies the fact that they remain fierce competitors in the EPR market. Microsoft is the world’s largest enterprise software vendor while SAP is the world leader in “back-office” ERP financial control systems.I will not discuss the merits of the deal here. SAP has given Open Data a nice AI tilt, which will form part of my thesis.Curiously, SAP shares have slipped more than 4% since that event. SAP shares have performed poorly since its Q2 2018 earnings call as investors focus on the weakness in the company’s legacy software license business.But maybe they need to dig a little deeper.At a basic level, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software integrates the processes needed to run a company including functions such as finance, HR, services, manufacturing, supply chain, procurement and others.The overall ERP market is projected to grow at an anemic 0.6% CAGR through 2021 to reach $84.7B (license, maintenance and subscription revenues). The slow growth is due to the ongoing transition from on-prem to the cloud, with cloud ERP expected to expand at a much more robust 10% clip through 2021 to hit $29.84B.Founded 46 years ago, SAP SE has never relinquished its lead as the global ERP systems top vendor,with Denver-based Panorama Consulting Solutions placing the company’s 2017 market share at 19% compared to 16% for second-placed Microsoft Dynamics. Oracle Inc. (ORCL) and Infor ERP close out Tier 1 with a 13% slice of the market apiece. Tier 2 vendors own 21% of the market while Tier 3 vendors have 18%. SAP ERP boasts the best ROI with 34% of respondents saying they have realized more than 50% of the anticipated business benefits after installation.It’s quite remarkable that SAP has recorded trailing 12-month revenue growth of 11.3%, suggesting that it’s growing much faster than the market despite its size. So what has reinvigorated this old-line tech giant?Tier I ERP Vendors ComparisonSource: Panorama Consulting SolutionsFor many years, Europe’s largest software company was a stodgy tech giant that specialized in selling monolithic on-prem ERP systems. Yet new and emerging market forces have been constantly creating pressure for businesses and organizations to move with greater agility and respond quickly to new threats and opportunities. To gain a truly competitive edge, business leaders need to gain valuable Business Intelligence from their customer data and use it to exploit emerging trends. In response to this need, older systems of records are being replaced by newer systems that are capable of leveraging predictive intelligence assets.Consequently, Intelligent ERP cloud is taking center stage as one of the leading tools among this new breed of intelligence systems. The true hallmarks of Intelligent ERP clouds are innovations that revolve around business processes and data as well as a unique user experience. Intelligent ERP systems effectively apply machine learning technologies on massive sets of market and customer data by learning from exceptions and adapting business rules in unprecedented ways. This, in turn, facilitates faster revenue growth, boosts profits, makes it easier to enter into new markets and even aids the disruption of entire industries.In a nutshell, Intelligent ERP creates 5 big business opportunities:In keeping with these secular and long-term trends, SAP launched SAP S/4HANA Cloud in 2015. S/4HANA is the company’s intelligent ERP cloud that comes with a new architecture, contextual analytics, machine learning and digital assistant capabilities.But SAP was not just content to consolidate its lead in its core ERP business. In June, the company unveiled its biggest product makeover in decades by making a long-anticipated move to bring all its ‘‘front office’’ software including sales, marketing and customer service into a single integrated offering it has christened SAP C/4HANA.SAP C/4HANA stands for customer 4th generation CRM while HANA refers to the company’s SAP HANA in-memory database. SAP C/4HANA pairs the new C/4HANA with the older SAP S/4HANA thus making them the core of the ""intelligent enterprise."" The company says that this combination will help organizations gain a ""360-degree view of their customers.’’ Companies that deploy SAP C/4HANA will be in a position to gain unique insights into the entire sales process including being able to identify new prospects to fulfillment and payment.Investors though will realize that SAP’s radical makeover is the company’s latest attempt to gain a proper foothold in the fast-growing $120-billion CRM market dominated by Salesforce.com. Salesforce is the undisputed king of CRM with a 19.7% share of the market in 2017, with Oracle and SAP coming in a distant second and third with 7.1% and 6.5% slice of the market, respectively. Quite worryingly, Salesforce has managed to widen its lead by a large margin over the past four years.CRM has become the fastest growing software market, overtaking the database management systems (DBMSs) industry in 2017 as per Gartner. The research and advisory outfit sees the CRM market expanding a robust 16% in 2018 helped by fast growth in segments such as field service management and lead management.Source: PR NewswireSAP CEO Bill McDermott believes that Salesforce’s core strength - a laser focus on the CRM market with minimal exposure to related verticals such as ERP and HCM - also happens to be its Achilles heel that SAP can turn to its advantage. SAP wants to position Salesforce as merely ""legacy CRM"" pretty much the same way Salesforce has derided SAP and Oracle for years for being old fogies incapable of stepping out of their legacy back-office ERP cocoons. SAP believes that its positioning as an ERP powerhouse will become the strategic differentiator in the CRM battle because businesses will be able to use the SAP C/4HANA ERP/CRM amalgam to gain high-value insights.SAP is not known to be very keen on mergers as, say, Oracle or Microsoft. The company’s move to double down on the CRM market has, however, seen it abandon its aversion to M&A by making several high-profile purchases including Callidus Software (sales pipeline and quota scenarios) for $2.4B in April.Early results suggest that the strategy is working for SAP: the company reported ‘‘steep triple-digit’’growth for C/4 HANA during its latest earnings call and said that its organic growth is more than 5x that of its primary competitor in the segment. Meanwhile, fast adoption of SAP S/4 HANA helped cloud revenues soar 40% Y/Y while overall cloud and software revenue climbed 10%, a high watermark for the company.More encouragingly, SAP raised its full year guidance with 2018 non-IFRS total revenue expected to clock in at a range of €24.8-€25.3 billion at constant currency while non-IFRS operating profit estimated to fall in the €7.35-€7.5 billion range.We have already witnessed stocks of legacy on-prem software companies that have transitioned successfully to the cloud being richly rewarded. Microsoft and Adobe are prime examples, with MSFT stock and ADBE stock having racked up gains of 50% and 76.5% over the past 12 months, respectively. SAP stock is up a mere 10.5% over the timeframe.So far, SAP seems to be executing well especially by integrating a key vertical into its cloud offerings. Meanwhile, forward PE of 21.6 is lower than the industry average.Source: Guru FocusThis looks like a stock that could reward investors with a long-term timeframe (2-5 years) the same way MSFT, ADBE and CRM have done."
4109816,80476,2017-09-27T11:22:13-04:00,"SAP's current valuation indicates an 8% long-term annual return potential.If one were to believe analyst estimates, the shares are even more richly valued.The digitalization of the global business landscape provides a strong tailwind for SAP.","The shares of SAP (SAP) are currently a bit richly valued. However, the current share price still provides an 8% annual return potential from this moment onwards.Majority of investors are more likely interested in how the valuation and possible long-term return for a specific stock look like. Let us start with valuation first. I will not be delving into the current business situation of SAP as there are already plenty of excellent articles covering this topic. Personally, I prefer to keep my estimates as conservative as possible in order to avoid negative surprises. In case of SAP, if we were to assume the historical 10 year annual revenue growth of 8% and free cash flow (FCF) to sales ratio of 19% could be sustained in the future, we would arrive at a normalized free cash flow level worth of $4412 million. With the current amount of outstanding shares, this translates into roughly $3.6 per share. Just as a reference, the 20 year historical values for the annual revenue growth and FCF to sales have been 9.2% and 20% respectively. For 2017, analysts are expecting free cash flow per share of around $3.19 per share, which is more pessimistic than mine.For simplicity's sake, when estimating the current valuation, let us only use the Gordon formula. This formula is simply valuation = dividend / (required rate of return - growth). In this exercise, I will replace the dividend in the previous formula with free cash flow. This is because we do not care whether profits are distributed to shareholders via share buybacks or via dividend payments. If SAP would not grow at all, free cash flow would equal to net profit as there are no costs related to growth. In addition, if management has no growth projects in sight exceeding the company's weighted cost of capital, all profits can be distributed to shareholders.Before we are able to apply the above Gordon formula to SAP, we need to find out required investment ratios for different levels of growth. The investment ratio can be derived using growth and return on equity with the following formula: investment ratio = growth / return on equity. The investment ratio plainly means how much from free cash flow needs to be deployed back to the business to fund growth. Let us assume SAP to reach in the long term 25% return on equity using free cash flow. This is a 10 year historical average while a 20 year one has been around 22%. With the previously mentioned return on equity, we can calculate various investment ratios with different growth rates.Table 1.Source: author generated by applying a 25% RoE to investment ratio formulaWe can now find out the free cash flow value in the Gordon formula by deducting the investment ratio from normalized free cash flow value mentioned above ($3.6 per share). By applying the Gordon formula with the previous values, the value of SAP can be deduced to be between $31.4 and $136.7. This range was achieved when the required rate of return is in the range of 8% to 12% and growth between 1% and 6%. The below table describes these values in more detail. For example, the value of $45.2 in the below table with growth rate of 3% and required rate of return of 10% is achieved the following way: $3.6*(1-0.12)/(0.1-.03).Table 2.Source: author generated by applying the normalized FCF per share and Table 1 to Gordon formulaFrom the above table, we could quickly eliminate the three rightmost columns. This is because the company is most likely able to achieve annual growth rates in excess of 3% in the long term even though in shorter periods this was possible. In the long term, 4-6% growth rate does not sound too unrealistic for SAP. Especially, considering that in real terms this would equal around 2% points less, i.e. 2-3%. One could consider that the required rate of return the markets are expecting in general is between 8% and 10%. So, using these ranges for growth rates and required rates of return and applying these values to the above table, we could conclude that the fair value for SAP is between $50 and $136. Since my personal required rate of return is 8% at minimum, I am completely fine with this price range as a fair value. As the current share price ($107) is at the high end of this range, the shares can be considered as slightly overvalued.However, what if we were to assume that we have been too optimistic in our assumptions regarding the normalized free cash flow level? If we would use the free cash flow per share value analysts are expecting ($3.19 per share), we would arrive at the following range for fair values with different growth rates and required rates of return.Table 3.Source: author generated by applying analyst expected FCF per share and Table 1 to Gordon formulaFrom the above table, an investor can deduce that the markets are valuing the shares of SAP purely based on extrapolation. What I mean by this is that the markets consider the current level of free cash flow as normalized and sustainable and growth to be at least 5% per year. I arrived at the previous growth ranges by applying the current share price and an 8% required rate of return to the above table. My personal view is, of course, that analysts are wrong and that current level of free cash flow is way below the normalized level.So, if you were to believe analysts estimates, the shares of SAP provide no upside potential of whatsoever. However, if you were slightly more optimistic in your estimates, you could conclude that the shares are only slightly overvalued but could still provide at least an 8% annual return going forward. In short, it is no surprise that I would recommend purchasing shares of SAP."
4115617,80476,2017-10-23T19:41:03-04:00,"SAP is experiencing growing pains in its cloud segment.Massive ramp-up costs have decreased overall margins.Cloud segment is currently not generating any free cash flow.When volumes start to increase, the cloud segment's operating cash flow should start to increase at a rapid pace.","SAP (SAP) is currently investing heavily in its cloud business and this has severely hurt its margins and cash flow. The cloud business does not currently seem to generate any free cash flow but this could change in a few years if the company manages to meet and exceed its volume targets. Considering how positive SAP's management is about its future, investors can expect a significant increase in free cash flow margins and hence dividends after a few years.In order to see how profitable SAP's cloud business has been from cash flow point of view, we need to compare the latest cash flow figures to figures before the cloud-era. Even though SAP has been investing in its cloud business for many years, it was not until 2014 when the management decided to put much more focus on this segment. For instance, the acquisition of Concur in late 2014 is a prime example. So, let's use fiscal years 2011 to 2013 as a reference point and compare them to 2017 estimated figures. For the 2017 estimated figures, I will be using the 2017 Q3 report together with 4-traders estimates.As can be seen from the below figure, SAPs operating cash flow was pretty static at around €3.8 billion during 2011 to 2013. The capital expenditures during the same period were between €0.4 to €0.5 billion. In 2017, capital expenditures are estimated to grow to €1.1 billion while operating cash flow is expected to reach €5 billion.Source: 2013 annual reportSource: 2017 Q3 reportIn 2013, cloud segment generated around €0.7 billion in revenue while the legacy segments generated €16.1 billion in revenue. For 2017, the respective estimates are €4 billion and €19.6 billion. So, revenue has grown during four years by €6.8 billion while free cash flow has increased only €0.6 billion. This explains clearly why margins have come down. If we assume that the legacy segments are still generating similar margins as in 2011-2013 (free cash flow to sales ~20%), these segments would be generating free cash flow worth of around €4 billion (€19.6 billion * 0.2) in 2017. Therefore it could be assumed that the cloud business is generating currently €-0.1 million (€3.9 billion - €4 billion) in free cash flow. This is an alarming number.The management has still many times indicated in its estimates that the cloud segment is currently experiencing heavy growth pains due to massive investments in hardware and personnel. These ramp-up costs are justifiable as long as the company manages to reach its volume targets. Capital expenditures have as a result increased by around €0.6 billion from 2013 levels. After a few years once the heavy investment period is over, it could be expected that this figure should come down a lot. In addition, as the cloud segment can be assumed to have rather fixed costs regardless of how many customers it is serving, each additional revenue will have a very high net margin. What this means in practice is that if the management's expectations of €8.5 billion in cloud revenue by 2021 is realistic, the additional €4.5 billion in cloud revenue could trickle down almost in full to the bottom line. This could be between €3.5-4.5 billion in increased operating cash flow. If we still assumed that the cloud capital expenditure drops to half from €0.6 billion, this would translate into €3.2-4.2 billion in additional free cash flow by 2021. This is almost a 100% increase when compared to current levels.As SAP's current P/FCF is almost 30, the current valuation certainly does not provide much safety margin in case something unexpected happens. If the previously mentioned doubling of free cash flow would occur, this would mean a P/FCF of 15. During the last 15 years, SAP's median P/FCF has been around 23 which would provide roughly a 50% upside potential by 2021 using today's share price. This would translate into roughly 12% annual yield if the dividend yield would stay at 1.5%. This would be a very good return for a patient investor.However, investors should closely follow the growth figures of the cloud segment. During Q3 this year, these figures were actually a bit soft but management assured that this is only temporary and that Q4 would be very strong. As long as the cloud growth figures stay in the expected range (~20-30% annually), SAP has all the potential to even double its free cash flow by 2021 but if the growth stalls, the share price will quickly go down.Even though SAP's cloud business is currently decreasing overall margins and most likely generating negative free cash flow, it still provides plenty of potentials. If the 2021 management growth ambitions are realistic, the increased volume should significantly boost margins, increase free cash flow and dividends. Within four years, SAP could be generating twice more free cash flow than it currently is due to its growing cloud business. This would make the shares a bargain at today's price. Therefore, I consider SAP a buy at the moment of writing this article."

Consulting.Below is an overview video of Gigya’s system:(Source: Gigya)Gigya’s primary offerings include the following,Gigya raised over $105 million from a large syndicate of strategic investors such as Adobe (ADBE) and Intel (INTC) as well as top-tier venture capital firms such as Benchmark and Mayfield Fund.Neither firm disclosed the acquisition price or terms and SAP didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance.Various reports in the Israeli media stated that the purchase price at $350 million, but that amount was not confirmed.The combination of Gigya and SAP promises to enhance SAP’s Hybris offering by providing Gigya’s consent-based identity data platform.As Carsten Thoma, SAP Hybris president and co-founder, stated in the deal announcement:With the acquisition, SAP Hybris said it plans to ‘become the first organization to offer a cloud-based data platform enabling companies to profile and convert new customers, gather accurate conclusions from disparate customer engagement sources and collect data for enhanced consumer choices that are line with regulations.’So, it sounds like SAP intends to walk as close to the fine line of personally identifiable information [PII] as it can.It remains to be seen whether SAP will be able to avoid running afoul of regulators across numerous jurisdictions with different consumer privacy rules.The deal, which is for Gigya’s 300 employees, customers and IP, is expected to close in the final quarter of 2017, so investors won’t know how it turns out for well into 2018 and possibly 2019.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

4097077,20521,2017-08-09T17:59:15-04:00,,"According to a Boston Consulting Report published earlier this year, B2B spending on the Internet of Things ((IoT)) technologies, applications, and solutions is estimated to grow to $267 billion by the year 2020. Nearly half of this spend is expected to be driven by the manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and utilities sector. This high value market is now a prime focus area for ERP giant SAP (NYSE: SAP) that already has a sizable presence in those sectors.SAP’s FinancialsSAP’s second quarter revenues grew 10% over the year to €5.78 billion (~$6.46 billion) compared with the market’s forecast of €5.71 billion (~$6.38 billion). Diluted EPS fell 18% to €0.56 (~$0.62) primarily due to higher stock-based compensation and restructuring-related expenses in the quarter. Adjusted for one-time gains, the company reported an EPS of $1.03, which was marginally better than the Street’s forecast of $1.02.During the quarter, the cloud subscription and support’s core revenue increased 27%, but fell short of the market’s forecast increase of 33%. New cloud bookings increased 33% at constant currency to €340 million (~$380 million).By segment, revenues from the Cloud and Software business increased 9% to €4.76 billion (~$5.32 billion). Services segment saw a 17% increase in revenues to €1.02 billion (~$1.14 billion).HANA continues to report strong growth with S/4HANA licenses sales growing 5% over the year. S/4HANA adoption grew to more than 6300 customers, up over 70% and the company added names like Duke Energy, Carrefour Belgium, and Mercadona as its customers.While revenues were impressive, the market was concerned about the company’s margins. Operating margin for the quarter came in at 27.2%, compared with the analyst forecast of 28.1%. The analysts are forecasting margins of more than 30% starting next year, but SAP’s continued investments in cloud computing capacity are holding down margins.For the current year, SAP increased its forecast of revenues to €23.3-€23.7 billion (~$26-$26.5 billion). The target has been increased by €100 million (~$111 million) compared with earlier forecasts. It kept its margin expectations constant at €6.8-€7.0 billion (~$7.6-$7.8 billion). The Street had forecast revenues of €23.9 billion (~$26.7 billion) and an operating profit of €7.1 billion (~$7.9 billion).SAP’s IoT ExpansionDuring the quarter, SAP continued its focus on its IoT solutions. It launched several new products and services within the IoT suite. The new products launched recently include Leonardo IoT Bridge, Global Track and Trace, Leonardo IoT Edge, Digital Manufacturing Insights, and Asset Manager.SAP’s core IoT platform SAP Leonardo can integrate machine learning, IoT, Big Data, analytics, and blockchain technologies on the SAP Cloud Platform. The new products are targeted at improving Leondardo’s capabilities. Leonardo IoT Bridge is a configurable role-based digital command center that will help improve the visibility and ability of managers to act on a real-time basis. Global Track and Trace is a cloud-based offering that will help improve end-to-end tracking, monitoring, and reporting of objects across supply chains and Leonardo IoT Edge is a software designed to improve deterministic performance of business processes. In terms of industry specific tools, it launched Digital Manufacturing Insights, which is a cloud-based manufacturing performance management solution that will help improve visibility in manufacturing.Besides new products, SAP also launched three new Leonardo Innovation Services. The services, which include Express, Open Innovation, and Enterprise Editions of Leonardo Innovation Services, will help organizations access new technologies in a shorter time, thus helping them achieve digital transformation. The growth in these products and services is in line with the $2.2 billion expansion it announced earlier in the development of its IoT portfolio.SAP’s stock is trading at 52-week-high levels of $106.4 with a market capitalization of $127.8 billion. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $80.93 in November last year."
4091908,98236,2017-07-28T12:46:07-04:00,"SAP reported another strong quarter last week.Growth is accelerating and in particular cloud bookings showed unanticipated strength.Margins for the company have been subdued so far this year, but are anticipated to show noticeable gains both in 2H and in 2018.SAP's shares are modestly valued for the package of growth, margins and rising cash flow that investors receive.The company has resumed share buybacks and is likely to increase its dividend steadily.","After a week of more or less vacation, it is time to gear back up. I have read that some investors are disappointed with the IT earnings season thus far. In parsing, some of the results in the IT space that I follow, it would have been difficult to be too disappointed with the results or guidance posted by ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) or PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). And while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares showed little immediate reaction to that company’s report of strong quarterly operational performance, it was in the wake of a rather substantial run into the numbers (7% in two weeks). So, from my perspective, earnings season thus far has seen the kind of strength I had been hoping to see in terms of growth above the trend line.One of the more challenging aspects of handicapping earnings releases relates to “what’s in the stock.” Much of the time, share valuation relates to expectations that are not related to the published consensus. So, it isn’t too surprising to find investors disappointed with quarters that seem to indicate strong operational performance, exceeding prior expectations. And from time to time, investors forget exactly what the reported quarter is comparing against. Even Jim Cramer can be guilty of that kind of misapprehension although anyone trying to comment on quite so many names as he does is likely to get some details wrong. Mr. Cramer felt that SAP’s (NYSE:SAP) quarter was “good” but not as good as Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) or that of Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM). In fact, the quarter just reported by SAP when carefully considered showed a company accelerating its growth motor noticeably. SAP competes in many different verticals. I am not too sure how I would compare the quarter the company reported to the quarters reported by Oracle or Salesforce. As I will take some pains to show, SAP’s revenue engine was in high gear last quarter, and its outlook, looked at carefully, is for more of the same culminating in a substantial upside to currently forecast 2018 earnings estimates. On that basis, I think the shares of SAP remain undervalued and have a significant potential to generate positive alpha over the coming year.To some extent, SAP's shares in the wake of the earnings release have possibly reflected disappointment that results weren’t even more of a beat or that guidance wasn’t more of a raise. “Buy the rumor, sell the news” as the saying goes. While SAP's shares have appreciated by 21% year to date, they have only appreciated 4% the past 90 days and declined marginally in the wake of earnings. I really do not try to handicap quarterly earnings in the articles that I write. I think it isn’t feasible to do so without an informational advantage - and it basically is not feasible to have informational advantages for most companies all of the time. My view before the earnings release was that SAP's shares represented an excellent choice for investors looking for a dividend paying name with respectable, although not hyper-growth opportunities. The results of this past quarter reaffirmed that viewpoint.One thing of note is that SAP gets a disproportionate amount of its revenues from Germany particularly and from its EMEA region as a whole. Most recently, the USD/EUR exchange rate has seen the dollar fall significantly - about 3.5% in the last month. This will be a modest headwind for SAP going forward as it reports its results in euros.On the other hand, SAP’s share price is primarily set by trading in Frankfurt. The company is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, and most European tech investors have positions in the name. Just the strengthening of the euro alone has accelerated the share price appreciation in USD. If the euro appreciates, then so too will the price of SAP shares, as quoted in the US although the reported euro revenues and earnings will see some headwinds. In Q2, FX was basically a “nothing burger” for this company. At this writing, Q3, as reported in euros, will see some currency headwinds.The most salient point to make with regard to SAP's reported quarterly performance is that the company's sales engine shifted into another gear. It is, to be sure, difficult to look at market share figures in each of the areas in which SAP has solution offerings. But it would appear, that viewed holistically, that SAP is showing market share gains looked at organically in the cloud, and the company’s current main-line digital product offering, S/4HANA, achieved particularly robust performance last quarter. S/4HANA is a product cycle that is just now starting and should contribute noticeably to SAP's overall growth for at least the next 12-18 months.SAP reported the results of its fiscal Q2 last week. The results were a beat on revenues and essentially in line with regard to EPS. The IFRS (the equivalent of US GAAP) reported earnings were impacted significantly by substantial increases in adjustments for restructuring and stock-based comp. Both of those metrics were more or less running at rates that had been forecasted by the company earlier in the year but which are showing substantial growth compared to the results of the prior year and the prior quarter.It is interesting to contrast the results of SAP with those of IBM (NYSE:IBM) about which I most recently wrote. IBM saw its revenues decline by 3%. Overall, SAP reported organic constant currency growth of 9%. To obtain those results, the company made choices that have led IFRS operating expense to grow substantially. Research and development expense grew by 19% year over year and was 14.6% of revenues. Sales and marketing expense rose by 16% year on year and was 29% of revenues.The comparison with IBM is obviously not precise, as this company sells far more software and far less services proportionately when compared to IBM. But it is hardly surprising that SAP is seeing substantial growth and IBM is showing successive revenue declines given that this company is willing to cut into margins in order to grow market share. Given the opportunities in the cloud and in the company’s vertical applications, this is a far more appropriate strategy to pursue for most stakeholders than the course on which IBM has been sailing.The strong results the company achieved in Q2, coupled with the rapid acceptance in the market of S/4HANA, lead to a modest guidance increase. Indeed, simply looking at one of the components of the company’s earnings release that shows order entry might well lead an observer to expectations for a more substantial growth rate than the company is forecasting. Cloud bookings were up by more than 50% sequentially and by 33% year on year. As a result of the strong order entry (bookings), the company had a 29% increase in cloud subscription and support revenues. Much of the strength in orders came from larger users adopting SAP’s newer technologies although in stark contrast to many other companies in transition, the company was able to still grow its tradition on-premise software revenues. Now, that is an attainment.Just turning to some specifics of the forecast, the company had forecast that its cloud revenues would reach E3.8-$4.0 billion. It also forecast that its total revenues would reach E23.4 billion. Non-IFRS profits had been forecast to reach E6.8-E7.0 billion. The company is now forecasting that total revenues will increase to E23.5 million at the midpoint of the forecast. The company’s forecast operating profit for the full year has been left unchanged. The company has been beating its revenue forecasts the last several quarters while achieving non-IFRS results consistent with prior forecasts. The company's forecast reflects some modest headwinds from the appreciation of the euro. In dollars, of course, the opposite is the case.On a sequential basis, cloud and software revenue rose by 10%, about in line with typical historical trends. Total revenues rose by 11.5% sequentially. In the prior year, total revenues rose by 10.6% sequentially while software revenues showed a 13% sequential increase. SAP has very marked seasonality in terms of revenue, partially because of the normal calendar for software acquisition in Europe. But last year, the company materially exceeded what might be considered to be normal seasonality - this time around seasonality was more typical, although still of adequate magnitude to produce decent comparisons. Looked at carefully, however, it was in the bookings metric, order entry as SAP calls it, that saw the real acceleration of SAP’s business.I suppose that sounds like the headline for a commercial for a supplement of some kind. I think one prerequisite for a company such as this is to both spend the money on internal investment and to also act, audaciously at times, to make acquisitions. SAP has been constrained because of the way it manages its balance sheet from making acquisitions since its purchase of Concur almost three years ago. At this point, with cash flow margins rising and net debt falling (it is now less than E2 billion - down from E4.5 billion a year ago), the company has the resources both to fund a renewed share repurchase and to hunt down acquisitions which will further enhance growth.I mentioned some comparisons with IBM. One that is strikingly apparent is the growth in this company’s cloud analytics bookings which were reported to rise by triple digits last quarter. I am not quite sure how SAP defines the category, but it is the kind of result that is part of the fabric of the SAP growth story. I think the comparison with IBM is so stark as to not need any more specific delineation.It would be tedious to go through all of SAP’s series of vertical solutions. What is important for investors to contemplate is the strength the company has achieved with SuccessFactors in HCM, with Ariba in B2B commerce, and with Concur in expense management. It is also important for investors to note in all of these areas and others as well, SAP is managing its acquisitions so that it can compete on a level field with the newer vendors in all of these spaces. It is, I think, a significant attainment and one of the key elements of the investment case to be made for these shares.Readers are probably jaded in terms of hearing about AI - I know as an observer I am. SAP’s version is called Leonardo, an appropriate name for a set of solutions that can be broadly used in areas of high priority for IT buyers. Is Leonardo better than Watson or Einstein or all of the other AI platforms out there? I am not able to make that kind of a call, and I really do not know how one defines “better” when evaluating these platforms. Rapid time to benefit, scalability, pre-defined templates. I am not sure I know or if it can be known how Leonardo stacks up on some kind of objective scale. I think all an investor needs to know is that without as much fanfare as Watson achieves, Leonardo is a significant growth driver for SAP.I also think it is worth mentioning the comment of the CEO that 80% of the company’s customer base remains as pipeline for S4/HANA. That ought to provide a relatively elevated level of visibility to support the company’s growth objectives for a while.I think that a passage from the CFO’s script is worth quoting. Mr. Mucic was very specifically addressing the issue of how and why SAP has been able to produce almost double-digit growth in the midst of moving its revenue structure from perpetual to subscription based and in making the transition to a set of integrated cloud based solutions. Here is the relevant passage that I think best depicts the trade-off SAP has been willing to make between margins and growth:SAP is opening another data center in the Mideast that has had a noticeable effect on margins this year - not too much different than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in that regard. In addition, the company’s mix has shown a noticeable shift to the public cloud which is less profitable for SAP than some of its other offerings at this point.It is worth noting that the seeming rapid increase in IFRS expenses was significantly correlated with the run-up in the company’s share price. One less appreciated issue with the formula used to calculate stock-based comp is that it is quite sensitive to changes in share price, and for this company, the combination of front loading hiring along with a significant increase in SBC as well as a one-time increase in restructuring costs leads to a noticeable decline in IFRS operating profit. The restructuring did, however, show up rather noticeably in an increase in services gross margins. Services GM rose from 16.5% to 20% year on year and offset some of the decrease in cloud GM.SAP doesn’t explicitly forecast IFRS profitability. But based on the sources of the decline in that metric in Q2, 2H should see a sharp reversal. The company maintains that it raised guidance. When it comes to operating profits, that hasn’t really been the case - at least in euros. And the company has not beaten earnings guidance with any consistency. But I will go out on a limb and suggest that the current set-up should allow the company to beat the current guidance/consensus forecast in the last two quarters of this year and even more so in 2018 which currently has unrealistically muted expectations.What’s the secret to sustaining double-digit growth in the midst of transitions that have stumped most other larger, legacy software vendors? A willingness to sacrifice short-term margins for growth, aggressive new product introductions and willingness to seemingly over-spend on transformative acquisitions.I am to be sure a shareholder in SAP. I doubt I would be so if I thought the current consensus forecasts represented the likely operational performance for this company. During the conference call, management was asked if it would be able to sustain 30% cloud revenue growth. Given just how strong cloud bookings growth was during the quarter, that may be thought to be a surprising question. But it turns out that in terms of total contract value, the growth in Q2 actually exceeded the 33% growth in reported bookings. Can SAP continue to show that kind of growth? Just based on its track record, I wouldn’t bet against it. Not terribly surprisingly, the company CFO said the same thing.But as part of the answer, the CFO spoke quite specifically about margin expectations going forward. Specifically, he said:I think it is fair to say that current consensus projections for SAP as reported to First Call are quite at variance with this forecast. At the moment, the analyst consensus shows just 6% revenue growth in the second half of this year and 7% growth next year. The EPS forecast is even skimpier with no growth at all forecast by the consensus in Q4. The consensus does show modest margin growth next year with EPS expected to rise by 11% compared to 7% revenue growth, but that is clearly a level far less than what has been suggested by company management.SAP's shares are not quite controversial although there are a fair number of skeptics in the audience. Thirteen out of 33 analysts who have reported their ratings to First Call rate the shares either a hold or a sell. But continued performance at the levels of Q2 is likely to change both estimates and ratings noticeably over the coming months. It is a good setup for entering SAP's shares.Just for the record, as mentioned earlier, SAP reports in euros and its projections are in euros. The current exchange rate is E=$1.17. The company is now forecasting that revenues for this year will be $27.5 billion. The consensus is higher. I would say that it is very likely that both numbers will be exceeded by a noticeable amount, but for the purpose of this article, I will use a forecast of revenues of $29 billion for the next 12 months. The company has a current market capitalization of about $118 billion and net debt of about $2 billion. With an enterprise value of $116 billion, the EV/S is 4X. I think this is a bargain ratio for a company that is quite profitable and which is enjoying growth of close to double digits which will probably accelerate.The company forecasts operating profits and not EPS. As mentioned, the company hasn’t changed its operating profit forecast for the current year. The company accrued a lower tax rate last quarter although it doesn't forecast that metric. But again, as I tried to point out above, it seems more than likely that the business will substantially outperform the current consensus forecast. I think it is reasonable to use a forward 12-month EPS forecast of $5.25. That is a P/E of 20X, again a significant value compared to most other tech valuations.The company doesn’t forecast CFFO or free cash flow. IFRS differs from US practice in terms of having a standard for reporting cash flow that does not include one of the normal adjustments made by US companies. In particular, the company does not include the positive impact of share-based comp in its cash flow statement. In the first half, cash flow jumped by 20% year on year, and more if including stock-based comp. Most of the company’s CFFO increase came from the substantial increase in deferred revenue. That, and balance sheet items, were sufficient to overcome the decline in IFRS profitability. Last year, the company generated $4.9 billion in operating cash flow and free cash flow was $4.1 billion. Given the very strong bookings numbers, and their concomitant impact on deferred revenue, I think a reasonable estimate for forward 12-month free cash flow should be about $5 billion. That would represent a free cash flow yield of 4.2%. Adding SBC to the free cash flow number, consistent with American practice, would raise the free cash flow yield to 5.2%. Again, that is seems to me to represent a very reasonable value for that metric given the company’s growth.The company does pay a modest dividend and its current yield on a forward basis is 1.3%. I doubt that the yield is any reason to buy the shares although I imagine the company will significantly increase its dividend now that it has paid down most of the debt it acquired when it bought Concur.The current consensus price target for SAP's shares is just 7.6% above its current share price. I think that the valuation analysis suggest that SAP's shares should sell at a significantly more generous valuation and that the metrics for operational performance will most likely exceed current published estimates. I have owned SAP shares for some time and expect I will continue to do so for some time to come. To me, the shares remain a good place from which to generate positive alpha."

In the recent earnings announcement, SAP missed its earnings expectations. But the market is not worried, and the stock has soared to a record high. Nothing appears to be stopping this stock.SAP's FinancialsSAP's first-quarter revenues grew 12% over the year to €5.285 billion (~$5.63 billion), compared with the market's forecast of €5.08 billion (~$5.5 billion).Revenues from Cloud and Software grew 12% to €4.33 billion (~ $4.61 billion), with cloud subscriptions & support revenues growing 34% to €905 million (~$963 million) and software licenses & support revenues growing 8% over the year to €3.42 million (~$3.65 billion). EPS of €0.69 (~$0.74) was short of the Street's forecast of €0.72 (~$0.77) for the quarter.For the current year, SAP reaffirmed its forecast of revenues of €23.2-23.6 billion (~$25-25.4 billion), marginally shy of analyst estimates of €23.65 billion (~$25.5 billion).SAP's Enterprise OfferingsDuring the quarter, the company continued to expand its enterprise offerings. Growth was driven by the S/4Hana in-memory database, which saw an addition of 400 customers. SAP now has more than 5,800 customers for its Hana platform, which includes global companies like Energy SE and Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTRX). Within the private cloud, the HANA Enterprise Cloud also is a fast-growth business for SAP. The company has improved its offering with the release of SAP Digital Boardroom, a reinvigorated analytics portfolio that saw strong, double-digit growth across cloud and software in the quarter.Within human capital management, SuccessFactors delivered another strong quarter. SuccessFactors' Employee Central now has more than 1,700 customers worldwide. Gartner awarded SAP the highest rankings in cloud HCM for core HR for global organizations with more than 5,000 workers.The company also is driving expansion within the SME segment. During the quarter, it added more than 1,000 net new SME customers. It expects to maintain momentum through its API Hub, an open SAP cloud platform that actively promotes and incubates innovations.To keep pace with the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning, SAP is accelerating efforts within the segment. It is focused on machine learning and has already released its first wave of machine learning-enabled applications. The machine learning technology offers capabilities like invoice and payment matching, predictive recruiting, intelligent sales forecasting, sales discount approvals, and data-driven renewal management within its products.SAP stock is trading at record high level of $103.88 with a market capitalization of $120.9 billion. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $71.39 in June last year.The company has always been looking to grow through acquisitions. Earlier, I had recommended that it evaluate Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) as a target. One of its key focus areas of late has been the development of IoT offerings. Splunk's machine-to-machine analytics capability will help SAP offer a product that will allow its customers to analyze data collected through multiple sources. Splunk ended last year with revenues growing 42% to $950 million, and it generated a non-GAAP operating margin of 6.2%. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $1.185 billion with a non-GAAP operating margin of 8%. Splunk is also focused on improving its business model. It recently changed its sales team's commission plans to get them to sell the SaaS product instead of the perpetual license product.Players like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) made a similar transition earlier and are now reaping the benefits of the transition. The move will hurt Splunk in the short term, but the SaaS business model will be beneficial for it in the longer run, as subscription revenues are more predictable and the cost of retaining customers continues to drop as the customer manages more of their needs over the cloud-based SaaS product. Its customers will benefit by having access to the latest version of Splunk software at all times. Additionally, by allowing Splunk to run the software for them in the cloud, customers will be able to save the IT infrastructure expense of having to host the software.

It was formed by five former IBM (NYSE:IBM) software engineers after their project for IBM was cancelled. From little acorns do mighty oaks grow. Needless to say, the company's first clients were German, and for years, the company was led by its founders. The founders and the foundations they have created continue to own a significant percentage of the shares, and Hasso Plattner continues to serve as chairman of the advisory board. SAP R/3, which was introduced in the early 1990s, changed the ERP paradigm dramatically, and for many years, SAP was a high growth name. But despite the fact that it established a headquarters for the US at some scale, it was always something of an insular company that some observers called more reactive than proactive. That has changed dramatically under the company's current leader Bill McDermott. Over time, the culture of the company has changed significantly, and SAP has been willing to spend freely to establish a cloud business. Just as a small example, SAP was a pioneer in establish development centers in India where it continues to be a major presence. It also has one of its more important development centers in Israel, along with 300 other tech firms. The company's advanced technology leader is an American, born in India, who was CEO of Concur. SAP is simply no longer an insular IT vendor with everything centralized in Walldorf.SAP and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have been rivals since Oracle developed its own financial apps 25 years ago. Over time, the two leaders in ERP have been Oracle and SAP. While these days Oracle mainly bashes its newer cloud rivals, it continues to have invective to spare when discussing SAP. But the fact is that SAP has become a much more nimble and progressive competitor as can be seen by the fact that it has a relatively larger cloud business than Oracle, depending on who is doing the counting.Neither of the rivals were pioneers when it came to the cloud. But writing at the start of 2017, it seems that SAP has managed its transition far more successfully than Oracle. Initially, it was more willing than Oracle to open its coffers to buy the best cloud software companies that were available and owning nameplates such as Concur, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Hybris, Fieldglass and SeeWhy has given it a large base of cloud users.Of course, spending at the level that was required to execute the strategy has left it with a fair amount of net debt that has prevented it from increasing its dividend significantly.A Straightforward Investment ThesisOver the past year, SAP's share price performance has managed to modestly outperform the IGV index. The company hit its high for the year back in September, and the shares have drifted off for the past five months. I first wrote about SAP on this site about a year ago, so the performance of the recommendation is essentially the same as the overall performance of the shares. I continue to believe that SAP represents one of the better large-cap software names, and I believe that it will continue to outperform Oracle and may catch up to the performance of IBM in the large-cap tech universe.My investment thesis is based on just a few basic points. I think that SAP has a broader suite of cloud technology solutions, some of which are clearly best of breed that it can offer users. At this point, despite the fact that many of these solutions are the result of acquisitions, they are affording the company excellent runway and opening up many accounts. Concur, for example, is the standard expense management technology used by most organizations. Ariba has the largest software purchasing network. I think that S4 HANA is now achieving significant transaction and winning head-on-head competitions both with installed SAP ERP customers, but with some new nameplates as well. I think that the company is starting to enjoy some traction from its IoT initiatives although revenue growth from that initiative is more likely to be a 2018 story. SAP's foray into the world of deep learning, and AI is at about the same point as that of many rivals. Promising, pregnant but not yet producing revenues on a scale to move the needle.Despite the company's size, its shares can be volatile and exciting enough to satisfy any owner of tech stocks. In 2.5 months last year, the shares appreciated by 25% as investors took a more sanguine view of the company's prospects after the Brexit-induced panic. A year earlier, the shares enjoyed a similar appreciation spurt in just a few weeks after a good earnings report. I think that the set-up is such that the company can see another appreciation spurt when it reports its Q4 numbers and provides formal guidance for 2017.SAP And Its FX ExposureAlmost all software companies are multi-national and have operations globally. SAP is one of the more multi-national of software companies and one of the few software businesses of scale that are headquartered in Europe (Walldorf, Germany). On the other hand, at this point, three of its seven senior executives are Americans including the CEO, the head of sales, and the president of its advanced business units, including Concur, Ariba and Fieldglass.SAP reports its results in euros and has extensive coverage from European analysts who have a paucity of other high visibility software names on which to focus (The next largest European software company is Dassault Systemes (OTCPK:DASTY) whose revenues are about 12% as large as SAP). SAP's numbers in euros will be relatively stronger in 2017 than otherwise, particularly in terms of revenue growth. At the end of the day, I think analysts waste more time on the issue of FX than is really warranted. I freely confess that I have no idea if the year will end with the dollar at parity or stronger still or if the euro will find traction. I have no idea how the tax debates regarding changing to a territorial system will affect exchange rates.These days, SAP gets 33% of its revenues from the US, 43% of its revenues from the EMEA region, 15% of its revenues from the APJ region, and almost 8% of its revenues from the Americas other than the US.Perhaps surprisingly, cloud revenues are substantially greater proportionately and absolutely in the US than anywhere else by a noticeable margin. While SAP is approximately two-thirds the size of Oracle's measure by revenue, its cloud revenues are almost 75% those of Oracle. Some of that has to do with SAP's historic willingness to spend big in acquiring cloud-based vendors of some size. Some of it has to do with the success of the HANA S4 platform. And some of it, perhaps surprisingly, is that the people who run the sales effort at SAP are simply more effective and have built a more professional organization. The SAP Executive Board includes three American superstars these days who have deep experience in managing and developing a professional sales organization and in spotting technology trends. They know how to get large deals done, and they have a track record in investing in high-growth companies.A Bit Of Product CommentaryTech companies rise and fall on their technology as well as their ability to execute. That may seem self-evident or even simplistic, but I think it is important to take a look at what SAP is selling and how it stacks up in order to evaluate the company's growth prospects.S/4 HANA has been labeled the biggest redesign of the company's core ERP functionality since it brought out S/3 in the early '90s and turned the ERP world on its head. It is a more complete rewrite than anything being offered by competitors and is the first massive update in 23 years. Needless to say, initially many SAP users were skeptical. One place to look for reviews is a service called G2 Crowd. The average user rating for S/4 HANA was 5 stars, which is the highest rating available. A couple of other reviews were those of PeopleSoft/Oracle, 3.5 stars; NetSuite (NYSE:N)/Oracle, 4 stars; and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Dynamics, 3.5 stars. The older version of SAP has a 4-star rating.Several years ago, the concept of ""in-memory"" applications became popular in the software world because of the massive price/performance advantages that it offered. Oracle runs an in-memory data base that uses an appliance called Exadata that it sells. With S/4, the database is available either as an appliance or as a cloud service. At this point, SAP is offering its SuccessFactors HCM solution on HANA for the first time.Gartner has described S/4 as a transformational product for the company. It essentially took what SAP had developed in stages over decades and re-architected it so it is optimized for the cloud. The product was initially released late in 2015, and last year, went through the typical teething pains of a major new release. One reason that I believe that SAP is likely to achieve significantly stronger growth this year than in the recent past is the availability of S/4 in a stable version that offers a complete set of functionality and which is described as Postmodern by Gartner.Given the relatively dramatic nature of S/4 in terms of its technology and the favorable product reviews from early users, it would be reasonable to believe that 2017 would be a break-out year in terms of the adoption of the product. How to quantify break-out is not easy to forecast. But as opposed to this current year in which the company has forecast that constant-currency revenue growth will be 7.5% at a midpoint, I think that constant-currency growth next year is likely to accelerate by 200-300 bps and that EPS will increase a bit more than that.The Leonardo IoT portfolioIt's a catchy name - at least as good as IBM's Watson. The company recently announced what it calls a jump-start enablement program as part of its IoT portfolio. The company is investing about E2 billion over the next five years in building out its IoT capabilities. That amount would represent more than 15% of SAP's research and development spend, a significant level of commitment given all of the other research and development tasks that the company is funding. While SAP does not report IoT revenue, it seems almost certain that its research and development spending + some allocated amount for sales and marketing cost would be substantially greater than the current level of IoT revenues.Part of S/4's capabilities include a discrete IoT component. The IoT has become a buzzword over the past few years, but real companies are creating real applications. There are so many companies in the space that a scorecard would be pages long and no one would really be able to tell who was leading, who was following and who had yet to come up for bat. I do not propose to try to solve that issue in this article.So far, Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) has been SAP's poster child in terms of building a mainstream IoT application. Siemens uses large data sets which it can analyze using SAP big data applications. In turn, the analysis provides Siemens with the knowledge to offer predictive maintenance, asset and energy data management to its direct end-user customers. In addition, Siemens sells a platform that allows its OEMs to provide data analytics that optimize the operation of a fleet of machinery.All of the revenue from the IoT is included in the cloud revenues that are reported by SAP. At the moment, I suspect that IoT revenues are minimal - if they were noticeable, I am sure the company would be happy to share its success with investors. I really think that the adoption of the IoT is more of a journey than something that is going to happen in the course of a year. Just as I see the adoption of S/R HANA having a significant impact on growth rates in 2017, I see the sale of SAP's IoT enabling-technology based on S/4 HANA being a significant growth driver in 2018 and beyond.How large is the opportunity? This could be one of those trick questions on a quiz show. The answer varies widely depending on what is being defined as part of the IoT. IDC published an analysis saying that the market would reach $1.7 trillion by 2020. But its definition was such that it reported that IoT revenues were already $655 billion in 2015. The definition doesn't mean very much when it comes to SAP. Yes, there are lots of cars that have GPS antennas - and they count as connected devices and in the coming years there will be many refrigerators and lamp posts that are connected. SAP's part of the pie is creating a platform from which its customers can develop their own applications to serve customers. There isn't any real data to be had as to how large that potential market might be.SAP's Midterm Ambition And A Few Other NumbersMany institutional investors these days base their expectations for SAP and their calculation of the worth of the shares based on what the company calls its midterm ambition. I seriously doubt if most individual investors have the patience to consider possible results in 2020 as part of their valuation calculus. But regardless, the vast preponderance of SAP's shares are either held by the founders and their foundations, or by European institutional holders. If they are enthused, the shares will rise. To the extent that appears that the company is achieving or exceeding its goals, even though they are for 2020, the current investor group is likely to get enthused.Ambition, at least for SAP, is not the same as guidance, which is part of the company's operating plan. I would probably describe the metric as an aspirational goal. I want to carefully note that SAP guides and reports in euros and does so at constant currency. Also, all of its projections are based on a non-IFRS presentation. Stock-based comp is a noticeable but not overwhelming component of SAP's profitability.Through nine months, stock-based comp represented 13% of operating profits. One might think that currency moves are likely to have a large impact on SAP's results, but that does not seem to be as likely as might be imagined. The euro has depreciated against the dollar by about 2.5% since the last time SAP provided guidance. But EUR has appreciated against both the GBP and JPY. So, the constant currency set of expectations will not change greatly.Overall, as mentioned earlier, the analyst consensus for 2016 revenues is $23.2 billion and the consensus for 2017 is for $24.9 billion. Given the strength of the S/4 HANA product cycle as outlined above, I think that both of those numbers are likely to be exceeded by some noticeable amount. SAP has many ingredients in the sauce it is using to grow while its principal rival has yet to bottle its own sauce. But to whatever one ascribes the company's success, both relative and absolute, it is certainly real and seems likely to continue into the future.The company continues to expend significant sums to integrate all of the purchased cloud software into the S4 HANA platform. As mentioned earlier, the first effort in that regard is the migration of SuccessFactors to the S/4 platform. The cost of efforts such as that has been substantial and has weighed on the ability of the company to improve its cost ratios. SAP's ambitions do not show much improvement next year; I think that the current ""ambition"" in terms of operating margins of 29% will likely be exceeded in 2017.But integrating the various parts of its ecosystem is likely to produce significant share gains for SAP. Yesterday, it was announced that Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) had landed a nine-figure transaction with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). The likely loser in the bake-off was SAP. Part of the reason may have been pricing. I doubt that SAP would be willing to cheapen the SuccessFactors franchise by selling to WMT or to anyone else, at $15/year/seat. But part of it may have been that as of this writing, SuccessFactors remains as a standalone solution that doesn't benefit from all of the features designed into S4/HANA. Integration will be another piece of the growth rate solution, I believe.SAP says its ambition for revenue growth is a CAGR of around 6% through 2020. The construction of those ambitions is exceptionally conservative. While the company hasn't broken down all of the numbers in detail, it is forecasting that cloud subscriptions will double through the end of the forecast period while everything else will decline by about 10%. That seems unlikely given that the current trend of revenues outside of cloud subscriptions has been to grow and not shrink. It should be noted in that regard that S4/HANA while optimized for the cloud is also available in on-prem versions and many current SAP users are choosing to migrate just part of their workload to the cloud while using S4 to update their on-prem legacy solutions. Maintenance revenues through nine months have continued to rise by a few percent year on year, and that, coupled with the small increase in software license revenue, presents a reasonably healthy picture for the company's on-premise business. Overall, software license and support revenues have grown 5% in constant currency through the first nine months of the year. At this point, maintenance revenues are about 2.5X the level of new software license revenue.SAP's cash flow from operations metric is growing faster than profitability. The company still generates a far lower cash flow margin than Oracle (currently about 19% compared 30% for Oracle). It does not have a legacy database franchise which throws off billions of dollars in very high-margin revenue. That is both a good thing and a bad thing. It is a good thing in that it doesn't have a single vulnerable source of cash flow and earnings. It is bad…well because it would be something nice to have.Almost 40% of the company's cash flow is currently coming from the increase in deferred revenue and none of its reported cash flow comes from stock-based comp. Perhaps uniquely, SAP reports its cash flow numbers on an IFRS basis. Adding stock-based comp to operating cash flow would increase reported CFFO by 13%. The company does not spend heavily on capex, which was 18% of CFFO through nine months.This company does not have ambitions that it publishes with regards to CFFO or net cash generation. It has an ambition of increasing its operating profits by 7%/year. While I think that is likely to prove to be conservative, if 7% growth is the right number, I think CFFO ought to rise by 9-10% over the period and that free cash flow will show a slightly higher trajectory in terms of growth. The company accrues taxes at a very high rate compared to American companies. Last quarter, the tax rate accrual was more than 28%. It seems possible that the company will see lower tax rates in the years to come.ValuationAs mentioned earlier, I am going to use the current dollar exchange rate in calculating valuation metrics. I really have no special insight in evaluating the future course of the euro/dollar rate into the future. If I did, I would surely trade FX in my pajamas as Lord Keynes was said to do. The increase of the dollar against the euro appears to have abated most recently. If readers think it will resume, then the value of the ADRs will be directly affected.The company currently has 1.2 billion shares outstanding. The current share price is $89 and that yields a market capitalization of $108 billion. The company has $5 billion of gross cash and $8.5 billion of debt. So that yields an enterprise value of almost $112 billion. The consensus revenue forecast is $23.3 billion for 2016 and $25 billion for 2017. That is an EV/S of 4.5X. The forward P/E is a bit less than 20X. The company doesn't forecast cash flow. Making the adjustment to include stock-based comp, I think that free cash flow for the year is likely to approach $5 billion, depending of course on balance sheet items. So the company's free cash flow yield is a bit less than 4.5%.These numbers basically portray a GARP valuation. On the other hand, if the company can continue to beat consensus numbers and to raise its guidance for major valuation metrics as well as it ambitions, there is plenty of opportunity to see significant appreciation. I think that is the likely scenario. I think SAP's shares offer a significant level of positive alpha from current prices."
4017333,20521,2016-10-31T16:58:14-04:00,"SAP is increasing its focus on the IoT segment.Last month, it announced plans to invest $2.25 billion in the development of its IoT offerings.Also as part of this focus, SAP recently announced key acquisitions.","SAP (NYSE:SAP) is one ERP player that has successfully adapted itself to the changing market landscape. After proving its mettle within the Cloud/Big Data market with HANA, the company is now gearing up to target the Internet of Things (IoT) segment.SAP's FinancialsSAP's third quarter revenues grew 8% over the year to €5.4 billion (~$5.9 billion) compared with the market's forecast of €5.3 billion (~$5.8 billion). Operating profits came in at €1.64 billion (~$1.79 billion), falling short of the market consensus of €1.65 billion (~$1.8 billion). Adjusted EPS of $1.02 also was short of the Street's forecast of $1.05 for the quarter.By segment, revenues from Services were up 6.6% to €920 million (~$1 billion). Cloud and Software business, which includes Cloud Subscriptions and Support and Software licenses and support, grew 8% over the year to €4.5 billion (~$4.9 billion). Within the segment, Cloud Subscriptions and Support revenues grew 28% to €769 million (~$857.9 million), while Software licenses and support reported revenues grew 4.6% to €3.7 billion (~$4.1 billion). By region, revenues from the Cloud and software segment grew 8% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 9% in the Americas, and 8% in Asia Pacific.For the current year, SAP increased the outlook for earnings to €6.5 billion-€6.7 billion (~$7.1-$7.3 billion).SAP's IoT GrowthAccording to a recent report by Machina Research, the total number of IoT connections are estimated to grow 16% annually over the next 10-year period from 6 billion in 2015 to 27 billion in 2025. Total IoT revenue opportunity is projected to grow to $3 trillion in 2025 from $750 billion in 2015. Given the market opportunity, SAP is increasing its focus on the segment. Last month, it announced plans to invest $2.25 billion in the development of its IoT offerings.As part of this focus, SAP recently announced the acquisition of Plat.One, a developer of a platform used for creating, deploying and managing IoT applications. The Plat.One platform has been developed for large-scale implementations and offers IoT and machine-to-machine application development tools, along with data and device management capabilities. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Post the acquisition, SAP will integrate its IoT capabilities including device lifecycle management and connectivity and IoT edge capabilities into SAP HANA Cloud Platform.Last month, SAP also announced the acquisition of Palo Alto, California,-based Altiscale. Altiscale offers cloud-based versions of the Hadoop and Spark open source software for storing, processing and analyzing different kinds of data. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but analysts estimate the deal to be worth $125 million. While the acquisition will help SAP strengthen its enterprise-related Big Data offerings, it also plans to leverage the new capabilities in its other initiatives including IoT, the cloud and business networks.Ultimately, SAP hopes to be able to integrate the Big Data collected from the connected devices with machine learning and SAP's real-time database S/4 HANA, and then subsequently transform this data into intelligent, actionable services, and insights for its customers. It recently released a few new products geared toward this objective.Earlier this month, it released SAP Connected Goods, a cloud-based solution delivered on SAP HANA Cloud Platform that has been developed to maximize the value of mass-market devices, such as coolers, vending machines or power tools, through remote monitoring, management and central control. The solution optimizes device availability, utilization and performance by managing stock levels and storage details. It identifies relevant trends and usage patterns and relies on rule-based alerts for replenishment of goods along with supplying customized dashboards. It also released SAP Dynamic Edge Processing - a platform that supports real-time IoT decision making with business context, and optimizes operations by making edge assets and workers operate more efficiently. The platform combines algorithms, syncing architecture and optimized database technology with features for device connectivity and onboarding, offline operation, data reduction, local application platforms, immediate response, and local storage.SAP's stock is trading at $88.31 with a market capitalization of $107 billion. It had reached a record high of $92.76 in September this year soon after the result announcement. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $71.39 it had fallen to in June this year."

Overall, the global ERP applications market was estimated to be worth $82.1 billion in license, maintenance and subscription revenues in 2015. In 2015, SAP (NYSE:SAP) was the leader in the market with 6% market share and $5.3 billion in ERP product revenues, riding on a 23% jump in license, maintenance and subscription revenues. With its latest product innovations, SAP hopes to maintain that lead.SAP's Financials SAP's fourth quarter revenues grew 6% over the year to €6.72 billion (~$7.24 billion) compared with the market's forecast of €6.68 billion (~$7.2 billion). EPS of €1.52 (~$1.64) was also ahead of the Street's forecast of €1.41 (~$1.52) for the quarter.Revenues from Cloud and Software grew 6% to €5.76 billion (~ $6.21 billion) with cloud Subscriptions and Support revenues growing 31% to €827 million (~$892 million) and software licenses and support revenues growing 4% over the year to €4.93 billion (~$5.31 billion). The Others segment brought in the remaining revenues of €0.96 billion (~$1 billion).SAP ended the year with revenues growing 6% to €22.06 billion (~$23.78 billion) and an EPS of €3.03 (~3.27).For the current year, SAP forecast revenues of €23.2 billion-€23.6 billion (~$25-$25.4 billion), compared with market estimate of €23.5 billion (~25.3 billion).SAP's Cloud GrowthSAP remains focused on its cloud business. It announced plans to invest nearly $4 billion in cash to fuel more growth in the segment. As part of the growth plan, SAP is looking at acquisitions, especially those valued at about $1 billion. It is searching for software companies with capabilities either across industries or in niche areas like networking factories and industrial equipment.As part of product offerings to drive the growth, SAP is releasing its new software S/4 Hana Cloud Edition, which is a HANA version geared to mid-sized companies with about 1,500 employees. To address the retail customers, it also launched SAP S/4HANA Retail, a version of the platform for merchandise management that will help retailers develop a multi-channel end-to-end retailing solution to cater to the demands of the digital economy. The Retail version's features include the ability to provide end-to-end support for all core retail processes, meaningful insights into operational retail data and a simple and intuitive user interface.SAP already is witnessing increasing adoption of HANA by organizations. It ended the recent quarter with 5,400 businesses running the HANA suite, compared with 4,100 a quarter ago. But this is still the tip of the iceberg. 5,400 customers implies that more than 85% of its install base is still in the pipeline and yet to be migrated to HANA.Given SAP's plans of growing inorganically, I would point SAP again towards Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK). At current market capitalization of $8.3 billion, Splunk is definitely beyond the current price range that SAP is scouting for. But, I think that a large acquisition like Splunk would help enhance SAP's IoT strategy. Splunk, as I have pointed out earlier, is, most likely, also on Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) radar. So this would be a competitive situation.SAP's Enterprise OfferingsMeanwhile, SAP continues to improve its enterprise portfolio to help organizations better manage and govern their data assets. The updates to the Enterprise Information Management portfolio include SAP Data Services that will provide extended support and connectivity for integrating and loading large and diverse data types, including integration with Google BigQuery, Hadoop, SAP HANA Vora, SAP IQ, SAP HANA, and other cloud storage.The service also will offer optimized data extraction from a HIVE table using Spark and new connectivity support for Amazon Redshift and Apache Cassandra. It will come with SAP Information Steward, which is the latest version to help speed data resolution issues with better usability, policy, and workflow processes. Users are able to view and share data quality scorecards across devices without having to log into the application using the Information Steward.Other features include SAP Agile Data Preparation that will improve collaboration capabilities between business users and data stewards, SAP HANA smart data integration and smart data quality that will offer new performance and connectivity functionality to deliver faster and real-time replication, bulk/batch data movement, data virtualization and data quality through one common user interface. The portfolio will offer SAP Data Quality Management micro services as a beta on SAP HANA Cloud Platform that will ensure clean data by providing data validation and enrichment for addresses and geocodes within any application or environment.SAP's stock is trading at $91.25 with a market capitalization of $110.4 billion.

The IoT market is expected to grow to almost $11 trillion by the year 2025.Another report claims the Western Europe and Asia Pacific markets for IoT devices are to grow the most through 2021.SAP's investments are in line with the IoT perspective, with offerings such as Hadoop, PLAT.ONE and FEDEM, all integrated with HANA. The company claims to have made some additional investments in machine learning (M.L.) and artificial intelligence (A.I.). After Amazon web services open sourced DSSTNE it is now contemplating on a future of AI in healthcare through Amazon Echo and Alexa. Apple Inc. acquired Turi to foray deeper into personalized gadgets, for example, an enhanced Siri experience. The ML toolkit is compared with the likes of Google's TensorFlow. Intel's acquisition of Nervana Systems could help lower costs by delivering higher performance through probable integration of Nervana Engine IP to a Xeon CPU. It is interesting to know that there's been a growing interest over getting a share of the AI pie.In Q3, SAP launched the HANA express edition, a powerful downloadable in-memory platform that helped the company in expanding its customer base. Also, through SAP Build, based on its Fiori platform, the company provides a cloud-based prototyping and user research tool for enterprise application developers. It started shipping its Build platform to clients such as ATB Financial, Convergent IS and Linklaters. Apart from these the company launched TripLink by Concur, Time Entry mobile app by Fieldglass and Direct Materials Sourcing capability by Ariba.These developments along with positive market acceptability ensure stable growth going forward. Cloud has gradually become a key metric for SAP. It Accounts for 15% of total revenue. However, YoY gross margin has slightly gone down.Partnership with MicrosoftMicrosoft's implementation of SuccessFactors Employee Central is expected to offer better employee engagement in terms of retaining talent and expertise. Also, Microsoft and SAP are expanding partnership in the cloud, which will bolster growth and presence for both the companies in the long run.Now SAP's cloud-based human resources software will run on the Azure public cloud. Further, integration with Fieldglass will help manage their external workforce. The Microsoft partnership has many dimensions to it, and is going to grow in future.ConclusionSAP has had a stable year so far, and with the current progress is almost sure to reach its 2020 ambition of an operating profit of €8 - €9 billion with a 70 - 75% share through cloud. It has a good cash flow to support its journey into cloud. However, weakness in key end markets such as Latin American countries and China may disturb revenue growth. As per reports, the global IT industry is expected to remain sluggish through the rest of 2016. The cloud space has also become very competitive. So, it is definitely a buy, but only after a slight correction."
4014111,98236,2016-10-23T22:57:03-04:00,"SAP reported the results of its fiscal Q3 on Friday. Revenue growth was strong while non-IFRS profits were above expectations.The company had a very balanced performance by product line and by geography, and had to overcome a charge of 300 million euros due to the appreciation of its share price.The company raised the outlook for its Q4 expectations marginally and reported the best pipeline in its history.The company's operating results continue to significantly surpass those of principal rival Oracle on a comparable basis and are stronger still than the results of IBM.The company essentially forecast a significant dividend increase next year as it has delivered its balance sheet after the borrowing undertaken to buy Concur in 2014.","Like many older, somewhat sclerotic software companies, SAP (NYSE:SAP) is often no longer considered as a growth stock. And to be fair, when compared to some of the current crops of software vendors who have grown up in the days since cloud architecture became regnant, it hasn't produced hyper-growth numbers, and at its scale, it would seem as though those days are behind it. On the other hand, this company has been making its transition to the cloud at a reasonable cadence and has been continuing to report growth in both revenue and EPS during the transition, unlike its principal rival, Oracle. (NASDAQ:ORCL) or IBM (NYSE:IBM).The title for the article comes from the famous patriotic song, ""Over There"" by George Cohan. Of course, Over There in that case was related to the efforts of the American Expeditionary Force redressing the balance of Europe in favor of the democratic allies. Here we see a European business enjoying greater success in all areas of the world as a legacy IT vendor than is the case for both its principle rival and IBM, headquartered in the US.And while SAP's dividend yield is nothing to write home about (1.52%), it has reached a position where dividend increases in the future are likely to be at a greater cadence than in the recent past. I was struck during the course of the earnings conference call on Friday by two things that are often not related. On the one hand, the CEO Bill McDermott was as positive as he has ever been in terms of his business outlook. But of equal interest were the comments from both the CEO and the CFO regarding dividend increases. The CEO described the outlook for dividend increases in his unique fashion as follows, ""I said that SAP will remain an excellent dividend payer as we have consistently done now for year and years and years. So, put that in the win column for the shareholders."" Further on, ""The main thing is we are going to be extremely shareholder friendly. We believe that a growth company needs to also take care of its shareholders."" Words - maybe - but I do think for readers/investors looking for a company in the enterprise IT space that has both growth potentials and a policy that favors shareholders regarding dividends, this is a better choice than many other alternatives. Finally, this from the CFO Luka Mucic, ""As you know, we have a dividend policy of paying out more than 35% of net profit. Net profit is up significantly when you take a look at our IFRS numbers (YTD), so chances are that the dividend will also be up significantly.""I own SAP shares and have done so for some time now. I do so mainly because I see the company's transition to the cloud being managed in a reasonable fashion that is perhaps underappreciated by some. But I think other readers who like to see dividends and a share repurchase program might want to look at SAP as it is emerging from the constraints it faced in terms of capital returns in the wake of its acquisition of Concur.During the course of the conference call, the company basically said there would not be any large acquisitions going forward to surprise shareholders. Management also said that it will be able to pay off the debt it took on to buy Concur sooner rather than later and that should give it room to buy back shares (2nd half of 2017) and raise the dividend, especially with the significant growth in free cash flow it anticipates and has achieved.The company reported the results of its fiscal Q3 last Friday and the results showed a modest upside in terms of revenue and showed a beat as well in terms of non-IFRS operating profits. (IFRS is the European equivalent of GAAP and most earnings estimates published by analysts highlight a non-IFRS presentation.) In the wake of the beat, management increased its non-IFRS operating profit forecast marginally, at the mid-point and it raised its forecast for product revenue growth by 50 bps to 7.5% at the mid-point. Although the CEO, Bill McDermott has a background in sales and a record of having a bit more optimism than might always be warranted, the quote for which this conference call will be remembered was his comment that, ""the pipeline is more robust than it has ever been going into the 4th quarter…We're in very good shape on the top line.""SAP's center of gravity is in EMEA - it is, after all headquartered in Walldorf, Germany although it has a significant US headquarters outside of Philadelphia - hardly a land of hope and glory these days. The company is notorious for being slow moving, cautious and for both overpaying and then having a difficult time in managing acquisitions. It doesn't get the highest marks in the world from consultants or from user satisfaction surveys. And yet, quarter after quarter, it cranks out reasonable numbers. Q3 turned out to be no exception.Many Seeking Alpha readers tend to ignore this company because it is Over There although its long-time CEO Bill McDermott is as American as anyone in the software business. And yes, it gets a smaller proportion of its revenues in the US than its peers, and that can mean more substantial swings in terms of US constant currency results than would be the case for some other vendors. In recent years, that has been a headwind in terms of reported numbers.But the company has an exceptionally broad footprint in the application software space, with offerings of various kinds both in many verticals and many infrastructure segments. Over the years, it has been able to buy solutions when it didn't develop appropriate and competitive capabilities internally. It has paid incredible sums for some of the companies it has bought - after all these years, I still wonder how the purchase of Sybase was ever justified to SAP's board at the price that was paid. (We all should have learned how to develop mobile apps and applied for large pensions for our work from SAP) And it hasn't been a particularly hospitable home for some of the leaders of the companies that it bought - although some of the individuals involved were surely stormy petrels at best.There are lots of things that SAP doesn't do that have been issues in the past, but are now considered benefits. Most particularly, the company doesn't try to pretend that it has capabilities in the IaaS market or that it needs to take on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in that space. (Maybe the Sybase merger was actually cheap at just a dead loss over a bit more than $5 billion.) Microsoft, indeed, is a customer and has chosen to implement SAP's SuccessFactors HR solutions. And SuccessFactors is available on the Azure platform. It is a reasonable strategic decision for both companies and it is the kind of thing that is making the transition to cloud easier for SAP than has been the case for Oracle or for IBM. Note on IBM's conference call, its CFO proclaimed that its Watson technology would never be available on anyone else's cloud. In other words, if an IBM user wants or has Azure or AWS, then Watson will not be available. On the other hand, if a user wants SuccessFactors, it is available on Azure. Frankly, SuccessFactors is stronger in its space than is Watson, but there are very different cultures at work - and in this case, the German culture is far more open and flexible and congruent with user expectations.It is lots easier to co-exist in the world than it is to pick fights. (That is not a political commentary, though I suppose some might think it so.) And that has been one of the principal factors that has allowed SAP to be able to achieve growth when its rivals have not grown and are not likely to return to growth. Not having to protect a huge installed user base of database customers turns out to be a very nice place to be in the wake of trying to deal with both Microsoft SQL Server and Amazon's multiple database offerings such as Aurora. At this point, and with numbers that somehow seem a bit more credible than those of rivals, about 15% of SAP's revenues come from cloud services. That is quite a bit higher than the percentage of Oracle's revenues coming from the cloud and it is against a backdrop of stable revenues in terms of on-premise licenses and some modest growth in support.Like all companies in transition, the transparency of the company's financial presentations could be significantly improved. The company has continued to acquire a significant amount of cloud revenue through acquisition. The acquisition of Concur, which closed just before the end of 2014 continues to have impacts on reported growth percentages, although this should be the last year in which that company's prior seasonality distorts comparisons. This year SAP has acquired 3 cloud vendors although the scale of the acquisitions is not enormous compared to the company's acquisitions in 2014.But overall, I think if I were to attempt to distill the company's secret sauce, it would turn out to be execution. There are many times in the past decade in which I and others have thought this company had lost its relevance. But somehow, in the last decade, the company has more than doubled its revenues and it has increased its operating profits from 598 million euros to 1638 million euros. CFFO has climbed consistently with earnings rising from 1267 million euros for the first 9 months of the long ago 2006 year to 3391 million euros just reported.In terms of USD returns, the shares have doubled in value over the past decade including the dividends that have been collected. As the euro has declined by 13.5% over the period, the company's share price increase record for Europeans has been quite strong indeed.This year is really not all that much different than the company's long-term track record. So far YTD, the shares have increased by 12% compared to the IGV which is up a bit less than 9% over the same span. Most of the share price increase is based on the fact that consensus estimates have been steadily rising and will self-evidently continue to do so because the company has increased guidance. The company has had one poor quarter over the course of the last 12 months; it is lots harder to forecast in multi-dimensions which is what it means when it becomes necessary to forecast not just what deals close, but what deals close in the cloud or in on-prem. (Also note that analysts forecast earnings for the ADRs, which are of course denominated in dollars and not euros which is what is reported by SAP) The current quarter showed a noticeable decline in IFRS profits, ironically caused because stock-based comp, calculated in accordance with the IFRS formula, showed a noticeable increase in last quarter that was a product of the share price appreciation. I really did not make that up. The share price increase of 20% in the quarter, led to a 300 million euro increase in reported stock-based comp - I suppose most shareholders would find the trade-off acceptable.I think that it is interesting that management has already given analysts a nudge when it comes to expectations for 2017 expectations. Again, from the CEO:The CFO, who actually has to deliver numbers said:I think the observation by the CEO regarding Oracle is quite apt, but this is not the place to discuss precisely how Oracle develops its percentage cloud growth numbers.Why is SAP having such different results than the other older technology companies?There is a hoary saying about wishing to be luckier than smart. Not that SAP doesn't have smart people, and the same can be said about Oracle and IBM. But SAP simply doesn't have to deal with defending the indefensible in a database area. Both IBM and Oracle have enormous revenue sources coming from database and middleware software. SAP doesn't. And for better or worse, that is a big part of the different results that are being achieved by SAP and Oracle.I am inclined to believe that one of the reasons that Oracle was tardy in starting to develop its cloud was the desire on the part of its then CEO to avoid the problems inherent in attempting the consumption of one's children. By that I mean that the CEO realized that if the cloud became the computing standard, Oracle's database monopoly was doomed and there would eventually little that could be done about it. If you don't want something to happen, call it a foul name and maybe it will go away. So, some of the advantages SAP has are historical, almost accidental.SAP is a venerable company as software vendors go. 45 years old at this point. It has dominated the applications world for many, many years, and today it faces a raft of new competitors with purpose built cloud applications. I think attempting to analyze whether SAP has a better solution in one particular part of the applications world or the other is a bootless undertaking. It is more or less inevitable that companies like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) have more ""modern"" architecture in whole or in part.But since the middle of the last decade, the company has been willing to spend unparalleled sums to buy cloud solutions - and other solutions as well - and while the amounts were staggering at the time in terms of valuation metrics, they have allowed the company to deal with some of the challenges of the cloud a little bit more easily than would otherwise have been the case. Again, I don't propose to rate all of the company's acquisitions against those of either Oracle or IBM. It really doesn't matter all that much at this point. In all, the company has done 61 acquisitions according to Wiki, and starting with Business Objects, some of them have been major. But none of them were done for ""financial"" reasons particularly and although I still wonder about the Sybase acquisition, what SAP did was to buy the best technology that it could regardless of the cost.Some of the companies that it has bought were domiciled in Europe and were less well known in North America and in EMEA. Some have been leaders in areas that are hot these days, but weren't quite so when they were bought. A typical SAP acquisition might be said to have been Hybris. Hybris was a German software company that might be said to have been one of the pioneers in the digital commerce world. It is still very European-centric with 84 customers in Germany and 90 in the US. But it is the leader in the Gartner MQ survey for Digital Commerce this year compared to some better-known names.Then there have been companies such as SmartOps, which was the brainchild of American visionary Sridhar Tayur, who describes himself as the Academic Capitalist and dreamed up a company that essentially does real time supply chain analysis.The acquisitions that are well known because of their size include Business Objects, Sybase, Ariba, SuccessFactors, SeeWhy, and Concur. Sybase is still a headscratcher, at least for me. The others were the category leaders and part of the reason that SAP can grow when its two largest rivals are shrinking in that list. SuccessFactors is the 600-pound gorilla in the HCM space. Concur is probably the 900-pound gorilla in the Travel and Expense management space. Ariba is surely the 600-pound gorilla in the supplier management space.I think the point of the list is to suggest that part of the explanation for the different results that SAP is able to enjoy these days, is that it has been willing to spend money to buy companies that have been passed on by its competitors who simply were unwilling to pay the price either in funding start-up losses or in terms of valuation premiums. SAP has been willing to believe in revenue synergies in a way that its two rivals have not wanted to deal with, and the results are what is being seen these days.Some luck, a better batting average with acquisitions, the willingness to take bigger risks and better sales execution have allowed Sybase to get more growth out of its space than have its two primary rivals.Valuation & Financial MetricsNo one has ever confused SAP shares with deep value. The company has a current enterprise value of about $111 billion. The company's revised revenue projection is a bit more than $24 billion using the current exchange rate of 1 Euro = $1.09. So, that is an EV/S of 4.6X. Analysts are forecasting 6% growth next year. I think that is likely to prove to be significantly lower than the actual result based on the company's track record and the specific comments of the CEO and the CFO cited above. At this point, I would think that the company might achieve 9%+ growth at constant currency. I won't count on any meaningful share repurchase. But at over $26 billion in expected sales, the EV/S will be 4.2X. Not value territory, but reasonable enough for the growth rate I think to be a reasonable expectation.The analyst consensus for SAP EPS had been $4.37. With the increase in guidance, I expect that the consensus numbers - and the actual earnings to reach $4.50-$4.60. That suggests that the current P/E is a bit under 20X and that based on revised expectations for 2017, the P/E is likely in the range of 17X. Again, not deep value territory, but reasonable for a GARP company.As I have mentioned on other occasions, I prefer using free cash flow yield as the most objective metric with which to compare investments. The free cash flow yield does away with anomalies as charging earnings because of the strong share price performance of a company in a particular quarter and it cuts through other anomalies that are non-operational in nature. Through the first 9 months of the year, the company produced 3,628 million euros from operations, up 12% from the prior year cash flow of 3,241 million euros. That is a CFFO margin of 23.5% - reasonable, but certainly not an outlier. CFFO is exceeding reported operating profits by a significant amount primarily because of deferred revenue increases and because of depreciation. Given the strong growth in cloud bookings, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in deferred revenues will continue to grow more rapidly than revenues for some time to come.Capex was higher this year than last year although it is still a relatively small cost relative to the other items in free cash flow. Overall, free cash flow through the first 9 months of the year was about 2960 million euros compared to 2815 million euro the prior year, an increase of 5%. Based on the commentary of the CFO, I expect that capex will decline in Q4 and will show little or no growth next year.SAP's cash flow is often lower in Q4 than in its other quarters because of the growth in receivables due to the elevated sales results in the last quarter of the year. That seasonality will likely diminish over the years as the company moves to more recurring revenue sources, but it will still be a factor in Q4-2016 cash flow. Last year, the company had CFFO of 398 million euros in Q4; I think it is reasonable to assume that CFFO this year will be between 450-475 million euros with capex for the period of about 150 million euros leaving free cash flow of 300 million euros for the period and bringing the estimate for full year free cash flow to just shy of 3.3 billion euros or $3.6 billion at current exchange rates. That is a free cash flow yield of 3.2%. Based on the glimmerings of guidance, we have been given for expectations next year within management's commentary on the call, I think that free cash flow will increase significantly faster than the increase in operating profits in 2017 because of strong increases in deferred revenue and some increases in depreciation. So, I think free cash flow ought to be in the neighborhood of 3.8 billion euros during 2017, and that would bring the current free cash flow yield to 3.4%. Again, that isn't deep value when compared to say MSFT, which has a free cash flow yield of 6.5%, but which has a noticeably lower growth rate.SAP reports many numbers in many ways, and I am sure that management actually believes it does so in the interest of transparency. This writer begs to differ. Some of the metrics are interesting, and some of the metrics are marginally relevant, but few of them provide any significant light in terms of providing the basis for forward-looking expectations. In particular, the way the company chooses to present revised guidance expectations is maddening - at least to this writer. And while the breakouts by product and region may be interesting to some, I am not too sure how much I ought to make of them in formulating a view about the success of the company vis-a-vis expectations. I will not discuss most of the many metrics that the company presents - it really would enhance no one's ability to forecast SAP's operating performance and would certainly have not be correlated with the company's share price. I will just touch on a few that might be of interest to some readers.There has been a premium that European investors have been willing to pay for SAP, primarily because of the scarcity of large cap software names in Europe. Given that the company still retains that status, it makes the current valuation metrics seem reasonable indeed and leaves room for significant share price appreciation in the context of continuing execution.As has been commented earlier, Q3 saw a significant expansion of IFRS expense, primarily because of the rapid growth in share-based comp coupled with a growth in operating expenses driven by a growth in headcount. The company does not break out stock-based comp specifically in its reconciliation of IFRS earnings to non-IFRS calculations. My comments regarding stock-based comp came from the information provided by the CEO during the course of the conference call.In the quarter, headcount grew by 2500 and grew by 7000 for the year with the most rapid growth coming in the APJ region where headcount grew by a bit more than 12% compared to 5.6% in EMEA and a bit over 10% in the Americas. Management suggested that Q3 was a heavy quarter for hiring and that the cadence would diminish going forward.Overall, non-IFRS expense ratios were flat year on year for research and development, increased by 170 basis points for sales and marketing and declined by 70 basis points for general and administrative cost. The increase in sales and marketing was the result of a strong percentage increase in bookings, some of which is not reflected in revenues during the period. Non-IFRS margins had shown particularly strong growth in Q3 of 2015.SAP is forecasting that its non-IFRS operating profit in Q4 will grow by 100 million euros, or about 4.5% at the mid-point while its overall revenues are forecast to grow about 6-7% overall. The decline in constant currency operating margins is likely to be a function of stronger bookings than reported revenues, which will continue to pressure the sales and marketing expense ratio as was the case in Q3.Revenue growth was more or less consistent in all of the company's regions with the company's European region showing 6% revenue growth, the Americas region up by 7% and APJ up by 6%.Margin growth, based on the progression of margins this year, is likely to be greater in 2017, which is consistent with the current forecast. I think the mismatch between bookings and reported revenues is likely to decrease to some degree and the rapid growth in headcount will also abate.When I look at SAP, I see a company still in transition, but one where the end point is in view and the interim numbers will not require some huge leap of faith in determining the end point. The company may not reach double-digit revenue growth even as the transition continues. It sells lots of ERP and that is simply not a growth market. I think it reasonable to expect that operating margins will rise over time at a noticeable rate and the company will reduce its share count and increase its dividend payout. Perhaps not the most exciting investment, but one that can produce a modest amount of positive alpha and some level of dividend income in the intermediate term."
4000358,20521,2016-08-17T15:44:23-04:00,"Since early 2016, SAP has been increasing focus on the Internet of Things segment.It is working on offerings that will be able to support customers already using IoT-based systems, and it is also working on a future wave of SAP IoT implementations.Earlier last month, SAP announced the acquisition of Norwegian company Fedem Technology AS, which would be its first strategic IoT acquisition.","After the announcement of Brexit last quarter, many were worried about the performance of Europe-based companies. Recently reported second quarter results by ERP leader SAP (NYSE:SAP) appear to have put those concerns to rest. After delivering rather lackluster results in the first quarter, SAP delivered very strong second quarter results that sent the stock soaring to 52-week high levels.SAP's FinancialsSAP's second quarter revenues grew 5% over the year to €5.24 billion (~$5.76 billion) compared with the market's forecast of €5.2 billion (~$5.71 billion). Operating profit in the quarter grew 11% to €1.52 billion (~$1.67 billion), ahead of the market consensus of €1.44 billion (~$1.58 billion). EPS of €0.82 (~$0.90) was ahead of the Street's forecast of $0.78.By segment, Cloud and Software business grew 30% to €720 million (~$791.4 million) and software licenses and support revenues grew 4% to €3.64 billion (~$4 billion). This was the 13th consecutive quarter that SAP reported growth of over 30% from cloud-based offerings. Revenues from other services fell 3% to €878 million (~$965 million). SAP attributed the impressive performance to the ""trifecta of double digit growth in software revenue, cloud revenue, and operating income in double digits, a rare feat in the industry.""By region, revenue from cloud subscriptions and support grew 47% in the Asia Pacific region, 41% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and 29% in the Americas.For the current year, SAP maintained its outlook of revenues of €6.4 billion-€6.7 billion (~$7.04-$7.38 billion).SAP's IoT GrowthSince early 2016, SAP has been increasing focus on the Internet of Things (IoT) segment. It is working on various offerings that will be able to support customers that are already using IoT-based systems, and it is also working on a future wave of SAP IoT implementations. It is currently seeing three kinds of key uses for the technology - the industrial customers who use heavy equipment and are aiming to optimize operations cost, maintenance cost and turnaround time, the aftermarket which includes end consumer and other businesses which have traded a product and are getting feedback to improve design, marketing, and create better engagement with customers, and finally customers with large moving assets such as fleets, cars, trucks who are using the service to track and trace on a real-time basis.While these customers are most prevalent in the oil, gas, chemical and mining industries for now, SAP is counting on the reach growing to agriculture, healthcare, and the financial industry within the next year. To cater to these new industries, SAP is working on new solutions. For instance, within the insurance sector, it is working on the ability to track the vehicle usage to deliver customized insurance quotes.Earlier last month, SAP announced the acquisition of Norwegian company Fedem Technology AS, which would be its first strategic IoT acquisition. Fedem's core assets include an advanced engineering experience and proprietary software that is able to run analysis based on scientific laws and is thus able to provide definitive answers. The company helps build a digital clone of the installation, collect sensor data from the physical structure in the cloud, analyze the data real-time and provide an overview of the structure's condition. SAP plans to build these capabilities into SAP's next generation end-to-end IoT solutions for predictive maintenance as well as real-time structural integrity monitoring and Industry 4.0 scenarios. The integration will help enterprise customers get an overview of wear and tear in equipment, vehicles or plant operations, and give them the ability to conduct proactive maintenance, thus reducing downtime. The technology is expected to be most useful for the renewable energy, oil and gas and marine and mechanical sectors. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.A McKinsey report published last year estimates the global IoT market to grow to have a global economic impact of as much as $11.1 trillion by the year 2025. SAP clearly wants to play a big part in this industry.SAP HANAMeanwhile, SAP continues to reap benefits from the impressive HANA platform. SAP now boasts of more than 3,700 S/4 HANA customers. During the quarter, SAP added more than 500 SAP S/4HANA customers, of which approximately 40% are net new SAP customers.Recently, the company announced several new upgrades to the system including Cloud Identity Access Governance, smart data integration, smart data quality, and other Data Services. The new products are able to integrate all businesses and their data into one source, allowing people to deal with live data and dig into any aspect of their business. Services like HANA Vora are allowing customers to blend scale on structured data in Hadoop allowing customers to seamlessly integrate cloud, on-premise, and hybrid landscapes.SAP's stock is trading around 52-week high levels of $88.17 with a market capitalization of about $105 billion. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $62.57 it had fallen to back in September last year.Ph"
4066275,98236,2017-04-27T15:42:51-04:00,SAP reported the results of its fiscal Q1 April 26th.The results were a beat on revenues and in-line EPS.EPS results were heavily influenced by adjustments to operating income.The company's top line growth was stellar compared to expectations and showed one of the strongest growth rates in recent years.The company has higher valuation metrics than many legacy software vendors but its top line growth and particularly the inflection in that metric are clear outliers in the group.,"SAP - Getting What You Pay ForSAP (NYSE:SAP) reported the results of its Q1 early Tuesday morning. The results were actually a modest beat in terms of EPS on a non-IFRS basis. (Like most European companies, SAP uses IFRS to calculate its financial results. It then adjusts those earnings to non-IFRS standard which are equivalent, for the most part, to non-GAAP earnings in the U.S). What is interesting about SAP results, is that unlike many of its peers, it has managed the transition from an on-premise business model to the Cloud while maintaining its profitability and growing revenue-even growing perpetual license revenues which were actually up 10% year on year. I will review the financial results later on this article, but this was an exceptionally strong quarter for an old-line software stalwart that is seeing another leg of growth and which saw an all-time high in its shares in Tuesday's trading.What should investors do with the shares at this point? I remain a buyer of the shares, although perhaps I would look for a better entry point. When all is said and done, the shares have traded up sharply, especially for Americans, based on the appreciation of the euro and the strong reaction in European stocks to the defeat of one of the more radical players in the French 1st round election.The shares have actually increased by about 25% in the last 5 months and about 8% in the last week. That level of appreciation is not that much greater than the IGV index over the past 5 months-it is up 21%, but that index is only marginally higher in the last week or so.The real question for investors to consider is what do first quarter results imply about growth as a whole for SAP and when will margin growth resume? The answer to neither of these points is self-evident or without controversy. Clearly Q1 showed a sharp acceleration in the growth of the company's business and indeed looked at holistically, the growth, because of the increase in deferred revenues, was actually noticeably greater than that portrayed in the headlines.Overall, the value of orders that were entered in the quarter increased by 30%. That's a rate of growth that even some newer, cloud only, company's might find acceptable and it is quite remarkable for an older company such as this is. Ironically, because of the relatively strong growth in on-premise license, the company proportion of ratable revenues held steady at 68%. It is a nice problem to have. Within the overall 30% bookings growth, cloud bookings rose by 49%, a noticeable acceleration from the cadence in the prior year.On the other hand, margins were such that despite the strong revenue quarter, EPS was merely in line, and to an extent, that reflects currency fluctuations in addition to operational performance. For a variety of reasons, the company did not choose to increase guidance for the balance of the year although certainly there might be reasons to believe that the full year will see results greater than those the company provided on Tuesday. It should be noted that the company had increased its guidance the past quarter. I think that management, relatively conservative in the past regarding guidance, is probably not wanting to be held to a standard of quarterly increases in guidance.Based on the results in Q1 and going back for some considerable period it seems clear that SAP is gaining market share in that its top-line growth is outpacing that of most of the markets in which it competes, and it is certainly gaining share versus its arch-rival Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) - and its market share gains are accelerating. For me, that is usually a good start in making a positive case for the shares unless they are outrageously valued. That is simply not the case at this point in my opinion.While margins did not show favorable trends last quarter, the same cannot be said regarding cashflow. The company cash flow from operations rose by 16% and free cash flow rose by 12% in the quarter year over year. That is a stark contrast to some of the company's peers and competitors. During the quarter, the company raised its dividend by 9%, to the equivalent $1.37/share. This is consistent with past policies but the yield is not really adequate to support a purchase recommendation.The divergence between cash flow and reported earnings was primarily a factor of the company's growth in deferred revenues-SAP is actually doing better than its headline numbers might suggest. Cash flow was also driven by changes in working capital, particularly payables balances.The results highlighted were achieved despite the company accruing consistent tax rates year on year while continuing to increase headcount steadily. And for those interested in such things, the company has woman holding 25% of managerial positions and it reduced its emissions of greenhouse gases to 100 tons, down from 120 tons the prior year. I am happy to know that I have invested in a socially responsible company that has embraced diversity as a corporate value. I am sorely tempted to write more, but this is an article about investing in SAP and not political commentary. Actually, somewhat unusually in the software world, the company has recently appointed two women to head global sales and marketing and has elected them to the Executive Board of the company.Deferred revenues were up by almost 20% year on year and perhaps most important in evaluating the business performance of the company, deferred cloud subscription revenue increased by 8% sequentially-a rather remarkable metric as Q1 is supposed to be down from Q4 and that was the case last year. Overall, deferred cloud subscription revenue grew 44% over the past year, a significant up-trend in that metric. Unlike many other companies who are selling cloud based solutions, SAP's users apparently are increasing the length of their commitments which would appear to be a good thing. The company doesn't provide an average contract duration metric but the increases in deferred revenue growth are impressive for a company of this scale.In looking at an old-line software company such as this is, I believe that investors should be looking to see if it is making the transitions to the cloud promptly and with competitive offerings. It really has done a better job in that regard than any of its peers and competitors-certainly compared to Oracle but also compared to IBM (NYSE:IBM). And the success of some of the company's newest offerings - particularly H4Hana suggest that this trend will continue on into the future. It remains, as it has been, the large cap name executing best in its space. Yes, the shares are at an all-time high and have a valuation not loved by some. But with SAP shares, investors are getting what they paid for.Why is SAP winning and why can it continue to do so?The saying goes that success has many fathers, although these days I think the saying needs to be modified so as to be gender neutral. Part of the success of SAP, I believe, is the success of the companies that they bought several years ago which are now in the process of making strong contributions to the company's growth. When SAP was buying companies in the early years of this decade it was willing to pay what then seemed very high multiples of sales which at the time were thought to be somewhat risky transactions. But the portfolio that SAP acquired, which most notably include SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass, has been able to sustain significant growth rates as part of a larger organization. Management said that all of these businesses are growing at rates significantly greater than the business case assumptions used when these enterprises were acquired.It is also true that S4Hana which was released 2 years ago has seemingly taken off in terms of user acceptance. Is S4Hana ""better"" that Oracle's comparable offering? I am sure that there are many answers to that depend on the particular use case involved. But one thing does seem to have developed is that many SAP users have decided to become all-SAP shops and to do away with their legacy Oracle database installations. This is probably a significant factor in the acceleration of SAP's cloud growth rate.I think as well that the integration SAP has been able to develop between the company's different sets of solutions has turned out to be a major factor in the large deals in which SAP has had success. SAP tends to win deals where CIO's and ""C"" level managers are concerned about data integration and having ""a single source of truth."" It is obvious that it can be beaten in large deals where it faces companies such as Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) who specialize in a single function that appeals to business line managers.I also think that SAP has been able to develop an SMB strategy that is primarily a product of internal development that seems to be appealing to that class of user. Management emphasized on its conference call that 50% of its names in Q1 were net new. SAP has a more global reach than its competitors when it comes to the application space and in some of the geos where it has been operating for a long time, the availability of both S4Hana and other SAP offerings in the cloud catering to small businesses have started to drive revenues. Whether or not the recent acquisition of NetSuite by Oracle will present more competition in this space is hard to know at this point and is probably not an Oracle priority.I think as well, the maturing of SAP's cloud and S4Hana base is having something to do with the company's sales growth inflection. One of the things that is generally spoken about when large application companies host conference calls is ""go-lives."" Initially, when SAP started with its new products, it had its share of implementation issues and ""go-lives"" took longer than they were planned. On this call the company referenced 700 ""go-lives"" which probably gives SAP enough critical mass to have reference customers around the globe and in all of the 25 verticals that the company supports.SAP had a particularly strong start to year in terms of revenue and bookings. While one tends to listen to management bragging with a sense of déjà vu, and one tends to remember that the CEO of SAP is a salesman by trade, the body language of the call was a bit more optimistic than I typically expect from a staid, conservative business like this one. In some ways, management commentary on the call reminded me of the camp revival meetings one has read about or which have been portrayed in movies. For readers old enough, think Elmer Gantry as a model.What winning looks like in numbersThe company reported a quarter of 12% revenue growth and that compared to expectations for 9% growth, at least according to the published First Call consensus for that metric. Expectations have been that full year growth would reach 7.5% which obviously implies some material deceleration in revenue growth. The level of bookings was clearly a significant upside surprise and as the CFO put in on the call, ""the first quarter was much more successful than the first quarter of 2016 and hence our approvals for bonuses in the field of course have been higher than in 2016 as well."" It is, I think, unusual to see sales execution bonuses of any magnitude in a Q1-they are more likely to impact costs at the end of the year. It is just further evidence of how successful, from a sales perspective this quarter actually turned out to be for the company.The company had raised its expectation for revenue growth at the start of this year and reaffirmed that expectation in this current earnings release. But the current business momentum and significant additions to the deferred revenue balance might suggest that a further increase in the company's revenue growth forecast is within view.SAP's investment yearBy that I mean that 2017 is shaping up to be a year in which SAP invests to drive future growth at a higher cadence than is assumed by many investors and most analysts. The company's hiring, often the most visible focus of an investment strategy is very visible with headcount rising quite consistently by around 10%, a significant level for a company of this size.In the end, all was not sweetness and light on this conference call and there is and has been a substantial divide amongst analysts regarding their recommendations on this name. There are 34 analysts who report their ratings to First Call. 19 like the shares but 15 do not. Many of the headlines that were posted in the wake of the earnings release on Tuesday proclaimed that SAP had missed earnings expectations for the year. That was inaccurate and if SAP were an American company there would be no ambiguity. The company's non-IFRS earnings came to $.795 as of current exchange rates and that is higher than the expected EPS of $.78. Using the average exchange rate for Q1, EPS came to $.78.The headlines might have done better to focus on how the numbers were constructed. As mentioned earlier, 40% of the company's EPS after-tax came from adjustments to the IFRS number compared to 25% in the same quarter a year ago. Of the adjustment, 70% came from stock based comp which showed a substantial increase from the prior year, in part due to the appreciation of SAP stock. Management is projecting a material contraction in the level of stock based comp both relatively and in absolute terms for the balance of the year.SAP reports gross margins on many different segments of its business and analysts tend to focus on those areas of the business that are performing anomalously when compared to their model. For the most part, I don't think that such analysis is going to help determine whether or not the company is a worthwhile investment. Some might disagree.One of the issues that investors perceive is the rather significant gap between gross margins in the cloud and gross margins on software license. Cloud gross margins are 65%; software gross margins are 85%. Cloud is growing significantly faster than software license and the impact was that cloud and software gross margins together fell 150 basis points during the year. But that fall was made up for by improvements in services margins. The company is forecasting that it will see about a 1500 bps margin improvement in cloud over the next 3-4 years and has laid out some of the strategy that will lead to that kind of result. There is no reason to believe that the company will be unable to achieve that goal.Management is forecasting gross margin improvements more or less across the board based on scale in the cloud and that favorable trends were visible this quarter in services and in SAP's Business Network. It becomes much easier to achieve sustained margin growth when growth exceeds expectations on a sustainable basis and I think that is one of the reasons why I believe this company will continue, most quarters, and for most metrics to exceed expectations.IFRS operating margins fell significantly year on year but non-IFRS operating margins were down only marginally. I have no more affection for adjustments to IFRS than I do for the same kinds of adjustments in GAAP but it has been a long-standing practice and I am surely not going to change it. But obviously, with headcount rising, it is not surprising to see significant increases in expenses related to headcount. Overall, operating expenses were up 20% on an IFRS basis and revenues were up 12%. As mentioned earlier, the rather sizable 22% jump in sales and marketing expense was partly a function of accelerator and other sales bonus payments that were earned because of the very strong sales performance at rates beyond expectations and headlines that were achieved last quarter.The CFO spoke-on more than one occasion-to the outlook for margins going forward. Indeed, the last question of the conference call related to margins. There are, no doubt readers and listeners who have less sanguine expectations regarding the course of opex, but it is something almost totally within the control of management. The CFO reaffirmed that while SAP has made and will continue to make significant investments in opex and particularly in personnel, the company will achieve its margin goals for the year and that margins will improve significantly as the year progresses.My understanding of management's expectations is that the cadence of opex growth will start to decline and that revenues will increase seasonally. If, as I think more likely than not, revenues exceed projections, the company is in a position to over-attain on its margin expectations as the major increases have been made and were visible in Q1. I would be surprised if SAP did not start to report quarters with unambiguous upsides compared to consensus expectations.ValuationI started this article by talking about SAP being an investment in which investors are getting what they pay for. I think that is the case in terms of an investment in this company but it does not mean that the shares are deep value.SAP has a current market cap of $120 billion. It has a net cash position of about $2.5 billion. So, its enterprise value is $117.5 billion. Full year First Call consensus estimates for revenues are currently $25.2 billion, although that is likely to increase noticeably when First Call recalculates the consensus in the wake of the just past quarter. But at current values, the EV/S is a moderate level of 4.7X.The consensus EPS estimate for the year is $4.51. That yields a P/E of 22X. Again, the P/E may not be as low as the P/E for other legacy tech vendors, but then again, the growth rate is positive and meaningfully so, something that rivals like Oracle and IBM have yet to be able to pull off.As mentioned earlier, the company's CFFO was strong in Q1, growing by almost 16% year on year. Some of this had to do with other assets and liabilities and an equivalent amount had to do with the rapid growth of deferred revenues. The company saw a sharp increase in capex for the quarter which left free cash flow 11% above the levels of 2016.The CFO's forecast for free cash flow is that it will remain positive for the full year.Last year, free cash flow came to $3.95 billion. Using the same growth rate for the metric as seen in Q1, I would expect free cash flow to reach $4.3 billion. Much of the company's cash flow is going to be employed in de-leveraging its balance sheet that saw borrowings rise steeply in the wake of the acquisition of Concur a bit more than 2 years ago. In general, SAP has chosen lately to follow a more conservative financial strategy than peers Oracle and IBM.The company's free cash flow yield of 3.65% on projected free cash flow is certainly no bargain on any kind of basis but neither is it outlandish. As the investments the company has made to become a major cloud player abate, this metric is likely to rise at a rapid cadence.I haven't attempted the exercise of comparing SAP's most recent results with those of Oracle in any detailed fashion. Suffice to say, Oracle isn't growing and isn't expected to achieve noticeable growth for some quarters in the future. This company is achieving double digit growth. Even when/if Oracle returns to growth, expectations for that metric remain at half or less what this company is currently achieving.I think Q1 results for SAP represent a noticeable inflection in terms of top line growth, partially, but not wholly reflected in the company's recent share valuation. I still believe there is positive alpha remaining for investors in this name."

But if the market was expecting a similar performance for the first quarter of the year, it was disappointed. The company reported rather lackluster results, following the footsteps of most of the other tech giants. Its recent investments in the cloud and mobile space are expected to improve its performance.SAP's FinancialsSAP's reported first quarter revenues of €4.73 billion (~$5.21 billion) and an EPS of €0.64 (~$0.70). The market was looking for revenues of €4.82 billion (~$5.31 billion) and an EPS of €0.69 (~$0.76). The company blamed the shortfall in revenues to a delay in the Americas on the closure of deals. It claimed that deals that should have been signed during the quarter got pushed out to April of the year, thus leading to lower revenue in the first quarter and improving visibility of revenues in the current quarter.By segment, the Cloud and Software business grew 5% to €3,850 million (~$4,246.2 million). The growth was driven by a 35% increase in Cloud Subscriptions and Support revenues, which accounted for €677 million (~$746.7 million) in revenues. Software licenses and support revenues were flat at €3,172 million (~$3,498.4 million). SAP's services revenue grew 4% over the year to €877 million (~$967.2 million). SAP HANA continued to attract new customers. During the quarter, SAP added 500 new customers which included names like Benetton, Norton Rose Fulbright, Beiqi Foton Motor and Huaxin Cement.For the current year, SAP expects non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenues in the range of €2.95 billion-€3.05 billion (~$3.25 billion-$3.35 billion) on a constant currency basis. Overall, it expects to end the year with non-IFRS operating profits of €6.4 billion-€6.7 billion (~$7.04 billion-$7.38 billion) on a constant currency basis.SAP's Improving OfferingsSAP continues to launch several new offerings to attract the cloud and mobile market, which is expected by MarketsandMarkets to grow from $9.4 billion in 2014 to $46.9 billion by 2019. Earlier this month, it introduced SAP RealSpend, a new mobile app that provides visibility and access to up-to-the-minute budget and spending information. The app is based on the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, and it leverages the cloud to pull data from core financial reporting systems. It allows managers to perform spend analysis and other calculations on a real-time basis. It allows organizations to drill down to details so as to provide a detailed analysis on actual and future spend with regard to forecast and budget plans.It also entered into the digital advertising market with the launch of the SAP Exchange Media (SAP XM) platform, which is an integrated online media network to directly connect advertisers and publishers in the cloud. XM is based on the SAP HANA platform as well and will help advertisers acquire full transparency and control with end-to-end advertising return on investment analytics and real-time campaign management capabilities. It is expected to help deliver higher conversion rates through hyper-targeted advertising capabilities while improving efficiency of operation by simplifying the advertising process.Within the growing Internet of Things (IoT) segment, SAP released new offerings based on SAP HANA to connect devices to the enterprise to deliver improved insights. The IoT foundation bundle for SAP HANA will provide capabilities for IoT data management through services such as smart data streaming that will allow for data filtering, aggregation and correlation at scale. Other capabilities include remote data synchronization to guarantee data consistency, dynamic tiering to manage multi-tier database storage as per the value of the data, and IoT SIM management to allow cellular IoT device connectivity management with a user interface. According to IDC research the global IoT market is estimated to grow to $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $655.8 million in 2014. SAP is clearly targeting this high growth market.Within mobile, SAP also entered into an agreement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to build corporate apps that will work on Apple's mobile devices. It also will build a new software development kit that will allow corporate developers to build their own iOS apps for their organizations. The new software development kit will be powered by SAP's HANA database technology. The agreement will help Apple achieve its goal of improving its presence in the enterprise space while also allowing SAP to widen its customer base.SAP's stock is trading at $76.96 with a market capitalization of $92.2 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $81.24 in March this year, and has recovered from the 52-week low of $62.57 it had fallen to back in September last year. Analysts estimate a price target of $87.50 for SAP's stock."

Earlier this month, it entered into an agreement with Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) to launch the Internet of Things (IoT) foundation bundle for SAP HANA. As part of the collaboration, organizations will be able to leverage Vodafone's IoT connectivity platform to connect and manage devices, collect and shift data from the devices into the SAP HANA platform, and subsequently use this data to support predictive maintenance. Additionally, the service will incorporate Vodafone's device connectivity management to help with the aggregation of data from SIM-based IoT devices' status, rate plans, usage, and billing, and through an integrated dashboard will allow SAP users to manage global IoT deployments.Last month, SAP also announced the acquisition of Roambi, a California-based provider of mobile analytics. Roambi is a provider of mobile-centric analytics and data visualization tools. With the acquisition, SAP will be able to deliver to its customers mobile access to analytics. Roambi was built with a focus on delivering to a mobile and social world where data can be used to tell stories and can be analyzed freestyle.

As of today there are several players that are trying to get a slice from the pie. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) are just a few names.In view of all these companies there is another important player missing. It's the Germany based multinational software corporation SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). SAP is one of the worldwide leading companies that makes enterprise software for business operations as well as customer relations. The company generated in 2015 about EUR 20.8bn of revenues and operating earnings (EBITDA) of EUR 7.64bn (Margin of 36.73%).(Source: Thomson Reuters)New silver bullet diversifies the portfolio and brings the next growth-boosterCurrently I've visited the latest analyst conference of the company in the course of German CeBit, the world's largest and most international computer expo. The presentation was mainly focused on the new miracle weapon ""SAP S/4 Hana"", an in-memory, column oriented and relational database management system. Firstly the predecessor of ""S/4 Hana"" fitted hand in hand with the cloud systems of IBM and AMZN. Hence an own cloud-computing with as of today more than 3.200 clients was just the next logical step.These numbers foreshadow a huge potentialIn the first three months of the current fiscal year the cloud business grew by +33%. For comparison only: The total revenues increased by +5%. In the first quarter SAP gained more than 500 new customers for ""SAP S/4 Hana"". This is especially impressive due to the fact that almost 30% are completely new SAP clients. The main driver for the run on this product is the adoption of the ""SAP Hana Enterprise Cloud"" (HEC).As of today the cloud business means ""only"" a proportion of 11% of the total revenues. Thus there are fantastic opportunities to increase this booster. An increasing average amount of revenues with existing clients on the one hand, as well as the onboarding of completely new clients on the other hand looks to me in the case of SAP like a well pursued path.Here is the main reason, why SAP will profit much more than competitors willIn Germany we've got sometimes the somewhat sarcastic well-known saying ""once a SAP client, always a SAP client"". If the systems of SAP are integrated in a company's software landscape it's much more complicated and especially expensive to break up the business relationship than just give a few more bucks for an update.Thus, the relationship between SAP and its clients is really close and SAP has, because of its excellent diversified product portfolio, a moderate bargaining power. Like already mentioned the DAX listed Company can simply use its current customer relations just to place a new product. The mentioned growth-figures just show how successful this method works and probably will work for the next years."
3991276,98236,2016-07-25T16:34:00-04:00,"SAP reported results of its fiscal Q2, and the results were a considerable snap-back from the disappointing results of Q1.Most impressive to many is that SAP's transition to the cloud has not resulted in any fall-off in its traditional on-premise revenue.SAP has been able to grow its total revenue and its total operating income despite the stresses and the challenges posed by the transition to the cloud.SAP has a nominally higher valuation than does Oracle on some metrics, but it is growing, and Oracle has been shrinking.SAP is a company headquartered in Germany, and it will, for the foreseeable future, obtain a disproportionate share of its revenues from the EU and from Germany in particular.","Can dinosaurs find living space in a new world?About 65 million years ago, or so it is said, a comet impacted the planet somewhere in the vicinity of the Yucatan. The resulting ash and volcanic activity apparently caused an extensive cloud to cover the planet and caused significant cooling. The dinosaurs, as they were cold-blooded, were unable to survive the change in the environment, and all of them, with the possible exception of a sub-species such as birds and some reptiles like crocodiles, were swept to extinction. We, Homo sapiens, are apparently an indirect product of what is called the fifth great extinction.Honestly, what is going on in the IT world these days is of a ferocity little different than what is described as a great extinction event. In my time as both an industry observer and participant, I have seen mainframes and time sharing give way to mini-computers and then to networking with relatively dumb terminals, which was then supplanted by distributed data processing architectures and then client/server topologies followed by thin clients. There were always companies in the IT space that were rising and falling as the technologies changed, but for the most part, there were more companies being born than those on the cusp of extinction.I suppose that at some point in the future, business historians will date the great IT extinction event to 2006 when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) first decided to build a network for its own compute requirements and started to sell extra blocks of capacity to customers and christened the offering as Amazon Web Services. If ever there were a case of ""might oaks from little acorns grow,"" this would be a prime example. Here we are barely a decade into the transition, and leading industry consultant Gartner says that already $111 of IT spending/year has migrated from on-premise to the cloud and that the transition is actually accelerating with $216/billion of revenue moving from on-premise to the cloud by 2020. Gartner says by 2020, 100% of 1,000 enterprises will be using the cloud in whole or in part for their computing, and that by that year, something in excess of 90% of new applications will be deployed in the cloud.But unlike the geological mass extinction events, there are still some significant dinosaurs roaming the IT planet. For many years, there has been one of the great blood feuds of all time raging between SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Successful investing at one level is a matter of making choices. Many years ago, investors had a choice of buying either IBM (NYSE:IBM) or the seven dwarves. No prize for figuring out the right choice. Then, there were a host of mini-computer vendors with names that are less well-known these days than the long departed automobiles like Pierce-Arrow or Packard.Personally, I think I would try to avoid choosing between different dinosaurs. It isn't that they will not survive. After all, birds fill modern skies and they are apparently the descendants of dinosaurs. But there may be other choices in the IT world that might produce greater alpha.But many investors like to invest in dividend-paying companies with conservative financials and long operating histories. As I recently wrote, for my money, the best of those is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But for those who want to take a walk down memory lane to find an investment, the choice really boils down to IBM, Oracle and SAP. I have written recently regarding my views with regard to IBM and enough was said. So this time out, I will try to contrast and compare between Oracle and SAP and try to pick a winner in that confrontation. Just to relieve any aura of suspense, my conclusion is that despite its issues - and it has more than a few - SAP is likely to make its cloud transition with a bit less financial pain than is the case for Oracle. And to put the conclusion before the argument, the basic reason is that Oracle has a huge base of what is essentially an un-protectable underbelly in terms of its erstwhile semi-monopoly in the data base area, and while quantitative substantiation is lacking, it is likely that the continued decline in Oracle's on-premise license revenues is a function of the decline in that revenue source while SAP's S 4/Hana and its incorporated database will almost certainly enjoy increasing market share as the platform is gradually adopted.A very nice snap-back indeedI think that it is apparent that on balance, Q2 was for most software companies a much easier quarter in which to do business than was the first quarter of the year. That was particularly surprising for a company like SAP that is basically centered in Central Europe.SAP is a German company and it reports in euros. It also reports using the IFRS standard, which is essentially the same as US GAAP. Most of my comments are going to be based on non-IFRS and on euros using a constant currency growth rate. In some instances, that hasn't proven to be feasible, for which I apologize in advance.SAP reported its earnings on July 20, 2016. Just for the record, the results were a modest beat compared to prior expectations with EPS of E .82 compared to prior expectations of E .78. Earnings grew from E .80 in the 2015 period. I think what stands out in the operating results in two of the last three quarters including this one is that the company has been able to achieve growth in legacy license as well as rapid growth in the cloud, which has allowed it to achieve both top- and bottom-line growth in the midst of its transition. Cloud bookings rose by 33% in constant currency, but software license and support also rose by 7%. Cloud revenues in the last quarter were E 720 mil or $792 million out of total revenues of $5.3 billion. And so, total revenues grew by 9%, quite different than comparable results coming from Oracle. Cloud revenues for SAP were 15.1% of the total. SAP's cloud gross margins were 65%.Overall, operating profit grew by 11% in constant currency and was E 1.5 billion or $1.7 billion. The operating margin for SAP in the last quarter was 29%, up from about 28% in the 2015 period. The 2016 tax rate was 34.5%, which was up from 31% the prior year.Overall, the reaction to the operating performance and the guidance that SAP published and provided was positive. The consensus EPS forecasts increased by 6% this quarter and by 6% for the current year and by 9% for 2017. Since the day before the earnings release, the shares have appreciated by more than 6% and are at a high for the year. By comparison, the IGV, also now at a high for the year, rose 2%. Oracle's shares enjoyed about the same level of performance in the few days after the company released its numbers for its May ending quarter. On the other hand, the consensus earnings estimates for Oracle declined marginally. A bit of a ""puzzlement.""Comparable operating numbers for Oracle in its May ending quarter were total cloud revenue of $860 million, a growth rate of 51%. Overall total revenues of $10.7 billion, which were flat with the prior year, with operating profits of $4.8 billion, a 45% margin and also flat with the prior year. Oracle's tax rate for the quarter was 29.2%, approximately unchanged from the prior year. Cloud revenues for Oracle are about 8% of the total. Oracle's cloud gross margins were 40%.Unlike Oracle, which typically only forecasts one quarter at a time, this company forecasts both the next quarter and expectations for the full calendar year. At this point, SAP is forecasting a growth of 33% in terms of overall cloud revenues and for all software revenue to increase by 7% at the midpoint and to achieve a 3% increase in operating profits.The analyst consensus for SAP, which is based on the forecast of 14 analysts, is for revenue growth of 16% this year and 6% next year, and for EPS to grow by 15% this year and by 10% in 2018. The difference between SAP's forecast and that contained in the analyst consensus essentially reflects adjustments for currency impact. The analyst consensus is comparable to the analyst consensus for Oracle shown below while the company forecast is not.Comparable forecasts for Oracle, which cover its next 12 months through 5/31/17 and are based on analyst consensus estimates of 37 analysts, are as follows: revenue growth of 2.4% this year and 2.8% next year, and for EPS growth of 25% this year and by 9% in the year following.SAP's reported cash flow in dollars declined for the most part, falling from $5.3 billion to $4 billion over the past three years. The change in constant currency however is much smaller and now appears to be reversing. Some of the change in cash flow relates to revaluation of assets which has been not insignificant. Most of that relates to the decline in the dollar amount of GAAP net income and changes on the balance sheet. The results for this past quarter showed a growth of 5% in terms of operating cash. The growth was mainly a function of higher GAAP income and a reduction in the relationship between cash taxes and taxes reported on its income statement. That being said, the company does pay a significant level of cash taxes. Deferred revenue growth is modest.In Q2, the company's operating cash flow margin was 29%, flat with the prior year. The company had free cash flow for the period $2.5 billion-plus, more or less comparable to the $2.5 billion of 2015. At this point, and perhaps surprisingly, the company has not spent a lot of money on creating a massive cloud infrastructure.Cash flow is best measured by the year, I believe. SAP's cash flow for the year ended 12/31/15 was $4 billion (E 3.6 billion). The company's cash flow margin for the year was about 18%. Its free cash flow for the year was E 3 billion, up 9% compared to the prior year as capex declined by 14%.The company has been a serial acquirer over the years although Q2 was not a period of great activity in terms of M&A. The company pays a dividend, but the yield of 1.56% on the recently increased dividend is barely more than negligible. The most recent payout rate is 41%. As might be anticipated, the shares are mainly held outside of the US - the company is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany. US institutions hold 19% of the shares. A significant amount of the shares are still held by charitable institutions controlled by the original founders.Primarily as a function of the company's numerous and sometimes substantial acquisition, SAP has a net cash position of $4 billion, far less than would otherwise be the case.Some comparable data for Oracle are as follows: The company generated $3.7 billion of operating cash flow in its last reported quarter. That was down from year-earlier levels. Oracle's results are very seasonally weighted, and the last quarter was a Q4. The company sees maximum cash flows in Q1, minimum cash flows in Q2 and average cash flows in the two other quarters.Because of that, I will use annual figures carrying forward. For the year, the company generated $13.6 billion of operating cash flow, which was a decrease of about 6% from 2015. Cash flow margin was 36%, down from 37% in fiscal 2015. Oracle has managed to avoid heavy expenditures for the build out of its clout. CapEx was $1.1 billion last year compared to $1.3 billion the prior year. The historical free cash flow yield for fiscal 2016 was 9.2%.Oracle also pays a negligible dividend, which was not increased this past year. Its yield is 1.46, and its payout ratio is 29%. 87% of Oracle's shares are held by insiders (mainly Larry Ellison) and by institutions. The company has a net cash of $12 billion, most of it held outside the US. It has needed to borrow within the US to fund share buybacks and acquisitions.Lots of numbers - some analysis please!Oracle is 35% larger than SAP in terms of revenue. Oracle's market cap is 68% higher, and its enterprise value is 40% greater. SAP based on consensus earnings estimates as compiled by 14 US brokers has an estimated P/E of 19X while Oracle has a P/E of 15X. I should point out that SAP grew its IFRS (essentially GAAP) profitability by 81%. While that is not often the key point of an analysis, it will ultimately show up in terms of operating cash flow. SAP is growing quite a bit faster than Oracle although the rate of difference is obscured by constant currency adjustments. Oracle generates three times the cash flow of SAP.Oracle's profitability has meant that at times it can and has chosen to buy strategic businesses more aggressively than SAP, and I have every confidence that it will continue to utilize that tactic in the future. This is a very high-stakes game and Oracle will not go quietly into the night.Perhaps surprisingly, SAP has almost double the percentage of revenues coming from its rapidly growing cloud solution offerings compared to Oracle, and that is one of the principal factors in the company's higher growth rate and higher growth rate expectation when compared to Oracle. Lots of what SAP reports as cloud revenues come from its acquisitions - that was its cloud strategy for a while and it certainly has work to do in providing its users a soup to nuts suite of re-architected cloud applications. SAP bought some exceptionally strong cloud apps vendors, albeit at monster valuations. And the success of companies such as Ariba and Concur and particularly SuccessFactors has continued to grow at rapid rates since they have become part of SAP's suite of cloud offerings.The other major factor that is crucial in terms of the difference between SAP and Oracle is that SAP's legacy revenue sources are growing and ORCL's are shrinking. Oracle has the albatross of its hardware business and SAP does not. And Oracle's on-premise database business is falling significantly although the company does not report that metric specifically. SAP has a negligible amount of on-premise data base revenues.Clearly, Oracle is a significantly more profitable business than SAP. There are several factors that at least statistically explain Oracle's profitability advantage. One of these is that SAP has significantly lower gross margins on its sales of software and maintenance revenues. It also makes a very modest gross margin on services, particularly when compared to Oracle. And it spends much more in terms of ratios on both R&D and on sales and marketing. Last year, operating margins fell for SAP by more than 400 bps compared to the prior period. Overall, operating expenses rose from 73% of revenues in 2013 to 80% of revenues last year.SAP spends 26% of revenues on sales and marketing and it spends 14% of revenues on R&D. Oracle spends 21% of revenues on sales and marketing and 12% on R&D (non-GAAP). Although it is not often expressed this way, it would appear that the basic difference in profitability between Oracle and SAP is one of trading off expenses for growth. SAP is focused on achieving greater top-line growth and it does so by spending more on both development and marketing at the cost of operating margins.How do dinosaurs dance?I think the simplest answer is that dancing is not a skill readily learned by middle-aged vendors that have to both ensure the satisfaction of their large users with their massive installations and compete for new workloads in the cloud while trying all the while to maintain a reasonable level of profitability. I think that SAP has, over the years, been willing to pay a bit more, i.e. pay higher valuations and to acquire somewhat larger companies in the cloud overall and that is why its cloud revenues are comparable to those of Oracle despite being a significantly smaller company.Like many companies, SAP provides a slide deck to go with its earnings call. I think it is worth considering the numbers on the slide deck and compare them to consensus forecasts and overall valuation. The company describes its forecasts as ambitions. The company is forecasting operating profit ambition for 2017 of about E 6.9 billion at the midpoint and that is $7.6 billion translating at current exchange rates. For 2017, SAP is forecasting revenues of about E 23.3 billion or $25.6 billion at current €/$ exchange rates. Cloud subscription revenues at that point are expected to be about 17% of total revenues. Assuming that the ratios between operating profit and EPS remain consistent, SAP's forecast in EPS for 2017 works out to be $4.65, a bit less than the current consensus for the period.I'm inclined to believe that given the extreme macro uncertainties that certainly seem to be focused within the EU, the company's current forecast is likely based on overwhelmingly conservative expectations. Luka Mucic, CFO said:When looking at how dinosaurs dance, I think it is important to assess how nimble these beasts are. So far, the prize for nimbleness simply has to go to SAP at this point in its transition.SAP's management even took a shot at a projection for 2020. At that point, it is forecasting that cloud revenue will double from 2017 and will reach $E 7.8 billion or about 29% of total revenues. While cloud revenues are forecast to double in euros and grow by E 3.8 billion, total revenues are forecast to grow by E 3.7 billion, which implies that the company's legacy revenues will be flat over the period. That would be a profound accomplishment if it actually happens and is far different than Oracle's expectations, which are that its legacy business is going to continue to contract over the next few years.Dinosaurs dance far more effectively if they do not have to carry around obstreperous monkeys that bite and scratch. Oracle has to deal with its hardware business and its huge legacy cloud business, and it bites and scratches every chance it gets.By 2020, SAP's ""ambition"" forecast implies that EPS will reach about $5.80-6.00 at exchange rates comparable to present values. At this point, it is hard to imagine that Oracle is going to be able to achieve a 30% increase in EPS between now and its 2020 year. It is lot harder to increase operating margins from the level at which Oracle is already functioning than it is to take up operating margins that are at far lower levels at which SAP is currently operating, I believe.Why believe SAP and not believe Oracle? Does SAP have particular technology advantages or does it sell better? Where's the substance?I haven't got second sight. Is Bill McDermott of SAP congenitally more trustworthy than the folks running Oracle? I have no way of answering that. Mr. McDermott has had a career marked by success, initially in various sales capacities at Xerox (NYSE:XRX), then as president of Gartner and finally as VP of Sales at Siebel. Working in a senior role at Siebel would not necessarily be a position from which to observe the more honorable side of dealing with stakeholders. Those of us who had to cover that company... well listening to its guidance was one of the more fraught exercises even by the standards of the IT world. Tom Siebel was often rumored to be running for political office. Very few analysts thought he was unfitted for the role given that he had an almost inexhaustible store of self justification, and when the truth didn't suit his purpose, it got dropped by the wayside.Mr. McDermott has been a senior executive at SAP since 2002 during which time the company has had its share of ups and downs. Over the years, the company's track record in terms of meeting its forecasts is far from perfect. Was Mr. McDermott part of that process? I would be terribly surprised if on more than a few occasions he found it necessary to be economical with the truth. Like the GEICO ad says, it is what CEOs of IT companies do! If nothing else, it was no lay-down for Mr. McDermott, as American as is possible, to become the CEO of a very German enterprise. So, I do not necessarily suggest that Mr. McDermott has more or less credibility with me going back a decade or more than do the folks at Oracle.So why do I find it a bit easier to believe the longer-term forecasts made by SAP on its quarterly call while finding that Oracle presentation more or less completely strains my credulity? I really do think that carrying and chain of trying to defend its database turf is a bridge too far. There is just too much headwind to deal with. Too much SQL, too much Amazon Aurora, too much Microsoft. The numbers that have to be defended are just a task that would be worthy of the efforts of Hercules to clean out the Augean stables, and to use the line Lloyd Bentsen used with such great effect in a different presidential election season, Mark Hurd - who essentially runs sales at Oracle - is just not Hercules (And no, I am not old enough to claim that I knew Hercules). And if Oracle cannot maintain revenues from non-cloud software and maintenance at constant levels, it is simply not very likely to be able to show much if any growth over the years during which SAP is planning to achieve a revenue CAGR of between 6% and 7%.And why do I think SAP's mid-term ambitions are reasonable to use in computing a valuation. Firstly, SAP doesn't suggest, as does Oracle that it is going to need hyper-growth in the cloud to achieve its numbers. SAP is forecasting that its CAGR for cloud revenues is going to be about 28% and will reach close to E 8 billion by 2020 at which time it will be about 28% of revenues.Oracle's expectations - well they are harder to tell. I believe during the call that Mr. Ellison suggested that Oracle would achieve hyper-growth levels for several years into the future. What that means in dollars is hard to say. From time to time, Mr. Ellison is guilty of speaking about numbers without thinking first. But just to come within distance of what SAP's goal is, Oracle is going to have to achieve a CAGR of something above 40% for its cloud through 2020 and that is going to be very hard to achieve.The other matter is trying to compare what SAP is offering in the cloud versus what SAP calls its cloud offering. I don't think it is totally relevant to try to compare and contrast S/4HANA and the HANA Cloud Platform with the specifics of Oracle's products. But the big thing that needs to be understood here is that S/4Hana is an integrated business suite. If you want SAP's cloud applications, you are going to have to buy the database that supports those applications and that is SAP's HANA S/4. This is very, very different than the past world. Most SAP applications have run on Oracle databases since time out of mind. Over time, that will simply not be possible. This is going to be a process, and it isn't going to happen in a year or two, but it will happen. Oracle database is highly likely to lose share and some of that share is going to be absorbed by S/4Hana.So while I might not believe Bill McDermott's projections on their own, the strategy here is such that I think SAP has the cards specifically and the hand overall in order to ensure that it will outgrow Oracle for the next several years, regardless of how a quarter or two might work out. I have referenced a paper presented by the Managing Director of a firm called OXYA, a subsidiary of Hitachi. For readers with the interest to see what an industry has written about the future and how it is going to affect Oracle vs. SAP, this is an industry study that is completely accessible, I believe. And it has the further advantage of not being filtered by my poor brain. There are other articles and analysis that suggest Oracle's applications in the cloud are probably slightly ahead of what SAP offers and that SAP is committed to a more step-wise approach. I really do not think the specifics matter terribly much if the point of view is that of an investor and not an industry commentator.I think for readers, the likelihood is that SAP has done what it needs to do in order to ensure that the vast preponderance of its users will move with it into the cloud and not go with some competitive suite of cloud applications. Market share stability in applications, market share growth in data base and market share growth in some of the many products that can't be neatly categorized (Concur and Ariba are prime examples) mean to me that SAP is going to grow faster than Oracle. And if it can grow faster than Oracle, it is going to have the opportunities to leverage its growth into higher margins.I think the odds favor SAP achieving and quite possibly beating its ambitions both for 2017 and for 2020 as forecast in its slide presentation, and those goals will, I believe, achieve performance that is quite a bit superior to what Oracle is going to be able to achieve.Summing Up!I do not expect stack vendors to become extinct. Many software vendors have aspirations of building their own stacks and it is financial prudence to wish to do so. While both SAP and Oracle are often referred to as industry dinosaurs, that does not imply that they will become extinct. Some investors like to dance with dinosaurs. If that is a preference, I believe SAP is a more suitable dance partner."
3818256,98236,2016-01-19T11:53:08-05:00,SAP announced an exceptionally strong quarter to end a strong year.SAP enjoyed spectacular growth in cloud revenue of 75% in constant currency coupled with double-digit growth in software licenses.Company announced general availability of its Native Mode Cloud offering called S/4 Hanna which brings its product technology up to the latest of cloud standards.The company has stable and experienced management with a record of successful risk taking.The company is gaining significant market share from principal rival Oracle.,"Introduction:In the space of a little over two weeks, it appears that the world has turned over in terms of the consensus outlook for growth and economic activity. I have no intention of joining that debate. There are plenty of seasoned and intelligent commentators who have varying points of view as to what is in store for both the global economy and the stock market over the course of the coming weeks and months and years. I think my value add to such a discussion would be pretty minimal.But that said, even in commenting on the enterprise IT space in terms of the companies and their likely relative performance, one simply has to acknowledge that one wears different clothes when it's snowing outside than when the weather is warm and sunny or when there is a heat wave. If the barometer now reads stormy some of the picks I have presented are going to languish at best and not produce pretty performance, relative or any other way. When investors decide they want to become risk adverse, enterprise software names are not the first place that they look to find investment opportunities. Even the larger supposedly more stable names will be found to have unpleasant downside potential. As to the smaller names, regardless of their business performance, investors will tend to run away as fast as they can and the only performance to be had amongst that cohort of companies will come in the event that some might be acquired.I have no belief that we are approaching a scenario that is a reprise of 2008. I imagine that there are some financial institutions who have a raft of bad loans in the energy space but the interrelated web of complex derivative transactions in the mortgage markets that marked the debacle of that year seems to be absent. At least I hope that is the case. But if we are to have either a meltdown or simply a bumpy ride that winds up going nowhere, it behooves investors to rethink their strategy both overall, and particularly in the enterprise IT space for as long as they feel that such a period is going to last.In general, I think that it is hard to find names in the enterprise IT space that are really good investments in the midst of what is either a market correction or a reaction to an impending recession. It is hard to remember at this point, but in the dark, dim days at the end of 2008, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) shares sold for less than $17, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares were less than $15 and Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) shares were less than $8, representing peak to trough declines of 32% in 9 months, 55% in 16 months and 67% in 23 months, respectively. And two of these three companies, Oracle and Cisco, were already mature and were nowhere close to their all-time highs when they made their descents in 2008.During the stock market meltdown of 2008 there were simply no really decent places to hide to withstand the debacle within the enterprise software space unless one was fortunate enough own shares in companies that were acquired by either private equity funds or by strategic acquirers, always a random event and one that was far rarer than has recently been the case. Even the subject of this article, SAP (NYSE:SAP), which actually stands for Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing, experienced a share price decline of 45% from June 2008 to a February 2009 low.That being said, SAP shares do pay a dividend with a modest yield of 1.53% with a payout ratio of 43%. The company generates healthy cash flow that is modestly greater than its reported non-IFRS EPS (IFRS is the abbreviation in use for what is the equivalent of non-GAAP financial reporting that is in use in the EU). SAP is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, and uses European accounting standards and its reports are almost all based on non-IFRS metrics Similar to American companies that reconcile between GAAP and non-GAAP, SAP reports a reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS measures. I should also point out that as a European company, SAP reports results in Euros and not dollars. Most analysts simply convert Euros to dollars at current exchange rates.In the last year as the Euro has declined vis-à-vis the dollar, reported percentage changes have been enhanced for the company although not to such an extent that would change my conclusions or comparisons. For example, SAP has just reported that in the quarter that ended 12/31/15 it achieved a 16% increase in total revenues denominated in Euros along with a 15% growth in software license revenues denominated the same way. In constant currency, growth rates would have been 11% for both software and total revenues.By comparison, in its last reported quarter, Oracle reported a 6% decline in total revenues and an 18% decline in software license revenues. In constant currency, total revenues were flat and software license declined by ""just"" 12%. The performance gap is smaller in terms of constant currency, to be sure, but just not that much smaller as to change any conclusions for me.SAP has reported consistently reasonable revenue growth over the years, albeit some of it through strategic acquisitions. Non-IFRS P/E based on current analyst estimates for the current year 2016 is a bit greater than 18X. EV/S, again based on 2016 estimates, is about 4.5X. Obviously there are far ""cheaper"" dividend stocks or value stocks than SAP. But it represents a middle ground within the software investment universe.Investment Thesis:SAP is the largest European-based software vendor with a dominant market position in the market for enterprise applications in central and eastern Europe and it also enjoys a leading market position within the Asia/Pacific region in that category. It is rapidly improving its market position in the US although I think it is probable that Oracle remains the largest application vendor in this country, but no longer by an overwhelming margin. Overall, with about $22 billion in annual revenues, SAP is the world's third largest software vendor and is clearly the most rapidly growing of that triad.Simply put, my investment thesis is that among the three largest software vendors, SAP will continue to outgrow the other two in terms of revenues by a significant and underappreciated margin and that over time, there is a significant upside potential to increase profitability. I believe the company to be effectively run and for a company of its size it has proven to be nimble and willing to take the chances that are necessary to maintain and enhance its position. As I wrote, SAP may not have the classical metrics of a value name. It does, however, have metrics that recommend it to investors looking for GARP characteristics and it certainly has the opportunity to accelerate its growth if it continues to execute, particularly with its relatively new HANA Cloud offering.SAP announced a substantial upside surprise in terms of both revenues and EPS from prior projections and from company guidance on January 11, 2016, in stark contrast to the earnings release of Oracle in mid-December. For the full year, the company had 18% revenue growth and more than doubled its cloud bookings. What was particularly significant to many, including this observer, was that unlike Oracle, SAP was able to almost double its cloud revenues and bookings while still achieving double-digit growth in license revenues although operating margins did fall by more than 200 basis points due to lower gross margins on cloud revenues. Management was reasonably conservative regarding full-year 2016 guidance which restrained share price performance in the wake of the preliminary earnings announcement and which has set up the opportunity for the company to substantially exceed estimates as was the case last year or to achieve what now appears to be conservative estimates should the world slither into a recession.There are many factors accounting for SAP's performance vis-a-vis Oracle. Of course one important factor is that SAP, for the most part, is not lumbered with a major business selling data bases and data integration tools. SAP does have an in-memory database appliance, HANA, but that is a relatively small revenue contributor with relatively new technology and is not under attack from new open source technologies such as Hadoop. If nothing else, Oracle has about one-third of its revenues coming from a product segment whose long-term revenue outlook, at best, is flat and which is most probably declining. It's really hard to run a decent race if one of your feet is encased in cement and tethered to the ground.I think another factor that has distinguished the two companies for many years is that SAP has chosen to reinvest at far greater rates than Oracle. SAP has non-IFRS operating margins of about 36% and Oracle has non-GAAP operating margins of 41% and that 41% includes the lingering drag from the Sun acquisition. Both companies are suffering from margin drag that is the product of the transition to a cloud-based business model. But I imagine that the effect is about the same for both vendors. It is particularly hard to tell the specifics of margins when companies like these are consolidating significant acquisitions and when they are in the midst of extensive transitions to a new business model. That being said, however, I do not think that the difference represents some magic efficiency on the part of Oracle. I do think it represents a conscious decision by SAP management to invest proportionately more of its revenues into a variety of activities that have led to better user satisfaction.Another factor, I believe, is that SAP has embraced a more aggressive acquisition strategy in recent years. It has proven to be willing to pay rather substantial premiums and valuations to acquire companies that are best of breed applications providers in various business segments so long as their models have been totally based on a cloud business model. Furthermore, it has been willing to spend what has been necessary to integrate the acquired product offerings into the HANA platform. SAP has also adopted a product strategy that promises to allow users more choices and access the best of breed suppliers who can utilize the HANA platform. I also would credit the current management team lead by Bill McDermott with being a bit nimbler and more responsive to the requirements of transitioning to the cloud than Oracle's team has been.By most standards, SAP has been late to totally embrace the cloud. That being said, along the way, SAP has been willing to spend, and spend lavishly, to acquire some best of breed cloud participants that are market leaders in their niches including companies such as SuccessFactors, Concur and Ariba among others. It has been willing to pay up to insure its market position and that willingness is seemingly paying off in current period operating results.According to some, the company has done a better job than its principal competitor, Oracle, in what is called ""transformational integration."" It would be presumptuous on my part to attempt to evaluate such claims - there are many services and consultants who write about these topics. I would suggest that my own reading indicates that the preponderance of those who do write and take positions on the issue would appear to favor SAP's efforts in the field of transformational integration. but to be honest, consultant reports are weasel worded much of the time and rarely are particularly definitive.Transformational integration offers users open APIs (application programming interfaces) and also includes hundreds of predefined and packaged business process integration adapters. SAP also offers users quite a bit of flexibility for such a large company in terms of putting together offerings that allow its customers to move readily to the ""true"" cloud or to move to what are characterized by some as hybrid offerings. The newest SAP cloud release allows users to move their existing SAP applications to what it describes as its SAP S/4 HANA that is completely SaaS in terms of its technology or users can elect to use a managed services option where SAP acts as an application hosting provider.I really have no completely comprehensive or unbiased way of determining whether or not SAP has a significant technological edge on Oracle in terms of its cloud transformation and the ability of its installed base to move to the cloud seamlessly. That being said, however, the latest quarterly reports for both companies going back now for several quarters speak loudly and eloquently to what is happening in the field. SAP is clearly continuing to grow its revenues and Oracle's revenues are either shrinking or stagnating. While the reasons for these trends may not be completely apparent, even in hindsight, the results certainly speak for themselves.While Oracle has higher operating margins than SAP by about 500 basis points, a forward P/E based on consensus estimates of 12X which is a third below that of SAP and an EV/S of 3.5X thus appearing significantly less expensive statistically, it is my contention that the faster top-line growth that SAP has had and is likely to continue to have, coupled with unrealized but substantial operating margin opportunities the company can achieve as its cloud revenues mature, make its shares the better value. If the stock market continues to pull back it would be naive to believe that SAP will not follow suit. If European economies in particular deteriorate at substantial rates, it is hard to believe that SAP will not feel some significant impact. But SAP has built what appears to this observer to be a winning portfolio of best of breed cloud solutions and it would appear to be further along a more successful cloud transition when compared to Oracle. I think the extra points of P/E and of EV/S are well worth it and that the better product and marketing position that SAP enjoys today make it a better defensive name than many appreciate.Background:Although SAP is the third largest software company in the world with revenues approaching $22 billion and an enterprise value of $98 billion, it is not as well-known among American investors as might be expected because it is a European-based company. Despite its size, only 11 American banks carry coverage on the company compared to about 35 analysts publishing estimates for Oracle. Of course, many European brokerages cover the company that are not covered by the Thomson/First Call survey and overall I doubt that the shares are really under followed. I do believe, nonetheless, that the shares and the company are less well known by American investors than other companies of its size and position. I also suspect that the concentration of share ownership in Europe probably has led to what I might describe as a bit of a scarcity premium that is unlikely to abate at any time in the foreseeable future. Europe simply hasn't the size and depth of the tech sector we have here and SAP is one of the few companies in the sector with a leadership position that is of both adequate size for most European institutions and which has achieved significant growth stretching back over an extended period. As a result, it is my belief that European institutions are more attracted to the name in the absence of good, European-based alternatives.SAP shares are rated a 2.1 by the company's coverage universe in the US, probably just a bit above average in the software world. The mean price target for the next 12 months is around $85 which is just a bit more than 10% higher than current quotations. I tend to take average price targets with more than a small grain of salt as analysts, for the most part, are going to use company guidance in setting their own expectations as opposed to making their own estimates.Company management is forecasting very modest growth in 2016 suggesting it is either extremely concerned about the global economy or that it is concerned that the transition to cloud will go less well this year than it did in 2015 when it achieved license revenue growth of 11% in constant currency along with cloud revenue growth of 75% on the same basis. I can't speak with any voice of authority regarding the global economy. If growth deteriorates significantly compared to current consensus estimates as some observers are suggesting, then SAP's financial attainment really will be constrained. SAP sells capital goods to large global companies. There has been and will continue to be a significant level of correlation between the performance of all large software vendors such as SAP and growth in the global economy.On the other hand, if the economy doesn't further deteriorate I would really be surprised to see SAP grow its revenues by less than 5% in constant currency after growing it by 11% in constant currency during 2015. Indeed, if top line growth were going to be depressed by a swing of material consequence to a cloud model, I would be hard put to see how operating margins would expand to the point where the company could grow EPS by greater than 10% which is the current consensus based on the new guidance. SAP's forecasting is not renowned for its accuracy and indeed its forecasting performance this past year was all over the lot and trendless. On a constant currency basis I would expect that SAP would continue to achieve double-digit revenue growth and that earnings growth would be faster than revenue growth. I think the current high estimate for $4.52 for EPS is far more likely to be achieved than the current consensus of $4.18.SAP was founded in April 1972 by five software engineers who had worked for IBM (NYSE:IBM) and one of its founders Hasso Plattner remains chairman of the enterprise after more than 40 years. Since 2010 the company's CEO has been Bill McDermott. McDermott, a former head of SAP worldwide sales, became Co-CEO with Jim Hagemann Snabe when they were brought in to replace the failed tenure of Leo Apotheker who went onto have an infamous tenure at Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ).SAP became an important player in the enterprise software space in the early 1990s when it developed its R3 suite of integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications that ran in a ""client-server"" environment. The company established a presence in North America in the late 1980s in the wake of winning Dow Chemical as a major client. For more than 10 years from that point, SAP was a hyper-growth story rising from insignificance to become essentially either the leading enterprise application player or a close second to arch rival Oracle. Partially as the result of exchange rate fluctuations, the US has become the largest single revenue contributor for SAP with total revenues of just below 1.7 billion Euro in the past quarter, or almost 34% of the company's total, up 41% year over year, obviously influenced significantly by the rise of the dollar against the Euro. Germany, the company's second largest ""geo,"" had revenues of 685 million Euro during the quarter which was year-over-year growth of 7%. It's more than apparent that despite the masking effects of currency on the company's performance, SAP was able to take significant market share from Oracle in Oracle's home market both in Q3 and for all of 2015.SAP finally rewrote its R3 applications to the Hana platform and what it calls SAP S/4 Hanna was released several months ago. The CEO described the project as a ""moonshot"" and while I'm not going to attempt to get involved in attempting to describe the specifics of the technology, it was certainly a huge undertaking and surely will define the company's direction in terms of product for years to come. While there are analysts who are forecasting that the adoption of a real cloud offering will spike SAP's top-line growth to 30% or more for a number of years, I would be surprised if that will really happen and I don't think it's necessary for it to happen in order to suggest that SAP will handily outgrow Oracle for the foreseeable future.SAP has been a hyper acquisitive company for the past 20-plus years although it has made no acquisitions since it spent $8.3 billion buying Concur Technologies which was the leader in web-based travel and expense management in 2014. In all SAP has made no fewer than 59 acquisitions of varying sizes and it would be surprising to me if the company did not make one or more significant acquisitions to cover what it perceives as product holes or to acquire opportunistically in the current year.About a year ago, rumors circulated that SAP was interested in acquiring Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). The rumors were denied at that time and indeed CRM now has a market cap that has about reached the price that was rumored to be what SAP was willing to offer. I think, simply given the math, that it's highly unlikely that SAP would either want to make an offer to acquire CRM or would be in a position to fund such an acquisition if it really wanted to take what would be a complete leap into the dark.It would be both presumptuous and not feasible to evaluate all of the company's acquisitions. Concur would appear to have been expensive from a financial perspective and certainly SuccessFactors was far from cheap. That being said, SAP's objective was to cover the cost of these and other acquisitions from revenue synergies and to insure that the company got its feet wet in addressing cloud opportunities. At least in the case of SuccessFactors I believe the bet has more than paid off. CEO Bill McDermott is a strong believer in revenue synergies and he has made that strategy pay for this company. To the extent that the equity markets are sloppy this year and the IPO markets refuse to award enterprise software companies with premium valuations, I would expect that SAP would pick up the pace of its acquisition activity.Just for the record, besides Concur, the company also has bought SeeWhy, which is a company that specializes in what is called behavioral target marketing, Ariba, which is a web based supplier exchange, Sybase, which had been known for both its database engine but more importantly as a vendor of middleware and as a pioneer in the mobile software platform space, SuccessFactors, which was the leading web-based talent management platform, and Business Objects, which was one of the leaders, if not the leader, in the business intelligence space.With all of those acquisitions there might be temptation to brand SAP a roll-up. But the fact remains the company's technology heartland was R3 and is now S/4 HANA, both internally developed. Interestingly, despite the fact that this is a German company, the largest of SAP's development centers these days is in Bangalore, India, and it has not been slow to leverage opportunities to move what jobs it could from high cost geos such as Germany, in particular, to places such as India over the past decade or so.Investment Summary:SAP is a classic GARP story that is apparently experiencing a significant resurgence in growth having significantly over-attained both internal targets and company expectations as detailed in its ""pre-earnings"" release of January 11, 2016. Despite the significant upside reported, the company's shares did not move greatly because of quite cautious guidance provided by company management coupled with weak equity markets during the past week. The company is significantly outperforming its principal rival, Oracle, both as a stock but also as an operating business, clearly taking significant market share over the past several quarters. In addition, the company recently launched its native cloud platform that some anticipate will further accelerate the company's growth. While SAP is certainly not a deep value story, it does pay a significant dividend and continues to improve its operating and free cash flow metrics.Given the very modest guidance this company has forecast and the concomitant modest growth expectations of analysts, I think that SAP shares represent a reasonably defensive commitment for investors if 2016 turns out to be a disappointing year in both the real economy and in investment world."

[1] Steve Singh, head of the newly created Business Network division for cloud-based corporate procurement services, called it a $75 billion opportunity in the form of fees on facilitating purchase of trillions of goods and services.Corporate procurement services is a lucrative market that's already served by software bigwigs like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Research firm Frost & Sullivan estimates that the B2B online retail market will grow to $6.7 trillion by 2020 due to rapid adoption of online purchasing platforms. [2] Corporate procurement service providers stand to make billions of dollars in fees by providing cloud-based platforms and management services to facilitate such online purchases by big companies.We have a price estimate of $78 for SAP, which is about 10% higher than its current market price.Building Upon SAP's Transition to CloudSAP has invested heavily in recent years to adapt to the ongoing transition from on-premise to cloud-based software. Its latest ERP platform, the SAP S/4HANA, also is optimized for cloud, on-premise and hybrid deployments. The company spent nearly $20 billion in acquisitions designed to expedite its entry into cloud computing. These acquisitions included ecommerce specialist Ariba, contract staffing firm Fieldglass and staff travel and expenses manager Concur. These acquisitions are now planned to be combined into a single ""Business Network"" for procurement services. According to SAP, the Business Network generated over $1 billion in revenues and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% through 2020.Further, SAP already has an existing customer base, which uses its Resource Planning and Supply Chain Management software. The company is likely to attempt to cross sell its new procurement services to such customers. By leveraging its existing customer base, SAP plans to create a network of preferred B2B suppliers for corporate purchases, which may result in lower costs for its customers.This strategy will give SAP a leg up against smaller competitors in the new market. However, it is worth noting that SAP will have its work cut out for itself as it will also face competition from software behemoths like Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Moreover, SAP will face competition not just from software vendors but also from companies like China's Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which is a pioneer of B2B ecommerce and already has a gross merchandize value of over $27 billion. [3]Margin Buffer in Low-Margin Cloud Computing EraSAP has maintained a commendable gross margin of around 80% for its software products as far back as 2008. This status quo is likely to change in the cloud computing era, which is characterized by aggressive pricing and intense competition from large and small players alike. In short, services businesses do not command software's rich margins. Therefore, it is widely feared that SAP may not be able to retain its high margins for much longer.In such a paradigm, the corporate procurement services business has the potential to provide a buffer for the overall margins of the company. The cloud computing industry has far lower margins than the 30% operating margins historically maintained by SAP. Thus, the higher-margin Business Network could prove crucial in protecting SAP's margins as it transitions to a cloud computing company.Disclosure: No positions."
3240666,56952,2015-06-07T03:20:18-04:00,"SAP announced ambitious mid-term financial goals in January this year.Cloud- and software revenue increased significantly in the first quarter.SAP's growth case is very strong for the next five to ten years.Based on a DCF valuation model, I find that SAP trades at a fair price.","From time to time, new global trends show up. This is also the case for the stock market and investment environment. Nowadays, 'cloud' seems to be the magical word for investors. Almost every respected name in technology is in some way involved in cloud services. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are several familiar stocks that are known for their fast growing cloud business. Therefore, investors should not ignore the trend of cloud services. SAP (NYSE:SAP) is another company that reported triple digit revenue growth of its cloud business. In this article, I will argue that cloud related business will be an important factor for the company's future growth. Further, I find that SAP trades at a fair price using a DCF valuation model.Originally, SAP is a German application and software-related service provider. The company offers integrated enterprise-wide systems to its customers. SAP also offers Big Data and cloud solutions through its SAP HANA platform. In the first three months of 2015, SAP reported total cloud related revenue of $558 million (€503 million) compared to just $232 million (€209 million) in 2014. To put this performance in perspective, Salesforce.com reported total sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter ended April 30, 2015. Salesforce.com is, unlike SAP, primarily a cloud driven company. Considering that SAP was able to generate more than a third of cloud related revenue compared to Salesforce.com, it is fair to say that SAP's cloud business has become a business to be reckoned with.According to SAP's latest mid-term financial outlook, the company aims to grow cloud related revenue even further to $4 billion (€3.96 billion) in 2017 and $8.8 billion (€8 billion) in 2020. SAP's cloud related revenue was just $1.2 billion (€1.1 billion) in 2014. Not surprisingly, SAP's cloud business will be the fastest growing business segment in the period 2015-2020. Next to strong revenue growth, SAP aims to improve its operating profit as well. The company expects operating profit to be around $7.4 billion (€6.7 billion) in 2017 and $9.4 billion (€8.5 billion) in 2020. For the full-year 2014, SAP reported a total operating profit of $4.8 billion (€4.3 billion).DCF valuation modelSo, it is clear that SAP will be growing quite fast in the next five to ten years, based on the company's outlook. This outlook is supported by strong results in the first quarter of 2015 as well. It is interesting to find out whether the market already priced in the company's growth prospects or not. To determine SAP's fair value, I drafted a DCF valuation model below. First, I analyzed SAP's free cash flow, based on historical earnings information and outlook for 2015 to determine the initial cash flow for my DCF model (see table 1 below).Table 1: Free cash flow analysesFor fiscal year 2015, I expect total net revenue of $22.4 billion, a gross operating margin of 24% and income from operations of $5.4 billion. Considering the average cash flow from operations to income from operations and capital expenditures, I estimated SAP's free cash flow to be around $3.7 billion in 2015. The estimated free cash flow in 2015 will be the basis cash flow number in my model.Table 2: Determination of the WACCThe second variable in my model is SAP's weighted average cost of capital (hereafter referred to as WACC). For the determination of the WACC, I normalized the free risk rate to a constant 3.5% because of the high volatility in interest rates lately. Based on my calculation (see table 2 above), I find that SAP's WACC is 8.35%. Further, I made the following assumptions:My DCF valuation model consists of a two-stage growth scenario. Considering SAP's mid-term financial outlook and high growth of the cloud business, I assumed free cash flow to grow 10% for the years one through five. For the years six through ten, I moderated the growth rate to 7.50%. The terminal growth rate was set at 2.00%. Further, my model consists of the following assumptions:Based on these assumptions and a WACC of 8.35%, my DCF valuation model indicates SAP's fair value to be around $75 per share, slightly above the company's current share price (see DCF model below):Table 3: DCF valuation modelConclusionSAP has an attractive business model and relies on its cloud business to support future growth. I am confident that the company will be successful integrating its SAP HANA platform with both existing and new customers. Therefore, SAP will grow revenue, operating income and free cash flow quite fast in the next ten years. However, I find that this high growth perspective is already priced by the market. SAP's fair value of $75 per share is just 1.8% above its current share price. Therefore, SAP's upside potential should come from additional growth, for example the company's software licensing business.The company does not depend on cloud services alone. I consider SAP a solid company with a proven and diversified business model. Therefore, I favor this stock over pure cloud plays like Salesforce. The company also pays a nice dividend yielding 1.6%. Further, SAP's free cash flow is likely to more than double in the next ten years. Combined with a strong balance sheet and relatively modest capital expenditure, SAP should be able to grow its dividend for years to come. All considered, I find that SAP is a good investment."
3961773,50662,2016-03-29T16:45:47-04:00,"SAP's 2015 was an excellent year and an ideal stepping stone for 2016 and beyond.The free cash flow was lower than I expected, but this was caused by a non-recurring accounting adjustment.SAP will be a monster by 2020 as it wants to increase the operating profit by almost 50% before the end of this decade.","In October, I explained I missed the run-up in SAP's (NYSE:SAP) share price and I was wondering if it made sense to chase the company's run and buy the stock anyway. I decided not to, but kept an eye on SAP to make sure I would be able to pick up some stock during potential weak moments. Unfortunately that hasn't happened yet, so maybe I should re-think my options but I first wanted to check up on SAP's health.SAP data by YChartsA lot of free cash flow, but not as much as I was expectingIn the previous article, I was quite pleased with what I saw, but it's obviously always wise to double-check the preliminary numbers with the financial results of the entire financial year.SAP's 2015 was excellent, and I would even dare to use the description 'impressive'. The total revenue increased by 18% to 20.8B EUR ($23.4B) and this strong growth was caused by a very strong performance in the company's 'cloud and software' division which saw its revenue increase by a stunning 20%, indicating SAP is heading in the right direction with its cloud services! The service revenue also increased by 10% but this only contributed 10% of the total revenue increase.Source: financial statementsOf course, the expenses associated with the cloud-model also increased, but it's important to emphasize the margins remained quite stable and the operating expenses didn't increase at a faster rate than the revenue. The total operating profit was however a bit lower in 2015 compared to 2014. That wasn't 'bad' as the operating profit fell by just 2% and a lot seems to have been caused by non-recurring events and investments in SAP's future.The restructuring expenses increased by a factor of 5 to almost US$700M but the company also spent more cash on sales and marketing (+26%) and R&D (+22%). So, yes, a lower operating profit isn't really great to see, but even if you'd just exclude the restructuring expenses and ignore the fact the higher marketing expenses will result in an increased revenue from this year on, the operating profit would have increased by 9.6% so you shouldn't really judge a book by its cover and try to find out what really caused a disappointing result. Due to a higher interest expense (due to the acquisition of Concur last year), the after-tax result fell by 7% to $3.4B.That's nice, but in my previous article I was predominantly focusing on SAP's cash flow, and I said I was expecting the company to generate a full year free cash flow of 3.5B EUR (or approximately $3.9B). And this is where my head-scratching moment started.Source: financial statementsAccording to the cash flow statements, SAP generated an operating cash flow of 3.64B EUR ($4.1B) and spent 640M EUR ($720M) on capital expenditures, resulting in a free cash flow of just 3B EUR. That's lower than expected, and even after adjusting this result for changes in the company's working capital position, the adjusted free cash flow was still just 3.2B EUR ($3.6B). What went wrong? Did I do something wrong? Were my assumptions too optimistic.It took me a few minutes before I realized why my expectations were almost 10% higher than the effective result. Even though the tax bill for FY 2015 was just 929M EUR ($1.04B), SAP reported a net cash outflow to pay taxes of 1.4B EUR ($1.57B). That's partly due to the higher tax bill of FY 2014 (which was paid during FY 2015) as well as SAP reducing the deferred tax liabilities. If I would apply the 'real' tax on the free cash flows, the adjusted free cash flow would be 3.68B EUR ($4.12B), or approximately 5% higher than my expectations. Problem solved!The guidance for FY 2016 looks quite promising!SAP seems to be very optimistic about its cloud-focused business division as it expects another (non-IFRS) revenue increase of approximately 30% compared to 2015 in the cloud subscriptions and support area. The total cloud and software revenue will increase by 6-8% (which should be 1.2B EUR ($1.35B) according to my expectations) whilst the operating profit will also increase to 6.4-6.7B EUR. The mid-point of this guidance would be an increase of 3% compared to the previous financial year.Source: presentationAs the capital expenditures won't increase as fast, I would expect the total free cash flow to increase from 3.68B EUR in FY 2015 to at least 3.8B EUR ($4.36B) based on what we know now.SAP Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsInterestingly enough, SAP also feels sufficiently confident to also already provide a guidance for 2017, where it expects its revenue to increase to in excess of 23B EUR ($26B) with an operating profit of almost 7B EUR ($7.85B). This would put the company on track to generate an operating profit of 8-9B EUR ($10B) by 2020 and have a very strong impact on the company's cash flow numbers, paving the way for a further dividend increase after having increased the FY 2015 dividend by 5%.Investment thesis2015 was a very strong year for SAP, and I like the way the company is delivering on its ambitious growth plans for 2020. The company sounds very optimistic for 2016 and 2017, so it's not unlikely the weakness in the company's share price might never happen.Instead, I might be better off by writing a put option on SAP, and I'm still hesitating between writing an in the money put and an out of the money put option. But perhaps it would be a better idea to write two options, and then I'd probably prefer to write a P70 and a P80, both expiring in September of this year. I should be able to receive an option premium of $1.7 and $5 which would result in an average acquisition cost of just over $71 should I be assigned to purchase the 200 underlying shares.SAP is on its way to become a monster and it looks like nothing will stop it."

IoT is the concept of connecting any device, ranging from a refrigerator to components of industrial machinery, to the Internet. IoT is widely considered to be the next big thing in emerging technologies and the stage is set for its explosive growth. [1]To capitalize on this opportunity, SAP has teamed up T-Systems for providing cloud-based connected logistics solutions. [2] SAP also partnered with Jasper, a leading vendor of IoT services platform, for simplifying the process of deploying and managing IoT services globally. [3] Lastly, SAP has joined the Industrial Internet Consortium, an open membership organization aimed at accelerating the commercial proliferation of IoT. [4]We currently have a price estimate of $78 for SAP SE, which is around 15% higher than its current market price.SAP And T-Systems: Connected LogisticsSAP has entered into an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement for connected logistics with T-Systems, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. SAP and T-Systems previously collaborated to provide a cloud-based logistics solution ""smartPORT"" for the Hamburg Port Authority in Germany. Through the new agreement, SAP and T-Systems will jointly offer smartPORT logistics globally. The smartPORT logistics networking solution is based on SAP's Connected Logistics software and T-Systems' Connected Car solution. The offering is targeted at not just ports, but also other logistics hubs such as airports, parcel distribution centers and production sites.SAP and Jasper: Internet of Things ServicesSAP has partnered with Jasper, a leading provider of software-as-a-service platform for IoT, for deploying and managing IoT services. As part of the collaboration agreement, the Jasper Control Center platform will be integrated with the SAP HANA platform for simplifying the deployment of IoT services and shortening the time to launch, manage and monetize IoT services. The Jasper Control Center automates the life cycle of IoT services, and its integration with SAP HANA will provide big data capabilities to customers for analyzing service subscription and usage data.SAP and Industrial Internet Consortium: Accelerating IoT in BusinessSAP has joined the Industrial Internet Consortium (NYSE:IIC), which aims at accelerating and promoting the business use of IoT as part of an initiative called Industry 4.0. IIC was formed just last year by a group of global conglomerates, including the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and GE (NYSE:GE). SAP, which has been a major proponent of Industry 4.0, will work with 140 other IIC members to deliver use cases, test beds, reference architectures and frameworks and security for IoT applications.This move is more of a win for IIC than for SAP as IIC will gain an important partner in its drive for interoperability among customers. On the other hand, SAP will join the group leading the bid for accelerated adoption of IoT for business and may gain technological advantages from the collaborative movement.Internet of Things: The Next Big Thing?According to Gartner's annual Hype Cycle report, the Internet of Things overtook big data as the most hyped technology in 2014. Forecasts for the market size and adoptability of IoT differ greatly, but the potential is universally agreed to be immense. Estimates for market size by 2020 range from a mere $300 billion [5] to an incredible $7 trillion. It should be noted that the huge difference between the estimates may be partly due to use of different definitions of Internet of Things by researchers.SAP already has a presence in the Internet of Things market and offers a number of solutions for businesses. This includes Predictive and Maintenance Service, Connected Logistics, Connected Manufacturing and Augmented Reality Apps. Its latest partnerships will accelerate its revenue stream from IoT services, although it may be a while before significant incremental revenues materialize.Disclosure: No positions."

Providing an excuse previously given by a few hundred other enterprise software firms (give or take), the company blames deal slippage (in the Americas particularly). Also, with SAP reporting in euros, forex went from being a tailwind in Q4 to a headwind in Q1. Revenue growth was 5% Y/Y as reported and 6% excluding forex. In Q4, the figures were 16% as reported and 11% excluding forex (earnings release).Still, there was a growth slowdown even in constant currency. The culprit: traditional software license revenue fell 13% Y/Y (as reported) to €610M. Quite the change from Q4's 15% growth, and a sign cloud software adoption is now having a big impact on SAP's license sales - arch rival Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) traditional license sales fell 15% Y/Y in its February quarter. Cloud subscription/support revenue remained strong, rising 33% to €680M. Cloud bookings rose 22% to €140M (Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for bookings), and software support revenue grew 5% to €2.56B.On the bright side, over 500 additional customers were added for the S/4HANA platform (involves running SAP's core ERP apps on its popular Hana in-memory database), bringing the total count above 3,200. And full-year guidance for 6-8% cloud/software sales growth in CC is reiterated, as is 2016 operating profit guidance. No need to rush to cut guidance after a bad quarter when there are three left (including seasonally big Q4).BlackBerry preps two mid-range Android phones, admits Priv costs too much - John Chen's remarks about enterprise customers calling the Priv (currently goes for $650 unsubsidized at Wal-Mart, after starting at $700) too expensive raise a big question: Why hasn't BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) significantly cut the Priv's price?Given manufacturing cost estimates for other high-end smartphones, it's unlikely the Priv costs more than $250 or so to produce. BlackBerry could presumably sell the device for $450-500 and still reap a decent gross profit. It's possible a big price cut will be announced soon, and/or that BlackBerry has refrained from quickly announcing one out of fear of angering initial Priv buyers.The BlackBerry Priv, slide-out QWERTY keyboard and all.As for the mid-range phone efforts, Samsung has begun competing more aggressively in the low-end and mid-range Android markets, and other Asian OEMs such as Xiaomi (XI), Huawei, Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), and Micromax (all of which have more scale than BlackBerry) also loom large. However, BlackBerry might be able to create an enterprise niche with its proprietary Android UI and privacy/security features, and (assuming one of the new phones has a keyboard) win over some lingering QWERTY enthusiasts.The company sold just 600K phones in the February quarter, and has said it will exit phones if it can't turn a profit on them. Chen has promised phone profits by September. Stay tuned.Marketo jumps following report of ""strategic interest"" from Microsoft and SAP - There was a lot of speculation back in 2013 that SAP would bid for Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO), a cloud marketing (advertising) automation software firm that's currently worth $982M, in response to acquisitions of Marketo peers by Oracle and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Maybe SAP was just waiting for Marketo's multiples to compress.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might have some use for Marketo as well. The company has been seeing strong growth for its Dynamics CRM Online cloud apps, which Marketo's software would complement. If SAP and Microsoft bid for Marketo, whoever loses out might turn its sights on Marketo rival HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), currently worth $1.46B and recently the subject of a less-than-flattering book from writer/ex-employee Dan Lyons.Re/code: Google, Facebook, and Twitter looked at Yahoo, but have little interest - Come for the banker-paid lunches, stay for the chance to look at a rival's books (while feigning M&A interest). Shortly after the WSJ reported Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is among the companies weighing bids for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), Re/code says it's just a case of Google M&A exec Don Harrison ""poking around, as his job demands, including taking meetings and trying to grok if there is any part of Yahoo that Google might like to have.""To be fair, there are specific Yahoo assets that might appeal to Google/Facebook/Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), if they became available by themselves. For example, Google and Twitter might care to bid for Tumblr, or Google for online video ad platform BrightRoll. But the odds of any of the companies caring to digest Yahoo in full and deal with all of its current problems seem pretty low. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), on the other hand, appears to have a serious interest. The U.K.'s Daily Mail is apparently interested too.Twitter adds two new board members; two others stepping down - Jack Dorsey has been looking to overhaul Twitter's board, which includes several members who don't tweet. Chairman Omid Kordestani says Twitter plans more board additions that ""will bring diversity and represent the strong communities on Twitter.""NYT: Amazon may be violating new Indian e-commerce rules - The new rules relate to pricing and merchandise sourcing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and several rivals appear to be violating them. Navigating India's complex retail regulations can be a minefield. Just ask Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).Bloomberg: QLogic exploring sale and other options - QLogic (NASDAQ:QLGC) has been contending with a secular decline for its Fibre Channel storage adapter card/switch/controller chip business, as a greater % of storage systems wind up interfacing with Ethernet and InfiniBand links. The company also has Ethernet exposure, but still depends heavily on Fibre Channel.If it's willing to expand beyond chips, Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) could try to buy QLogic to better compete against Broadcom/Avago. Microsemi recently bought storage chipmaker PMC-Sierra, while Avago bought both PMC-Sierra rival LSI and QLogic rival Emulex before merging with Broadcom.TSMC's sales growth turns positive in March - TSMC's (NYSE:TSM) revenue rose 1% Y/Y in March, after dropping 12.9% in February and 18.7% in January - another sign the chip industry's late-2015/early-2016 inventory correction is ending. The world's biggest chip foundry is also benefiting from ramping production of chips based on its advanced 16nm FinFET process - initial production of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A10 CPU (due to go into the iPhone 7) could be playing a role.Noteworthy Tech CommentaryJeremy Liew: The fourth Facebook goldrush just got started - By ""goldrush,"" Liew is talking about new Facebook features that lead thousands of app developers and/or content providers to create new offerings, with some of them building giant audiences in the process. He argues Live streaming and Messenger chatbots will underpin the next one. Liew: ""These goldrushes never last longer than a couple of years... But these opportunities to get to massive scale quickly don't come along often and they create a new generation of interesting startups.""Donny Reynolds: The Future is Without Apps - I think apps still have a big future, but as Reynolds observes, there are some interesting technologies being rolled out that can deliver an ""app experience"" to users without forcing them to download one in full. Specifically, Google's App Streaming, which streams parts of an app on-demand to a web browser or the Google Search app, and Apple's On-Demand Resources (""ODR""), in which only required resources are downloaded at first through the App Store, and everything else downloaded when needed. There are also browser-based web apps (around for ages) to consider.App Streaming, like app indexing and Now on Tap, increases the value of Google Search in an app-dominated mobile landscape.SunTrust: A Yahoo acquirer could gain $2B in value by laying off 40% of the workforce - SunTrust's Bob Peck thinks a company like Verizon could reduce Yahoo's workforce, which is expected to be at 9K by the end of 2016, to around 5K by eliminating nearly all of Yahoo's G&A spend and also making R&D and sales/marketing cuts. Activists have been calling for Yahoo to aggressively pare headcount for some time.MKM: LinkedIn job postings fell in Q1 for first time in six years - MKM's report, which is accompanied by a downgrade to Neutral, comes two months after LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) provided soft 2016 guidance for its Talent Solutions (jobs/recruiting) business. The company blamed international macro pressures for field sales and expectations of just single-digit growth for self-serve (online) sales, which are driven more by SMBs. Credit Suisse recently argued LinkedIn, whose site has received its share of criticism, needs to simplify its SMB Talent Solutions offerings. Is LinkedIn's low user engagement rate having an indirect effect on job posting growth?Peter Rojas: When do bots beat apps? When context and convenience matter most - As Microsoft (via its Bot Framework for Microsoft and third-party apps) and Facebook (through a soon-to-be-launched Messenger bot platform) bet big on automated chatbots, Rojas looks at the technology's core value proposition. ""Chatbots are a bet that we are going to be spending more and more of our time within messaging apps like WeChat, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Telegram, etc. and that it will be easier to access the services we want via a bot within those apps than to jump into another app or use the web.""

3601376,50662,2015-10-25T13:50:29-04:00,"SAP's share price outperformed in the past month after a 25% jump.That performance isn't undeserved considering SAP's increased operating cash flow and reduced capital expenditures in the first nine months of the financial year.The next two years will be important for SAP as the average analyst expectation calls for a 30% increase in profit.As the capex is usually lower than the depreciation rate, I expect free cash flow to increase to close to 5B EUR by the end of FY 2018.","IntroductionI still have some cash left in my 'blue chip' portfolio for a few more high-quality companies, but it's very difficult to find the 'no-brainers' in this market. After seeing how SAP (NYSE:SAP) blasted through the 60 Euro's on the back of an excellent Q3 report, I was a bit disappointed I didn't analyze this company before. In this article I take a closer look at SAP's performance in the first nine months of the current financial year to find out if a purchase of SAP stock is warranted.Even though this company has a market capitalization of almost $100B, it's really surprising me to see the lack of coverage on Seeking Alpha with just one article in the past seven months. The volume on SAP's NYSE listing is pretty good and as the American listing also has options available, you don't really have to consider trading in SAP through the German stock exchange as an average daily dollar volume of $100M in New York should be sufficient to cover your needs.Is the 25% share price jump in one month warranted?In the first nine months of the current financial year, SAP's revenue increased by 19% to 14.5B EUR $16B) mainly due to the integration of the multi-billion dollar acquisition of Concur Technologies into SAP's corporate structure as well as the effects of a weaker Euro. The operating expenses increased by 25% (mainly caused by a 28% jump in the costs of cloud and software) resulting in a gross profit that was 'just' 17% higher and an operating profit of 2.55B ($2.8B) EUR, or 1% lower than the corresponding period in the previous financial year.Source: Financial StatementsYou might not like the slightly lower operating income (as this reduces the operating margin as well, given the higher revenue), but as this difference was caused by R&D expenses as well as increased investments in the sales and marketing division, there might be some benefits from these investments in the future.What I especially like about SAP is the fact the company's free cash flow generally is higher than the net income, and that seems to be confirmed in the cash flow statements of the first nine months of the year. The operating cash flow was a very impressive 3.24B EUR ($3.6B), a 5% increase compared to the 3.08B EUR ($3.4B) in the same period last year.Source: Financial StatementsAfter deducting the 424M EUR ($470M) in capital expenditures, the free cash flow was approximately 2.8B EUR ($3.1B) but keep in mind the capex will be a bit higher in the fourth quarter of this year, so right now I'm counting on a full year free cash flow of approximately 3.5B EUR ($3.85B).The working capital position is improving and the 'risk' is decreasing, but don't expect a substantially higher dividend.SAP is working hard to keep its hard-earned cash on the balance sheet and that's clearly visible on the company's most recent financial statement. Whereas the working capital position was quite small at just 400M EUR ($440M) as of at the end of December 2014, the situation already improved to 1B EUR ($1.1B) by the end of the third quarter. Financial flexibility is important, and reducing the net debt as fast as possible should be (and probably is) one of the company's first priorities.Source: Financial StatementsSo, a positive free cash flow and a robust balance sheet are two great things, but US-based investors should take into consideration the dividend will very likely be lower than the two previous years. That's not because SAP will pay a lower amount of dividends, but due to the fact the US Dollar is much stronger than it has been in the past 2 years. Whereas the 2013 dividend of 1 EUR was $1.37 per share, this fell by 12% to $1.22 over the previous year despite SAP increasing the dividend by 10% to 1.10 EUR.For the current year, I'm expecting another increase to 1.15 EUR and if the currency exchange rate doesn't fluctuate anymore, this should translate in a USD dividend of $1.27 per share. That's not bad, but in SAP's case a weaker US Dollar is better for the shareholders, as a 1.15 EUR dividend and an EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.35 would have resulted in a dividend of US$1.55 per share.Investment thesisI didn't have my eyes on the ball and missed the opportunity to pick up shares of SAP at 56-58 EUR ($61-63.5 at the current exchange rate) in September. That's a pity as the company was trading at a forward free cash flow yield of just 6.95% which isn't much considering SAP is a true household name. It bugs me a little bit, but I have now added SAP to my watch list and the company now is one of the companies I really want to take a position in during a period of market weakness.SAP is still digesting the $8.3B acquisition of Concur Technologies in 2014 but the net debt should be reduced at a rate of 2.5-3B EUR per year and I would expect SAP to start hunting for another acquisition this year as the net debt/EBITDA level is now back to less than 1. Should no decent acquisitions be found, I think the SAP shareholders could look forward to a nice share buyback program."

The German technology firm is well positioned to leverage global IT trends and a favorable exchange rate to bolster profits. Despite healthy sales growth in 2014 especially in the fourth quarter, SAP's market value has steadily decreased.US Dollar Gains Value on the EuroOver the past six months, the US dollar has made consistent gains against the Euro. Late summer exchange rates averaged $1 US Dollar to 0.75 Euro, since then the Dollar has gained value to about 0.89 Euro.Source: StockCharts.Everything becomes cheaper for US companies operating in Europe. For example, paying for materials and labor in Euros now cost less in US Dollars terms than it did just six months prior. The opposite is true for European companies operating abroad - everything is more expensive. However, when the companies have to convert profits back to their functional base currencies the inverse happens. US companies that have made profits in Euros are now worth less in Dollars, and European companies the have Dollar profits are worth more Euros.SAP Geographic OpportunityFor a company like SAP this is significant, most of their costs of development and administration is in Euros, the cheaper currency. However, a vast majority of their sales occur outside of the Eurozone with the largest geographic customer being the US.Source: SAP Investor Relations.The United States currently makes up over 25% of SAP's customer base. Other stronger currencies including the Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, and Swiss Franc also account for a large share of SAP's customer base. Germany and the rest of the Eurozone only account for a little over 30% of SAP's customer base. As a result, SAP will convert profits from stronger currencies back into Euros to continue to invest in their business with more Euros.Current and Future GrowthIn 2014, SAP was able to strategically grow two key product lines - cloud services and support. While software sales remained stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The growth translated to a 7% increase in revenue.Source: SAP Investor Relations.In order to create this growth, SAP had to make significant investments and incur increasing expenses. The result was a slight decrease in operating profit for fiscal year 2014. The investor community has subsequently responded negatively to this news. However, the current growth profile for 2015 should allow SAP to continue to leverage its unique position as a Euro-based company selling to customers in countries with stronger currencies. The competitive advantage will translate to increasing profits and strong long-term prospects by leveraging their cost advantage.SAP's OpportunitySAP's stock has seen a large decline in value due to the current economic downturn in the Eurozone as well as the dismal performance posted by SAP for the fourth quarter of 2014. Since trading neared $80 per share, SAP's ADR stock has declined almost $14 per share to $66.Source: StockCharts.Investors should take note of the short- and long-term technical indicators that look very favorable to SAP's. Upward trends in both relative strength and convergence divergence indicators show favorable upside pressure in 2015.SummarySAP offers a promising opportunity for US investors looking to expand their foreign portfolios and leverage the strengthening US dollar. SAP will continue to make profits in stronger currencies, convert them back to the weaker Euro and investment in growth opportunities throughout 2015. SAP's stock is well poised to rebound as this growth occurs."
2970046,23479,2015-03-03T16:38:26-05:00,"SAP claims that its latest release, named SAP S/4HANA, redefines the way its ERP works by introducing in-memory simplifications that will drastically improve speed and performance.We believe that the success or failure of SAP S/4HANA rests not on the performance improvements, but on the quality and depth of industry-specific functionalities that the company will need to offer to support its latest product.We have a price estimate of $78 for SAP, which is around 10% higher than its current market price.","SAP (NYSE:SAP) recently released the biggest update to its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform in over two decades. SAP claims that its latest release, named SAP S/4HANA, redefines the way its ERP works by introducing in-memory simplifications that will drastically improve speed and performance. [1] The new platform will be offered in on-premise, as well as software-as-a-service (i.e., Cloud) and hybrid variants. The company has also decided to continue simultaneous support and updates for the original SAP HANA Business Suite through 2025. [2]The most notable update in SAP S/4HANA is that while the existing SAP HANA Business Suite runs on third-party databases like those offered by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the new app suite and platform will run on HANA itself, an In-Memory technology where the entire data set is loaded and searchable in Random Access Memory. This will eliminate all interim steps like aggregates, indexes and other data redundancies that take up significant storage space and processing cycles in conventional database computing, thereby leading to much faster processing. The notoriously outdated SAP HANA user interface has also been revamped with the new ‘Fiori’ interface, which is designed to run seamlessly on mobile devices.In this report, we take a look at SAP’s latest product and why this is a crucial turning point for the company.We have a price estimate of $78 for SAP, which is around 10% higher than its current market price.Doing Away With Third Party DatabasesAs mentioned earlier, the functionalities offered by SAP’s current ERP systems currently work on third-party databases like those offered by Oracle and Microsoft. SAP S/4HANA represents a massive change, because ERP systems based on the new platform will function on HANA alone. This removes the need to store interim steps like aggregates, indexes and materialized views on synced spinning disk drives, thus speeding processing. Now, thanks to in-memory calculation of virtual views, users will be able to preview what-if scenarios for major strategic, organizational and reporting changes almost in real time. [3] SAP claims the magnitude of improvement in transaction performance from this update may be as much as 3x to 7x; the data storage footprint of an ERP-system may improve by a factor of 10. [2]Unanswered Questions, Unclear RoadmapThe immediate aftermath of the release announcement raised numerous questions regarding the transition from SAP HANA to SAP S/4HANA. For instance, SAP has clarified that its public cloud apps like SuccessFactors and Ariba will be integrated with and expanded in S/4HANA. However, it is unclear how the integration will take place in private-cloud or on-premises deployments. [4]Perhaps more importantly, the company has remained vague regarding the roadmap and timeline for making the new offering production ready. Further, the S/4HANA Public Cloud offering for a number of functions will be released later this month. [4] However, while the Public Cloud is configurable, it remains unclear how and when support for company-specific customizations and legacy interfaces in the Private Cloud will take place.Lastly, SAP has not yet provided detailed pricing information for the S/4HANA platform, and subscription cost for the cloud model has not been released at all. [5] Further, SAP has a tendency to not provide itemized bills, which frequently holds back customers from upgrades. This factor will become all the more important if the company choses to provide separate add-ons for industry-specific functions, for which price clarity will be essential. Thus, we believe that pricing, especially in industry-specific private cloud models, will be a crucial factor if SAP is to successfully convince potential customers to switch from the comfort of familiar databases to SAP’s insofar untested offering.Has SAP Bet The House on S/4HANA?We believe that the success or failure of SAP S/4HANA rests not on the performance improvements, but on the quality and depth of industry-specific functionalities that the company will need to offer to support its latest product. It is pertinent to note here that SAP has previously stated that it does not have any major acquisitions planned in the near future. [6] Therefore, its in-house development team faces an uphill battle in developing suitable replacements for the functionalities offered by Oracle and Microsoft.SAP S/4HANA has already spent two years under development and its release is touted as “the biggest update in 23 years, possibly in SAP’s history”. [7] Given the level of resources that the company has dedicated to S/4HANA and the long way it still has to go before it becomes fully functional, it would seem that SAP is betting the house on SAP S/4HANA. SAP founder Hasso Plattner has gone so far as to admit that “If it doesn’t work, we’re dead. Flat out dead.” [8]However, we believe that its decision to continue the SAP HANA Business Suite alongside the new version suggests that the company is hedging its bets. After all, full support and updates for the older suite for another decade doesn’t exactly spell “phasing out”, let alone “full transition”. If anything, it indicates SAP’s cognizance of the hurdles that it is going to face in getting users to move on from familiar, traditional databases like Oracle. Instead of pursuing a single, unified vision for the entire company, SAP has now forked its foreseeable future into two paths – the older SAP HANA and the new SAP S/4HANA. In other words, SAP may have a lot riding on S/4HANA, but it has not put all its eggs in one basket – yet.Disclosure: None"
2852826,80806,2015-01-27T06:30:12-05:00,"SAP announced that the cost of setting up cloud-based infrastructure to allow the company to shift to that new software system would likely affect profit for the coming two years.SAP’s 2017 operating margin is expected to be less than 31%.

It is now also the second-largest cloud software provider after Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), with 50 million users and $4 billion revenue in FY2014.However, the company issued its second profit warning in four months on Tuesday. It had previously adjusted its 2014 profit forecast downwards in October, but confirmed on Tuesday that the cost of setting up cloud-based infrastructure to allow the company to shift to that new software delivery system would likely affect profit for the coming two years.Cloud software companies have to face higher initial costs and deferred revenue, which is realized over time, adversely affecting short-term margins. According to a reCode interview with CEO Bill McDermott the company's previous goal of 35% operating margin is ""no longer realistic"" while still attempting to grow the cloud business.SAP's 2017 operating margin is expected to be less than 31%. Europe's largest software group predicted that its 2017 operating profit will be between 6.3 billion and 7 billion Euros, on sales of 21 to 22 billion Euros. Shares for the company dropped to 4.4%, underperforming the German blue-chip DAX index. The fall in share price was a continuation of the company's year-long trend with its stock having dropped over 9% in the last year, even vastly underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Technology Index, which was up by more than 10%.SAP's revenue grew 4% from last year, from 16.82 billion to 17.56 billion Euros, and its operating profit was up 3% from 2013, reaching 5.63 billion Euros. Its cloud software revenue rose to 1.1 billion Euros in 2014, a 45% rise over 2013. Part of this growth can be attributed to the acquisitions of Concur, SAP's largest ever acquisition at $7.3 billion, and Fieldgrass. While the company is still realizing the costs of these integrations, the acquisitions have boosted SAP's goodwill and have provided drivers for future growth in the company.SAP declared a profit of 1.6 billion Euros for the last quarter, on revenue of 5.5 billion, adding up to 1.31 Euro per share - a 3% rise from this time last year.CFO Luka Mucic excluded the possibility of any further sizeable acquisitions within the next few years; instead, the company plans to focus on increasing shareholder dividend and trimming its debt, which expanded by more than 2.5 times to 11.5 billion Euros in 2014 due to the leveraged Concur acquisition. It intends to adhere to a conservative leverage policy, and to reduce leverage to its previous levels over the next three to four years.SAP has responsibly laid out a plan for the next few years in order to continue expanding its cloud business and bringing up its revenues and margins. The company expects cloud and software revenue to grow by around 10% in the coming year, and operating profit is anticipated to clock in between 5.6 billion and 5.9 billion Euros.US market research firm IDC reported that in the first three quarters of the year, global IT business growth outstripped that of the world economy once more. It expects the software market to grow more than 4% this year, and to continue to grow faster than the global GDP. According to the US based research firm the cloud software market is estimated to have a compounded annual growth rate of 21.3% until 2020.Encouraged by the growth of the cloud business thus far, SAP anticipates that it will have expanded seven times, from 1.1 billion Euro currently to about 7.5 to 8 billion Euros, by 2020. It also said that it aims to have an operating profit of between 8 and 9 billion Euros on revenue of 26 to 28 billion, by the same year.The reason for the company's unexpectedly low growth in margins and revenues is its high degree of leverage, high initial costs in establishing and growing the cloud-based software delivery business, and the deferred revenues inherent in that business, whereby revenues are realised over a period of time, as opposed to the immediate realizations that the company has been used to with its traditional software delivery mechanism.SAP's cloud business, however, is performing well due to a clever and organized strategy including key acquisitions and a focus on its expansion. The company has invested in China, Russia, and the Middle East, and is expanding to Africa as well, allowing these emerging markets to further act as a growth driver within the company.SAP hopes that this dip in profitability is simply a temporary drawback, and expects its cloud subscription and support revenues to exceed those from its software license business by 2018."
2838336,23479,2015-01-21T17:32:26-05:00,SAP reported detailed fourth quarter and full year earnings on Tuesday.The company beat its revenue guidance on the back of explosive growth in its cloud business and the continued success of SAP HANA.We are currently revising our $86 price estimate for SAP to reflect 2014 results.,"European software major SAP (NYSE:SAP) reported detailed fourth quarter and full year earnings on Tuesday, following preliminary results released on January 12th (Read: Cloud Subscriptions Soar as SAP Achieves 2014 Guidance). The company beat its revenue guidance on the back of explosive growth in its cloud business and the continued success of SAP HANA. It also achieved its revised non-IFRS operating profit guidance despite the accelerating transition to a cloud-based business model, which typically results in lower margins during the transitional period.Full year revenues were €17.56 billion, up 4% from 2013 revenues of €16.82 billion. The growth was led by a 56% spurt in Cloud Subscriptions and Support Revenue, which touched €1.1 billion in 2014. Software and support revenue, which includes revenue from new software subscriptions and technical support services, accounted for the bulk of the revenue and expanded by 4% year on year to reach €13.77 billion. The ongoing shift of focus to the cloud took a toll on Professional and Other Services Revenue, which fell by 6% year on year to €2.7 billion.Operating profit was dragged down by TomorrowNow and Versata litigation charges and fell by 3% year on year to €4.3 billion. On a non-IFRS basis, which excludes such one-off items, operating profit grew by 3% to reach €5.63 billion in 2014. The non-IFRS operating margin declined by 34 basis points to 32%, primarily due to the focus on developing the cloud business, which involves higher deferred revenues compared to the current on-premise software business.The company guides cloud and software revenue to grow by 8% to 10% in 2015, while operating profit is expected to be €5.6 billion to €5.9 billion on a constant currency basis.We are currently revising our $86 price estimate for SAP to reflect 2014 results.The Future Lies in CloudSAP is firmly positioning itself for a complete makeover from a traditional on-premise software vendor to a cloud-based software vendor. The company’s shift of focus is evident from the fact that while its revenues from new software licenses declined, cloud subscription and support billings expanded by 104% year on year. Although part of this growth is attributed to the Concur and Fieldgrass acquisitions, the company still managed a substantial organic growth in cloud billings. This indicates that SAP is focused on acquiring new customers for its cloud business, even if it is at the expense of on-premise software licenses.Accordingly, the company guides Cloud Subscription and Support revenues to increase to €1.95 billion to €2.05 billion in 2015 in constant currency terms, which is a growth of 77% to 86% compared to 2014. This astounding growth rate will be assisted by the cloud backlog (future revenues from executed contracts not yet booked) and deferred revenue (future revenues from booked contracts), which more than doubled to over €3 billion in 2014. By 2018, SAP expects cloud subscriptions to exceed sales of new software licenses.Further, buoyed by the encouraging growth so far, SAP has pegged its cloud business to grow seven-fold from €1.1 billion in 2014 to €7.5 to €8 billion by 2020. Overall incremental revenue by 2020 is expected to be €10 billion. A substantial part of this growth is projected to trickle down to the bottom line also, with an incremental €3 billion in operating profits by 2020.Highly Competitive Cloud Business May Inhibit Margin ImprovementSAP’s ongoing transition to the cloud resulted in a decline of 34 basis points in non-IFRS operating margin in 2014. This was because, unlike revenue from traditional on-premise software( which is mostly booked upfront), much of the revenue from cloud subscriptions is deferred over the life of the contract. High infrastructural investments for scaling up of the cloud business also resulted in lower cloud margin, although the margin erosion bottomed out by the end of the third quarter.Although the company was able to contain the decline in margins in 2014, it has stated that it may not be able to retain the high level of margins which it enjoyed in the past. [1] This is because of the highly competitive nature of the cloud industry, which will prohibit SAP from realizing high margins. Therefore, the company has effectively deferred its target of achieving a 35% operating margin by 2017 in favor of focusing on expanding operating profit in absolute terms.Software and Cloud Subscription & Support to be Clubbed with Professional Services With effect from 2015, SAP plans to implement a radical new approach in which all services, whether for on-premise software or for cloud subscriptions, will be provided under a common umbrella. As per this ‘ONE Service’ approach, all premium professional services, global support services and cloud subscriptions will be provided through a single organization under a common contract with a common rate. This plan extends SAP’s characteristic drive for simplification in its software products to its services also, which will now comprise of a single contract.Consequently, the company will no longer distinguish between standard support services (currently included in Software Support Revenue line) and premium professional services (currently included in Professional and Other Services Revenue line). These will be clubbed along with revenue from cloud subscriptions into a single line item named Cloud and Software Services Revenue.Cash Flow to be Used For Repayments as Debt Surges by 2.5xSAP’s operating cash flow declined by 7% year on year in 2014 to €3.57 billion. The decline was mainly due to the payouts arising out of the TomorrowNow and Versata litigations, amounting to €555 million. Excluding this amount, the operating cash flow increased by 8% during the year. The company has stated that the cash flow will not be utilized for any further acquisitions in the near term, with the exception of a few minor ones of insignificant size.Instead, SAP intends to trim down its debt which ballooned by over 2.5 times in 2014 to €11.5 billion, thanks to the leveraged acquisition of Concur. Its debt to equity ratio also doubled to 0.6x in 2014, which is slightly lower than Oracle’s ratio of 0.7x. The company now intends to stick to its conservative leverage policy and aims to bring down leverage over the next three to four years to the previous low levels.Disclosure: None"

And they wonder about which one to pick up.Most will choose to pick up the oil knife. Readers at Seeking Alpha understand oil stocks. A quick look at the roads over the holidays show demand for gasoline is picking up as the price goes down - there is some price elasticity. Countries that depend on oil tend to blow up when oil goes down, and that can send oil prices right back up.But I want you to also consider the Euro-knife. The Euro's fall these last six months has not been as great as that of oil, but in its own way it's just as impressive. You can buy a Euro, as of this writing Monday morning, for $1.19. Back in June the same Euro would have cost you nearly $1.40.There are some important implications of all this. First, the Fed is not going to raise interest rates any time soon. If it did, even more money would rush into the dollar, and we don't want that because it hikes the price of our exports and makes the trade deficit worse, while increasing international tensions. Second, Europe just went on sale.Consider SAP (NYSE:SAP), the European software company. It opens for trading today at under $69/share, down 17% from a year ago. But this is a great company. Operating margins have been averaging 25% for five years. The top line has grown consistently. The debt load is modest. The customers are tied closely to it, and it even has a cloud strategy.Now consider IBM (NYSE:IBM). I know, you may not want to. The top line has been deteriorating for years, the debt load has been increasing, and management is about as highly-rated as the Oakland Raiders. But IBM is still worth $161/share as trading opened Monday, a total market cap of $160 billion. That's almost twice the valuation of SAP. SAP, and its superior management, is thus affordable.For that matter SAP's chief rival in databases, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), could also buy it. So, for that matter, could Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which is now worth $385 billion.I have no insight into whether such a deal could or would happen. I'm a tech reporter so I'm using an example from the industry I know. But across Europe, and especially in Germany, there are strong and super-strong companies that have been put on sale by the weakened Euro. Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY). Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY). Lufthansa (OTCQX:DLAKY). Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY). They're all marked down about 20%. They're all more affordable than they have been, for an American buyer, in years - more affordable than they are bound to be again.Now may be a good time to pick up a few good European stocks, if you have the same courage with falling knives you claim to have regarding oil. The Euro is going to go back up someday, just as oil is. And you want to be there when it happens.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2828616,80476,2015-01-18T06:26:02-05:00,,"In 1972, five former IBM employees founded a company named SAP (SystemAnalyse und Programmentwicklung) (NYSE:SAP). 43 years later, SAP serves more than 263.000 customers in over 190 countries worldwide. Headquartered in Germany, SAP touches US$16 trillion of retail purchases around the world. SAP is the world market leader for enterprise applications, analytics and mobile solutions with a 25% global market share. In addition, SAP is the second-largest enterprise cloud company with more than 35 million users and is the fastest growing database provider in the world.Current business situation In the first three quarters, worldwide IT business growth again outpaced growth in the overall world economy, according to US market research firm IDC. Software continued to lead IT spending, with companies investing primarily in the cloud, in Big Data, social, and mobile. At the moment, IDC expects the global software market to grow slightly over 4% this year and keep growing faster than the global GDP in the future. IT markets in the emerging economies have developed at different rates since the beginning of the year. The market for IT in the EMEA region has been largely stable but has failed to keep pace with the expansion of the IT market globally. IT market growth, and particularly software and services segment growth, was much stronger in the AJP region than in the world as a whole. The resurgent U.S. market drove growth in the Americas region. Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver, with high double-digit growth in software and cloud revenues expected through 2017. In addition to SAP's investments in China, Russia and the Middle East, the company is expanding in Africa as well.During this year, SAP's revenue has increased by only 3% compared to last year. Owner earnings and the balance sheet remain pretty much unchanged except the fact that goodwill has increased because of acquisitions and will grow in Q4 because of Concur by several billions of Euros. The main driver for revenue growth was the cloud business which grew by 51%. Over half of the revenue growth can be explained with that segment. The drive in the cloud business is now extremely strong and SAP has had to raise its outlook for the segment a few times this year. A negative fact has been that the margins decreased in the cloud business by 7.6% points to 65%. This decrease was primarily due to increasing expenses related to the ramp-up of the cloud business, with related investments, as well as additional personnel expenses. So, all in all the problem was not in the market.Currencies had a negative effect on revenue growth. Margins decreased slightly as profits did not rise together with revenue. During this year 47% of revenues were generated in Europe, 38% in Americas and the rest in Asia. For the cloud business, Americas is by far the biggest geographical customer. In Europe, Germany is the biggest customer which accounts for 15% of total revenues. US generates 28% from total revenues. IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) are finding growth harder to come by as customers move from traditional software contracts and computer purchases to programs delivered from remote data centers online. SAP already has a good head start with cloud compared to its peers.In the case of SAP which has equity worth of €18 billion and a market capitalization of €70 billion, it is quite clear that most of the value of the company is not visible in the balance sheet. This is quite common with software companies where the value lies in intangible software and know-how. This year Interbrand evaluated SAP's brand worth of $17 billion. In general, SAP's business and balance sheet are in good order as Moody's and Standard & Poor's have both assigned it a credit rating of ""A2"" and outlook ""Stable"". Below you can see the recent liquidity statement for the group which is pretty much a perfect example of cash flow of a wonderful business.SAP HANA's customer count has gone up to 1,450 as compared to 450 a year ago. It has been, alongside the cloud business, the main contributor for revenue growth. With total license revenue of €1.2 billion in less than three years, SAP HANA is the most successful product in SAP's history. This technology is the basis of all SAP applications in the future. Hence, the strategy change towards SAP HANA made in 2010 has proved to be correct so far.Three major technology trends - in-memory computing, enterprise mobility and the cloud - have triggered change in the world of IT. Those trends are changing not only the way enterprises adopt and deploy business technology, but also fundamentally the way how work is done. Cloud computing has now become mainstream and is a widely accepted delivery model in the United States, and increasingly in Asia and Europe. According to SAP, organizations around the world are now entering a new era of business model innovation, made possible by the convergence of cloud, mobile, social, and in-memory technologies. The company tries to serve this market need by simplifying its customer's IT infrastructure. SAP can achieve this by offering all of its products through cloud-based SAP HANA. Today, cloud, mobile, and Big Data are the dominant themes in the IT industry and SAP HANA tries to answer all these demands.At the moment the company is in the middle of a transition in its business model from traditional software sales to cloud computing and this will take some time before it starts to show on the bottom line. However, the disproportionate growth of cloud business leads to short-term margin pressure: upfront cloud sales and delivery costs increase as customers sign more cloud deals but revenue and profits are generated much later. Consequently, SAP has adjusted its outlook for operating profit for the full year 2014 a few times. However, the cloud business can be expected to increase its profitability in the longer term, as economies of scale start to kick in with revenue growth. The good part with cloud is that SAP will now see a consistent stream of revenue from its customers as compared to one-time payments.This will also allow those enterprises who cannot afford to pay high fees upfront, but are capable of paying small installments, to buy SAP's services. This move will effectively increase the company's customer base. Below you can see SAP's current revenue base where the majority of the revenues are already recurring.SAP currently estimates that they will increasingly be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of products in its industry segment grows, as it acquires more companies and expands into new industry segments. Even at the moment, SAP is subject to multiple lawsuits. The biggest one is with Oracle which started already in 2007 legal proceedings in the United States against TomorrowNow which was slightly earlier acquired by SAP. In the worst case, Oracle is seeking $1.3 billion relief from SAP because of lost revenues.Concur acquisition On September 18 this year, SAP announced it will buy the global market travel and expense management software manufacturer Concur with a whopping price of $8.3 billion. The initial market reaction was a 4% drop in share price. SAP has unused credit facilities worth of €7 billion for the purchase and will issue bonds if needed to fund the acquisition. There has been a lot of discussion whether the purchase price was overly absurd considering that in the last fiscal year, Concur had revenue of $700 million and generated owner earnings of $25 million. This would make the P/S ratio 12 and P/OE ratio 332. It still has to be noted that during the last 5 years Concur has grown more than 20% annually and that it is quite difficult for a regular investor to assess the synergies generated from this acquisition. E.g. When Concur is combined with the Ariba and Fieldglass business networks, SAP will be positioned to power transactions that drive more than US$10 trillion of addressable global spend annually. The main idea with the Concur purchase is to add it to SAP HANA so that customers could glance through a single report all company-related costs. Concur simply completes SAP's offering. If you imagine that SAP could double Concur's revenue because of its larger customer base, the P/S would be only 6 as compared to SAP's 4 which is not a lot any more, considering Concur's strong growth rate.Competitors SAP's main competitors in the applications market are IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Key competitors in the business analytics market include IBM, SAS Institute, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Oracle. The mobile market is still highly fragmented but competitors include among others Antenna. In the cloud market, SAP faces line-of-business on-demand players such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), and NetSuite (NYSE:N), as well as Oracle. Principal competitors for technology & database products include IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle.SAP products SAP offers products in 5 different segments: business applications, database & technology, analytics, cloud and mobile. Its portfolio of solutions currently covers 12 lines of business; asset management, corporate strategy and sustainability, finance, human resources, information technology, manufacturing, marketing, procurement, R&D and engineering, sales, service and supply chain management. In total, SAP now supports enterprises in 25 industries.SAP's goal is to offer all these products through SAP cloud-based SAP HANA. SAP is the only company in the world with a portfolio to enable its customers to manage all key resources on one cloud platform. SAP's products can be installed on-site or offered through cloud and can be used either mobile or via other user interfaces. SAP mainly sells these products by itself or through partners. Partners can directly sell them, develop their own solutions that complement SAP's products or provide implementation and other services for SAP software. In addition to these products, the company offers consulting, training and customer-oriented software development. Consulting generated 13% from total revenues in 2013.For its software, SAP provides two different licensing models: software licenses and cloud subscriptions. For software licenses, the group recognizes the majority of revenue as a one time up-front license fee. The customers receive a perpetual license to SAP's software. The list price for the perpetual license forms the basis for the support fees. Support is usually sold and invoiced on a monthly or annual basis. Support revenue is a strong recurring revenue stream for SAP, representing 52% of 2013 total revenue. Software sales accounted for 27% of total revenues in 2013. For cloud subscriptions, SAP recognizes revenue ratably over several years. Cloud offerings are typically installed in a data center of SAP or one of its partners. Cloud subscriptions include license, support, and operation costs for the data center. It is SAP's second recurring revenue stream, strongly growing and in 2013 contributing about 4% of total revenue.Outlook SAP expects the combination of a stable, highly-profitable core and fast-growing cloud business to deliver continued growth and margin growth in the near future. The management has stated that the dividend payout ratio should be more than 30% of the profit after tax.SAP's near term financial goal is to increase its total revenue to at least €20 billion and total revenue from its cloud business to approximately €2 billion by 2015. In the medium-term it is striving to increase its revenue at least to €22 billion by the end of 2017 and increase its operating margin to 35%. To capture the growth opportunities in the cloud, the group now expects the margin target to be reached by 2017 rather than in 2015 as previously stated. This is why the share price has been performing so badly this year. SAP anticipates that the fast-growing cloud business along with growth in support revenue will drive a higher proportion of more predictable, recurring revenue in the future. SAP expects that annual cloud subscription and support revenue will be higher than annual software license revenue, latest by 2020. Hence, the cloud business will be critical for future growth and margins for SAP.SAP plans to grow both organically and through acquisitions to reach the revenue targets. In recent years majors acquisitions include BusinessObjects (2007), Sybase (2010), SuccessFactors (2011), Syclo (2012), Ariba (2012), hybris (2013), Fieldglass, and Concur (2014). SAP does not currently have any other major acquisition plans in the cloud business as opposed to recent years. Now is the time to integrate them and let the synergies take over.Ownership Board members of SAP own in total ~120M shares which translates to a € 6.6 billion ownership. This is the biggest management holding compared to all my other holdings. An interesting thing to note is that almost everyone in the global managing board have joined SAP over a decade ago so they should have a deep understanding about the company and industry.Disclosure: I am long on SAP."
2516295,73565,2014-09-23T20:14:01-04:00,,"[Originally published 8/19/2014]Yesterday, SAP announced it would acquire Concur for $8.3B, the single largest SaaS acquisition in history in dollar terms.To put this acquisition in context, I looked at six other public-to-public acquisitions, where one publicly traded company acquired another. Because the acquired target is public, much of their financial information is readily available. As the chart above shows, the Enterprise Value/Trailing 12 Month Revenue (EV/TTM Rev) multiple SAP paid for Concur is tied for the highest among any public-to-public SaaS acquisitions.Above, I've copied a table that compares the key data points across acquisitions. Across these seven transactions, Concur generated the most revenue. Concur's gross margins of 63% are a bit below the median of 66% and their growth rate equals the median.It's easier to explain SuccessFactor's premium multiple because they recorded a 59% annual growth rate when they were acquired in 2011. But can we explain the pricing of these MegaExits for the rest of the sample?Below, I've plotted two charts showing the relationship between a company's growth rate and the TEV/TTM Rev Ratio at acquisition, and the gross margin and the TEV/TTM Rev Ratio.In both cases, the R2, the measure of how strongly the variables are correlated are pretty weak. I tried to create a simple linear to model to predict the TEV/TTM Rev Multiple yields using these two variables in addition to revenue. But the model has no predictive power.In other words, across this very small sample set, the financial fundamentals of the business don't really drive the multiples. Instead, factors like brand, management team, strategic importance and competitive auction dynamics seem to be much more influential over the ultimate selling price than income statement and balance sheet. Each of these massive acquisitions is a huge strategic move for the acquiring company and therefore, it's viewed as a snowflake, a one-of-a-kind-acquisition.I'm certain we will quite a bit more fireworks in the SaaS M&A market. I'm curious to see how acquirer's thinking around purchase prices continues to evolve. But in almost every regard, Concur's sale to SAP is an exceptional event for the SaaS world.Disclosure: None"
2507305,55442,2014-09-19T10:43:20-04:00,"SAP's acquisition of Concur Technologies looks to destroy shareholder value under any reasonable scenario.
        While difficult to assess, assuming SAP's cloud business is unprofitable, it appears that SAP's Successfactors and Ariba transactions have also destroyed shareholder value.
        Despite having a strong core business and selling at only 15x 2015 estimated earnings, the author is selling his shares.","Though I considered SAP (NYSE:SAP) to be one of the great businesses of all time and have been a shareholder since 2007, sadly it is time to divest this holding. I have always admired the company's strong market position, high operating margins (30%+), and large recurring revenue base (over 55% of revenue is recurring). However, following the Concur (NASDAQ:CNQR) acquisition, SAP no longer meets my investment criteria. As a long term value investor, I look to buy businesses of at least average quality, selling at significant discounts to my estimate of their intrinsic value. In addition, I look for financial strength - not only must the business be able to service its debt in the current environment, but it should be able to withstand both a company specific and macroeconomic shock. Last but not least, I look for a management team that acts as owners - allocating capital in a manner which creates long term value for shareholders.Allocating capital in a value creative manner can take many forms. In some cases, the business has significant organic opportunities which require capital expenditure. In other cases, management has the opportunity to create value by purchasing complementary businesses at prices which generate positive returns for shareholders. For instance Countrywide Plc (OTC:CTYWY) frequently acquires leasing businesses at low multiples of EBITDA and then creates additional value by extracting synergies. Swedish lock manufacturer Assa Abloy (OTCPK:ASAZY) is another example of a management team which has created significant value for shareholders via acquisition. While Countrywide and Assa have exemplary acquisition track records, as Warren Buffett remarks 'most corporate managements kiss frogs rather than princes'. Lastly, management teams can create value for shareholders by returning capital to shareholders - specifically by repurchasing a company's shares when they are selling at a discount to fair value. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done a decent job of doing this over the past year.As a value investor I have a long-term time horizon. There are typically three reasons I may sell a holding:In the case of SAP, I believe that I was wrong about the company's management. While I'd believed they would create (or at least not destroy) shareholder value, I now believe I am wrong. As announced yesterday after-hours, SAP is buying Conquer for ~$8 billion, or roughly 11.3x 2014 expected revenue. This represents an infinite multiple of operating profit and net income (because Concur is a money loser). I gave SAP the benefit of the doubt when it acquired Successfactors (spend $3.4 billion or 8x revenue) and Ariba ($4.4 billion) as I was impressed with the value SAP created by purchasing Business Objects (looked like 20x EBIT at time of deal but through synergies and growth worked out to be less than 10x). However, either SAP no longer is price sensitive (which is a deal breaker for me as an investor), or the Successfactors/cloud strategy is going so poorly that the company is going to 'fix' this with an over priced acquisition.As we sit today, I have yet to find a SAAS stock which is generating a profit, let alone one earning margins of 30+% (as we see in SAP's core business). Even if Concur continues to grow revenue at a 25% CAGR for the next 5 years (which is unlikely), and generate 20% operating margins (which no cloud software company has done), SAP will have paid 31x 2019 earnings! This is about 2x what I think the company is worth (not even factoring in the time value of money). Thus I believe that $4-5 billion of shareholder money has just been vaporized. If the sky is less blue than I just outlined (and I believe it will be), shareholder value destruction will be even greater.Though it is impossible to track (due to integration), I believe the acquisitions of Successfactors and Ariba have fared only slightly better. Assuming $4.5 billion in value destruction on the Concur transaction and another $2-3 billion on Successfactors/Ariba means that SAP has destroyed half of what it has earned over the past 3 years (total net income of nearly $14 billion from 2011-2013). Of course there is the risk that SAP does shareholders the favor of allocating more capital toward such acquisitions!While I still love the economics of SAP's core business, I have little faith that the profits and cash flow from that business will make it into my pocket. As such, I must sell my shares."
2651785,54222,2014-11-06T15:34:10-05:00,"SAP is changing its business model for the better, as this will allow the company to bring more customers into its fold, apart from establishing a consistent revenue stream.SAP has been dominating the ERP space, and it is getting better by moving into rivals' territory with the help of its cost-efficient products.SAP is smartly growing its business by cross-selling its newly-acquired products to its old customers, while the IBM deal can expand its reach further.","SAP (NYSE:SAP) has dropped close to its 52-week low on account of weak guidance that it offered last month. In fact, despite topping analysts' expectations on revenue and earnings, SAP shares fell due to Wall Street's short-sightedness. Now, SAP is operating in a growth market, which is why the company is investing aggressively in cloud infrastructure. This is expected to create short-term pressure on its margins and arrest SAP's bottom line growth for some time. But, looking at the long-term perspective, it will be a wise idea to take advantage of SAP's weakness and buy the stock. Let's see why.Shifting to a better business modelSAP is now focusing more on cloud-based software technology. As a result, its revenue will now be distributed over a longer period of time, depending on the contract that it enters into with the customer, and will depend less on licensing fees. This is one of the major reasons that have contributed to lower earnings guidance. But, the good part is that SAP will now see a consistent stream of revenue from its customers as compared to one-time payments.This will also allow those enterprises who cannot afford to pay high fees upfront, but are capable of paying small installments, to buy SAP's services. This move will effectively increase the company's customer base.Expanding its dominanceIn addition, SAP recently announced that it will be acquiring Concur Technologies for $8.3 billion, its largest acquisition ever. Concur is a provider of cloud-based software for travel and expense management. This looks like an important acquisition, as according to Forbes:On the other hand, the company's flagship product, HANA, also is gaining new customers by replacing rivals. NTUC FairPrice, the largest supermarket chain in Singapore, plans to replace Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) software with HANA's in-memory database, which will reduce its cost structure. To its credit, SAP has a large number of customers such as TUI Travel, Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Polo Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), and now it is eating into Oracle's share of the market.In fact, SAP has taken a solid lead over Oracle in the ERP market. According to the last ERP market share update, SAP commanded almost 25% of the ERP market, greater than Oracle's 13% share. Looking ahead, this dominance can increase further as HANA allows customers to cut costs remarkably. As SAP management points out, ""Forrester estimates the customer seek 30 to 50% TCO savings with the HANA platform."" As a result, it is not surprising to see that SAP's HANA customer count has gone up to 1,450 as compared to 450 a year ago.Recent acquisitions powering growthSAP has depended a lot on acquisitions for its growth, and it has a good history of successfully integrating those acquisitions into the business. In the last couple of years, it has strengthened its cloud offerings with the help of SuccessFactors and Fieldglass, both of which are now gaining new customers globally.For instance, SuccessFactors is seeing strong demand from the Asia Pacific, Japan and EMEA countries. More importantly, SAP's existing customers are opting for the services offered by its acquired companies, which indicates that the company is doing well to cross sell products. For instance, Singapore Telecommunications Limited, which is an existing SAP customer, opted for SuccessFactors' Human Capital Management suite.It is clear that SAP is following a smart strategy by acquiring companies and integrating their products into its own suite of products. The company believes that this is turning out to be a key differentiator for the company as compared to the competition. As CEO Bill McDermott points out, ""Because of this integrated portfolio of applications, we are winning against the competition with customers like Opus Capital, Delaware Consulting andSmurfit Kappa choosing SAP Cloud solution.""In addition, SAP is partnering with IBM (NYSE:IBM) in a cloud infrastructure deal. According to this deal, HANA Enterprise Cloud will now be available on IBM's cloud data centers across the world, leading to a faster roll-out. According to a report, ""SAP HANA will run on IBM Cloud with an open-standards-based approach that promises to help make it easier to integrate existing technology investments with new workloads."" Since HANA will offer customers in-memory computing ability in a cloud environment, there is a good chance that IBM customers will opt for it.ConclusionSAP has not done well this year. The stock has lost almost 23% on the stock market. But, this has made the stock pretty cheap at just 19 times last year's earnings, which is way better than the industry P/E of 36. Its forward P/E looks even more impressive at 17.75. With the stock trading close to its 52-week low, it might be a good idea to buy some shares as SAP is expected to see annual earnings growth of almost 12% in the next five years, better than what is has delivered in the last five."

The company now has more than 40% of their revenues coming from the cloud. HANA continues to drive SAP’s growth during the quarter. They ended the quarter with over 4,100 SAP HANA customers and 1,450 SAP HANA Business Suite customers. A quarter ago, SAP HANA had 3,600 customers and over 1,200 Business Suite customers. SAP HANA has helped them deliver to more than 44 million cloud users on the cloud.As part of the new offerings for cloud, SAP recently announced plans for a Cloud for Planning solution. The new solution will be focused on simplifying the planning process by providing customers with a consumer app-like experience integrated with in-context collaboration and analytics, and all of that on the cloud. The application will be built on SAP HANA and will simplify the financial planning and analysis for an organization.To further strengthen the cloud growth, SAP recently announced the acquisition of cloud-based expense and travel management solutions provider Concur. Market reports suggest that Concur was approached by both Oracle and SAP for a merger. In the end, SAP managed to close the deal at a price tag of $8.3 billion, making this their biggest acquisition ever. Concur brings with it a revenue rate of $700 million and a global customer base of 23,000. For the year ended September 2013, Concur had reported revenues of $546 million and a loss of $24.4 million.Analysts aren’t particularly thrilled with the acquisition. As Commerzbank analyst Thomas Becker said,I don’t agree. I am very bullish on Concur, and expect that it will avail SAP a much closer relationship with enterprise end-users, something they have lacked systematically.Post the acquisition, SAP will be able to boast of supporting network spend volumes of over $600 billion on their network. The addition of Concur will take SAP to more than 50 million end users in the cloud, making them the biggest enterprise cloud company in the world.SAP’s stock is trading at $66.63 with a market capitalization of $79.7 billion.

Cloud subscriptions and support revenues grew 39% over the year to €0.24 billion (~$0.33 billion).SAP expects to end the year with cloud subscription and support revenues of €1.00 billion-€1.05 billion (~$1.37-$1.44 billion), raising their guidance from €0.95 billion-€1.00 billion (~$1.30-$1.37 billion). They projected the year's operating profit at €5.8 billion-€6.0 billion (~$7.92-$8.20 billion).SAP's Run Simple StrategySAP remains focused on enhancing their business through cloud and HANA-related offerings. Recently, they announced a business strategy of ""Run simple"". They plan to use cloud and SAP HANA to help simplify their customer experience. As part of that, they recently included the SAP Fiori user experience within SAP software licenses. SAP Fiori is a collection of apps that uses latest design principles to deliver an improved user experience. It successfully integrates features of personalization, responsiveness, and simplicity across multiple devices to deliver the experience.As part of this strategy, SAP in the last quarter released Simple Finance, which provides users with an end-to-end financial management solution as a comprehensive package. The solution features capabilities like simplifying and automating the intercompany reconciliations, integrating financial planning with reporting, improved cash management and reduces the data points generated as part of the financial processing.SAP is also deploying the strategy in their customer relationship offering. Their hybrid omni-channel e-commerce platform and SAP cloud for sales are integrating processes like customer insight, targeted marketing, sales promotion, commerce, and service.They also realize the need of simple processes especially for the SMB segment and recently launched a new division focused on providing solutions to the smaller firms.SAP's stock is trading at $76.88 with a market capitalization of $91.8 billion.

They expect to end the year with software and software related services growing 6%-8% over the year from previous year's €14.03 billion (~$18.9 billion), which translates to overall revenues of €15.83 billion-€16.15 billion (~$21.3 billion-$21.8 billion).SAP's AcquisitionsSAP continued to build their product portfolio through acquisitions. Recently, SAP announced the acquisition of real-time behavioral marketing company SeeWhy. SeeWhy is a leading provider of behavioral marketing solutions that help deliver real-time one-to-one marketing campaigns using multiple digital media including email, and advertising across desktop, mobile, and social channels. SeeWhy's solutions analyze the customer's behavior to personalize marketing campaigns and thus make them more relevant to the user. Their offerings are estimated to improve conversion and deliver improved return on investments. SAP plans to integrate SeeWhy's solutions with their Hybris e-commerce platform to deliver enhanced one-to-one personalized marketing campaigns. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Last quarter, SAP also acquired vendor management systems provider Fieldglass for an estimated $1 billion. Fieldglass' tools help organizations manage their employee and supplier relationships. Their cloud-based Vendor Management System will help meet the growing demand of managing flexible workforces. Using their tools, organizations can quickly employ and manage temporary labor force to support business and customer needs. The acquisition is expected to complement the existing capabilities of SAP's Ariba and SuccessFactors. Post the acquisition, SAP's existing customers will be able to manage suppliers and both in-house and external contracted employees. Analysts peg the contingent labor and statement-of-work services market to be worth $3.3 trillion as more and more companies are resorting to variable operating models. Contingent workforces are projected to grow by 30% over the next three years. The acquisition will help SAP address this high-growth market.SAP's Expanding OfferingsSAP has also been extending the deployment of SAP HANA to other fields. Recently, they entered into a strategic collaboration with Stanford School of Medicine to deploy SAP HANA in conducting research regarding the contribution of genetics, environmental exposures, behavior, and other factors to disease susceptibility. SAP also announced participation in the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health to deploy their technology in sharing and analyzing large amounts of genomic and clinical data.SAP's stock is trading at $78.31 with a market capitalization of $93.5 billion.

2609315,75405,2014-10-29T08:08:29-04:00,"SAP reported lower-than-expected earnings in the 3rd quarter of 2014. Total revenue for the software industry giant amounted to $5.4 billion for the quarter.SAP is now refocusing its business towards cloud-based technology, and there is expected to be increased pressure on short-term margins for the company.SAP has made several acquisitions, along with additions to its business, in an effort to move forward with the expansion of cloud-based technology.Investors are having trouble adjusting to the new subscription-based model that is a feature of cloud technologies.Investment in the company is definitely an attractive prospect, especially for long-term investors.","Enterprise Resource System developer SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) reported lower-than-expected earnings in the 3rd quarter of 2014. The company continued its recent adverse trend of performing below expected levels. As a result of the company missing its mark yet again, investor confidence has dropped, as most investors are currently pulling out. Share prices are currently standing at $64.37, which is their lowest point for the year 2014. SAP has also had to adjust its expectations of operating profit downwards, and the overall outlook for the software company has suffered from recent trends. It is important to point out that the outlook for operating income for SAP has been adjusted in order to accommodate the accelerating switch from packaged software to cloud-based software, in line with changing customer demands. SAP's customers are moving to cloud technologies, due to their greater appeal in terms of cost efficiency. However, as the demand for cloud technology accelerates, future revenues for the company are expected to show an increase.Overview of SAP's financial performance for Q3 2014Total revenue for the software industry giant amounted to $5.4 billion for the 3rd quarter of 2014. Revenues showed a 5% increase over and above the previous year, but missed the $5.8 billion mark expected by analysts. Earnings per share for the company amounted to $1.07. The company registered broad-based revenue growth across all of its major business segments. SAP's Software and Support segment generated revenues of $4.2 billion, and recorded a growth of 5% over and above the previous year. The company's Software and Software-Related Service segment also reported growing revenues of 7% over and above the previous year. The most important factor in SAP's financial performance for the quarter, which led to downward adjustment of the outlook for the fiscal year 2014, was the robust 42% revenue growth generated by its Cloud Subscriptions and Support segment. Despite its smaller contribution to total revenue, SAP's cloud subscription business generated the highest growth among all of its operational segments. SAP is now refocusing its business towards cloud-based technology, and there is expected to be increased pressure on short-term margins for the company. SAP reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, showing an increase of almost 15% over the previous year. Full-year operating profit is expected to be in the range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, down from previously expected levels of $7.8 million.Future outlook for SAPSAP has experienced a change in its revenue collection model, as it is now switching towards more subscription-based revenue generation through its cloud business. Upfront revenues will be generated in the coming years through the expansion of SAP's cloud business. The cloud business is surely the next big thing when it comes to enterprise resource systems. The market has been redefined by cloud technology, as traditional software is now less fashionable. Cloud sales for the company will be recognized more gradually over the course of the next 3 years. SAP is currently in its stage of investing upfront in cloud-based technology, which is why profits are temporarily suffering. However, sales and profits will significantly increase over the subsequent years. SAP has made several acquisitions and additions to its business, in an effort to move forward with the expansion of cloud-based technology as a core component of its overall business model. It recently agreed to buy US-based cloud traveling and expense management software producer Concur Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: CNQR). The company is pursuing a broad-based enterprise resource model for cloud technologies, and has acquired HR, e-commerce and workforce applications, namely SuccessFactors, Ariba and Fieldglass, in order to expand its model. SAP's flagship HANA software is the crown jewel of its cloud portfolio, as it is the core component which will be harnessed to offer essential enterprise software products.ConclusionSAP has suffered from a loss in investor confidence over the years. The company has performed below expectations for the majority of the previous quarters. It has missed the mark set by analysts for the better part of the previous 8 quarters. Share prices have shown a downward trend throughout 2014, and are at their low-point for the year currently. However, the current fall in investor confidence is stemming from the massive change in SAP's revenue model. Investors are having trouble adjusting to the new subscription-based model that is a feature of cloud technologies. However, confidence will be restored once they digest the fact that revenues will be realized over the course of the next 3-4 years. The current downward trend in prices might be an ideal opportunity to buy into the stock, as the growth potential from harnessing cloud technologies into enterprise resource models is enormous. In the current quarter, the cloud-based technology division for SAP generated 42% revenue growth. Revenues for SAP are expected to grow as subscriptions are cashed in. Investment in the company is definitely an attractive prospect, especially for long-term investors."

[1] The partnership includes Accenture as the primary services provider and HP as the primary infrastructure provider, while its subsidiary SAP America provides mission-critical product support for the deployment of HANA on a subscription model.We believe the collaboration is a strong attempt from SAP to push forward with its HANA platform as the de-facto industry standard for in-memory application deployments. SAP caught significant attention in the IT industry by marketing the HANA platform as the world's first in-memory computing database. From a revenue perspective, HANA has seen good traction, with fiscal 2013 revenues reaching approximately €664 million (~$882 million). In this article, we take a look at SAP's strategy with HANA and what the partnership with Accenture and HP provides for SAP. We have a $96 Trefis price estimate for SAP against its current market price of $75.SAP Focuses On Bundling HANA With Its ApplicationsSAP HANA, short for High Performance Analytic Appliance, is the company's flagship in-memory database product launched in November 2010. As the company states it, ""SAP HANA converges database and application platform capabilities in-memory to transform transactions, analytics, text analysis, predictive and spatial processing so businesses can operate in real-time."" [2] Clearly, the company's strategy from the above description of its HANA platform is to promote the bundling of the application suite offerings with the real-time, in-memory database HANA platform.What differentiates an in-memory database management system from the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) is the nature of input/output operations surrounding data access. In traditional RDBMS, data is uploaded and downloaded into and out of system memory from the data set stored on hard drives in the storage system supporting the server. In contrast, the in-memory platform loads the entire data set into in the system memory, which is radically expanded. This eliminates the read-write time of the hard disks, allowing real time analytics at much higher speeds.We believe the main objective behind SAP bundling its applications with the HANA platform is to boost the adoption of its HANA platform. Being a market leader in most enterprise software verticals such as ERP, SCM and BI/BW, SAP has the flexibility to bundle these application packages with its in-memory platform for agile provisioning of resources. Faster processing rates and lower latency should benefit businesses with reduced operational costs. In addition to the on-premise deployments of its application suites, SAP has also rolled out an SaaS model of deployments for both its application offerings such as Business Suite and Business Warehouse, as well as the HANA in-memory database module. This should resonate well with customers inclined toward an SaaS deployment rather than the traditional on-premise model.Accenture-HP-SAP Partnership A Win-Win For AllThe collaboration between Accenture, HP and SAP is a win-win scenario, both for the participants and for customers unfamiliar with this new technology. According to the agreement, Accenture is the primary contact and manager for customer implementations of the SAP HANA system. The partnership with Accenture is crucial for SAP, given Accenture's deep operational expertise in the technology domain. Prior to the partnership on SAP HANA, both Accenture and SAP teamed up to launch a new business solutions group focused on jointly developing and delivering industry-specific solutions based on cloud and other digital technologies. [3]We believe the collaboration between SAP and Accenture on deploying industry-specific solutions and implementing customized solutions of the HANA module should boost bookings for the HANA platform. Customers opting for the joint industry-specific offering from SAP and Accenture can also choose to deploy this offering on the SaaS HANA platform for greater operational efficiency. The collaboration in product and service offerings should also simplify the process of purchasing SAP solutions and Accenture services for clients.On the hardware front, these customer-specific solutions are configured on the HP ConvergedSystem 900 infrastructure. HP ConvergedSystems are purpose-built systems designed to handle enormous workload requirements with speed and efficiency. Excellent integration across server, storage and networking makes these systems easy to deploy and manage. Technologically, the ConvergedSystem 900 is an augmented version of the ConvergedSystem 500, which HP introduced specifically for the deployment of SAP HANA solutions in March 2014. [4]The new ConvergedSystem 900 is a massively scalable system and is certified by SAP to deliver up to 12 terabytes of data in a single memory pool to power the most mission-critical business applications. This enables clients to manage and analyze extremely large and diverse data sets from a single system to facilitate real-time business decisions. And because of the collaboration, new systems can be delivered for implementation in as little as 30 days. [5] The highly scalable architecture of the ConvergedSystems ensure up to 100 percent uptime, vital for the running of mission-critical applications such as ERP, SCM and CRM for business operations. This allows SAP to focus entirely on developing and providing mission-critical product support required for industry-specific solutions jointly with Accenture.Disclosure: No positions."

The company has more than 25,000 customers and 25 million active users in more than 150 countries. SAP announced the $8.3 billion Concur buyout in September 2014.Concur certainly is a growth play. Revenue jumped 28% year-over-year to $177 million in Q3 2014 vs. Q3 2013, Concur announced back in August 2014.On The RecordBut now that the buyout is official, where do SAP and Concur go from here? Seeking some answers, I interviewed Tim Minahan, Chief Marketing Officer for SAP Cloud and Robson Grieve, Executive VP of Worldwide Marketing at Concur.During Thursday's interview, Minahan and Grieve described a world where SAP customers will eventually move seamlessly from one SAP cloud application to another, providing an integrated experience as users move from one business or personal task to the next.Or as SAP CEO Bill McDermott said in a prepared statement:Case in point: Over time, CFOs will be able to scan a single report (rather than multiple SaaS application silos) as they seek to understand various company expenses - from travel to marketing, procurement and more, noted Minahan.Challenges And OpportunitiesStill, SAP and Concur don't want to look too far down the road. The core priority right now is to remain customer-focused. According to Minahan:Under SAP's ownership, Concur won't stray from that mission, he said.Buyout integrations can be tricky, but Minahan has extensive experience across SAP's cloud products. And he knows how SAP can best tuck acquired cloud businesses into the larger SAP. After all, Minahan joined SAP through the $4.3 billion Ariba buyout in 2012.""Now that we've got a feel for SAP's view of the world, I can say it's a match both philosophically and strategically,"" said Grieve. ""We're completing each other's sentences in meetings.""Grieve's top priorities for Concur:The prime opportunity: Help SAP engage new types of IT buyers - marketing pros, traveling pros and more - through the web.""We [SAP and Concur] do share a significant number of customers, but there's plenty of room for us to grow,"" said Grieve.Recent ProgressFor its Q3 2014, SAP's cloud revenue jumped 41% and the company's annual cloud revenue run rate reached $1.7 billion, CEO McDermott said during an Oct. earnings call.That's promising. But SAP's overall revenues were about $17 billion in 2013, meaning that the cloud is still only about 10% of the company's business. SAP apparently won't pursue big buyouts to further lift cloud revenues for the next few years.That means SAP will lean heavily on Concur and other cloud assets the company already owns. It's a safe bet SAP and Concur will also lean heavily on strategic partners such as IBM (NYSE:IBM).SAP inked a strategic partnership with IBM back in October to accelerate enterprise cloud adoption. IBM and Concur signed a similar deal back in May. And IBM, of course, competes fiercely against SAP's core rival: Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which also is marching toward more cloud sales.Both SAP and Oracle face a long road ahead in their cloud transformations. I'm not a shareholder in either company, preferring instead to buy and hold faster-growth, pure play SaaS providers like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and WorkDay Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY)."

Annual revenues for FY2013 for the company were more than $22 billion, and the company has a market capitalization of about $91 billion. In addition to commanding market leadership in the ERP market, SAP has a decent share in the Business Intelligence and Analytics and Supply Chain domains.Over the last two quarters, SAP has been mulling ways to break into the cloud services space, primarily through its flagship HANA product. Although the HANA in-memory database accounted for about €664 million ($882 million) or 4% of FY13 revenues, SAP has bundled many of its product offerings across verticals to boost bookings for its HANA platform. Recently, the company announced the launch of subscription-based deployments of various SAP solutions powered by the HANA platform. In the recently concluded Q1FY14, the company posted revenues of $316 million which were 38% higher on a non-IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) basis from SAP solutions deployed over the HANA powered SAP cloud. Comparatively, its rival Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) posted cloud revenues of $292 million with a year-on-year growth rate of 24%.Despite the relative outperformance for SAP against Oracle in the cloud space, the company's stock has fared poorly this year. SAP lost 11% of its stock value since December 31, 2013, while Oracle gained 10% in value during the same period. In part, the fall in stock price is a result of the deferral in its 35% operating profit target from 2015 to 2017. This deferral is because of the company's higher investments into its cloud business, which has fared relatively better than the cloud businesses of its peers in recent times. In addition to the weak performance from SAP's stock, the string of high-level executive exits recently has further impacted investor sentiment. The company's head of cloud business, Shawn White, and the key architect of its flagship HANA platform, Vishal Sikka, left the company last month, fueling speculation of lapses with its cloud-led growth strategy.In this article, we present our rationale for the 25% premium we have on SAP and take a look at potential downsides that could impact our valuation. We have a $95 Trefis price estimate for SAP against its current market price of $76. Rationale For Our $95 Valuation For SAPOur valuation for SAP is strongly substantiated by the executional strength of its senior management team. The management, previously led by chief executive officers, Jim Hagenmann Snabe and Bill McDermott, along with chief technology officer, Mr. Sikka, have provided strong historical performances for SAP in the past. The company has a revenue target of €22 billion (~$29 billion at FY13 EUR-USD conversion rate) and an operating profit margin target of 35% for 2017. [1] From fiscal 2013 levels, this target presents a 7% annualized growth in revenues. Additionally, non-IFRS operating profit margins need to expand from their 2013 level of 32.8%. We believe the company's management team has the capability to drive revenue growth and execute margin expansion in parallel through fiscal 2017.The company's strategy is to push its enterprise software solutions bundled with the HANA platform, so as to improve the operational functionality and business efficiency of its customers. That it is working has boosted, and should continue to boost, HANA sales. Actual on-premise licenses could see revenue acceleration from the bundled offering with HANA. Given the disruptive in-memory technology behind the HANA platform, we should see good adoption from business for the bundled offerings in the near term. We expect this adoption of in-memory technology from business to be fueled by its faster processing rate and lower latency in comparison to traditional memory and hard-disk drive architectures.Moreover, the launch of subscription-based deployments, both for its software solutions such as Business Suite and Business Warehouse, as well as the HANA in-memory database module, should resonate well with its customer base. Although a greater transition to cloud subscriptions should lead to a slowdown in overall revenue growth in the near term, this trend should see a reversal as SaaS subscriptions have fewer subscription periods than on-premise deployments. This lower subscription period for on-demand licenses should drive incremental revenues higher over the course of the actual on-premise license.The company's margin targets are expected to be met from lower cost of revenues and a realigned business structure to accommodate the increasing shift to cloud offerings. As reported by the Wall Street Journal on May 13, management plans modest work force changes, reducing the number of employees supporting on-premise deployments and adding employees with different skills to support SaaS offerings. This should lead to lower selling expenses, boosting operating margins. Additionally, cloud offerings have higher gross margins compared to on-premise offerings. This is because despite the data center costs involved for cloud offerings, other associated costs are lower. This is evident from Salesforce's gross profit margins, which stand at 85% compared to 81% for SAP.Downside Risk Associated With Our ValuationOne of the key downside risks associated with our valuation is the ability of the company to execute on its 2017 top line and margin targets. With the departure of key senior executives from its most important business divisions such as cloud and HANA, the risk attached to a further deferral in its target has increased some. In recent Q1FY14 results, quarterly revenues fell short of analyst estimates. This particular trend could continue in the near term, particularly as a result of the departure of key executives in its management team. We believe the company's Q2FY14 performance pivots on the execution skills of Mr. McDermott, who is expected to become the sole CEO of SAP on May 21, and his team.We are cautiously optimistic on our current valuation for SAP and expect to factor in these downside risks post the company's performance in Q2FY14.

2071243,20521,2014-03-06T08:14:18-05:00,,"According to a report published last year, the worldwide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) market continues to be dominated by SAP which holds a 24.6% market share. Overall, in 2012, the ERP market grew 2.2% over the year and SaaS-based ERP offerings accounted for 13% of the global ERP market. Gartner projects that the contribution of SaaS-based ERP solutions will continue to increase and expects it to account for 20% of the global ERP market by the year 2016.SAP's FinancialsFor the recently ended quarter, SAP (NYSE: SAP) saw Q4 revenues grow 7% over the year to € 5.1 billion (~$6.9 billion), in line with market estimates. EPS of €1.11 (~$1.62) was ahead of the Street's projections of $1.59 for the quarter. By segment, support revenues grew 10% to €2.3 billion (~$3.1 billion) and revenues from software and cloud subscriptions grew 6% to €2.1 billion (~$2.8 billion).Revenues for the year grew 8% over the year to €16.9 billion (~$22.7 billion) with earnings improving 11% to €3.03 (~$4.08) per share.SAP expects to end the current year with cloud subscription and support revenues at €0.95-€1.00 billion (~$1.28-$1.34 billion). They expect the other software-related service revenues to grow by 6%-8% during the year.SAP's Ambitious OutlookKeeping with the current trend, SAP is also driving their cloud-based revenues and is projecting growth in that segment to help drive their total revenues to at least €22 billion (~$30 billion) by the year 2017. That is an ambitious target for SAP considering that they ended the current year with revenues of $22.7 billion.But considering the growth they are seeing within their cloud initiatives, it does look achievable. Not only their acquisitions, but their home-grown products are also delivering strong results. Their annual cloud revenue run rate is now more than €1.06 billion (~$1.5 billion) and they now have more than 35 million total cloud portfolio applications subscribers. Ariba, their Web-based business trading community, has also seen strong adoption and is operating at spend volumes of more than $0.5 trillion with 1.4 million connected companies. During the last year, their biggest growth driver was SAP HANA, which now has more than 3,000 customers with annual revenues of €664 million (~$898 million). HANA is their fastest selling product ever.Additionally, they are also growing their geographic footprint. They have increased their market presence within the financial services sector in the APAC markets and have delivered their products to more than 20 banks and 10 insurance companies in the region last quarter.Besides continuing to grow these offerings, I expect SAP to keep acquiring as well. They could look at adding companies like online marketing services provider Marketo to their portfolio to build their cloud based offerings as well as to compete with Oracle's recent Responsys and Eloqua acquisitions. Another interesting company to acquire would be sales compensation vendor Xactly.SAP's stock is trading at $78.87 with a market capitalization of $94.2 billion.

Non-IFRS revenues from the Asia-Pacific region stood at €2.86 billion in FY13, up 8% from a year ago in constant currency terms. Non-IFRS software and software-related service revenues from the region grew at a double digit pace of 10% in fiscal 2013.

[1] These investments could arise from a number of verticals as industries across the business spectrum chase higher profitability in a weak environment. Be it consumer retail, banking or core manufacturing, IT investments in 2014 will be done with customer experience innovation as its main objective.Gartner expects growth in Chinese IT spending to accelerate to 8.7% in 2014 from 6.7% in 2013, while overall APAC IT investments are expected to grow 5.5% to reach $767 billion in 2014. [2] E-commerce in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the strongest driver this year, driven by the burgeoning Chinese e-commerce industry. Forrester estimates that the total number of online buyers from China in 2014 would reach close to 356 million, surpassing the entire population of the U.S. [1] Building such scale requires significant investments into upgrading the existing IT infrastructure without depressing profitability in a weak macroeconomic environment, which is provided by the changing face of the global IT systems market. Leaner SaaS deployments reduce hardware footprint for enterprises and provide avenues to reinvest savings from a leaner IT system into its operations.Similarly, industries such as healthcare, government, communications and manufacturing are expected to offer the greatest opportunities for technology vendors, with IT investments driven by a strong affinity for automation across these industries. IDC states that investments into the manufacturing industry would help drive visibility into the supply chain and facilitate the ability to take decisions in real-time. [3] Real-time data analytics is expected to percolate across all industries eventually as customer experience becomes paramount for all enterprises, which should benefit SAP’s strategy to deploy application software suites on its high performance in-memory computing platform HANA.In the financial services vertical, SAP reported a significant market gain in 2013, with more than 20 banks and 10 insurance companies opting for SAP solutions. [4] Financial institutions in the Asia-Pacific region are leading the way into mobile financial services, providing a convenient and simple experience for customers, and are quickly becoming the main communication and marketing channel. [5] According to an IDC white-paper, online banking platforms were preferred by close to 57% of Asia-Pacific customers, with ATM and mobile banking services accounting for 26% and 5% of customers. [6] In the next five years, credit-card driven transaction volume in Asia-Pacific is expected to increase from $5.3 billion in 2012 to $13 billion by 2018. [7] This shift towards cashless transaction services, driven by online and mobile banking services, should lead to higher IT investments in the industry going forward.We expect to see an increase in overall IT spending in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by an increase in automation of services to cater to better customer experiences that should expand revenue share of the Asia-Pacific geography for software vendors such as SAP. We intend to provide more in-depth IT trends covering specific industries and geographies in the future.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
2148133,23479,2014-04-17T15:53:38-04:00,,"First quarter results for SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), reported on April 17, fell short of analyst expectations. The German software developer reported IFRS revenues of €3.7 billion ($5.11 billion U.S.) compared to our estimate of €3.8 billion ($5.25 billion U.S.). Consensus first quarter estimates for SAP also were approximately €3.8 billion. Non-IFRS revenues, which exclude currency fluctuations and deferred revenue adjustments, expanded 6% to reach €3.9 billion ($5.39 billion U.S.) for the first quarter.The company continued to impressively scale its on-demand business. IFRS cloud revenues grew a 60% to €219 million ($302.64 million U.S.) over the prior year level, which excludes the deferred revenue of acquired businesses. More tellingly, non-IFRS revenues for the company (excluding currency effects and including this deferred revenue) expanded 38% year-on-year to reach €231 million ($319.22 million U.S.) for the quarter. This revenue growth rate of 38% stands higher than its earlier guidance for FY14. We believe the acceleration in cloud revenues for SAP is a result of strong demand for cloud solutions powered by SAP HANA, in addition to good operational performances from Ariba, SuccessFactors and hybris. Going forward, we expect further acceleration in revenue growth for the cloud business through organic and inorganic channels to meet its 2017 revenue target of €3 billion - €3.5 billion ($4.15 billion - $4.84. billion U.S.).However, revenues from on-premise software offerings declined in the quarter. New license revenues for on-premise offerings stood at €623 million ($860.92 million U.S.), 5% lower than revenues from a similar period last fiscal. Comparatively, new license revenues for on-premise offerings from SAP were 3% higher in Q1FY13 on a year-on-year basis. In this earnings note, we present a quick takeaway of SAP's Q1FY14 earnings.Is SAP Sacrificing On-Premise Growth To Expand Cloud Footprint?The on-demand business for SAP has shown strong momentum since its inception. In fact, in the first quarter, it attained an annual revenue run-rate (including both subscription and support and cloud-related professional services revenues) of €1.1 billion ($1.52 billion U.S.). Comparatively, cloud revenue run-rate for fiscal 2013 at the end of Q1FY13 stood at €840 million (1.16 billion U.S.). Fiscal 2013 cloud revenues ended at €787 million, lower than the actual revenue run-rate due to business seasonality. Accounting for seasonality in subscriptions, overall FY14 revenues for the cloud business should be comparatively lower than the calculated run-rate of €1.1 billion ($1.52 billion U.S.). The company previously guided cloud revenues between €950 million - €1 billion for FY14, which looks more plausible at the moment.However, on-premise sales have taken a beating this quarter, falling 5% on an IFRS basis. This fall in IFRS revenues is much steeper compared to previous quarters. In the recently concluded fiscal 2013, SAP reported a 2% decline in software (new license) revenues on an IFRS basis. Even on a non-IFRS constant currency basis, revenue recognition slowed down considerably. Non-IFRS constant currency revenues for new on-premise licenses expanded by 1% this quarter, compared to 4% for fiscal 2013.A slowdown in new license revenues may well have been augmented by SAP's aggressive push into developing its on-demand business. Businesses usually find the cloud model easier to deploy and consume at reduced costs, despite concerns on data privacy and security. This enterprise shift to on-demand consumption of IT solutions impacted many legacy software players such as SAP, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in recent times. The company has lost its CRM market leadership to pure-play operator Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) in 2012, and has been under pressure from other cloud operators such as NetSuite (NYSE:N) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) in the ERP and HCM verticals.With its focused cloud strategy, SAP is benefiting from the move to cloud-based solutions as customers cut back in investments in more traditional architectures. Longer term, this strategy of funneling growth in new licenses onto its cloud offerings should bode well for the company. However, we could see a decline in new license sales for the company for the next few quarters as customers shift from on-premise deployments to its cloud offerings.We are currently reviewing our $95 Trefis price estimate for SAP and will follow up with a detailed analysis of the Q1FY14 earnings for the company.Disclosure: No positions."
2143193,23479,2014-04-15T15:49:23-04:00,,"German software developer SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) is scheduled to report first quarter results Thursday, April 17. We expect revenues of approximately €3.8 billion for the quarter, indicating a 6% year-on-year growth for the company. Revenues from the same period in fiscal 2013 grew 7.5% to reach €3.6 billion. In dollar terms, revenue growth rate for Q1FY13 stood at a slightly higher level of 8.3% compared to Q1FY12. This higher dollar growth rate signifies a stronger euro against the U.S. dollar. For Q1FY14, the euro – dollar conversion rate from the European Central Bank stands at 1.3696 compared to 1.3206 and 1.3108 during Q1FY13 and Q1FY12. This further appreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar should boost revenue growth rate in dollar terms this quarter.What is more significant this quarter is the performance of its cloud revenues, which grew very rapidly last year. Cloud subscription and support revenues for SAP expanded from €35 million in Q1FY12 to €167 million in Q1FY13. This represents a massive five-fold growth in cloud revenues on a year-on-year basis. For entire fiscal 2014, SAP has a €950 million – €1,000 million revenue forecast from cloud subscriptions and support. We expect strong double-digit growth in cloud subscriptions revenues for SAP this quarter. However, the company’s operating margins are expected to be subdued this fiscal, in line with SAP’s guidance of a deferral in its profitability target to 2017. The company plans to accelerate its investments into its cloud unit to boost sales growth further, which impacts profitability in the short term.We currently have a $95 Trefis price estimate for SAP, which stands at a 20% premium to its market price of $79. We will be revising our price estimate once the company files its Q1 results with the SEC.Demand For In-Memory Computing Should Drive Revenues For HANA In 2014Technology research firm Gartner predicts good adoption of in-memory computing technology in 2014, as deployments into business-critical computing environments in the enterprises deliver high-impact business value. [1] We believe SAP is positioned well to capture this growth in demand for in-memory computing technologies through its High-Performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) platform. The company’s HANA platform is the first-of-its-kind in-memory database that offers converged Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) of data.Last quarter, SAP generated revenues of €633 million (~$841 million) which was lower than its guidance range of €650 million – €700 million. This shortfall in revenues for the HANA platform was a result of adverse currency fluctuations in fiscal 2013. In terms of year-on-year growth rate, revenues for SAP HANA expanded close to 62% from €392 million in fiscal 2012. We expect this strong performance to continue in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by the business functionality of the HANA offering. Bundled offerings of its application suites on the HANA platform have seen strong growth from enterprises, and the launch of subscription-based solutions powered by SAP HANA should boost both HANA revenues and application revenues for SAP in 2014. [2]Integration Between HCM And SCM Solutions Should Bode Well For SAP’s Cloud Growth StrategySAP recently announced the acquisition of Fieldglass, a human capital management firm that operates in the Vendor Management System (VMS) space. It utilizes the on-demand service model to manage vendors who provide contingent labor management solutions. This acquisition should bode well for SAP’s cloud strategy, especially given the synergies that the company can unlock by integrating offerings from its earlier acquisition of Ariba, a supply chain and business network organization.Integrated offerings from Fieldglass and Ariba should provide end-to-end solutions for the 1.4 million businesses registered on the Ariba network. Ariba provides procurement and other supply chain related solutions within its supplier network. To this, Fieldglass adds its vendor souring for temporary contract worker solutions suitable, complementing Ariba’s end-to-end solutions for business. The Fieldglass acquisition is expected to be complete by the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We are of the view that a synergistic portfolio should boost cloud revenues for SAP in 2014.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
2039963,23479,2014-02-21T15:51:24-05:00,,"Quick TakeFiscal 2013 results for Enterprise software giant SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) have been impressive from a cloud perspective. The division reported a triple digit growth in total cloud revenues in 2013, with a strong double digit growth in its organic cloud business. The HANA platform, which is key to SAP’s long term strategy, also witnessed renewed customer interest towards the end of the year, driven by the launch of SAP Suite on HANA offerings. However, the company’s stock has been under-performing other legacy software companies since the beginning of 2014. SAP AG has shed 5% in value compared to 0.74% among other legacy software players such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Recently, the company held an Investor Symposium where SAP presented deep insights into its strategy for the future. The HANA platform is key to the company’s long term success. In this note, we present various trends that we expect to see from SAP in the future. We have revised our SAP price estimate to $95 following sound fundamentals and strong growth prospects for the company.Cloud Push Backed By HANA Should Provide Strong GrowthIn the recently concluded fiscal 2013, SAP reported cloud subscription and service revenues of $1.3 billion, up 121% from last year’s $586 million. Excluding inorganic growth (most notably its acquisition of Hybris), SAP grew its cloud business 32% on a like-for-like basis between 2012 and 2013. [1] The company has a 32% growth rate forecast going into fiscal 2014 for its cloud business, with a revenue estimate of ~$1.3 billion from cloud subscriptions compared to $1 billion in FY13. [1] Furthermore, the benefits of in-memory computing have provided formidable support to SAP’s HANA platform. Constant currency revenues stood at €664 million for the in-memory platform in 2013, in line with its guidance of €650 million - €700 million.SAP plans to collapse its entire service offerings across five different market categories, namely cloud, mobile, analytics, applications and database, onto the HANA platform. This considerably simplifies the customer’s IT landscape and reduces its data footprint, consolidating applications and data that in other architechtures reside on multiple systems. Due to its in-memory technology, SAP HANA allows for the real-time analysis of work-loads, eliminating the read-write cycles key to traditional data analytic implementations. Given the current focus on Big Data analytics, HANA is generating significant momentum for the company, both in on-premise and Cloud implementations.In short, HANA erases multiple copies of data stored across a company’s ERP, CRM and SCM systems onto a unified integrated platform where an entire data set can be loaded from disk storage into memory. Going forward, businesses would face enormous pressure in tackling the growing total cost of ownership (TCO) of dedicated hardware systems for transactional and analytic processing. And it is fully integrated into SAP’s alternative on-premise and Cloud solutions to accommodate the full range of requirements in the Enterprise marketplace. We plan to analyze this in greater detail in future articles.Additionally, SAP could look to focus more on predictive analytics solutions by completely integrating its latest acquisition, KXEN, within this offering. [2] KXEN provides predictive analytics solutions to make better decisions on petabytes of big data for many companies such as Bank of America, CBS Interactive, ING Direct, Meredith Corporation and Vodafone. Given the exponential increase in data generated and stored globally in coming years, the integration of KXEN and HANA creates a cohesive in-memory predictive analytics platform that would help reduce the cost of lead generation from this expansion in big data for SAP’s and KXEN’s customers, irrespective of the industry it operates in. We believe SAP’s success in the future depends on businesses adopting the HANA platform for both new and ported implementations. We expect the company to aggressively expand its offerings on the platform going forward to drive revenue growth.Competitive Pressure From Pureplay Cloud Players Short-livedSAP’s market share in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) market globally has shrunk since 2008 due to the rise of pureplay cloud service providers such as Salesforce, Workday and Netsuite. According to Gartner, SAP’s CRM market share has decreased from a commanding 25.5% in 2007 to 12.9% by 2012. [3] [4] Salesforce has dominated the global CRM market in recent times with its on-demand CRM offering. Similarly, Workday and Netsuite have strong on-demand SaaS offerings in the Human Capital Management (HCM) and ERP space. These players have enjoyed strong top line growth since 2008 due to a variety of factors listed below, which contributed to an inflation in their market share.Post the recessionary period of 2008-09, businesses chose to cut costs by collapsing their IT hardware infrastructure on SaaS providers and consuming software as a service instead of the usual on-premise model. This resulted in a rapid expansion in the customer roster for these cloud players, driven by small and medium enterprise businesses. Additionally, the lack of strong competition from legacy software companies such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft and IBM in the cloud services space during the 2008-09 period has contributed to ballooning revenue growth rates for these companies.However, we expect this expansion to stay tempered going forward as these legacy software players begin their offering cloud-based application deployment models. While the move to cloud expands the addressable market for legacy software players, the addressable market for pureplay cloud players has less upside for the pure plays. SAP estimates to double its addressable market from $110 billion in 2010 to $230 billion by 2015, and increase to $350 billion by 2020, with growth in cloud, mobile and database technology businesses. [5] [6] This huge increase in its addressable market should present strong revenue generation opportunities for SAP. We believe SAP would begin grabbing lost market share from these cloud players in the years to come with a strong and aggressive move to cloud through the HANA platform.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1963641,23479,2014-01-23T15:19:17-05:00,,"German enterprise software manufacturer SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) reported an impressive set of fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results on January 21, 2014; beating our revenue and operating profit estimates. Fiscal revenues for the company was marginally higher than our estimate, at $22.34 billion vs. an estimated $22.26 billion. Although software revenues were 3% lower than their 2012 figures in reported terms, they were 2% higher on a constant currency basis. SAP continued to impressively scale its cloud division, with subscription revenues of €787 million (~$1,045 million), higher than the company's guidance of €750 million (~$996 million). For fiscal 2014, the company has a revenue target of €950 million - €1,000 million (~$1.28 billion - $1.35 billion at current exchange rates) from cloud subscription and support revenues, indicating a projected base growth rate of 21% year-on-year for the division.While macroeconomic factors and industry trends have contributed in part to this cloud revenue growth rate, the company's HANA platform was a major driver for SAP's cloud strategy as well. As a high performance in-memory computing platform, HANA now includes SAPs full range of products, either on-premise or via the Cloud. And as a Cloud implementation, HANA is generating strong demand outside the Enterprise, among smaller commercial customers. Revenues from the in-memory computing HANA platform were marginally lower than guided figures at €633 million (~$841 million), impacted by significant currency volatility in 2013. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenues from the HANA platform were €664 million (~$882 million), within the range €650 million - €700 million (~$863 million - $930 million) range provided by the company.SAP's operating profit was also above our estimates for fiscal 2013, at $5.95 billion compared to an estimate of $5.57 billion. IFRS operating margins were for the fiscal stood at 26.7% compared to our estimate of 25.1%, favored by a lower than expected stock-based compensation expense and its adoption of cloud services. In the long term, SAP's strategy of becoming a cloud service provider, rather than solely an on-premise software vendor, should contribute to an expansion in operating margins. The company has an operating profit margin target of 35% by 2017, indicating the scope to expand in adopting a cloud-based business model.Despite its strong business performance, the company's stock has seen some weakness since the launch of its unaudited results on January 10, 2014, where management delayed profitability prospects from the cloud division from 2015 to 2017. This resulted in SAP's stock shedding close to 4% in value since January 10, 2014. In this earnings note, we present crucial takeaways from its FY13 earnings release. We have a Trefis price estimate of $80 for SAP which is under revision to reflect the recent FY13 results for SAP.SAP Targets Pure-play Cloud Players Such As Salesforce.com With HANA Powered CloudIn its FY13 earnings call, CEO Bill McDermott stated that SAP aspires to become the world's leading cloud company, from being second in terms of revenues currently. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is the leading player within the $17 billion SaaS industry, with revenues estimated to touch $4 billion for the fiscal ending January 31, 2014. In comparison, SAP had cloud subscription and support revenues of approximately $1.3 billion in 2013. However, the company is the largest cloud service provider, with a user base of approximately 35 million. With the SaaS market evolving rapidly, SAP plans to target pure-play cloud service providers such as Salesforce and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) going forward, with an aggressive push into cloud. This is supported by the strong cloud pipeline it has, both in terms of deferred revenues and contracted revenues. Deferred cloud revenues and cloud backlog revenues stand at €443 million and €1.2 billion respectively as of December 31, 2013.Powering the SAP Cloud is its high performance analytical platform, HANA. Revenues from HANA were approximately $882 million in 2013 while revenues since the launch of the platform in November 2010 were about $1,600 million. In addition to generating more than half of its overall revenues in 2013, the HANA platform witnessed greater traction during the last quarter. Revenues from SAP HANA in Q4 accounted for more than 47% of its entire fiscal 2013 revenues, reinforced by the newly launched HANA Enterprise Cloud launched in May 2013.Additionally, the HANA plus Business Suite bundle has seen strong growth, gaining close to 750 customers since launch. Going forward, we should see strong growth in the SAP HANA platform, especially on the on-demand front, as a result of the platform's integration with other enterprise application software. Integrating application software with the HANA platform provides the customer with reduced hardware load by collapsing the entire IT stack required by the application onto HANA. We believe SAP's focus on transforming itself into a pure-play cloud operator bodes well with the company's offerings, contributing to significant future revenue growth.Delayed Profitability Guidance Shouldn't Depress Stock ValueSAP's results have been relatively strong compared to other mega-cap software competitors such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). However, the stock has been subject to pessimistic views about the company's profitability. While the company's strategy in moving its entire product offering to an on-demand model is a huge move, SAP has not faced any executional challenges so far and results have been strong from the company. Revenues from SAP's cloud division, which includes both subscription and support businesses, stood at €975 million (~$1.3 billion) compared to €456 million in 2012 (~$586 million).Similarly, net income from the division increased to €140 million (~$186 million) compared to a loss of (-€51) million (~(-$66) million) in 2012. Moreover, SAP's recurring revenue ratio has expanded from 39% in fiscal 2007 to 57% in fiscal 2013. Recurring revenue ratio represents the amount of incremental revenue generated from a customer on an annualized basis, and is a crucial metric for a company operating under an SaaS model. We expect this recurring revenue ratio to expand further due to an increase in investments in growing its cloud market share. These investments in supporting its cloud business growth have resulted in the company delaying its 35% operating profit margin target from 2015 to 2017. We don't expect the delayed profitability guidance to impact the company's stock price negatively and believe this to be a prudent move, given the scale SAP could build within the cloud software industry."
1684462,54502,2013-09-10T12:32:06-04:00,,"SAP is the first name that comes to mind when thinking of ERP software, as it is one of the largest and most trusted software companies in the world for ERP solutions.The German company is renowned for providing ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) based business solutions. Besides ERP, it also provides data warehousing and data mining solutions. Recently, the focal point of SAP has been on business solutions in public and private cloud computing and this has helped it grow revenue and perform well financially even in times of distress.Financial performanceIn the second quarter results declared recently, SAP's revenue grew 8% year over year to $5.3 billion. The growth was driven by higher revenue from support services, which was up by 11%. Software and software based services witnessed a growth of 10% and cloud enabled solutions reported 7% growth. This growth was achieved despite pressure in Asian countries, especially China.The company saw outstanding performance in Brazil and Latin America for its software services and cloud enabled solutions, which resulted in a year over year regional growth of 18%. Despite an uncertain EMEA market, it still recorded year to year growth of 3% from its software services and cloud solutions. But as mentioned earlier, it saw a setback in Asia Pacific & Japan with 7% decline in revenue.SAP continues to generate an impressive cash flow of $3.2 billion, up by 3% year over year, while there was phenomenal growth of 37% in cash and cash equivalents that amounted to $4.4 billion.SAP's major acquisitions and innovations have helped it dominate the cloud and this has started showing positive results in terms of comparative revenue growth and its acquisition based strategy of growth should lead to more revenue growth in the future.Looking aheadSAP's latest acquisition of hybris, an e-commerce vendor, will enable it to venture into omni-channel commerce. The total estimated market size of this segment is around $37 billion according to analysts. With hybris being a leader in commerce solutions, its combination with SAP's expertise should lead to synergies and help it capture a portion of this sector.Also, SAP's HANA should be one of the major contributors to its revenue growth as businesses move to the cloud around the world. SAP HANA is targeting revenue of around $500 million to $545 million in the current fiscal year. SAP expects an increase in its revenue from cloud subscription services and software by 14% to 20% this year which is an impressive expected rate of growth.In India, SAP has joined hands with Wipro for providing SAP HANA solutions. Since the Indian market is still nascent as far as cloud computing is concerned and Wipro is a leading software company in India, the partnership would be beneficial for SAP as Wipro has a huge client base with over 140,000 clients spread in over 57 countries.Other playersSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a company with its core business model being CRM (Customer Relationship Management) on the cloud. The company has been awarded for being the world's most innovative company for 2 consecutive years by Forbes and for CRM excellence by Gartner and many more.Salesforce is one of the direct competitors of SAP. Just before SAP acquired hybris, Salesforce had announced that it would be acquiring ExactTarget for $2.5 billion. ExactTarget's solutions are focused on multi-channel marketing automation and the company has around 6,000 customers including the likes of Nike and Coca-Cola. So this deal should lead to further growth for Salesforce which is already growing at a fast rate.Its revenue the first quarter was $892.6 million, a growth of 28% over last year and the new deal should bring in more customers and enable Salesforce to keep its revenue growth rate intact.CGI Group (NYSE:GIB) is another provider of IT solutions with operations in over 40 countries around the globe. It also has a history of acquisitions. Its recent acquisitions include major software companies like American Management System, Stanley Inc, and the most recent in 2012 was Logica. The core business of the company is providing business solutions and consultancy.The company has been growing rapidly as it reported revenue of $2.6 billion in its recent quarter, a huge growth of 141% year over year. Logica has been the company's biggest ever acquisition and CGI is working to integrate it into its business. CGI has decided to eliminate Logica's low-margin contracts as it is intent on improving overall quality and moves like these should lead to improved margins.ConclusionLooking at SAP's innovations and tie ups to profit from ""Business solutions on the Cloud"" I think that the company is in a good position to increase its revenue. Its year over year growth even in uncertain global economic conditions shows its strength and the necessity of its products. As more businesses move to the cloud, SAP's performances will improve and investors would benefit.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1859681,23479,2013-11-24T08:08:53-05:00,,"With a market capitalization of $99 billion, SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) is a German enterprise that develops various Customer Relationship Management, Business Process Management and Business Operation Management software products. It is the largest software developer in the European region and the fourth largest in the world, with revenues over $20 billion. The company has traditionally competed with Large Cap On-premise Enterprise software development companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). However, the dawn of the hyper-growth Cloud Computing industry has contributed to a slow erosion in On-premise software revenues.In the January through September 2013 period, SAP reported a 4% decline (in Euros) in traditional On-premise software new license revenues from the prior-year period. However, in USD terms, the decline was relatively lower at 1.3% due to a strengthening Euro against the Dollar. During the same period, new Cloud subscription revenues increased 238% to reach €488 million. Weak dollar performance in 2013 helped SAP post a revenue growth of 248% to $643 million in the nine months so far. To help support its growth in Cloud-based services, and also to help offset the decline in On-premise software sales, SAP has begun bundling its Cloud application software with its high-performance HANA in-memory platform.The present note focuses on SAP's on-going shift to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model and its influence on new Cloud subscription revenues for the company.The option of deploying both its Cloud and On-premise offerings on the HANA platform has helped SAP increase the Cloud subscription revenues it generates. The On-premise option benefits large Enterprises that deal with huge sets of data within the confines of their own secure networks. Additionally, these mostly large companies can offer HANA within their own secure Private Clouds. More importantly, HANA can now be deployed in the public Cloud by third party providers (most notably Amazon's AWS), which opens the power of this especially expensive hardware / software platform to small and medium business (SMB) enterprises that are better served by the leaner SaaS model. This is evident from the fact that Cloud adoption from SMB organizations increased 30% in revenues in 2012 and is expected to grow at a compounded rate of 28% annually between 2012 and 2015.The primary reason for this rapid move to the Cloud by smaller enterprises stems from the fact that SaaS eliminates the need for huge upfront investments into physical IT infrastructure. This has leveled the playing field across various Application software markets. An example of this would be the exemplary success of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), the global leader in On-demand CRM software. In comparison, large organizations have adopted similar Cloud services at a lower pace because of the security risk attached to having entire data sets off-premises at an external data center. The recent snooping activities by the National Security Agency (NYSE:NSA) has increased the concern for security. Accordingly, large corporations are often reluctant to deploy their data and applications onto Cloud despite their significant positives.Going forward, we should see strong growth in new Cloud subscription revenues for SAP, driven by its leadership position across its Application software portfolio and the increased integration of its HANA platform. Currently, 77 SAP applications are being offered as a bundle with the HANA platform and more are expected to follow suit. As more applications are offered on the HANA platform, its functionality grows; large applications gain the advantage of increased processing and application handling without a reduction in security. Additionally, large enterprises should benefit from SAP's latest HANA Enterprise Cloud offering that gives organizations a hybrid Cloud approach. Although current application deployments on hybrid Clouds are at present less common, Gartner estimates that 50% of global large enterprises will have hybrid cloud deployments by 2017. Through the on-demand option, SMB organizations stand to leverage HANA's high performance capabilities at lower prices.On the flip side, SAP's growth in cloud subscriptions could be contained as smaller players continue to offer point solutions for the Cloud at lower cost. Additionally, the recently launched 'Salesforce1′ mobile platform will be a strong competitor to SAP's applications on cloud, especially its CRM applications. CRM application sales account for approximately 17% of SAP's stock valuation, and an increase in migration towards Salesforce could create a downside for SAP's valuation.Disclosure: No positions"
1465711,24550,2013-05-28T19:20:55-04:00,,"Earlier this month SAP (NYSE:SAP) hosted the 2013 version of its user conference, Sapphire. I spent three days taking a look at how much progress SAP has made in adapting and changing its business to meet the shifting landscape in enterprise software. I could spend a lot of time here going through every announcement and updating every area of SAP's business, but honestly so many of my colleagues have already published that sort of thing and it would be redundant to join them. So instead let's focus on the overarching change that is core to SAP's future growth -- its move to the cloud.Every traditional enterprise software vendor is dealing with the need to maintain its current (mostly on premises and hosted) customers while building out a cloud portfolio of offerings, and a strategy for transitioning its business and current customers. I've written about this quite a lot (see here) so I won't go through all the issues. Instead, I want to look at what SAP is doing and how far it has progressed.SAP has gone through several iterations of its cloud strategy over the past three to four years. The ""original"" strategy, or at least the earliest one that I know of, was to build out a mid-market SaaS platform and ERP suite and then over time use what they learn with that platform to move the whole Business Suite to the cloud. It's a bit fuzzy how that would have happened, but since it's not a relevant strategy at this point, analyzing that would only be an exercise in irreverent conjecture. That suite is called Business ByDesign. It originally had some issues and was not aggressively sold, but once those were resolved, it has stayed in the product portfolio as the mid-market SaaS ERP offering. Although, in reality, you hear very little about it these days.With the BbyD platform strategy focused on mid-market, SAP then went in a few directions -- building/buying a cloud line of business apps that could be sold around core enterprise ERP, and a platform strategy that involved a few platforms built and bought. Again, not much point in going through all the platform iterations, because except for River (more on this later), none of those seem to fit into the current strategy.Two unrelated ""events"" refocused these efforts -- the purchase of SuccessFactors in December 2011 (and subsequent appointment of former SuccessFactors CEO Lars Dalgaard to the executive board with responsibility for SAP cloud) and the development of the HANA in-memory technology. Most of 2012 was spent sorting out the strategy, with one significant acquisition: Ariba. As of Sapphire this year, though, with credit to Lars and the team he built, that strategy is very clear. Here are the details:SAP is making progress in executing on its cloud strategy. The concept of focusing on higher value LOB apps seems to be paying off, and finally having a single cloud platform story should prove to be a great decision. The one hole still remains, though: What's the next generation of the Business Suite that gets it to the public cloud? As with any transition, in the end it's about execution, so the story will play out over the next few years."
1575182,48021,2013-07-26T05:40:58-04:00,,"The story has gone viral: ""SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) misses estimates"" or ""SAP delivers disappointing results."" We should pause and ponder for a moment. Did the company grow earnings or did it miss estimates? We should think of the most important factor to investors. Is SAP expensive or cheap in line with the current growth trends? Looking behind the negative stories, the present weakness in SAP may provide a great business opportunity for investors. The company is presently valued at 19 times forward earnings, suggesting the market is expecting a moderate growth over the next few years.FinancialSAP reported second quarter earnings of $0.97 per share. This was in line with the expectations of analysts covering the company. The figure also exceeds last year's second quarter results by 4.29%. However, SAP's revenues were $5.37 billion versus $5.56 billion expected by analysts. Consequently, the company's shares fell 2.3% in European markets. Still, SAP's net profit rose 10% to $958.14 million, a performance that makes many organizations green with envy.The Weak SpotThe company's software licenses were the weak spot, while cloud subscription revenues increased 7% to $1.55 billion. The slowdown in China made sales in Asia to drop 9%. Despite this, SAP actually gained software market share from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). The company also won numerous cloud deals against Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). It sounds logical to assume that SAP's core business operations can drive growth opportunities. The software licenses revenue could have disappointed last quarter, but it may also provide a big boost for the company in the next few quarters.Definitely, there are issues that will raise questions going forward, like the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the shift in spending on web-based applications. But on the other hand, SAP is reaching the most important part of the year with database products and programs that are accessible online. This sets the stage for a potentially profitable third quarter.HeadwindsSAP's financials were respectable for an organization of its size, confronted by product cycle headwinds and a tough macroeconomic environment. However, its progress should not be seen in relation to the expectations of experts but in consonance with its valuation. Is the company justifying its price? This should be the main issue.PeersTwo companies that can best be compared with SAP are Oracle and Accenture (NYSE:ACN). The forward valuations of these two stocks are in the 10 to 16 range. So SAP appears to be priced slightly higher than its peers. Of course, Oracle has been growing its business through its strength in cloud. Its earnings were up 10% in the last quarterly report compared to the same period in the year prior. However, it reported sales that missed estimates. Total revenues were unchanged from the same quarter last year at $10.9 billion. That performance fell short of the $11.1 billion analysts had expected on average. Even though analysts were disappointed, it certainly appears to be an interesting pick given that it is priced cheaper than its peers.Accenture, which helps enterprises to install SAP software, reported net revenues of $7.2 billion in its last report, an increase of 1% year-over-year. However, the revenue fell below the company's guided range of $7.25 billion to $7.50 billion. Its report showed that customers deferred decisions on short-term consulting contracts.We can also compare SAP to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Microsoft carries a forward P/E of 10.51, with analysts' expectation high enough that the five-year PEG ratio is just above 1. It is priced cheaper going forward than IBM (13.95), SAP (18.87), and Accenture (16.35). Only Oracle (10.28) offers a cheaper valuation. We note that Microsoft missed analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter report, and its stock fell 3.4%.IBM is, in a sense, the most profitable of all the stocks we have mentioned here. On a return to equity of 82.78%, it is more attractive than Oracle (24.49%), Microsoft (30.09%), SAP (21.82%), and Accenture (66.61%). However, we should be concerned that it has a debt/equity of 190.81%, compared with 26.84% for SAP, 16.20% for Microsoft, and 18.49% for Oracle.ConclusionFrom a valuation standpoint, SAP AG offers investors EPS growth of 3.88 in 2014. At a 14.65% growth rate in the past five years, it has grown faster than Microsoft (11.68%) and Accenture (10.58%). Only Oracle (17.59%) and IBM (15.77%) have grown faster. SAP offers a return on equity of 21.82%, above the industry average of 16.9%. In addition to this attractive valuation, SAP also gives investors a decent dividend yield of 1.10%, just below the industry average of 1.20%. Some of the bullish money managers who have increased their stakes in the stock this quarter are Matthew Tewksbury (200%) and Matthew Hulsizer (10100%). The company's efforts to continue increasing its available products should help improve the stock in the near future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The researcher believes that the growth in the market is driven by increased adoption of CRM, ERP, HR SaaS tools and the need for mobile apps for corporate applications. Another report estimates the SaaS market to be worth $22 billion by the year 2015.SAP’s FinancialsThe industry’s growth projections are reflected in the performance of their key players. Recently SAP (NYSE:SAP) announced their Q2 performance where revenues grew 8% over the year to € 4.1 billion (~$5.3 billion). EPS of € 0.73 (~$0.95) was above the market’s expected earnings of $0.91 for the quarter.By segment, revenues from software & cloud subscriptions revenues grew 7% over the year to € 1.16 billion (~$1.52 billion). Support revenues increased 11% to €2.2 billion (~$2.9 billion) and revenues from software and software related services grew 10% to €3.3 billion (~$4.30 billion). Growth was driven by the Americas where revenues grew 18% over the year. SAP also managed to report a 3% growth within the EMEA markets despite the continuing economic crisis in the region. Asia Pacific Japan revenues, however, fell 7% over the year despite strong performance by the India and Southeast Asian countries.For the current year, SAP expects to end with revenue growth of 10% over the year compared with 11-15% growth projected in the earlier quarter. SAP attributed the decline in revenue projections to a slowdown in the Chinese economy.SAP Pushes HANA to drive growthSAP continues to push HANA’s growth. Recently they announced the availability of HANA solutions with three additional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). As part of the agreement, AlertEnterprise, Clockwork and PROS will now offer their customers access to real-time in-memory technology platform, SAP HANA.They also entered into reseller agreements with Intel and Hortonworks to resell and support the IntelDistribution Apache Hadoopand the Hortonworks Data Platform with SAP HANA. Through the agreement, organizations will now be able to purchase big data solutions supported by SAP while leveraging capabilities of technologies such as SAP HANA, Apache Hadoop, and other SAP Business Intelligence tools such as BusinessObjects. By integerating with Apache Hadoop, SAP plans to be able to provide insights across all kinds of data – stored cold data, petabyte-level warm data and even real-time and streaming data.SAP is also ensuring that all their new products and existing products run on HANA. Yesterday, SAP announced the introduction of SAP HANA platform into solutions that will power the SAP’s offerings of manufacturing and research and development (R & D) solutions. Known as SAP Overall Equipment Effectiveness Management (SAP OEE Management) application, the upgraded 6.0 version aims to offer end-to-end project management which SAP is calling as the “idea to performance” approach. SAP believes that by including HANA into their project management offerings, managers will now be able to see a complete view of all aspects of the projects within their portfolio, gather data real time, identify and address any red flags.SAP recently also acquired predictive analytics technology solutions provider, KXEN, with plans to integrate HANA with KXEN’s offerings. San Francisco-based KXEN is known for their analytic tool, InfiniteInsight, which helps automate end-to-end modeling process thus helping with the development of more accurate predictive models. It assists in increasing the speed at which analytics are performed while ensuring more accurate analysis of the customer life cycle process. KXEN will be able to successfully complement SAP Predictive Analysis, SAP’s analytic software. SAP would also be looking to integrate KXEN with their own enterprise business intelligence capabilities along with the SAP HANA platform to enable organizations to analyze big data and engage users across the enterprise.As I said earlier, platform eco-system is a hot trend. SAP has managed to create a successful offering within analytics in the space through HANA. Since its release two and a half years ago, HANA now has over 2,000 customers and over 1,100 implementations and has generated more than $1 billion in revenues. During the current quarter alone, HANA software revenues grew 21% over the year to €102 million (~$135 million). SAP expects growth to continue and is estimating that HANA will generate €650-€700 million (~$865-$930 million) for the year.SAP’s AcquisitionsLast month, SAP announced the acquisition of hybris GmBH, a leading player in e-commerce technology. Germany based hybris offers Commerce Suite, an open, multi-channel platform which helps in product content management and unified e-commerce processes that help organizations connect with their customers in real time basis across multiple devices and delivery channels. SAP hopes to integrate hybris to expand their e-commerce platform offerings by leveraging mobile, cloud and big data innovations. Terms of the deal not disclosed.SAP’s stock is trading at $72.64 with a market capitalization of $86.62 billion. It touched a year high of $84.66 in March this year."

Rather than focusing on undervaluation or excessively optimistic pricing, many services assign ratings tailored to validate what's already happened.Comparing the current advice from major research providers Value Line, Morningstar and Standard & Poor's on large-cap software providers Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) will serve to illustrate the illogical nature of their conclusions.Both ORCL and SAP are fine companies. Each showed very nice five- and 10-year growth in both revenue and EPS. From 2002 through 2007, SAP was the superior company. Over the more recent half-decade, however, Oracle has been the better performer.(click images to enlarge)Based strictly on the information above, you'd expect ORCL to be priced at a premium valuation compared to its own normalized levels. It would also seem appropriate for ORCL to command a higher multiple than SAP.Here are their historical and present P/Es as of Friday, Nov. 23, 2012:Investors want to know more than simply P/Es. Here are four other metrics for each company. Both companies rate highly, but Oracle displays a clear overall advantage.Better stats along with lower relative and absolute valuations would seem to make the recommendation of ORCL an easy one. Surprisingly, Value Line rated Oracle only as neutral while listing SAP as a buy in their most recent full-page write-ups.Value Line was not alone in their assessment. Here are current views from Standard & Poor's on these two companies.S&P assigned a 4-star (out of five) buy rating to SAP with the shares at $77.21. They called present-day ""fair value"" as $70.90. Standard & Poor's 12-month price target? $78, a whopping 1.02% above the current quote. If they are correct, you'd see only a 2.23% total return over the coming year.S&P puts ORCL's quality ranking in the top 1% of their entire research universe. They see ""fair value"" as $39. That figure is 26.1% above last week's closing price. They inexplicably carry a 12-month target price of just $34.S&P rates Oracle only as a ""hold."" Achieving even their lower, very modest, $34 goal would bring investors just shy of 10% from the present price, plus a yield of 0.8%. Many people would be quite satisfied with about 11% on a high-quality stock in our ZIRP world.Well-respected stock research firm Morningstar likes ORCL. They go with a 4-star, buy rating, while seconding S&P's fair value at an identical $39 mark.A change in Morningstar's analyst coverage leaves SAP temporarily unrated (for stars). They do indicate that SAP looks overpriced based on a fair value that has been cut to 23.6% below the present price.My own preference for predicting future price action is to assume a regression to the mean on various metrics for the same company's shares. Note the valuations for ORCL at its previous ""best buying opportunities"" of the previous decade.Oracle's P/E is now lower than any time in the previous 18 years, excepting the exact bottom in 2008-09. Those lucky/smart enough to have caught that low had the chance at 164% gains over the following 25 months. ORCL shares look extremely cheap based on P/BV and P/CF as well.Perform the same exercise with SAP. Today's price does not jump out at you as a particular bargain compared with its valuations at the three most recent cyclical bottoms.Oracle's outstanding results are not being reflected in its share price, which remains 15.3% under its 2011 peak. Meanwhile, SAP trades just pennies below last week's all-time high of $77.38.Swapping out of SAP and into ORCL makes sense.Why pay MSRP for SAP when you can own Oracle at Black Friday pricing?Disclosure: I am long ORCL.

1363591,23479,2013-04-23T16:56:59-04:00,,"Software corporation SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) released its preliminary financial results for Q1 2013 on April 19, and  reported an ~8% y-o-y growth in non-IFRS revenues, to €3,636  million (~$4.8 billion). The company’s revenues have now grown for 13  consecutive quarters. Software and cloud subscriptions revenues grew  almost 25% y-o-y, to €824 million (~$1.1 billion). The highlight of the  quarter was continued performance of SAP HANA, which more than tripled  revenues y-o-y, to €86 million (~$112 million).The company also maintained its  operating margins at ~25% while operating profits grew 8% to €901  million. Its success in growing its revenues across geographies such as the Americas and Europe while its competitors struggle is suggestive of  it gaining market share there. The company reported revenue growth from  all geographies except Asia-Pacific and Japan. Here we take a look at  the driving factors behind its performance and our expectations in the  future.HANA Meets ExpectationsSAP HANA remains the major growth engine  for SAP with HANA software revenues of €86 million. Last year, SAP had  more than doubled revenue on HANA. This quarter, HANA revenues tripled  compared to Q1 last year. It has about 1,000 customers on it now and is  growing fast. HANA’s relevance as a real-time analytics platform for big  data and warehouses has been driving its popularity. This quarter, SAP  added Levi Strauss, an iconic clothing brand and ConAgra Foods, a U.S.  consumer company as its customer in the Americas. The company estimates  that it could be half a billion U.S.-dollar business, making it one of  the the fastest-growing software product in the world. [1]For 2013, the company has set lofty  expectations of the product. It estimates that software revenue from SAP  HANA will range between €650 million to €700 million. Its expectations  are supported by the completion of the transition of entire SAP ERP  (Enterprise Resource Planning) suite onto the HANA platform in January.  This will put it in direct competition with Salesforce.com, which is the  leader in cloud-based CRM. We expect SAP to successfully cross sell  HANA and other software in its suite of products over the year, and  expect SAP HANA to define the company’s 2013 performance.The Americas Lead The Growth From FrontSAP registered revenue growth across  geographies riding on the success of its push into cloud computing and  SAP HANA. In the Americas, software and cloud subscription revenues  grew 51%. This was driven by strong performance in Latin America and  strong cloud subscription and support growth in North America, Brazil  and Mexico. Despite the delayed budgetary cycles in the U.S. caused by  the federal budget uncertainty, software license revenue grew by 8% in  the Americas. We expect an improving economy to speed up this growth. Emerging markets in EMEA such as the Middle East, Africa and  Russia helped the company achieve 15% growth in software and cloud  subscription revenues. Even established markets such as U.K., Sweden and  Switzerland grew over 50%. SAP HANA once again helped the company win  over big clients such as BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeräte, which will  migrate to SAP Business Suite, powered by SAP HANA.The only drawback to the otherwise solid  overall performance came from the Asia-Pacific and Japan region where  software and cloud revenues declined by 7%. External factors such as  lower-than-expected demand for IT investments in the beginning of the  year from state-owned enterprises in China led to this decline.  However, the company expects that the stability provided by the new  government will help it return to solid growth in Q2.We are currently revising our $73 price estimate for SAP.Disclosure: No positions."
1352161,34201,2013-04-18T15:01:50-04:00,,"When a company delivers record revenue showing year-on-year increase of 16% and shows consistent revenue growth and earnings per share of $3.09 with prospects of more than 13% EPS growth next year; what does the market do? Well! It sits up and takes notice.That is exactly what the market has been doing with SAP AG (SAP) - the stock has gained 20% in one year. Apparently, there has been good buying on the counter as the company's average traded volume is 1.29 million shares. The stock has fallen 6% in the last one month in the run up to its earnings date for first quarter fiscal 2013 (April 19, 2013). This article tries to understand whether the current decline in share price is an opportunity to buy.SAPSAP is a software and programming company whose core business is selling licenses for software solutions and related services. Solutions offered by the company cover business applications and technologies including industry-specific applications. Business Suite applications of the company include enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, product lifecycle management and supply chain management. SAP also provides solution portfolios for end-to-end business process support, delivering tangible business and IT value for functional areas and across the extended enterprise.This week, the company announced the latest version of SAP Sybase Replication Server, a core component of the company's Real Time Data Platform that helps ensure that critical information required by customers is available where and when they need it.FinancialsFor the year ended December 30, 2012, SAP reported revenue of $21.39 billion, up 15.67% over prior year. The company has an astounding gross profit margin of 68%. SAP reported a net income of $3.72 billion at net profit margin of 17.43%. Its earnings per share are $3.09 and a dividend yield of 1.23%.High margins are however normal in software and programming industry. The industry average is 69%.CompetitionWith a market cap of $91.65 billion, SAP is a much smaller company than its competitors that include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), which have market caps above $150 billion.Both Microsoft and Oracle have higher revenues, which should not be surprising considering their size- both companies have a workforce of above 90,000 against 64,000 plus of SAP. At the same time, both have higher profit margins as compared to SAP - 75% for Microsoft and 80% for Oracle. The same is true for net profit margins - 21.20% for Microsoft and 28.45% for Oracle. However, whereas Microsoft provides a dividend yield of 3.19%, Oracle's is 0.74%.Is SAP a buy at this price?Admittedly, SAP reported good revenue and has impressive profit margins. The company also announced a dividend raise for fiscal 2012. It shall now pay €0.85 or $1.11 per share as compared to €0.75 paid in 2011. However, in 2011 the company had also paid a special dividend of €0.35 in celebration of its 40th anniversary, taking the total tally to €1.10. The presence increase in dividend payout is 13% if the special dividend of 2011 is not taken into account.However, the above data only indicates that SAP is a reasonably good dividend play. If the market keeps responding to revenue growth and high margins, the stock may also give a reasonable return on investment over the long term. SAP has been disappointing analysts continuously for the last four quarters but still returned more than 17% to investors by way of stock appreciation in the last one year.However, a value investor is more concerned about current and future valuations, the two most important factors that investors need to consider before taking a call on a stock. At present the stock is trading at PE multiple of 24.90, which according to all standards is pretty high.For first quarter 2013, results for which are to be declared on April 19, 2013, analysts are predicting an EPS of 53 cents down from 64 cent EPS and quarterly revenue at $3.88 billion, down from $4.46 billion reported for the same quarter prior year. However, analysts are more optimistic about full year results and anticipate earnings per share of $3.82 against the current $3.09.Whereas the earnings growth for December 2013 is primarily negative, the company is expected to register 13.38% growth over the long term (five years).Forward P/E ratio, for December 2014, is expected to be in the region of 20, which is also on the higher side. At the same time, it must also be said that the industry average P/E is 25.72, which reflects the market's faith in the technology sector, particularly software and programming industry. However, there are many other value picks in the sector; for example, Microsoft, which is trading at a much lower P/E of 15.82 and forward P/E of 9.26 offers better value for money than SAP.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1947521,23479,2014-01-15T14:23:33-05:00,,"SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) reported preliminary unaudited results for fiscal 2013 on January 10, 2014. In dollar terms, total revenues grew 4% to €16.81 billion compared to fiscal 2012. Constant currency revenues on the other hand grew 8% for the fiscal, indicating significant erosion on volatile currencies during 2013. Comparatively, constant currency and reported revenues grew 9% and 14% during fiscal 2012.Cloud subscription revenues posted growth of 158% to €697 million over fiscal 2012. On-premise software license sales, however, continued their downward trend due to the migration of businesses from on-premise application software to on-demand SaaS offerings. Revenues from SAP’s software division declined about 3% over fiscal 2012, reaching close to €4.51 billion. Software-related service revenues also witnessed a slowdown with 6% growth compared to 14.5% last fiscal. In addition, revenues from SAP’s professional services division shrunk approximately 6% for the fiscal period.IFRS operating profit for the fiscal stood at approximately €4.47 billion, compared to €4.07 billion a year ago. The 10% growth in operating income, despite the slowdown in revenues, resulted in 1.5% expansion in IFRS operating profit margin. However, these margins were comparatively lower than the 34% observed in fiscal 2011.Here we highlight key takeaways from the preliminary results. The company will announce its audited fiscal 2013 results on January 21 and we want to study the impact of the ongoing cloud migration on SAP’s top line prospects, with regards to the outlook for fiscal 2014. We will also shed some light on future margin prospects for the company in our earnings article.Declining Software Revenues To Continue In The Short TermThe decline in SAP’s software revenue stems from the migration of businesses from deploying applications on-premise to the cloud. This is evident from SAP’s preliminary fiscal 2013 results. In reported terms, software revenues declined 3%, compared to 13.5% growth in fiscal 2012. On a constant currency basis, software revenues gained 2% in fiscal 2013, compared to 11% growth in fiscal 2012. This is a sharp deceleration in revenues and a continuity in this trend could very well lead to negative top line growth for the company. On the other hand, cloud subscription revenues, which are expected to make up for the decline in on-premise software sales, are still at an early stage for the company. Despite the impressive triple digit growth rate in 2013, the revenues of €697 million (just 4% of total revenues) are still small in absolute terms.The decline in software license sales has also impacted software-related service revenues. Software-related service revenues in 2013 were €8.73 billion, compared to €8.24 billion in 2012 and €6.97 billion in 2011. This represents a growth rate of 6% compared to 18% a year ago. In its Q4 earnings call on January 21, we expect to gain insights into SAP’s stance on its software license division in terms of its fiscal 2014 outlook. Although SAP is expanding the integration of the HANA platform with its application software, we expect to see a further slowdown in software and software-related service revenues for the first two quarters of fiscal 2014.Margins To See Gradual Expansion Due To Increasing Cloud AdoptionAccording to SAP’s unaudited financial results, operating margins expanded from 25.1% in 2012, to 26.6% in 2013. We believe this expansion is a result of an increase in adoption of cloud services from SAP’s customers. Going forward, we expect margins to expand further as SAP customers continue to adopt cloud subscription services. Additionally, the integration of SAP HANA into its application software subscriptions as a bundle package could contribute to better margins due to its relatively higher pricing. Currently, 77 industry applications and analytical solutions are being powered by HANA, and all the product offerings are expected to be ready for HANA soon. We expect SAP to continue to benefit from the expansion in margins by integrating its application offerings with the HANA platform to boost business productivity for its customers.We will revise our $80 Trefis price estimate for SAP after the release of audited results on January 21.Disclosure: No positions"
1337361,41541,2013-04-12T09:04:41-04:00,,"SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) has many hedge funds enthusiastic about its stock and I want to see why. My analysis here is based on the common stock valuation ratios in the financial statements of SAP AG over the last five years.An investor looks at valuation ratios to gain an estimate of valuation to ascertain the attractiveness of a potential or existing investment. The valuation numbers that I came across for SAP were very encouraging. Keep in mind, however, that this is just one of the many ways to analyze a stock.The German technology firm recently announced that it would increase its annual shareholder distributions for the upcoming quarter. SAP AG will raise its dividend 85 euro cents (U.S.$1.11) per share.An analysis of the valuation ratios of a company involves looking at a class of financial metrics to determine whether a firm's stock price is too high, reasonable or a bargain as an investment opportunity.Source: SAP annual reports.Market Value per Share divided by Earnings per Share [EPS] is the calculation used to obtain the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The most well-known investment valuation ratio is the P/E ratio, which compares the current price of a company's shares to the amount of earnings it generates. The purpose of this ratio is to give users a quick idea of how much they are paying for each $1 of earnings. And with one simplified ratio, you can easily compare the P/E ratio of one company to its competition and to the market.SAP's P/E ratio has been considerably higher than the industry average over the last five years and this signifies that investors are expecting higher future growth.The Price to Operating Profit (P/OP) ratio is something investors like to analyze instead of the P/E ratio. This is because the P/E ratio is calculated using net income and therefore the ratio can be quite sensitive to things like capital structure and nonrecurring earnings.In SAP's case, the P/OP ratio values portray to an investor that the tech firm will have rapid growth in the future, which matches the deduction obtained from analyzing the P/E.Note: U.S. dollar in millions except for EPS and Operating Profit per share.The numbers used to obtain the P/E and P/OP ratios are shown in the table above. These numbers are higher than its closest competitors over the last five years. SAP had gross revenues of about $21B and its revenue projections are also very good.Like the P/E ratio, the P/S reflects how many times investors are paying for every dollar of a company's sales. SAP AG has a high P/S ratio compared to other firms in the industry and this actually makes it a less attractive investment. However, it must be remembered that the P/S ratio only offers another perspective that complements the other valuation indicators - particularly the P/E ratio - and is a worthwhile addition to an investor's stock analysis toolbox.As for the P/B ratio, value investors utilize it to find discounted equities. The trouble with book value especially when attempting to value a technology firm is that it ignores intangibles like goodwill, brand name and intellectual property. SAP AG has a lot of asset value that is determined by intellectual property. The P/B ratio may have its drawbacks, but it is an easy-to-use tool for finding companies that are under or overvalued. SAP's P/B ratio is higher than the industry average and this is indicative of the high expectations that investors have for the tech giant.Note: U.S. dollar in millions except for Sales per share and Book value per share.SAP has a strong balance sheet and great revenue numbers over the last five years. The numbers used to arrive at the valuation ratios listed in the 'More Valuation Ratios' table are shown in the table above.The numbers lag behind its closest rivals Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). After all, the German tech firm has a much smaller market cap in comparison to its American rivals.The trend that can be seen across the board is that large-cap tech stocks have continued to grow their assets and revenues rapidly over the past five years. There will always be tech booms and busts, but it is innovation that will lead the American recovery and the growth in China.1 Data adjusted for splits and stock dividends.2 Close price on the filing date of SAP AG's Annual Report.The share price has continued to rise along with the number of shares of common stock outstanding. This is a very encouraging sign for investors.Conclusion: Invest in SAP AGSAP has become the most precious German firm despite revenue that's 20% of Siemens AG (NYSE:SI) and one-tenth that of Volkswagen AG (VLKAY.PK).It is true that the stock price has dipped below its 20-day moving average [MA] and also the 50 day MA. But I see this pullback as a perfect entry point to buy more SAP shares.It must be stated here that SAP is the world's ninth most valuable technology firm and the only European one in the top 10. Large-cap tech companies are always a great investment idea. After all, innovation drives the global economy.All material is sourced from Morningstar and MSN Money.Disclosure: I am long SAP.

Customers  will have the option to run on HANA or keep what they currently use.SAP Business Suite has lagged to some degree through its dependence  on traditional databases. With SAP HANA, SAP Business Suite will have  the capability to keep the functionality of the traditional database  technology, but with the capability of SAP HANA.Here's the catch. SAP HANA is not easy to implement. Big enterprise  companies will hire a lot of consultants to get it up and running. But  with SAP HANA comes an emerging developer ecosystem. SAP has an  investment fund for HANA startups and has made investments to make SAP  HANA on Amazon Web Services.""Mission critical"" is a popular term in enterprise circles. It often  relates to old-school enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions that  use batch processes to update the data with the software.But as data has become increasingly abundant, the batch systems have  slowed. SAP HANA changes that for companies like John Deere, which has  implemented the new SAP HANA available on SAP Business Suite. John Deere  is using the technology to get real-time updates on tractors that are  operating with sensors that transmit data for real-time analysis.SAP HANA does apply to a broad variety of business scenarios,  including marketing analysis, financial close, receivables management,  material resource planning, and consumer and social sentiment  analysis. The news represents a significant shift for SAP, moving the company  into a far more competitive space.By making SAP HANA the underlying  infrastructure, SAP now has a big data play that gives it new dimensions  for growth. But the challenge will be in deployment and getting  customers to adopt the revolutionary new technology.Original Post"

SAP AG will raise its dividend €0.85 (U.S.$1.11) per share. I had already analyzed SAP based on the common stock valuation ratios in its financial statements over the last five years and determined that it was a great investment idea. The April 19 earnings report release kept the bullish sentiment among investors.SAP's P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio has been considerably higher than the industry average over the last five years and this signifies that investors are expecting higher future growth. Like the P/E ratio, the P/S (price-to-sales) reflects how many times investors are paying for every dollar of a company's sales. SAP AG has a high P/S ratio compared to other firms in the industry, but this actually makes it a less attractive investment. However, the fundamentals look good overall.For instance, SAP's P/B (price-to-book) ratio is higher than the industry average and this is indicative of the high expectations that investors have for the tech giant.SAP has a strong balance sheet and great revenue numbers over the last five years. Nonetheless, the numbers lag behind its closest rivals Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). After all, the German tech firm has a much smaller market cap in comparison to its American rivals.The Dividend Discount ModelThe dividend discount model (DDM) also makes the case to buy SAP stock. The DDM is an easy to use tool for investors to quickly assess a stock as it is great at finding intrinsic stock value estimates.The DDM is a procedure for valuing the price of a stock by using predicted dividends and discounting them back to present value. The idea is that if the value obtained from the DDM is higher than what the shares are currently trading at, then the stock is undervalued.It is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation technique. Dividends are the most clear-cut measure of cash flow since these are obviously cash flows that go straight to the investor.Intrinsic Stock ValueThis is using the Dividends Per Share forecast.1 DPS0 = Sum of last year dividends per share.It is easy to see that SAP is undervalued from the table above and so it makes for a great investment idea. But there must be a number of questions on your mind. Specifically, what is the 'calculation' column and how are  the growth rates obtained. The good thing is that I am going to show you everything so that you will be able to do a dividend discount model on any stock you wish to analyze.Dividend growth rate [g] obtained from the PRAT modelThe biggest calculation is getting the dividend growth rate [g] and this is the product of the profit margin [P], the retention rate [R], the asset turnover [A], and the financial leverage [T].USD $ in millions, translated from EUR €Now we have all the components in the PRAT model listed in the table above with their respective values. These components are calculated as follows.Retention rate: (Profit attributable to owners of parent - Dividends) ÷ Profit attributable to owners of parentProfit margin = 100 × Profit attributable to owners of parent ÷ RevenueAsset turnover = Revenue ÷ Total assetsFinancial leverage = Total assets ÷ Equity attributable to owners of parentWe have now obtained the PRAT model component values for 5 years and we obtain the averages which are summarized in the table below.We use the figures in the table above to get the dividend growth rate as implied by the PRAT model. This is the percentage used in the Year 1 row of the first table in this article that gives the intrinsic stock value according to the dividend discount model. The calculation is shown below for your convenience.Retention rate × Profit margin × Asset turnover × Financial leverage= 0.67 × 17.72% × 0.69 × 1.88 = 15.26%Dividend growth rate [g] implied by Gordon growth modelThis is an integral part of finding the intrinsic stock value. We start by estimating the required rate of return (RF). To do this, we start by obtaining the average of bid yields on the total amount of outstanding fixed-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds. These Treasury bonds should not be due or callable for another 10 years and the average will be an unweighted one. This value of 2.6% will act as a proxy for the risk-free rate of return.The estimated rate of return on a market portfolio (RM) is widely estimated to be 13.19%. The systematic risk (β) for SAP is 1.24. The required rate of return on SAP (rSAP) is calculated as follows:rSAP = RF + βSAP [E(RM) - RF]= 2.60% + 1.18 [13.19% - 2.60%]= 15.11%Once this is found, we insert the values into the Gordon growth model equation.g = 100 × (P0 × rSAP - D0) ÷ (P0 + D0)= 100 × ($78.87 × 15.11% - $1.48) ÷ ($78.87 + $1.48) = 13.01%where:P0 = SAP stock priceD0 = Sum of last year dividends per shareDividend growth rate [g] ForecastConclusion: Now is the time to buy SAP AG sharesI have always been a firm believer in innovation. SAP AG is the world's ninth most valuable technology firm and the only European one in the top 10. The DDM shows that SAP is a great investment idea as the current stock price of $78.87 is lower than the calculated intrinsic value of $83.56.The recent pullback that we have seen in the stock price over the long term is a good opportunity for investors to buy more SAP stock. The stock price has started to rise lately and has moved above the 20-day moving average (MA) and also the 50 day MA. This is an encouraging sign and a good time to buy SAP shares.Disclosure: I am long SAP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

One European technology firm, in particular, is winningSAP (NYSE:SAP).SAP and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have been rivals for years. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison became a legend by putting nearly all such rivals down for the count. He bought potential competitors and dominated enterprise software.That may no longer be the case. The reason is SAP.As business has moved to the cloud, SAP and Oracle have both been threatened. But it's increasingly obvious that Oracle's strategy, buying hardware maker Sun Microsystems, was a huge blunder, while SAP's strategy of buying cloud software companies and offering services around it makes sense.The latest evidence is SAP's purchase of Ariba for $4.3 billion.Ariba arrived in the 1990s as a creator of spending management solutions, and in 1999 was valued at $6 billion. Its major purchases in the last decade were market-making companies, TradeEx and FreeMarkets. But it would have remained troubled had not its SaaS services been transformed by underlying technology into ""cloud services."" The company thought its effort aimed at building Internet applications, AribaWeb, was going to get it out of trouble, but it was its base business that attracted the big bucks.Ariba will help SAP achieve its current mission, moving from being an enterprise software company to being a cloud applications company, like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).Over the last year investors have begun taking note of SAP's strategic success. While the stock's price is down slightly over that period, Oracle is down over 20%, and as recently as April SAP shareholders were seeing a 20% gain from last Memorial Day.What this means is that after some adjustment based on the Ariba price, SAP is probably due to start rising in value again. It is poised to start taking some serious market share from both Oracle and Salesforce.com. Much of that will be in emerging markets that didn't spend during the enterprise days but are now able to look toward SaaS as an alternative.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In actuality, because SaaS saves money for clients, much of existing wealth will be destroyed, not transferred. Perhaps one day angel investors and venture capitalists who fund young companies will spin off hedge funds to short aging companies, and the overall market will price industry trends less schizophrenically. For now, an institutionalized disconnect between Silicon Valley and Wall Street has created epic inefficiency: both disrupted and disruptor enterprise software providers are priced for growth.SAP Price to Earnings Less Cash TTM data by YChartsLike Amazon, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been shorted by otherwise-intelligent professionals betting that a low-margin market-share acquisition strategy would disenchant shareholder expectations. Smart people being proven wrong is an excellent signal which should raise alerts for alpha seekers; the alerted indication is to prospect in related stocks for market inefficiencies.Context Of DisruptionLike Amazon has diluted retail, Salesforce and other cloud companies will dilute the pricing power of enterprise solutions. SAP is the leader in non-cloud enterprise applications and has billions in non-cloud cashflow to lose, not to mention the reversal of a growth valuation.It's important to note that SAP's dethronement will not be symmetric with its decade-long ascent to power; the coup will be sudden and violent. The trade here is just a search for timing.Perhaps the best signal of proximity in timing is the willful decision-making of SAP itself. You see, until recently, despite whatever they claimed to be doing, the company's leaders did very little to invest in cloud enterprise solutions. This was classic ""innovator's dilemma"" behavior. Why create an efficient enterprise software solution, when high-end customers are willing to pay more for maintenance of an inefficient one?(Courtesy Profs. Mindell and Pratt, MIT, Following acquisitions such as a 50%-market-premium buyout of SaaS provider/potential SEC target SuccessFactors, SAP's story now convincingly stars cloud enterprise disruption. That they are disrupting themselves indicates the end is near.With a P/E at double the stock market average, a market capitalization approaching $100BB, and a dividend-investor demographic lounging peacefully/bullishly on deck, I regard SAP as The Enterprise Titanic. SAP's last-minute self-disruption, an attempt to steer clear of the SaaS pricing iceberg, is an indicator of proximate timing. It is time to buy insurance on the soon-to-be-sinking investment vehicle.A CatalystFurther confirmation arises in last week's report of SAP handing out half-off discounts to large customers, revealing that a previously monopolized high-end bunker is being penetrated by low-priced competition (this high-end penetration correlates perfectly with the time axis on the innovator's dilemma diagram).Maintenance contracts are perhaps the dirtiest of secrets in the IT profession. Often the only way to get paid for a software product is to service it habitually (one might say it is ""broken on purpose""). But SaaS drastically cuts the pricing for such maintenance--the servicing is built into the software.Data Mining?Now, some have said SaaS commoditization will be overcome through market growth in data mining and analytics. I find this big data thesis unconvincing: big data suppliers, like rare earths suppliers, find their market value in the expense of extraction, not the rarity of natural un-mined occurrence; as extraction becomes more efficient, the price of big data will fall -- like Molycorp's (MCP) share price, which shows 85% decline in one year.In reality, Excel has been doing big data for a while; the actual opportunity for efficiency improvement these days is ease-of-use, and there are dozens of Facebook-like (NASDAQ:FB) startups working on this; comparing SAP to Myspace in this situation would insult Myspace, as SAP's sluggishness, maintenance costs, and contempt among captive participants are qualities far more deserving of a comparison to the glue-stick and scissors tedium of scrapbooking. To complete the anecdote: Facebook was founded in 2004, the same year we said goodbye to scrapbooking and Creative Memories.A Billion Users?Besides the big data bubble, CEO McDermott has thrown a Hail Mary investment thesis of growing customers to ""a billion"". So basically, SAP is going to have every user on Facebook as an enterprise customer! Watch out, LinkedIn (LNKD)!By the time Hail Marys get thrown, smart money has already taken the other side. Judge for yourself: how much smart-money is betting on a billion customers at SAP? The most detail McDermott can give in his thesis is the tautologous, circular, self-proving, redundant claim of ""ecosystem"" development. SAP says you should invest in it because it is going to have a lot of customers--customers who will come because they will be drawn to SAP's ecosystem of a lot of customers. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) investors understand the fragility of even a pre-established network-effects moat; McDermott wants you to trust a yet-established network-effects moat.Betting Against The Cloud?Amazon/Salesforce-type companies have implemented a strategy of long-term zero-profit-margin expansion in order to aggressively gain market share. Their share prices have responded optimistically, while shorts have bet cynically, thinking corrections would be inevitable. These shorts were betting against a paradigm change; so far they have been proven wrong.Some would point to SAP's steady growth in earnings as evidence against my thesis of disruption.SAP Revenue Quarterly data by YChartsHowever, historical cashflow growth smoothness is not at all divergent from an ""innovator's dilemma"" situation. In fact linear success prior to disruption is standard in the model. Abundantly evident ""hockey-stick"" accelerating market-share annexation by companies like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) indicates a low-end-pricing iceberg curvature; recent, reactionary change in course by The Enterprise Titanic confirms SAP's closeness to said shape in the fog.Predicted-by-some tragedies like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)  in 2011 happen all the time in tech: out-maneuvered in pricing by mobile/cloud on the low end, brutalized by bigger R&D spenders like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) on the high end...ahem, Oracle.SAP: An Elegant ShortThe elegance of an SAP short is: more than one way to win. SAP has double the market average in P/E multiple. So, multiple compression alone will make the SAP short profitable--whereas a falloff in earnings--a falloff in margins-- will make the short legendary.But don't take my word for it. Just listen to VC Jason Green, who backed SuccessFactors and Salesforce. Here's what he has to say about a race to the bottom price-tag in enterprise efficiency:Titanic's crew sees a zero-margin iceberg ahead:SAP Enterprise Value data by YChartsNote: SAP downside exposure through share borrowing and/or put options is markedly cheap as a result of SAP's deceptively smooth share-price history.Disclosure: I am short SAP, CRM.

498251,24287,2012-04-15T06:10:41-04:00,,"In its rise to leadership of the ERP market, SAP (NYSE:SAP) shrewdly placed bounds around its strategy: it would stick to its knitting on applications and rely on partnerships with systems integrators to get critical mass implementation across the Global 2000. When it came to architecture, SAP left no doubt of its ambitions to own the application tier, while leaving the data tier to the kindness of strangers (or in Oracle’s case (NYSE:ORCL), the estranged).Times change in more ways than one – and one of those ways is in the data tier. The headlines of SAP acquiring Sybase (for its mobile assets, primarily) and subsequent emergence of HANA, its new in-memory data platform, placed SAP in the database market. And so it was that at an analyst meeting last December, SAP made the audacious declaration that it wanted to become the #2 database player by 2015.Of course, none of this occurs in a vacuum. SAP’s declaration to become a front line player in the database market threatens to destabilize existing relationships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) as longtime SAP observer Dennis Howlett commented in a ZDNet post. OK, sure, SAP is sick of leaving money on the table to Oracle, and it’s throwing in roughly $500 million in sweeteners to get prospects to migrate. But if the database is the thing, to meet its stretch goals, says Howlett, SAP and Sybase would have to grow that part of the business by a cool 6x – 7x.But SAP would be treading down a ridiculous path if it were just trying to become a big player in the database market for the heck of it. Fortuitously, during SAP’s press conference on      announcements of their new mobile and database strategies, chief architect Vishal Sikka tamped down the #2 aspirations as that’s really not the point – it’s the apps that count, and increasingly, it’s the database that makes the apps. Once again.Back to our main point. IT innovation goes in waves; during emergence of client/server, innovation focused on database where the need was mastering SQL and relational table structures; during the latter stages of client/server and subsequent waves of Webs 1.0 and 2.0, activity shifted to the app tier, which grew more distributed. With emergence of Big Data and Fast Data, energy shifted back to the data tier given the efficiencies of processing data big or fast inside the data store itself. Not surprisingly, when you hear SAP speak about HANA, they describe an ability to perform more complex analytic problems or compound operational transactions. It’s no coincidence that SAP now states that it’s in the database business.So how will SAP execute its new database strategy? Given the hype over HANA, how does SAP convince Sybase ASE, IQ, and SQL Anywhere customers that they’re not headed down a dead end street?That was the point of the SAP announcements, which, in the press release, stated the near term roadmap but shed little light on how SAP would get there. Specifically, the announcements were:Most of the announcements, like HANA going GA or Sybase ASE supporting SAP Business suite, were hardly surprises. Aside from go-to-market issues, which are many and significant, we’ll direct our focus on the technology roadmaps.We’ve maintained that if SAP were serious about its database goals, that it had to do three basic things:The third part is the heavy lifting. For instance, given that data platforms are increasingly employing advanced caching, it would, at first glance, seem logical to blend in some of HANA’s in-memory capabilities to the ASE platform; however, architecturally, that would be extremely difficult as one of HANA’s strengths –dynamic indexing – would be difficult to implement in ASE.On the other hand, given that HANA can index or restructure data on the fly (e.g., organize data into columnar structures on demand), the question is, does that make IQ obsolete? The short answer is that while memory keeps getting cheaper, it will never be as cheap as disk and that therefore, IQ could evolve as near-line storage for HANA. Of course that begs the question as to whether Hadoop could eventually perform the same function. SAP maintains that Hadoop is too slow and therefore should be reserved for offline cases; that’s certainly true today, but given developments with HBase, it could easily become fast and cheap enough for SAP to revisit the IQ question a year or two down the road.Not that SAP Sybase is sitting still with Hadoop integration. They are providing MapReduce and R capabilities to IQ (SAP Sybase is hardly alone here, as most Advanced SQL platforms are offering similar support). SAP Sybase is also providing capabilities to map IQ tables into Hadoop Hive, slotting IQ as alternative to HBase; in effect, that’s akin to a number of strategies to put SQL layers inside Hadoop (in a way, similar to what the lesser-known Hadapt is doing). And of course, like most of the relational players, SAP Sybase is also support the bulk ETL/ELT load from HDFS to HANA or IQ.On SAP’s side, for now, is the paucity of Hadoop talent, so pitching IQ as an alternative to HBase may help soften the blow for organizations seeking to get a handle. But in the long run, we believe that SAP Sybase will have to revisit this strategy. Because, if it’s serious about the database market, it will have to amplify its focus to add value given the new realities on the ground.Disclaimer: Author is an analyst with Ovum; the opinion stated does not necessarily reflect that of Ovum."
973531,24550,2012-11-02T13:31:21-04:00,,"It's turning into a big news week for enterprise social network (ESN) software. First, Yammer's first user conference, YamJam12, and then a very interesting announcement  from SAP (NYSE:SAP). SAP has, in the past at least, not really exhibited a great  deal of interest in social software, nor have its few product attempts  in the social business area been particularly compelling. The truth is  that many of the enterprise software vendors have had some false starts  and made some missteps over the past few years in attempts to get  involved in the rapidly evolving enterprise social software market. The  market is large already and getting larger quickly as adoption rates for  social business solutions are skyrocketing. For the social software  market (ESN), our recent forecast shows ~$1.1B in 2012, growing to ~$4.5B  in 2016 (a CAGR of 42.4%), but that's not the whole story. The overall  social business solutions market is ~$2.9B in 2012, growing to ~$10.3B by  2016 (a CAGR of 28.8%). With market numbers like that, it's pretty  obvious why major enterprise vendors like IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)  have all rolled out new social business offerings ranging from ESNs to  customer experience suites this year. It also explains why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  recently bought ESN vendor (and a market leader in our recent social software marketscape) Yammer.So now it's time for SAP to make its move and with this week's  announcement, the company becomes a contender in the social software market. Now  this didn't just happen, though. There's a bit of a story to it, as one  might expect. Earlier this year, SAP signaled that it was getting serious  about social by hiring well-known social business expert Sameer Patel  to head up its social business efforts as the Global VP and GM of social  software solutions (Disclaimer: he's also a friend). Sameer spent the  better part of the last several years helping companies actually DO  something with social business solutions, so he brings a wealth of real-world experience to the position and the team. Since joining SAP, he has  gathered together a talented team and completely reworked SAP's strategy  and offerings, and I have to admit so far, I like what I've seen.There are quite a few ESN solutions on the market today, and frankly,  most have similar features. They can operate as a system of relationships  across the entire organization, and offer employees a modern, clean and  simple way to collaborate and connect to each other, and to data,  content and systems. This approach, forming a new social layer, works  fine for some employees and some roles -- that is, moving collaboration  and a lot of day-to-day communication into a new system. Some employees,  particularly in some specific roles -- roles that spend much of their  time doing work inside an enterprise system, like customer service  agents or AP/AR clerks -- find it undesirable or inconvenient to add an  new system for communication and collaboration that is separate from the  system that occupies most of their daily activities. That's why it's  necessary to provide the capability to embed the ESN into other  enterprise systems to get the broad adoption that delivers the greatest  value from the network. While the current leading ESNs have this  capability, it has always seemed to me that the major enterprise vendors  were in a unique position here, and could leverage the ESN most  effectively through inserting it into the work flows inside their other  enterprise systems. That's exactly what SAP is doing with its new ESN  product, SAP Jam.SAP Jam, which is offered both on premises and in the cloud, is built to  connect people (employees, partners, customers) to people, content and  data in context to the enterprise work flow/process. Jam is enterprise- ready, mobile (iPad app available now), secure, not silo'ed, and in SAP  terms ""infused"" across the rest of the SAP apps portfolio (phased in  across the next few releases, of course). The following diagram, provided  by SAP, gives a good overview of the strategy:The current roadmap, which is subject to change, provides social  on-boarding and collaborative opportunity management in Q4 2012, along  with several integrations, including Sales OD, Finance OD, Social OD and  CRM 7, as well as the Jam API. In the first half of 2013, SAP plans to  add:...along with a number of additional integrations, including an OpenSocial API.SAP has come a long way in a very short period of time, and has some  very aggressive plans in the coming months. The real proof is in the  execution, so I'm anxious to see how the plans progress, and to talk to  some live customers once there's a bit more experience with the new  solutions. Based on what I've seen so far, SAP is definitely in the  social business software game now, and has a good opportunity to provide  significant value to its customers."

Two months later, the deal has finally closed and SAP isn’t wasting any time in releasing a product roadmap for SuccessFactors now that the company is part of the SAP family.As the New York Times reported back in December, SAP saw SuccessFactors as one entry point into the cloud. Forrester analyst Paul Hamerman told the publication at the time that “The cloud has been a small part of SAP’s revenue stream, about 2 percent; the deal adds to the revenue base and shows SAP’s strong commitment to the software-as-a-service business model.”Today, SAP says that SuccessFactors’ software will be combined with SAP solutions to provide a comprehensive offering to clients. SAP will continue to offer its own Human Capital Management on premise solution but will be pushing SuccessFactors’ performance, compensation, recruiting and learning management products in the cloud. The talent management components from SAP’s software will be selectively innovated on, says the company.Basically, SAP’s existing HCM products will be the on-premise offering and SuccessFactors will be deployed in the cloud. There are currently no plans to phase out any SuccessFactors products, says SAP.SAP explains that data and analytics will be a focus area for further innovations in both SuccessFactors and SAP’s HCM offerings. SuccessFactors software will be integrated with SAP’s data analysis product HANA.The human capital management industry is huge and big enterprise companies are betting that the cloud is the future of this space. Salesforce just announced the acquisition of social performance platform Rypple, and will be launching a new product and SuccessFactors-rival, Successforce.

This allows SAP to put more money toward growing the business.The balance sheet looks solid with total cash of $6.06 billion and total debt of $5.39 billion. The company has 1.13 times more current assets than current liabilities. The debt to equity ratio is a respectable 33.14.SAP has grown earnings annually at a market beating pace of 12.41% in the last five years. It has 2 upward earnings revisions for 2012 and 3 upward revisions for 2013. For the next five years, SAP is expected to grow earnings annually at 12.53%. This expected growth is higher than IBM's (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) growth of 11.5% and 9.13% respectively. This growth should take the current stock price of $57 to over $100 in five years.The company's growth strategy is to strengthen its position as the market leader. It plans to do this by innovating and developing the world's best business applications. SAP plans on expanding its leadership with on-premise business applications. It also will introduce new on-demand solutions and enable new connectivity to mobile on-device applications.SAP's business analytics solutions have been the key driver for growth. The company is using in-memory technology to enable business analytics applications that were previously not feasible in the past. The SAP Business by Design solution has been released offering applications that run completely in the cloud.The Sybase acquisition allows SAP to help businesses become unwired by combining enterprise applications, business analytics, and a mobile infrastructure. Customers will have the confidence of having efficient coordinated data and processes on multiple devices.Overall, SAP should continue to outperform the S&P 500 over the long-term. It also has a slight edge on expected earnings growth over its competition, IBM and Microsoft. This edge could add up significantly over several years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

It laid out a full suite of enterprise software based in the cloud, and sold as services - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Human Capital Management (HCM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) - all aimed at having its customers through SAP clouds.It's a tough transition, since SAP has always been considered a direct Oracle competitor, a provider of enterprise systems with licenses sold per-server. Now it not only has to deliver cloud-based solutions but offer cloud-based pricing as well. The company promised that 5,000 people are now working on that, but anyone who studies software knows that the more programmers you have on a job the harder it is to coordinate them and the slower the work can actually go.The SAP cloud program, called NetWeaver, will be based on VMWare's Cloud Foundry, and will aim for integration with other cloud vendors like IBM. Since cloud doesn't assure mobile, the company said it will be working with CapGemini to develop co-marketed solutions in that area. Until then it will continue offering mobile device management through Amazon's cloud.The biggest problem analysts see is how it will put so many development eggs in the cloud basket while retaining its revenue streams in ERP, a system it hasn't upgraded since 2009. Will SAP customers wait for the SAP cloud, and follow the SAP strategy into mobile, or will they look elsewhere, like to IBM (NYSE:IBM)?The real story, however, should be its divergence from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), with which it's usually compared since both began as enterprise-class database vendors. While Oracle bought Sun Microsystems and went into hardware, SAP has stayed strictly in software, and may well be ahead of its rival in delivering customers the cloud, social and mobile solutions they seem to crave. Going back a year, Oracle has lost nearly one-fourth of its market value while SAP has held fairly steady.Holding things steady, overall, during a major transition is a bit like a sports team that manages to bring up rookies to replace aging stars and remains a contender. Optimists may see SAP as the San Antonio Spurs of software.Disclosure: I am long IBM."
320076,20725,2012-01-17T15:41:49-05:00,,"SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) has been trading in a range this whole year and now that it is closer to the bottom of its range, I wanted to take a closer look at the stock to see if it is attractive at these price levels. Here are five points I looked at while researching SAP:Valuation: The trailing valuation metrics imply that SAP is cheap as it is trading in the lower end of its 5 year valuation metrics. SAP’s current P/B ratio is 4.0 and it has ranged between 3.0 and 8.8 over the past 5 years. SAP’s current P/S ratio is 3.3 and it has averaged 3.9 over the past 5 years with a high of 5.5 and low of 2.6. SAP’s current P/E ratio is 17.2 and it has averaged 21.6 over the past 5 years with a high of 28.9 and low of 15.6.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow SAP is $61. That is upside of about 11% from where the stock is currently at. This suggests that SAP is fairly valued at these levels.Forward Valuation: SAP is currently trading at 17 times FY12 EPS. SAP’s closest comp is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which is trading 10 times next year’s earnings. This is much higher than other tech giants trade at. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is trading at 10 times, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading for 9 times, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is trading at 10 times, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is trading for 12 times, and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is trading at 6 times. The average forward P/E ratio for the five tech stocks is 9. This suggests that SAP is overvalued at these levels.Dividend: SAP pays an annual dividend and has paid one since 1988. Its last dividend was paid on May 23, 2011 and was 82.5 cents a share for a dividend yield of 1.5%. Translated into euros as SAP is based on Germany, the dividend was a 20% increase over the prior year.Earnings Estimates: SAP beat earnings estimates its last two quarters after missing 1Q11’s estimates. The 2Q11 earnings beat was 2 cents while the 3Q11 beat was 8 cents. If the company is able to report earnings with an 8 cent beat, that should provide a positive catalyst to the stock.Price Action: SAP has had an up and down year. In the first part of last year, the stock rose over 26% to over $67 a share before it pulled back all the way to below $48 during late summer and late fall. Then the stock rallied again to the $63 level and then pulled back again, and is now trading at around the $55 level. The stock is now below its 50 day and 200 day moving averages. The 50 day moving average sits at just below $57 while the 200 day moving average sits just below $58 a share. On the upside, $55 should serve as a key resistance level followed by the $60 level. On the downside, $52 should serve as support followed by $48.(Click to enlarge)Conclusion: SAP looks overvalued here as it is trading at a significant premium to other tech giants and low upside from analysts’ consensus target. It is probably better to take a closer look at Oracle or other tech giants to add to your portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company published initial  numbers for its results but will be releasing full results and  projections for 2012 in late January.Total Q4 revenue came in at €4.50 billion ($5.7 billion), an increase  of 11%. Operating profit was €1.67 billion ($2 billion), an increase of  206%. The company saw record fourth quarter 2011 software revenue,  which was up 16% to €1.74 Billion ($2.2 billion). And full-year 2011  software revenue is up 22% to €3.97 Billion ($5 billion), with full-year  total sales coming in at €14.23 billion ($18 billion), up 14 percent.SAP says that its record performance was driven by growth in its  sofwtare applications business, with particular strength in demand for  analytics and mobile solutions as well as for SAP’s data analysis  product HANA (which saw $202 million in revenue for the year). Mobile  contributed more than $127 million in software revenue for the quarter.“In an uncertain environment, SAP delivered the best year in its 40  year history. We gained significant market share and achieved  double-digit growth across all regions,” said Bill McDermott and Jim  Hagemann Snabe, co-CEOs of SAP, in a statement. “Our innovation strategy  is winning. Customers see the incredible value we deliver and recognize  that SAP is the better choice.”SAP just dropped $3.4 billion on SuccessFactors, pushing the enterprise software giant’s cloud strategy. The company is also planning to spend $2 billion in China through 2015 to grow its international business.Original post"
312124,20412,2011-12-06T11:43:03-05:00,,"According to the MGI SaaS valuation model, SAP (NYSE:SAP) did not overpay for its acquisition of SuccessFactors.There are so many comments about SAP overpaying for SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF) that SAP has started spreading its own rumours about how they had to pay more in order to thwart a competing bid for SFSF. We remain skeptical of the fact of any competing bid. SFSF was never high on our stock list and on numerous occasions we had over the past couple of years pointed out the discrepancies between SFSF valuation and operating parameters. The company was at the top of its peer group in terms of a valuation multiple and near the bottom of the scale in terms of operating efficiency measured by MGI Index. Then, to top it off, the company updated/restated its reported SEC numbers frequently, something that was overlooked by most analysts. All that, combined with a high level of hype surrounding the company, made us uncomfortable with the stock. Yet, with all this baggage, we would be the first ones to point out that at the end of the day SAP did not overpay for SFSF.Several MGI research reports point out the relationship that exists between growth rate and valuation of SaaS companies. When Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) acquired RightNow (NASDAQ:RNOW), the valuation came in within 5% of that predicted by our SaaS valuation model. A similar chain of events seems to take place now. SAP's take out valuation of SFSF is within 5% of what was predicted by our model (See MGI Research Note ""SaaS Valuation: What Price is Right?"" published in March of 2011). Over the last four quarters SFSF revenue growth rate vs. the same quarter in the prior year (PYQ) averages to about 55%. Using our valuation model that translates into a revenue multiple of 11.38. SFSF trailing twelve month revenue adds up to about $292 Million. Putting that together, that translates into an theoretical Enterprise Value (EV) of $3.322 Billion. SAP is paying $3.4 Billion for SFSF. The company has about $250 Million in cash and no debt, thus translating into acquisition EV of $3.15 Billion. The theoretical EV exceeds the actual acquisition EV by $172Mil or by about 5% of the actual purchase price paid by SAP.The ultimate issue for SAP investors and customers is not whether or not SAP is overpaying or underpaying for SFSF. The real issue is what are they going to do with this property and how can they make this deal matter to SAP shareholders. If the acquisition is a success, i.e. SAP grows its cloud presence and creates some clarity for its customers, partners and investors then no one will remember the price paid for this deal. If the deal splashes and then burns out like a roman candle, then SAP will have bigger issues to worry about than the price they paid.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
312020,25120,2011-12-06T04:39:31-05:00,,"Over the weekend SAP (NYSE:SAP) announced it would acquire US-based SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF) for $3.4bn. The deal indicates that SAP is making a serious commitment to their cloud-based strategy. SuccessFactors shareholders are in the clouds since they receive a 52% premium compared to Friday's close.The dealSAP will pay $3.4bn for the company or $40 a share. Based on Friday's close at $26.25 the 52% premium that the Walldorf, Germany-based company pays comes close to $1.2bn.SAP's shareholders seemed disappointed with the price of the deal which is on the high side. SAP is trading 2% lower, losing $1.2bn in market value in a market which is trading up in general. The initial judgment call from the market is that this is mere a wealth transfer from SAP's shareholders to those of SuccessFactors.SuccessFactorsFocused on employee management software, the ten-year old company is seeing rapid-growth. Revenues in 2010 totaled $206mn on which the company lost $12mn. Revenues for coming year are expected to come in at $330 million and expected to grow to about $500mn in 2015.Oracle's RightClick acquisitionAnalysts are quick to point out that the acquisition looks expensive compared to the $1.4bn acquisition of RightNow made by Oracle in October. Some are suggesting the acquisition is a defensive move as competitors have been on an acquisition spree already.Oracle paid just a 22% premium, compared to the 52% SAP is paying. Furthermore, SAP pays 16 times 2010 revenues, compared to Oracle's multiple of 8 times.Oracle has turned itself into an acquisition machine as it has spent over $40bn over the last five years on numerous acquisitions. SAP has traditionally focused on internal growth and did its first successful acquisition last year when it bought Sybase for $6bn.Cloud strategySAP changed its internal growth strategy towards a more acquisition-based one after former CEO Leo Apotheker left for Hewlett Packard in 2010. Co-CEOs McDermott and Hagemann acquired Sybase just months after Apotheker's resignation. The acquisition of SuccessFactors seems an admission that the internal growth strategy for cloud solutions has been a failure.SAP is competing with big names such as Oracle, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in a fast growing cloud-computing market expected to more than double in size reaching $150bn in 2014 according to research firm Gartner.While $3.4bn is a high price, it is the right price to pay according to SAP executives. SuccessFactors offers enormous synergies with existing SAP businesses and it is growing at a rapid pace. The acquisition gives SAP a platform and an opportunity to grow a powerhouse by innovations and internal growth.SAP shareholders have been happy with current management. Shares are up 18% year-to-date. The acquisition might be expensive at first glance, but high potential growth and synergies might create a lot of value for SAP's shareholders down the road if SAP manages to make cloud-computing profitable. As always, it all relies on the execution.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
312086,23915,2011-12-06T10:01:11-05:00,,"By Phil MarshSAP AG (NYSE:SAP) announced on Saturday that it would acquire cloud software maker SuccessFactors, Inc. (NYSE:SFSF) for $3.4 billion in cash, a major move that puts the dominant maker of business applications squarely into cloud computing. It is a transaction that may signal many more of its type to come as traditional software and business service companies strive to remain relevant and innovative by acquisition.At over $40 per share in cash, the purchase comes at a 52-percent premium on SFSF's Friday closing price of $26.25 per share. The deal, however, brings SAP much needed top-line growth in an area where the company itself has largely failed. Paul Hamerman, an analyst at Forrester, a technology research group, stated in Forrester's blog that “By acquiring SuccessFactors, SAP puts itself into a much stronger competitive position in human resources applications and reaffirms its commitment to software-as-a-service as a key business model.”Forrester sees the cloud computing market expanding six-fold from its current volume of 40 billion, to more than 240 billion in 2020. Software providers are increasingly moving their offerings into the cloud and reducing their leverage on their traditional on-site installations. Customers are becoming ever mindful of the benefits in terms of cost, scalability and continuous upgrades availed on solutions that reside on the web rather than within their own servers. Unlike installed software, cloud applications have no upfront cost since they are often deployed on a subscription basis. And with companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) making great strides in cloud computing, security has become much less of a barrier to adaption.In the race to capture this growth, SAP is seen as lagging behind its competition -especially its archrival, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) - with whom it is battling with for customers. In October of this year, Oracle made a move in the race for the cloud and purchased RightNow Technologies (NASDAQ:RNOW), an SAP competitor, for $1.5 billion. Although SAP is expected to meet a current goal of reaching 1,000 cloud customers by the year's end, cloud computing contributed just 2 percent of revenues for 2010, roughly $335 million. Considering the comparatively superior growth for cloud services compared to installed solutions, this picture needs to change for SAP to catch up.By comparison, SuccessFactors posted revenue of $205.9 million in 2010 and was on track to nearly double that to $400 million next year. For a much smaller company, SuccessFactors enjoys an active subscriber base of 15 million spread over 3,500 corporate customers in 168 countries. In a sign of its flexibility in scale of operations, its customers' user base ranges from the few dozens to over 2 million. Its portfolio includes talent and recruiting management, goal and performance reviews, business execution and even senior executive succession planning.These people-focused cloud applications are expected to integrate smoothly and be highly complementary with SAP's enterprise strengths. In addition to its own installed solutions for talent management and workforce analytics, SAP's core services include HR, payroll and shared services delivery. SAP currently has over 15,000 human capital management deployments over its customer base, through which it reaches over 500 million employees - all of which would have a likely interest in the new cloud offerings SuccessFactors brings to the fold.SAP, who said it was financing the SuccessFactors acquisition with cash on hand and a $1.4 billion loan facility, said the deal would slightly dilute earnings for 2012 but would become accretive in subsequent years. The company has a standing goal to boost total revenue to $26.9 billion by 2015, an improvement of over $10 billion compared to last year, which market the company's return to growth following the 2009 economic crisis. This target is now likely to be surpassed.SAP's acquisition of SuccessFactors is arguably a move that ensures its continued presence in a battlefront for increased digital footprint and users. SAP and its legacy competitors such as Oracle and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are not only competing with Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), the current undisputed leader by volume in the customer relationship cloud computing, but they are increasingly competing with companies like Google and Facebook (although not for strictly the same objective… yet). Employees and decision makers are using their online social habits (and the cloud) with them at work, and will increasingly ask why their tools at work are not as easy as their social life.This purported revolution will most assuredly rearrange the current industry landscape in the coming couple of years. This acquisition was not the first. IBM already has Social Business and Cross Channel Commerce acquisitions under its belt. Since October, so does, as we said, Oracle with RightNow, almost certainly this will not be the last planned acquisition.The astute investor will find probable reward by keeping an eye on current competitors to SuccessFactors, equally innovating and of similar size, and thus with matching potential. Taleo (NASDAQ:TLEO) Kenexa (KNXA) and NetSuite (NYSE:N) come to mind among current publicly traded targets for acquisition. Workday is another enterprise-in-the-cloud player that will become public in the second half of next year.SAP closed Friday at $59.54 per share on Friday, and SFSF traded at $26.25 per share on the same close.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
311960,22829,2011-12-05T17:40:38-05:00,,"By Brenon DalyAfter struggling for years to build its own on-demand offering, SAP (NYSE:SAP) plans to buy its way into cloud-based software, handing over $3.65bn for  SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF) in what would be the largest-ever SaaS acquisition. The  deal combines the largest ERP vendor, which has some 500 million users,  with the fast-growing human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM) provider. However,  the acquisition, which is slated to close in the first quarter of next  year, does face some challenges. J.P. Morgan Securities advised SAP on  the transaction, while Morgan Stanley banked SuccessFactors, after leading its IPO four years ago.SAP, which is 30 years older than SuccessFactors, has consistently  pulled back the targets for its Business ByDesign SaaS suite since it  started talking about it a half-decade ago. The difficulty in moving  more quickly into a subscription-based software model is underscored by  the fact that even after it drops $3.65bn to make SuccessFactors its  cloud-based HCM product, SAP will continue to sell its own existing  on-premises talent management offering. In fairness, we had our doubts  about SAP’s previous big deal – the $6.1bn purchase of Sybase  in mid-2010, which thrust the German giant into a host of new markets,  including mobility and databases – but the early returns from that  combination have been fairly solid.However, when we compare SAP’s two most recent significant  acquisitions, we can’t help but be struck by one gigantic discrepancy:  valuation. SAP is paying a price-to-sales multiple that’s roughly twice  as rich for SuccessFactors compared to the one it paid for Sybase.  SuccessFactors is projected to do about $330m in sales in 2011, meaning  it is garnering a rich 10 times revenue valuation, while Sybase traded  at about 5x revenue. Obviously, SuccessFactors’ projected growth of 57%  this year goes a long way toward explaining that premium, as does the  fact that it’s a subscription-based business with 15 million  subscribers. But even when compared with Oracle’s recent purchase of RightNow, which went off at about 6.6x trailing sales, SAP’s move seems pricey."

SAP's purchase of SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF) could easily be the start of a gold rush on SaaS companies, as enterprises buy them, push them as cloud plays, and use the locked-in revenues to adapt to the new business computing environment.Here are some companies that have gained on news of the SFSF acquisition, and could be in a great position to cash in:There are two reasons why human resources specialists are rising most quickly to the bait here. First, these SaaS applications provide substantial lock-in of customers. Once you're devoted to Saba, it's hard to move to Taleo. Second, there are enough of these companies around that most would see a buy-out as being in their best interests.While it may not appear that human resources have much in common with databases, it's still an enterprise computer application, and thus similar to the kinds of companies Oracle spent the last decade acquiring, like Seibel Systems and PeopleSoft.For companies that see themselves as direct competitors to Oracle, shopping on the recruitment SaaS aisle may make a lot of sense.Disclosure: I am long IBM."

I have seen it in action, and the product will greatly improve the mobile ERP experience.  The company is mature and is making its 35% margin targets. SAP although it is losing some market share it is still dominant at the largest companies. SAP's BPC (Business Planning and Consolidations) product is more open to development that the similar Hyperion offerings of Oracle.   These are all reasons to have SAP in your portfolio. Over the last few months I have seen scores of Oracle customers in health care and other fields switching or planning to switch to SAP to use their tailored options. It seems as if Oracle is just dumping growing sectors of customers to avoid providing specific solutions. If this trend continues and spreads to other sectors, SAP may be able to put more distance between it and Oracle. This will lead to top- and bottom-line growth.If you believe in custom solutions and would like to access your ERP from your smart phone, I would put a strong buy on SAP.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
311735,21392,2011-12-04T14:39:08-05:00,,"For years, a variety of industry analysts and bloggers have  suggested that SAP (NYSE:SAP) jumpstart its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and  broader Cloud initiatives with a major acquisition, such as  SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF). Today’s news that SAP will buy SuccessFactors  for $3.4 billion shows that the company’s executives have finally  admitted that they can no longer rely on internal development and  organic sales efforts to gain a meaningful share of the rapidly growing  SaaS/Cloud marketplace.I can’t say that I’ve been among those advocating this type of bold  move because I’ve been a part of a similar acquisition which failed to  achieve its strategic objective, and I’m not convinced that SAP will be  able to transform its business through this transaction.Back in 1999, I worked for a fast-growing network professional  services company, called International Network Services (INS), which was  acquired by Lucent Technologies for $3.7 billion, or 12x revenues!  Lucent’s goal was to transform the telco equipment vendor into a  multidimensional services provider, like IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) Global Services unit.  INS’ leaders were given responsibility to run Lucent’s services business  in hopes they could reinvigorate the unit and gain market leadership.  Despite all the grandiose promises made at the time of the acquisition  announcement, deeply rooted corporate politics and a corporate culture  which discouraged innovation within Lucent conspired to bury INS’  strengths. As a result, the acquisition couldn’t help Lucent avoid an  inevitable death spiral which it never recovered from, and the INS unit  was divested three years later for a penny on the dollar.Today’s announcement states that SuccessFactors’ CEO and Founder Lars  Dalgaard will assume responsibility of SAP’s SaaS and Cloud business,  and SuccessFactors will continue to operate as an independent business  unit. While both these moves are the right way to go for SAP, my guess  is that a year from now the luster will be off the rose and many of  SuccessFactors’ key executives and employees will be gone when their  payouts are fulfilled or the SAP’s politics have driven them out to find  new opportunities elsewhere.This is not an indictment of SAP in particular, but a law of nature  in general. There have been few corporate transformations in any  industry, especially in the tech sector, fueled by bold acquisitions.  Young, aggressive companies don’t fit well into old, entrenched  companies. Executive and employee motives, and corporate policies and  politics differ too severely to mix well. For example, you can bet many  of the key personal at RightNow will also disappear from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) a year  from now as many of their predecessors have done after past Oracle  acquisitions.I hope I’m wrong. SuccessFactors (and RightNow) has been an important  force in the SaaS movement. I know plenty of people within SAP who  sincerely want to deliver competitive SaaS/Cloud solutions to satisfy  their customers’ changing needs and escalating demands. But, SAP’s  leadership and legacy software, operating systems and salary structures  will need to be significantly realigned to successfully absorb  SuccessFactors and make it a real catalyst for change that will make SAP  a market leader in the SaaS/Cloud marketplace.It will take more than a bold-stroke acquisition to put SAP on a  fast-path to success. It will require changing the deeply embedded  dynamics which have stood in the way of the company fully accepting the  reality of SaaS and magnitude of the Cloud. It will take a long-term and  broadbased effort to make SAP a leader in the new world order.The good news is that the SaaS/Cloud movement is just starting to  gain broad-based acceptance and SAP has time to take advantage of  the market momentum. However, any indication that the company isn’t truly  committed to delivering competitive offerings will drive more current  and prospective customers to its SaaS/Cloud-centric competitors, such as  Workday."

So in February 2010, the newly appointed co-CEOs – Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe – vowed to change things.In their favor, they actually do seem to have boosted employee performance and morale. But placating shareholders has proved a far less simple challenge to master. And if they can’t master it soon, the company might fight itself under new management once again.Is SAP a Takeover Candidate? SAP has to convince its three founders – with their combined 24% of shares – about SAP’s stand-alone strategy. Otherwise, it could become a takeover candidate.Gartner Research Director Thomas Otter says:SAP’s stock price trailed its archrival’s, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), for yet another year. And it received another blow recently when a court ruled it had to pay interest on top of the $1.3 billion already awarded to Oracle in a copyright infringement case. Allegedly, several emerging market sovereign wealth funds have recently made inquiries about SAP. Specifically, they asked if Klaus Tschira, a founder who owns about 8.4% of the stock, would want to sell his stake.The answer seems to be no… for now. But that might change if SAP doesn’t start performing to satisfaction soon. After all, he and the other two founders are all over 65 years old. They may decide selling to a strategic partner would be the best way to secure SAP’s future, and their own.Helmuth Gumbel, managing partner at IT research firm Strategy Partners, put it this way: “Will the current management be able to prove it can reinvent SAP [without a partner]? I don’t see the visionary who could meaningfully drive such a restart.”Possible Buyers for SAPSpeculators believe a takeover is inevitable. But while SAP’s market cap of about $60 billion looks attractive, it excludes all but other large technology companies from biting.Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) currently leads the list of potential buyers. The company is even now looking to expand its reach into software. Fueling speculation further, Leo Apotheker became HP’s CEO back in September. Forced out as SAP’s chief executive in February 2010, he now wants to make software a priority.The aforementioned Gunbel says, “For the three founders, HP would be a good exit.” But whether Apotheker wants to help a company that booted him remains uncertain.Additionally, with a market valuation just a bit over 50% higher than SAP, HP would face significant risks absorbing the German software giant. It doesn’t have the same size as other potential suitors like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).IBM, however, turned its back on the applications business in the 1990s, showing little indication of returning. And while Microsoft did attempt to acquire SAP about three years ago, it is now focused on beating out Oracle and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the mobile and online markets.SAP’s FutureIf some company does mount a takeover for SAP, it won’t be at bargain basement prices. The company’s stock still trades at about 20 times forward earnings. That could discourage potential suitors, since comparatively speaking, Oracle’s sits in the mid-teens.So like it or not, the company’s fate rests on the current CEOs, who are busy selling the idea that SAP has already reinvented itself. Snabe and McDermott are moving it away from its traditional desktop software sales for business processes like personnel planning and accounting systems. Instead, they’re trying to broaden SAP’s customer base by expanding into products for mobile devices.To do this, they intend to introduce a line of new products. That especially includes the $5.8 billion purchase in May 2010 of database and mobile software specialist Sybase. But the deal raised eyebrows at the time and continues to do so. To date, these initiatives have failed to bring significant growth to SAP.Therefore, its new products need to start making a noticeable impact on revenues. Soon. The clock is ticking on McDermott and Snabe already… and nobody knows how much time it has left.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids its writers from having a financial interest in any security they recommend to our subscribers.

293181,24276,2011-09-12T17:06:13-04:00,,"With the euro in free fall because of Europe, the continent's strongest companies are suddenly on sale.Might someone take a run at SAP (NYSE:SAP)?SAP is well regarded by many Americans at Seeking Alpha, and just as U.S. assets go on sale when the dollar falls, so is SAP now on sale thanks to the euro.The problem here is who would buy it? Here are three likely candidates:Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is the most logical buyer. It's SAP's closest competitor, it has been hurt in the marketplace, and the company's strategy has always been to buy firms in its niche that threaten its ability to keep prices high. The company is still worth more than twice SAP's market cap of about $60 billion.A cash-and-stock deal would empty Oracle's vaults, however, and probably leave SAP stockholders with a substantial share in the company, something CEO Larry Ellison may find impossible to swallow. There might also be serious antitrust considerations on both sides of the Atlantic, which would increase the deal's costs and could scuttle it.IBM (NYSE:IBM) is worth more than three times what SAP is, so a deal would not give SAP shareholders as much control of the parent as Oracle might, but IBM has much less cash than Oracle, meaning stock would have to play a bigger role.IBM has been moving strongly into software and services for many years. It's big in the enterprise, like SAP, so the two companies may mesh. And there would not likely be the same antitrust worries as with Oracle.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may be in the strongest position to make a move. Its $52 billion cash hoard and $216 billion market cap means SAP would not be a great stretch for the giant of Redmond. SAP's product line does run on Windows as well a several versions of Linux.But Microsoft would have to be making a huge commitment to the enterprise here, away from consumer markets where it remains strong. The company is very focused on its cloud strategy with Azure, and SAP would not necessarily make a good fit with that.Of course, there's another way this might work, with SAP the buyer rather than the seller.Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is now worth 25% less than SAP, at $45 billion. It's highly vulnerable to a takeover, but finding a compatible fit has proven impossible.But with HP getting out of the PC business, now might be the time for someone like SAP co-CEO Bill McDermott to pounce. Such a deal would replicate Oracle's purchase of Sun, aiming to provide its software customers with a complete hardware-software solution. HP's data clusters may also be attractive as a way for SAP to build a cloud strategy.Buying into America would also provide SAP with a hedge against further falls in the euro, and end the soap opera involving the HP board and CEO Leo Apotheker, who joined the company after being pushed out by SAP.While most M&A activity is frozen by the troubles in Europe, that's not entirely true in technology, where Broadcom (BRCM) has just announced the purchase of NetLogic, HP just bought Autonomy, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has bought Motorola Mobility.So why not put SAP in play?Disclosure: I am long IBM."
241374,21568,2010-12-13T08:12:10-05:00,,"By Michael KanellosSAP (NYSE:SAP) adopts solar, LED lights, electric cars, videoconferencing and  DC data centers in Palo Alto. Guess which one saves the most?Fluctuating energy prices, new regulations, employee satisfaction and  market opportunities are prompting large and small businesses to adopt  green technologies.But where do you get the most bang for your buck?At the Palo Alto campus of SAP, the answer turns out to be videoconferencing.  The company, as part of an overall energy retrofit, installed three  telepresence systems from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) in Palo Alto for a cost of  $300,000. The units will save $300,000 in reduced travel costs in the  first year alone. Besides that, they boost productivity.“No one wants to fly every few weeks to Germany,” said Rami Branitzky,  the managing director of SAP Labs North America. SAP has 28 installed  worldwide and more could follow.Solid state lighting came in second place. SAP installed 337 LED fixtures from Lunera and connected them through a network from Redwood Systems. Total cost: $434,000. Annual savings: $80,000.“It is the best business case except telepresence,” said Peter Graf, SAP’s chief sustainability officer.Retrofitting the data center to run on DC power came in fourth place,  right behind a $1.2 million solar array, but the best part has yet to  come for DC. The retrofit -- which largely revolved around installing a  rectifier that can convert high voltage AC power from the grid into high  voltage DC to run computers and storage equipment -- cost $128,000 and  saves $24,000 a year. (DC rectifiers save power by reducing the number  of times power gets converted from AC to DC and vice versa before it  powers a server -- we’re huge fans of DC power these days).That’s a 5.3-year payback. Overall, the DC data center reduces power  consumption in the data center by 15 to 20 percent, said Branitzky.Graf, however, added that SAP will study ways to deliver power from the  solar array at the campus straight to the data center. Solar panels  directly produce DC power. A roof-to-computer rack could thus eliminate  two more AC-DC conversions: solar DC power wouldn't have to go through  an inverter to become AC and the AC-DC rectifier at the data center gate  could take a nap.Such a system could reduce power consumed by the data center by a total  of 30 to 40 percent. SAP also installed technology from Sentilla and  OSISoft in its data center to curb power.Meanwhile, a fleet of EVs and 16 chargers cost $250,000 and saves $21,000, reaping a somewhat protracted 12-year payback.The retrofit -- shown off at an open house for customers, partners and  reporters -- helps SAP cut its own operating costs, but more  importantly, it will serve as a test bed to show what the company can  accomplish for its customers. Like rivals IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP wants to  provide software and services that will help large corporations better  manage their operations.For years, SAP’s software mostly focused on parameters like factory  productivity, cost-per-unit, etc. Now, the idea is to highlight building  energy consumption, fuel costs and other direct and indirect factors  tied to energy and resources. Right now, large companies largely  estimate those figures through extrapolation. But in the future, soft  drink managers will, ideally, be able to more easily mine data on  changes to the water or fuel footprint of a canned soda over different  energy pricing scenarios.Regulations and rising energy costs are prompting large companies to  try to better track resources. But price volatility is also a huge  concern. In the last decade, commodity pricing has been 40 percent more  volatile than it was in the previous decade, Graf noted. The uncertain  future surrounding China’s exports of rare earth elements underscores  the problem.A number of startups participated in the retrofit: Lunera, Redwood  Systems, Coloumb Technologies (car charging), and Sentilla. Will these  companies partner with SAP on larger corporate deals? Are they possible acquisition targets?Don’t read too much into it, Graf cautioned me. Most of these companies  make technologies that directly impact operations: their software helps  control lights or manage data centers. SAP typically makes software  that manages these management systems.Still, SAP, like Oracle, IBM and Cisco, is a serial acquirer, so keep your eyes peeled.Results like the ones achieved through this initiative will vary with  the circumstances. SAP is a multinational with an aggressive sales  culture. It probably has more execs on the road in a given month than  the U.S. military has people combing the ground in the Tora Bora region.  Not everyone will see those kinds of results. (Cisco has dodged hundreds of millions in travel costs through video.)  By contrast, anyone can benefit from solar. Still, the figures  underscore that energy strategies can be fluid and unpredictable.Disclosure: No positions"
311793,25183,2011-12-05T07:46:07-05:00,,"This past Saturday, SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) announced it was acquiring SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF), a cloud HR software provider, for $3.4 billion. Although this is a 52% premium to SuccessFactor's Friday close, this allows SAP to ""establish an advanced end-to-end offering of cloud and on-premise solutions for managing all relevant business processes"" according to its press release.There is a legitimate reason why SAP was willing to pay such a premium. SAP understands the value of an enhanced presence in cloud computing, and this merger agreement will add momentum to SAP's cloud services-- an advantage that will prove crucial-- especially in a sector saturated other heavyweights such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).SAP is a German developer and provider of business software. Yes, it is a European company. However, the huge fiscal fiasco in the eurozone, one which has taken down Greece and is paralyzing Spain and Italy, has surprisingly left SAP unscathed. Take, for example, SAP's most recent earnings report. In the middle of the European sovereign debt crisis, the German business software developer reported that revenue rose 14% to about $4.7 billion, with gains of 26% in Europe, 35% in the U.S. and 42% in the Asia-Pacific region. SAP's software license sales, a reliable gauge of customer sentiment, increased 28% to about $1.2 billion.From a CAN SLIM approach, SAP is a very attractive stock, one which now suddenly finds itself with a catalyst in the form of the SuccessFactors acquisition. SAP's 2011 3Q Earnings Per Share was up 35% from last year's 3Q EPS, and its 3Q earnings blew away analysts' estimates by 59%. The average EPS Growth for SAP's last 3 quarters is a solid 35%, and its current EPS estimate for 4Q is up 19% from the EPS of the same quarter last year. SAP's estimated annual earnings growth for this year is up 13.48% from last year's earnings.SAP has zero debt and a healthy Annual Return On Equity (ROE) of 28.7%.  Its annual Pre-Tax Margin is 29.8% and the 2011 3Q sales increased by 12% from last year's 3Q sales. Although SAP has a paltry 3% 3 Year Sales Growth Rate, it is steadily gaining market share, a development which-- compounded with its acquisition of SuccessFactors-- could very possibly result in a winning stock. Also, SAP holds a commanding lead over some of its much bigger competitors such as Microsoft and Oracle in several target markets; according to fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Brian Bleifield, SAP holds 24% of the market share in enterprise resource planning, compared with Oracle's 18% and Microsoft's 11%.I strongly recommend looking into SAP as a potential addition to your stock portfolio. SAP has shown itself to be a very progressive company, one which has recently experienced accelerating growth, especially in its third quarter. It has not been significantly adversely impacted by the European sovereign debt crisis, and it stands to gain an increasing foothold in the cloud services market with its acquisition of SFSF. Combine this with its commanding market share of enterprise resource planning and its surpassing of the vast majority of CAN SLIM criteria, and you can see why SAP-- one of the rare European companies that continues to shine in the midst of a sea of darkness-- is poised to prosper.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SAP over the next 72 hours."

[2] Sage’s presence in the healthcare, payment processing and online banking (a sector with increasing needs for such solutions) verticals is also challenging SAP.According to Gartner, SAP’s market share steadily declined from 2005 to 2009 due in part to Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2005, which lifted its market share in ERP making it second to SAP. Oracle has a strong presence in Europe, SAP’s home market, and has been pushing into the financial services domain and increasing its focus on human resources management (HRM) software, which includes payroll processing, recruiting process, employee services, etc.While we currently forecast modest declines in market share, we note that SAP has maintained market share close to 26% since 2008, and if it can maintain this, this would add around 5% to our price estimates.You can drag the forecast trend-line above to express your own view, and see the sensitivity of SAP’s stock to SAP Market Share in Resource Planning Software.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

238630,22829,2010-11-24T18:09:17-05:00,,"By Brenon DalyHindsight is a wonderful thing. Would SAP (NYSE:SAP) still have gone ahead with  the $10m January 2005 purchase of fledgling third-party apps support  player TomorrowNow (TN) had it had any inkling then of the financial  cost more than five years later -- a $1.3bn payout to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and a ton of  legal fees -- as well as the dent to its previous sterling reputation? TN  was always a loss-making business for SAP and at its height attracted  less than 400 customers, a tiny proportion of the tens of thousands of  Oracle apps customers.SAP had been hoping to only have to pay out $40m over the  intellectual property theft case that Oracle initiated against its  bitter ERP and CRM foe and its TN business back in March 2007. Oracle  alleged that TN, with SAP’s knowledge, had engaged in ‘massive theft’ of  its software and related support materials through a series of illegal  downloads with TN staff using customer passwords to access Oracle’s  technical support websites for its JD Edwards, PeopleSoft and Siebel  families of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) apps. TN had then allegedly used the stolen  materials to support its customers, offering them support at 50% less  than Oracle’s rates.More recently, SAP set aside $120m, but had in no sense been prepared  that the jury would find so strongly in favor of Oracle, which had been  looking for $1.7bn or more. SAP is set to appeal and ‘pursue all its  options’ to reduce the award. This whole saga is far from ended –  already, it’s been the stuff of Silicon Valley soap operas, with Oracle  CEO Larry Ellison speaking out against new Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) CEO Leo  Apotheker, a former CEO of SAP, and failing to serve a subpoena on him  in a bizarre take on the video game ""Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?""Over the course of the case, Oracle had sought to continually expand  the scope of the lawsuit, while SAP had tried to limit its focus. A few  months into legal proceedings, SAP had admitted to some inappropriate  downloads of Oracle material at TN, but shortly before the trial began,  it decided not to contest contributory infringement, effectively  contradicting earlier assertions that SAP executives didn’t have  knowledge about what was going at TN.The jury decision in favor of Oracle could well have a chilling  effect on the remaining third-party support market. It’s one that never  took off to the degree that its advocates had been expecting. In  January, Oracle filed suit  against the leading third-party support vendor, Rimini Street, which is  headed by a cofounder of TomorrowNow. The suit was very similar in tone  and scope to the TN one, but went into less specifics. It’s going to be  interesting to see what happens now, since Rimini Street has been  gearing up for a legal battle of this sort for some time.Much has changed since SAP bought TomorrowNow, a unit it put up for sale, and, after finding no buyers, shuttered in October 2008.  The move was triggered by Oracle’s multibillion-dollar purchases of ERP  and CRM players PeopleSoft and Siebel. The widespread expectation was  that Oracle would push those acquired customer bases to adopt its own  E-Business Suite apps, but there was no large user exodus and Oracle has  delivered new versions of its purchased apps. Indeed, Oracle has also  tempered its big push around a new generation of apps, dubbed Fusion,  with the initial release due next year.So, customers in general are under much less pressure to migrate from  the apps they’re currently using. At the same time, those same users  are facing increased maintenance fees, which are a steady revenue source  for both Oracle and SAP. It’s effectively at present in both companies’  interests to have no third-party apps support market. It will be  interesting to see whether each of them revisits the concept to be one  where they could have some revenue involvement. Over time, each player  will face having to support a wider and wider variety of apps, versions  and deployments, and they may find that taxing on their resources and  therefore not as lucrative as in the past. Both companies are keenly  aware of the gradual wearing-away impact of the software as a service ((SaaS)) apps market, where  maintenance fees are substantially less or are factored into the cost of  per-user, per-month subscriptions."

I can't actually find the actual list on the web site of the list maker, Foreign Policy magazine,  but take my word for it. The above link takes you to the guys tied for  number one in global thinking, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates  and that very successful tailor from Nebraska, the owner of the  Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) shirt company. If you keep working your way  through the web site using subsequent links you get to Shai. My guess is  that this is the speaker list for the upcoming Davos convention. But I  don't see Bono or Al Gore?But back to the IT investment research implications... According to published reports  during the recent damages-phase of the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)-SAP trial (that  was the only phase of course), Agassi said in a two-year-old taped  deposition that he led the evaluation of the TomorrowNow acquisition.  Therefore presumably he recommended it to SAP's boards along with a  caution that Oracle would maybe/likely/probably sue SAP. Also according  to published reports, Agassi estimated in an email that IT investment  analysts would quickly figure out that this idea would hurt Oracle  future earnings so much that its market valuation would plummet because  the big profits in enterprise software are on the services side of the  income statement. (In reality, investment analysts yawned at the idea  and although I have not read the transcripts and filings I would guess  that back in 2006-2007, SAP's boards would have spent no more time  thinking about this idea than on the annual SAP paper-clip budget.)So that was the ""global thinking"" part of the TomorrowNow idea. I admired what Agassi was doing at the time with the SAP NetWeaver business.  It was similarly wide in scope and potentially game-changing for the  enterprise software market. SAP's middleware business quickly but  quietly passed the billion-dollar mark. The thinking was outside the  box (shame on me) even if the TomorrowNow fiasco led to some inside the  buoy sailing. As I said, I haven't studied the transcripts. Please correct me if  the public record says I'm wrong about either SAP top-executive  knowledge or Agassi's personal involvement:[Side note: From an IT perspective, working through the list to Shai  you also find Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Jeff Bezos and Apple (OTC:APPL) co-founder  Steve Jobs, and the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Boys. Eric Schmidt did not appear to  make it; it sucks to be just the hired hand.

When large businesses expand or adapt, they generally need the services of companies such as SAP in order to do so.Looking at today's second quarter earnings, it turns out that software revenue in the United States grew 28% year-over-year, with was faster than that in Asia or most of the world.  ""We had outstanding growth in strategic markets like the U.S. and we saw continued double-digit growth in key emerging markets in Latin America and Asia,"" the company said. (Click to enlarge)Looking forward, SAP expects core revenue to rise 8-9% this year, excluding additional revenue from their recent Sybase acquisition. Importantly, it also expects its operating margin to expand this year to 30-31%, from 27.4% last year.The margin expansion is key since if you combine it with their expected revenue growth, it implies that core operating earnings could grow more than 20% year over year in 2010.

In comparison to 3Q09, SAP is in a far better financial and strategic position, as it continues to see a return to customer spending, integrates its acquisitions of Sybase and Technidata AG, and refreshes its portfolio with new analytics solutions.Reported Growth Not What It Seems, but Improvement From Year AgoSAP benefitted from exchange rates during the quarter, as the company reported 19.7% year-to-year growth in 3Q10. International growth exceeded SAP’s growth within EMEA, with APAC leading at 34.5% year-to-year. TBR concludes that real, organic growth is likely to be in the high single digits, but is still an improvement in comparison to a year ago, when growth rates were declining. The addition and expansion of shorter lifecycle products like appliances, analytics and mobile enterprise applications are driving rapid growth, while longer lifecycle products like SAP’s core ERP solutions continue to grow in the low single-digits.Acquisitions Deliver New Revenue and Increase ExpensesTBR believes Sybase contributed about €100 million from its messaging business, which SAP reported under its Services segment. Sybase exceeded TBR’s expectations of revenue contributions of about €34 million based on the size of Sybase’s business. The Services segment grew 22.0% year-to-year, a rapid increase, as a result of Sybase’s additional revenue. Acquired employees and additional support hired by SAP increased headcount by 4,900 employees from last quarter. TBR believes SAP is hiring now that it is confident the business cycle has turned around and growth will continue. An increase in cost of goods and operating expenses, due to new sales and headcount, led to a slight year-to-year decline in both operating and gross margins of 90 and 100 basis points, respectively.Mobility Is SAP’s New Big Market OpportunitySAP’s mobile strategy will lead new growth as SAP acquired a new market and customer base where the lifecycle is shorter. As customers continue to demand access to information in the form of multiple devices, SAP is positioned to capture revenue as Sybase was a leader of mobile markets.As data management continues to be a high priority for businesses, SAP and Sybase will work to create an Enterprise Information Management portfolio. The companies will combine products to enable the optimization and porting of SAP’s solutions through Sybase’s database servers. The broader portfolio allows customers to have more choice of database platforms to run their SAP applications on and open SAP up to new customers who use systems that, prior to the acquisition, where incompatible with SAP’s applications.Through the combination of SAP’s BusinessObject BI solutions, SAP’s in-memory computing system and Sybase, the company can now offer a high performance business analytics base. This analytics base will offer end-to-end solutions from recognition to utilization of businesses that are optimized for industry specifics solutions.A Future ShowdownSAP has a brief timeframe to get its ducks in a row as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) focuses on gaining traction in the hardware business, transitioning to new President Mark Hurd. Oracle now targets IBM (NYSE:IBM), as well as SAP. SAP will gain some time as Oracle repositions to address IBM. TBR believes SAP will continue to release new products where it has an edge in industry focus and analytics, while it advances strategies to target Oracle in appliances, applications, databases, and mobility. SAP will gain support from other large IT vendors, such as HP (NYSE:HPQ), EMC (EMC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as Oracle continues to expand into their core markets.

Customer CEOs evidenced their support for SAP by signing the “big” strategic deals (over $5 million) that the company needs to rapidly drive revenue growth and profit. Additionally, SAP Co-CEO Bill McDermott reported that the company is now effectively selling below the customer CEO to Line-of-Business executives, a change in sales strategy that pushes SAP deeper down into customer organizations to compete with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Lawson (NASDAQ:LWSN), Infor and others.Revenue growth was supported by growth in the Americas of 37.2% year-to-year as new big deals closed; however, SAP reported that big deals in Europe slid during 2Q10 as conditions deteriorated in June due to the Greek economic crisis. The pipeline did not disappear completely, but was postponed into 3Q10 as the crisis impacted end of quarter deals. TBR believes that a resurgence of sizable transactions in Europe will drive substantial revenue growth in the second half of 2010. Total revenue reached €2.89 billion as the corporate strategies of targeting faster innovation, rebuilding customer confidence, and penetrating new markets begin to take off.SAP reported strong growth within the SME segment, helping the company to top 100,000 total customers with partners closing 10,000 deals. SAP closes 90% of SME deals with its ecosystem partners and channel programs, which is a profitable and scalable business model. Business ByDesign version 2.5, set to release at the end of the week, will provide opportunities for new and existing partners to grow a volume business and further target SME’s with a scalable value proposition for the customer. The volume-ready delivery of Business ByDesign represents a new business model for SAP.SAP Identifies Three Markets for GrowthSAP plans to centralize business efforts around a three-pronged strategy: on-premise, on-demand, and on-device with orchestration. On-premise is targets existing mid-size to large enterprises with the existing portfolio while on-demand represents a new volume sales business model which is supported by the release of Business ByDesign v2.5 and through SAP’s ecosystem and channel programs. Finally, on-device combines SAP’s competencies in analytics and business intelligence with the on-wire Sybase (NASDAQ:SY) platform to build enterprise applications for mobile devices to drive future growth in mobility.TBR believes that the 30% year-to-year growth in SAP’s subscription business during 2Q10 is directly correlated to SAP’s three-pronged business strategy. Deferred income increased by nearly €100 million year-to-year, in line with the increase in subscription revenue, indicating future revenue and further growth within the business segment. Subscription based revenue helps smooth the effects of seasonality and creates a smoother revenue curve. TBR believes that the addition of Sybase to the business, and the subscription revenue from its mobility business, will increase growth even more rapidly for SAP and will ultimately change the cyclicality of the business going forward.Sybase Encompasses Corporate Strategies to Sustain GrowthSAP’s purchase of mobile applications and database vendor, Sybase, aligns with the company’s corporate message to provide customers with a consistent portfolio, as a result of Sybase product focus and customers. Sybase will provide SAP with databases to run SAP software, especially in analytics and business intelligence where data warehousing is necessary. SAP will use Sybase’s sales efficiencies to drive top-line revenue growth and double the size of its addressable market with mobile subscriptions.Disclosure: No positions"

SAP’s Business ByDesign is an on-demand Enterprise Resource  Planning (ERP) software that competes with similar offerings from  Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Oracle  (NASDAQ:ORCL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT).SAP entered the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business with the  release of its first version of Business ByDesign software in September  2007.  However, the mass-ready version of the product was delayed many  times due to performance related issues.  We believe that the mass  release of the upgraded version of Business ByDesign can help SAP to  compete better and potentially help it sustain ERP market share.Key Differences Between  On-Premise and SaaS ServicesWhile traditional on-premise software is hosted on the customer’s PCs  or servers, SaaS is software that is delivered remotely when needed.  Below are the key differences between on-premise and on-demand software:SAP Share in ERP Market Expected to DeclineERP software constitutes about 40% of the $45  Trefis price estimate for SAP’s stock, making it the most valuable  business for SAP.  Large businesses use ERP software to connect  different parts of their databases in order to gain insights into their  businesses and offer better service to their customers.  For example, a  company that has multiple business lines can connect customer and  business information from each business in order to spot cross-selling  opportunities or in order to identify potential cost savings.We expect SAP’s  share in the ERP market to decline from around 26% in 2009 to  around 24% by the end of Trefis forecast period, led by rising  competition from Oracle and other smaller players like Infor and Sage.However, there could be an upside of around 3% to the $45  Trefis price estimate for SAP’s stock if the ‘mass-ready’ Business  ByDesign software were to help SAP stabilize its ERP market share  instead of decline as we forecast.There are two main reasons why SAP could benefit from the  ‘mass-ready’ launch of Business ByDesign.1.  Complexities of ERP Implementation Will Give SAP an  Edge Over CompetitorsERP implementation is quite complex and we believe this is to SAP’s  advantage.  We believe SAP could leverage its experience handling large  on-premise ERP implementations to be the leader in on-demand ERP  service. In comparison, SAP’s competitors (Salesforce.com, Oracle and  Microsoft) specialize in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software  which is often simpler to implement than ERP software.2.  SaaS Market Expected to Grow Fast According to Gartner,  the worldwide SaaS market could double from $8 billion in 2009 to $16  billion in 2013, representing an annual growth of around 20%. This is a  much faster growth in comparison to the single digit growth expected of  the traditional on-premise market.  An increasing shift toward SaaS  could benefit SAP’s market share.You can modify our forecast above  to see how SAP’s stock will be impacted if its ERP market share were to  stabilize rather than decline as we forecast."

The user interface is more intuitive and easier to configure.Monday SAP unveiled three new ’starter kits’ in Feature Pack 2.5:While the latest offerings clearly illustrate the company’s determination to deliver a solid SaaS solution, the real measure of its success will be its market uptake from a customer and partner perspective.Now that SAP has addressed some of the key technological and application design deficencies of ByD, it must overcome the go-to-market challenges in order to win over new customers and partners to prove it has regained a competitive edge.Disclosure: SAP is a THINKstrategies client."
184736,23045,2010-01-27T06:41:52-05:00,,"by Audrey B.When I first heard the words “Security Outsourcing” together, the first thought that came to my mind is the word oxymoron. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have anything against the enterprise; it’s just that putting the two words together seemed rather contradictory to me. Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because I recently read an article on how Forrester Research (NASDAQ:FORR) speculates that security outsourcing may be the newest trend in outsourcing for 2010, dispelling previous notions that security outsourcing is in decline. To define the term briefly, security outsourcing is the process of hiring an outsourcing company that handles security such as SAP (NYSE:SAP) or data management to maintain data security for your company. And according to Forrester Research, this is the next up and coming trend for outsourcing.With this in mind, Forrester has pointed out that although companies may outsource their security, the accountability for the protection of the data needs to still remain with the company and not the outsourcers. This is essential to inspire constant vigilance on the part of companies availing of outsourcing services.Another thing Forrester points out is that although a company may outsource their security, the data management itself will still remain with the company as well. Thus the responsibility and future hassle in maintaining organization and efficiency will still remain in your corner.These are just some of the points to consider in the greater world of security risk companies, wherein you may face paying fines of up to 500,000 pounds like what may happen in the UK.  Just looking at recent news, there are cyberattacks; case in point is Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in China, and there’s the hacking of financial data like what happened to Citigroup (NYSE:C).Thus, companies who do outsource should be aware that the management of security outsourcing should be a hand-in-hand ploy, a relationship between the company and the outsourcer, in an effort to maintain best practice while saving on cost. Because right now, let's face it, even with all the precautions that are employed, there is still a substantial risk when shipping data from the company to the outsourcer. There is still a substantial risk in handing over the reins of your security to an outsourcing company. And there is no ‘magic wand’ solution to your security and data management. Part of it is determining how your company stands security-wise and understanding that the world has changed and information can no longer be just ‘restricted’. And although we have our own preconceived notions about outsourcing and security, putting the two together would not necessarily mean greater risk if done just right. Author's Disclosure: None"

The news kind of got lost in the blogoblather about management changes. The idea of hooking up with  the 2.0 Adoption Council is to give the beta a large enough in to make it worthwhile.12sprints is a Business-Objects-based decision-making application and environment, which SAP says is:Parsing the phrase to mean business intelligence (BI), or more precisely analytical apps, via SaaS, I think the claim may be true. But I admit I have not researched it thoroughly. Either way, SAP via 12sprints is doing for BI what IBM/Lombardi did for business process management (BPM) a few years ago via Blueprint. That is, it represents moving an inherently on-premise function onto the internet.  I say inherently on-premise because BI is so tied into competitive advantage for the IT user that the enterprise typically wants to keep the resulting data close to the vest.At the least, the 12sprint effort might give a lot of users a taste of Business Objects' functionality that SAP can later turn into real business.  Unlike Lombardi Blueprint, SAP says it will charge for 12sprint after the beta phase turns into general availability.Reading the SAP press release also introduced me to the organization called:Does that mean there is an anti-2.0 movement that I have been missing?The name 2.0 Council implies a message that I think is strong from a marketing point of view, melding the Enterprise 2.0 and Web 2.0 buzzwords.  As users of 12sprint, assuming they actively take up SAP's offer, the 2.0 Council will illustrate whether there is a market for cross-legal-boundaries BI.  Just as BPM makes more sense in cross-legal-boundaries as support for supply chain management, I would guess there is a similar need for BI.  Once that need is determined, SaaS is a great way to go.As an aside, while I have never heard of an anti-2.0 movement, there clearly is an anti-SAP crowd out there and it is sure to dump all over SAP for getting into 2.0 ecosystem after the enterprise software and web worlds have already moved on to 3.0.

SAP co-CEO Bill McDermott said:Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP co-CEO said:Here’s Sybase’s unwired vision:There’s no doubt that mobility is a big market. However, SAP’s big payoff will require some shareholder patience. Indeed, Goldmacher said:The database question. It has been suggested by a few observers that the Sybase acquisition has a heavy component of SAP chairman Hasso Plattner’s urge to stick it to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). For better or worse, SAP is now in the database business. Jefferies analyst Ross MacMillan said he gets the mobility part of the Sybase acquisition. “What we understand less is why SAP would want to own a relational database business with low (but improving) market share,” he said.Snabe said:John Chen, Sybase CEO, acknowledged the database issue and the company’s roughly 3 percent market share in the U.S. He said:SAP said it will continue to support databases from key partners such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM. Oracle, though unnamed in the conference call transcript from Wednesday, is also on the list. It will be interesting to watch how SAP can lever Sybase’s strong verticals in finance with its applications.Laura Lederman, an analyst at William Blair, said:However, Altimeter Group’s Ray Wang estimates that SAP resells $1 billion in Oracle databases a year. Why wouldn’t SAP use Sybase to stop funding a rival? And the final question to be addressed is SAP’s ambitions beyond Sybase. Howlett makes a strong case that SAP will continue to acquire companies and possibly Tibco.

He says Q1 license revenue is likely to be “well below” the current consensus of 500 million Euros; his own estimate is for 440 million. And he adds that the sales pipeline for the rest of the year is weak, as well: “In our view, expected growth in its maintenance revenue is unlikely to offset [a] decline in its license revenue for the year, which will make it difficult to maintain its current margin profile even it makes another small headcount reduction” in the second half.Kim also says SAP is “aggressively pursuing closer partnership and alliances with major technology vendors,” including Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), [[IBM]], Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ).

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also a software company – albeit of the media variety. But these aren’t the only companies worth considering.German software company SAP (NYSE:SAP) is proving to be a global powerhouse yet again. This business-to-business giant designs and distributes software for supply chain management, product and customer relationship management. SAP weathered some tough times to rebound with a second-quarter profit that exceeded expectations. What is behind the success?For one, profit margins are looking up – mainly from cost-cutting efforts. SAP cut 2,800 jobs in the first half of this year. According to CEO Leo Apotheker in a recent interview, “We will continue to be a very disciplined company… In the last few quarters we’ve used this opportunity to become a leaner and more agile company.”This is just the sort of thing you might expect from an old-school German business. Figures back up his claims. SAP improved its full-year outlook for operating profit margin from a range of 24.5% – 25.5% in April to 25.5% – 27%. When the economy roars back this operating leverage will works in their favor, as the lean machine will see profits soar.Others are taking notice. Merrill Lynch recently upgraded SAP shares to buy from neutral, the second upgrade within two days for SAP. That’s a big coup for any company. Oppenheimer analyst Brad Reback added “SAP is in a solid position with a good product lineup and customers who like them. The big question is how much they’ll give back to investors when things turn around.”Another vote of confidence came from research firm IDC. In a recent market analysis, IDC found that SAP has the leading market share and highest share gain of any vendor. The report also highlighted that SAP’s market share is approximately twice as large as its nearest competitor. In addition, growth in 2008 was 17.8 percent – almost double overall market growth.SAP Germany says these figures represent a selling environment that is still tough. Optimism remains high, however. Bill McDermott, executive board member and head of field operations, said SAP expects the sales climate to improve as the year continues. “There is a steadily improving pipeline in all regions of the world, and in all industries, in fact.”The company’s optimism can be seen in recent acquisitions. SAP said it would pay $90.6 million to purchase SAF Simulation, a Swiss software maker. SAP feels that this deal will give them a stronger product base for their customers.Peeking at the chart, SAP has been on a tear since early July. The strong uptrend is firmly in place. We understand the desire to wait for a pullback in this low-volume market. But now could be an opportunity to get in while the rest of Wall Street vacations at the beach.To go with a solid play in the B2B software space, buy SAP."

121744,22182,2009-02-20T08:56:26-05:00,,"Thursday we reported on the shutdown of Coghead, a web-based enterprise software editor that featured an unusually intuitive interface. Friday, we were contacted by the company’s CEO Paul McNamara, who informed us that software giant SAP, which previously had invested in the company, has acquired Coghead’s intellectual property assets. While Coghead will cease operations, much of the company’s team will join SAP (though McNamara will not be joining the company).While SAP had previously invested in the company, its ultimate acquisition of Coghead is sure to raise a few eyebrows. SAP has long been associated with local enterprise software suites that require time-consuming upgrades and IT teams, and has had trouble coping with the pressure to lower its prices to reflect those offered by SaaS services like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) (though SAP offers products that these SaaS solutions don’t).To combat this attrition, the company recently began offering smaller upgrades, allowing customers to pick and choose the features they’d like to upgrade rather than having to spend time on large system overhauls. It has also been making strides to establish services in the cloud, which may explain the logic behind the Coghead acquisition.Update: Some comments below note that the Wall Street Journal article referenced originally contained some inaccuracies, and that SAP may not be introducing the ’smaller updates’. However, the company is indeed expanding its presence in the cloud.Here’s a portion of McNamara’s letter to customers:Original post"

Part of that pushback Nguyen refers to can be seen in the American SAP User Group (ASUG). Dennis Howlett reports that ASUG is firing Steve Strout, the group’s full-time CEO. The problem: ASUG wants someone who will better represent their interests.Translation: SAP’s maintenance price increase hasn’t gone over well and Strout wasn’t pushing back enough.That customer turmoil–along with a weak economy–is likely to bite SAP in the fourth quarter, argues Nguyen. Here’s the meat of his argument:The tough economic environment along with customer resistance to upselling provides interesting bookends to SAP’s talk (partial infomerical) on Friday. SAP’s message–delivered by co-CEO Leo Apotheker (right)–was that companies should invest in IT during a downturn–presumably with SAP–but it’s unclear whether customers are buying it. Underneath the surface Nguyen’s argument appears to be carrying more weight. Remember, large software vendors increasingly have to squeeze more revenue from existing customers. If they push back growth projections can crumble quickly.Nguyen lowered his fourth quarter license revenue forecast to 1.2 billion euro from 1.4 billion euro, down 26 percent in constant currency. Nguyen lowered his total revenue estimate to 3.3 billion euro, down from 3.5 billion euro, and earnings estimate to 0.63 euro a share from 0.69 euro a share. Nguyen’s estimate cut puts him in line with Merrill Lynch’s projections."

Using business intelligence to tie data together across the enterprise.Under the surface, however, are some interesting cross currents. For starters, Schwartz did briefly touch on a theme that fits in with this social networking concept. Schwartz referred to the “process of me.” That term refers to the personalization of enterprise apps and could be powerful when coupled with a little corporate social networking–one of the challenges from SAP’s InnoCentive partnership.Meanwhile, Schwartz said SAP needs to be deliver data into any client–browsers, Lotus and Microsoft Office and any mobile devices. Schwartz said the company is creating a “semantic layer” that will distribute information any way the customer wants it. Schwartz acknowledged that SAP isn’t there today. “These are very big changes,” said Schwartz, who asked developers for feedback on how to deliver SAP to multiple formats.Whether these concepts come together will largely depend on user interface. Folks are used to social networking and they are used to Web interfaces that are much easier on the eye than what you see in the enterprise. Schwartz’s Business Objects demonstration focused on creating reports for those of us that aren’t Excel jockeys, but the visualization features weren’t exactly revolutionary from a UI perspective.But that may be changing.  For instance, one of the more popular sessions on Monday was developing on Adobe Flex and Flash and Rich Internet Applications being connected to business data. In a nutshell, enterprise data may become more attractive to look at (it’s a bit homely today).

The company’s revenue surged 18%, beating Wall Street expectations, causing the stock to close up nearly 10%. Since the results were released, the stock has been trading in the same price band, which is near its seven-month high. The stock closed at $57.86 yesterday, just two dollars short of its 52-week high. Second quarter U.S. GAAP software and software related services revenue was €2.06 billion, a 21% increase over the second quarter of 2007. Total revenue was €2.86 billion, up 18% from €2.4 billion a year ago. SAP reported second quarter net income of €408 million, down from €449 million a year ago. Software sales were up 25% to €898 million from €716 million a year ago.SAP is in an ongoing legal battle with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), its biggest competitor, over TomorrowNow, one of SAP’s subsidiaries. Oracle alleges that SAP was aware of TomorrowNow’s illegal strategies to get Oracle’s confidential information when SAP acquired it in 2005. SAP is disappointed with TomorrowNow’s performance and plans to close it by October.Although net income was down 9% from a year ago, revenue surged and the company predicts it will touch the higher end of its 2008 revenue targets with growth of 24-27% for software and software related services. The company also aims to meet the upper end of its operating margin forecast of an increase to 28.5-29% this year. CEO Henning Kagermann told CNBC he was confident SAP could surpass its target of 100,000 customers by 2010.The company reported its market share was 33.7% for the last rolling four quarters, up 7.7% for the corresponding period in 2007. Operating margins in the quarter were 20.7%, down from 24% in the second quarter last year. SAP reported its second quarter earnings were hit by a €25 million euro expense to settle litigation and onetime costs to integrate the Business Objects acquisition.As I had previously mentioned, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) could be an acquisition target for SAP, thereby giving the German company a chance to gain a foothold in the collaboration market space, which is fast filling up with giants like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). I am surprised that SAP has not outlined a collaboration strategy yet. In the meantime, a number of smaller players have cropped up, some of which may also be acquisition targets.SAP’s excellent results are also due to strength in many emerging markets. Strongest growth was seen in the APJ region, especially China and India, which reported high double-digit growth rates. Software and software-related service revenues in the region grew 40% overall, with Japan showing the most disappointing results from all the regions.In the Americas, Q2 performance was very good. Non-GAAP software and software related service revenues increased 37% at constant currencies, with U.S. revenues increasing 39%. Some of the important contracts in this region were H.J. Heinz (HNZ), Hallmark Cards and Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation (NYSE:SSCC). Latin America also boasted strong results this quarter. In EMEA, non-GAAP software and software-related service revenues increased 27% with Germany increasing 11%. Key contracts here were Brenntag Holding GmbH, Micksi Gas Spa and Dansk Supermarked A/S.

Because of the myopic ideas of those former tech titans, companies like Digital Equipment Corporation and Wang Computers no longer exist.Denial didn’t work out well for them and it won’t work for SAP either.Executives at SAP aren’t alone in their efforts to downplay SaaS. The CEO of Lawson Software made even more atrocious comments a few months ago, as did Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) CRM head at November’s SIIA On-Demand conference.Of course, much of their ridicule is aimed at fending off the competitive threat, which the SaaS/cloud computing movement represents to their core business.AMR Research expects the overall enterprise application market to grown only 3% between 2008 and 2009, and that percentage factors in the 25% growth of the SaaS portion of the market. In fact, AMR believes the SaaS market could grow as much as 40% if the economy continues to struggle, while on-premise apps continue to stagnate.For a myriad of reasons, SAP and other ‘legacy’ application vendors face stiff challenges migrating their software to an on-demand platform and business model. Therefore, it is easier to discount the viability of on-demand solutions.However, given rising customer adoption and strong customer satisfaction, which SaaS is enjoying, the legacy vendors are better served embracing rather than stonewalling the SaaS/cloud computing movement.These companies can move in this direction without significantly disrupting their operations in numerous ways.For instance, SAP can leverage its vast services organization to learn about the realities of deploying SaaS solutions in SAP environments and leverage that knowledge to help its product development team build solid SaaS solutions of their own. The services organization can also build ‘good will’ by helping SAP customers adopt and optimize their SaaS solutions in SAP environments.SAP can also employ the ‘tugboat’ strategy I suggested over a year ago. This strategy encourages SaaS companies to build solutions, which integrate with SAP’s software to enhance its capabilities and satisfy SAP’s customers. Working with SaaS companies can help SAP better understand the technical requirements for building and delivering SaaS solutions, and accelerate the development process.As Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli famously suggests in his famous book, The Prince, it is better to stay close to your enemies than to distance yourself from them.Disclosure: None"

I also suggested in a recent post that platform and cloud computing companies, which don’t offer a combination of solid enabling technologies plus attractive channels to customers won’t survive the shakeout.Sure enough, the rumors about the demise of Coghead have come true, and it is among the early entrants to the platform/cloud computing market who are now making an equally early departure. Coghead may have had terrific technological capabilities, but it lacked a sufficient revenue model to stay afloat in an increasingly competitive market. As a result, investors were unwilling to continue to fund the company and it had to discontinue operations.The primary reason Coghead couldn’t generate sufficient revenue to stay alive was that it didn’t offer enough value to attract adequate customers. It was a classic ‘Catch 22′ situation – not enough customers bought into Coghead’s value proposition and as a result, not enough customers were willing to buy its solutions.However, it didn’t take long for SAP (NYSE:SAP) to capitalize on the situation and acquire Coghead’s assets and a handful of its engineers for a fraction of its paid-in valuation. The asset sale gives SAP much needed insight into the engineering requirements to play in the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and broader cloud computing market.It comes at a time when SAP openly admits that its internal efforts to develop and deliver a viable SaaS solution are being retooled. The acquisition of the Coghead technology and engineering team alone will not rectify SAP’s SaaS struggles. But, if this is the first in a series of acquisitions and alliances, which I referred to as the ‘tugboat strategy’ in 2007, it could begin to give SAP the new perspective and skills the company desperately needs to get its SaaS and cloud computing efforts turned around and back on track.The best indication of whether SAP is serious about its intentions in the SaaS and cloud computing market is if it makes more of these opportunistic acquisitions in the months to come.Disclosure: None"

Its shares had slid 16% earlier in the month when the company reported preliminary results that missed estimates. Third quarter GAAP software and software-related services revenue was €1.99 billion, up 15% y-o-y but down about 3% q-o-q. Total revenue was €2.76 billion, up 14% y-o-y but down 3% q-o-q. Net income was €388 million, down from €408 million last year and quarter. EPS was €0.35, which was flat y-o-y while non-GAAP EPS increased 14% y-o-y to €0.41.Software revenue was €763 million, versus €714 million a year ago and €898 million last quarter. During the quarter, SAP bought back shares worth €104.2 million and in the first nine months of 2008, it invested €486.8 million in share repurchase.SAP reported that its worldwide share of the Core Enterprise Applications market was 33.4%, up 6.5 percentage points over last year. The y-o-y market share increase can be attributed to organic growth and the acquisition of Business Objects, which is the top vendor for BI tools, with 14.2% market share as per IDC.As the credit crisis worsened and recession became a certainty at the end of the third quarter, SAP’s SME revenue was hit hard. As a result, SAP has decided to go for a more controlled rollout of its BusinessByDesign products, its SaaS venture targeting the SME market.In light of the economic uncertainty, SAP has withheld its 2008 revenue forecast and revised its profit margin outlook to 28%. It had earlier forecast an operating margin of 28.5%–29.0%. To achieve the 28% target, SAP needs to achieve at least 20% to 22% growth in software and software-related revenue and watch its expenses. It plans to save €200 million by freezing hiring and minimizing travel expenses. I think, in general, this economic downturn is a great opportunity for all companies to take a close look at gratuitous business travel.After the earnings release on Tuesday, the stock hit a 52-week low of $29.31. It was trading around $58 last month and at the time of writing, was trading around $32. In contrast, SAP’s biggest rival, Oracle, had a good quarter.

The sales outlook was lowered to between $1.5 billion and $1.52 billion, from prior estimates of $1.52 billion to $1.54 billion. Year-over-year sales growth now is estimated at 13 percent to 15 percent.Overall, these numbers don’t seem all that bad. Not bad enough for a 20% drop at least. The stock’s 6.2% intra-day recovery from its low of $9.70 indicates that we might be seeing increased buying on Thursday—probably enough for a 5-15% increase.Which opens the question of who may be next in line for a substantial drop. My money is on a company with products that I have yet to hear a single good word about from its customers.SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) is one of the two biggest makers of business management software. (The other one is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).) SAP’s scheduled to report earnings on July 29. Numbers are expected to be good: Analysts banter about a 12 percent increase in second-quarter operating profit due to strong sales performances in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. An analyst poll shows consensus figures of a 15.9 percent sales increase to 2.806 billion euros in the quarter, with the biggest jump in software and software-related service revenues, expected to be up at 2.017 billion euros, and software revenues rising to 822 million euros.Trading near its YTD high of $55.44 these days, positive expectations for that 12% increase seems to have been fully priced in.Now, SAP’s products are used to integrate and manage things like accounting, manufacturing, and human resources. And it’s in this area where I see SAP encountering some rough waters. Just a week ago, jeans maker Levi Strauss blamed a catastrophic 98 percent drop in second-quarter net income on its new SAP-made ERP system. Levi reportedly was forced to take shipping systems at its three major distribution centers off-line for a full week to fix problems receiving and fulfilling orders.That sounds familiar.It wouldn’t be the first time that SAP software has been blamed for massive corporate problems. Candymaker Hershey (NYSE:HSY), white-goods manufacturer Whirlpool, computer maker Hewlett Packard, and Petsmart Inc. (NASDAQ:PETM) had reason to blame fiscal disaster on SAP in recent years.A recent headline from PCWorld.com read “SAP Migration Caused Paris Legacy Architecture Clash.” Apparently, gay Paree is so far behind on payments that suppliers stopped delivering materials for a $37 million restoration on a 17th-century church. ITL Industries Ltd. in India has also recently reported problems with SAP.And a contact at a large local research institution here in Baltimore linked the recent implementation of new SAP software to “pouring liquid concrete into your business processes.”Software businesses tend to have a good excuse for this kind of thing. Since their product can’t possibly be responsible for any malfunction, blame is typically shifted to legacy systems and existing business processes and culture. The afflicted businesses at that point are really in no position to complain: Once they have committed to switching systems, they have pumped so much time, resources, and money to the implementation that it seems less devastating to change entire processes to service the new software than vice versa.This, and excellent PR work, would explain the absolute lack of impact Levi’s announcement had on SAP’s share price.How long can they keep it up?Hard to say. I do believe there is a good chance for a drop of at least 5-10% a few days after the earnings release on Tuesday. And as the U.S. and global economies slow down and businesses get more reluctant to commit hundreds of millions of dollars in new software expenditure, there is a good chance that we will see the stock price dropping into the mid-$40’s by Q1 2009. Risk-embracing traders should consider some long-term out-of-the-money put options on the stock.Disclosure: none"

Oracle executives, speaking at OpenWorld, were upbeat about prospects. Microsoft, which also has exposure to small and mid-sized companies, will also be closely watched.Co-CEO Leo Apotheker (right) said that the pullback occurred among a broad swath of customers.

of April 2007 which he would have been working on prior to his
departure.Together with the recent release of the SAP 20-F
and management comments to financial analysts after the SAP
financial-results release of April 30, 2008, the Sapphire NetWeaver BPM
announcement also highlights the revenue success the product is having.
By my methodology, NetWeaver revenue is nearing $2 billion on a trailing
12 month basis (SAP says it’s only a billion euro but I believe it uses
a different methodology than I do). Either way, the key
statistic is that SAP says 37% of that revenue is for standalone
NetWeaver instances. That does not mean that the user was never
previously an SAP user (although that is true in some cases). It means
that the middleware is being used for traditional middleware purposes
such as integration, web/application serving, software development,
etc. irrespective of which applications—SAP’s or other suppliers’ or
in-house developed—that the middleware is integrating, serving,
developing, etc. It’s not just tying two SAP application instances
together (some of the other 63% is heritage SAP BI but the total does
not include Business Objects). That makes SAP a major middleware
player, right up there with IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle/BEA (NYSE:ORCL), TIBCO (NASDAQ:TIBX),
Software AG and implicitly Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), from a standing start just a few
years ago.SAP has also quietly put together a community of
350,000 Business Process Experts [BPX)] from among its users,
integrators and other partners. Agassi was one of the early posters on
the BPX when it was launched a few years ago.In other words, by
any measure, SAP is no longer a one-trick pony in the software market.
In my opinion, Agassi is the person that foresaw the need for SAP to
enter that space aggressively and laid out the plan to get there.
Wherever he is today, driving around in one of the “green cars” he’s
building in his new endeavor, he can toot his own horn."
60549,20521,2008-01-17T08:45:44-05:00,,"On Monday, preannouncements from IBM (NYSE:IBM) and SAP AG brought a fresh breath of air to the tech sector. And on Wednesday, there were two major acquisitions in the enterprise software market. It looks like the dealmaking in the enterprise software sector will continue in 2008.   SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) preannounced that it expected fourth quarter revenue of €3.25 billion ($4.83 billion), up 10% y-o-y. Software and software related service revenue for Q4 is expected to be about €2.48 billion, up 13% y-o-y. Full-year 2007 software and software related service revenues are expected to be about €7.44 billion, up 13% y-o-y (17% at constant currencies). It expects its worldwide share of Core Enterprise Applications vendors to be 28.5%, up from 24.5% in 2006. Region-wise, in the Americas, software and software related service revenues for 2007 are expected to be about €2.50 billion, up 9%. In the EMEA region, they are expected to be up by 13% to about €3.98 billion. The Asia Pacific Japan region is expected to see an increase of about 19% to approximately €0.96 billion. For the third quarter, 54% of its workforce was in EMEA (with 34% in Germany), 26% in Americas, and 21% in APJ. That was quite a year for SAP. However, its operating margin is expected to be about 26.5%, down from 27.3% in 2006. This decline is mainly due to its heavy investment on its on-demand business software solution, Business ByDesign which targets the mid-size segment of the SaaS market. Another major event last year was Shai Agassi, heir apparent, leaving the company in March. Read my post in which I said that SAP might lose more top executives of the Silicon Valley bent. It has happened, as most of Shai’s recruits are out. This is a case in point for a May 2007 Wall Street Journal article that hinted at cultural barriers in SAP’s globalization efforts. Another big expense in 2007 was the acquisition of French company Business Objects (NASDAQ: BOBJ) for $6.78 billion. This was a departure from its organic growth and small acquisitions orientation. All eyes are going to be on how SAP is going to integrate this acquisition. Recent reports say that Business Objects will operate as a standalone business under the SAP Group and SAP’s business user organization will go over to BOBJ. This should not make much difference culturally to SAP, as it already has more than 42,750 employees at sales and development locations in more than 50 countries. Overall, SAP is certainly going to play the role of a major acquirer this year alongside Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and presumably Sun Microsystems (JAVA). The question is, will SAP go after the SaaS consolidation that I have been predicting?"
75678,20468,2008-05-05T11:35:25-04:00,,"SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) co-CEO Leo Apotheker says that Business ByDesign, the application giant’s high-profile software-as-a-service product, was delayed because of its total cost of ownership for the company.  That’s a fancy way of saying SAP hasn’t figured out how to make money at its $149 per user per month price point. SAP confirmed that it was delaying Business ByDesign when it reported its first quarter earnings (see transcript). “We’ve announced a price point and now we’re working backwards,” says Apotheker.“What we did discover in the last five or six months is that while we made progress on our TCO model we’re not where we wanted to be (a 10 times TCO reduction),” said Apotheker, in a meeting with a group of Enterprise Irregulars Monday at SAP’s Sapphire conference in Orlando.Apotheker played down the delay, adding that “it’s not like we put this thing in the freezer.” Apotheker didn’t go into too much detail about what was derailing TCO, but did mention that “there’s a lot of engineering involved.” Apotheker says SAP is working through upgrades, hot patching and hosting costs, but isn’t cutting expenses quickly enough to hit its rollout targets.Now SAP can achieve its TCO using “labor arbitrage,” says Apotheker, referring to lower-cost programmers presumably offshore. But Apotheker says SAP “is trying to solve this by technology so we have an optimized TCO model. The next release of NetWeaver should significantly help.”He adds that he was reasonably optimistic that Business ByDesign’s TCO will fall enough to make it a profitable business. “We have a business to run. We have to find a balance between pushing things forward and making our numbers,” says Apotheker. “We’re in a position to say let’s do this right. It doesn’t matter whether it takes six more months. You can never fix the wrong impression on day one.”When asked whether Apotheker was worried that he gave competitors another six months of an advantage, the co-CEO said that “no one will be able to offer an end-to-end comprehensive business suite.”However, Apotheker did note that customers will be able to add select features of Business ByDesign before getting the full suite. Apotheker adds that “cloud computing is a real option in the future. We want to make sure we’re agnostic to all kinds of environment.”Enterprise Irregular jury: Apotheker provided our gang lots of quotes, but didn’t deliver the goods. Business ByDesign economics overshadow what could be larger problems."
60237,21619,2008-01-15T08:48:12-05:00,,"Dennis Byron submits: Scheer Monday announced that it is an “early partner” for SAP’s (NYSE:SAP)
Business ByDesign [BBD] offering to small and medium enterprises [SME]
in North America. If it takes four months to line up an “early
partner,” when can we expect some BBD partner partners?The announcement is in line with SAP’s usual lightning speed when it
comes to its approach to the SME market and is yet another example of
SAP’s keen sense of what it takes to market applications software
through partners. The January 14 press release (see BusinessWire; not
available on either web site as of time of this blog post) begins with
the following:You have got to be kidding me!  I am not sure why any SAP SME channel partner would go to
Scheer for BPM anyway, but I am astonished that the best that SAP can
get out of its oldest and most loyal partner–after two years of talking
about BBD and four months since formally but tentatively announcing
BBD–is a “Memorandum of Understanding” “expressing its willingness” “to
support SAP.” If it weren’t for the fact that Scheer has been a BusinessOne
partner for 10 years, perhaps the best SAP could have done was a letter
of intent instead of a memorandum of understanding.I’ve been out of marketing for 20 years but why on earth would anyone publicize such a half-hearted endorsement?"
51044,21619,2007-10-24T03:50:29-04:00,,"Dennis Byron submits: Except among investment analysts, no news is good news. For
investment analysts, no news brings out the worry beads. So it seems
with SAP (NYSE:SAP). Investment analysts were all over on-target Q3 results
and slightly improved full year guidance from SAP at an October 18
quarterly conference call. They peppered SAP executives with
number-crunching questions, picking apart changes in expectations by
row and column. For example, compare license revenue in the Americas
but back out last year’s $31M reversal? What about Business By Design [BBD] capital expenses vs. milestones announced two years ago? Wasn’t
Germany soft? (yeah, it was summer in the Northern Hemisphere in
Europe). But if full year 2007 is going to be x-metric better than
2006, doesn’t that mean Q4 2007 is going to be softer than Q4 2006? One
analyst wanted SAP to release local costs in local currencies.To be fair, the analysts are nervous about the information
technology [IT] market overall, and SAP is more likely to give out more
useful detail than other IT suppliers. So there is a tendency to ask
SAP questions that if answered help analysts fill in cells in overall
IT market models. But the net-net for SAP at the end of Q3 2007 is threefold. SAP said
it will grow faster in 2007 than in any of the last three years. Key
revenue metrics are growing at the same rate as key competitors
adjusted for currency (SAP gets a negative effect from the Euro
appreciation vs. the dollar whereas U.S. based competitors get an
extra bump). User counts—the metric SAP wants to be measured
by—continues its upward trend.Basically, nothing has changed positive or negative since many of
the same questions were asked and not answered at last week’s TechED,
the announcement about acquiring Business Objects (BOBJ) a couple of
weeks ago, last month’s BBD announcement, and last quarter’s conference
call. So naturally the non-answers haven’t changed either. SAP would
not comment on Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) bid to acquire BEA (BEAS). In fact, it
wouldn’t even comment much about SAP’s bid to acquire Business Objects.Investors do still have to cut through SAP’s possibly misleading
core enterprise applications vendor share claim as well as the
statement that “we would have made more money if we weren’t rolling out
BBD but we’re investing in the future.” The latter statement isn’t very
actionable for investors because presumably every successful company is
investing in the future. As for the former, is NetWeaver growth somehow
included in SAP’s “enterprise applications” calculation? Are Netsuite
and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) considered competitors? Still, the SAP market
share claim is no more egregious than Oracle’s claim about its place in
the middleware market as Oracle defines it. In both cases, the companies do not release the numbers needed to
verify the claims. So ignore them. Do not invest in SAP simply because
you think it is gaining ERP market share; it is not gaining share in
ERP vs. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle. But the rest of the news is that there was no new news."
60203,21394,2008-01-15T06:14:43-05:00,,"SAP (NYSE:SAP) just announced its 4th quarter results and, like IBM (NYSE:IBM), the quarter was strong. SAP is saying that fourth quarter revenue is expected to be about 3.25 billion euros, up 10 percent from the previous quarter in 2006. If we exclude the fact that the euro is stronger than the dollar, SAP’s revenue growth was about 14 percent. Revenue for 2007 was 10.26 billion euros, up 9 percent from 2006.  What makes it interesting is the fact that all these numbers are organic in the sense that SAP did not have big billion dollar acquisitions to boot. SAP recently announced that it will acquire Business Objects (BOBJ), but this acquisition is still to be completed, so we need to wait before seeing what impact Business Objects will make on SAP's topline. SAP also claimed enterprise software market share of 28.5 percent for the last four quarters, up from 24.5 percent from a year ago. That is some growth. Though these numbers are SAP's own claims, I would like to believe these are reasonable claims, as it is organically growing at 10% while the market certainly is not. Hence, it is crystal clear, to me at least, that SAP's market share is growing.But I expect that the stock markets will not be too happy as operating margin for 2007 is expected down by about 1%, thanks to a stronger euro and its SAAS product investment. Revenues in America was up 7%, Europe and Middle East were up 13%, and Asia was up 19%. These are yet again testimony to a strong enterprise applications market and clear leadership of SAP in this segment. Again, clear acceleration from emerging markets. SAP is a truly global company and these numbers are great news for the emerging markets like India and China. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) does not follow the Jan-Dec quarter calendar, so I am eagerly awaiting Oracle's results in a month or so, as good results from them will round off a great year for the enterprise applications market.Disclosure: none"
75306,20521,2008-05-02T05:40:16-04:00,,"On Wednesday, SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) reported results for a disappointing first quarter affected by the weakening dollar, the Business Objects acquisition and heavy investment in its SaaS initiative, BusinessByDesign. It is currently trading around at $50 with a market cap of around $60 billion. It picked up well from its 52-week low of $43 on January 23. Earlier coverage is available here and here.   Revenue grew 14% y-o-y but declined 24% q-o-q to €2.46 billion while net income dropped 22% y-o-y and 68% q-o-q to €242 million, missing consensus estimates of €296 million. Operating income was affected negatively by Business Objects acquisition write-down of €47 million and total acquisition-related charges of €130 million. These charges together with accelerated investments of around €40 million in the Business ByDesign solution brought down the operating margin from 20.2% in Q1 2007 to 14.6%. Its headcount increased to 51,274 from 43,861 in the last quarter with Business Objects accounting for 6,224 employees. Segment-wise, software and software related service revenues were up 15% y-o-y to €1.74 billion. Software revenues increased 11% y-o-y to €622 million. SAP’s worldwide share of Core Enterprise Applications vendors grew to 32.6% compared to 31.9% last quarter and 28.2% last year. Its win-rate over its “largest competitor” was over 80% in the quarter. As for share repurchases, SAP bought back 8 million shares for about €258 million and for the rest of the year, it expects to invest €250 million more in buying back shares. Full-year 2008 Non-GAAP software and software related service revenue, excluding €180 million deferred support revenue write-down from Business Objects acquisition, is expected to grow in the range of 24% – 27% at constant currencies. SAP is now looking at reducing its investment in SAP Business ByDesign to €100 million in 2008 from €175 million to €225 million. It will focus on just six countries (Germany, U.S., France, U.K, China, and India) this year, down from 15 countries earlier. Focusing on these high potential countries would be good enough. In any case, it is never advisable to launch a product in multiple geographies wihout first figuring out what works. It is delaying its roll-out to other countries till 2009. It expects to take a year or more to reach its 2010 target of $1 billion revenue and 10,000 customers. With this reduced investment, it has increased its full year operating margin guidance to 28.5% – 29.0%. SAP is a robust company that has survived many downturns and market cycles, so none of this is any cause for alarm. At some point, if the company so desires, it can also acquire SaaS companies to quicken its growth."

Shares of SAP were down 1.6% to €38.61 in late morning trading in Frankfurt, which one analyst explains is due to unmet expectations of a forecast upgrade.

48795,20358,2007-10-03T04:19:53-04:00,,"Peter Zencke, a member of SAP’s Executive Board and head of R&D, spent the last fours years developing Business ByDesign,  a new foundation for SAP’s ERP software. I caught up with him during SAP TechEd ‘07 and asked about the origins of the product and what will differentiate it in the marketplace.  (See earlier coverage of Zencke’s TechEd ‘07 keynote and more SAP coverage here.)DF: What was the genesis behind Business ByDesign?PZ: “Four years ago, in 2003–exactly 10 years after R3 was
introduced–we decided to go for new architecture, which we called
“Ether” and then later “Enterprise SOA.” The first year we were
figuring out how to do enterprise SOA. We built a prototype but decided
not to productize it. We were just working on some principles during
the first year. Early on we made a decision for a more rigid approach
figure, one that we could not let flow to our ERP product [SAP Business Suite].DF: What is unique about the architecture of Business ByDesign from
other SAP products besides that it is on demand and aimed at companies
with 25 to 100 users of the software.PZ: There are two elements, process integration for services and the
process definition level, with small subcomponents. It is not at the
database level, which is different from the past in mySAP [now called
SAP Business Suite]. The key question is can we have the same
reliability of traditional database integration. What happens if
messages get lost. This is different than traditional database
integration. If we go the non-database route, we can’t do it with mySAP
and change the transaction model. It won’t work for the installed base.
With Business ByDesign we define services for composition on top, and
there isn’t tight integration between front and back end. As a result,
the risk of migration is too high. On the other hand, if we only go
forward by evolution, we miss a lot and we cannot fully exploit
enterprise SOA. [SAP will evolve its existing platforms to gain some of
the features in Business ByDesign by enhancement packages that sit on
top of NetWeaver.]DF: How does Business ByDesign stack up in terms of performance and reliability?PZ: Performance is a factor of four less than what we are used. When
we started it was ten times. If we go for new hardware infrastructure,
with multi-core processors as we do in our hosting, we get pricing
gains. In the last 15 years, we have been optimizing R/3 on an ongoing
basis for the highest volume. Business ByDesign is slower because it is
multi-layered, which can eat up potential performance. First we went
for what is clean and then we looked for shortcuts to speed performance.DF: Was Shai Agassi [former head of products and technology who left SAP in March 2007] involved in developing Business ByDesign?PZ: From day one it was always in my hands. Shai had second tier involvement.DF: How important is the self-service aspect of Business ByDesign for gaining customers and is it operational?PZ: The self service of buyer cycle is fully operational. All
customers in first 20 went through the cycle. We did pre-qualify for
customers, as the business center is not open for anybody. We wanted to
find business in the mid-market, ranging from 25 up to 100 employees.DF: Do you plan to open up the Business ByDesign platform to
developers or to allow them to run their code on your servers as
salesforce.com is doing with Force.com?PZ: Salesforce.com’s model is different. They are not mission
critical. We have to be more risk averse about running code on our
server infrastructure not developed by SAP. With NetWeaver as the
composition environment, which is model driven and works with our code
generator, so much more is in our hands. We have also implemented
built-in services for support. If an incident happens, such as code not
working or messages stuck or a database commit issue, we automatically
track it and the system writes them into the SAP service back end. This
remote control is launched with each installation, whether from us,
hosting partners or on premises, which we don’t yet have. In most
cases, the customer doesn’t know about incidents and it doesn’t affect
any application environment. The same automation happens with the
composition environment in NetWeaver. If outside tools such as .NET or
WebSphere are used, we would be more restrictive. But customers can run
code on their own site that works with our hosted environment. The
“hybrid” model is useful for fast moving composition.DF: There is a lot of discussion around multi-tenant versus
single-tenant approaches to delivering applications. What is the
delivery architecture behind Business ByDesign?PZ: Where we came from there was always one database, then
client/server and multiple servers and front ends. mySAP’s front end
has become quite complex. We asked can we run an end-to-end stack,
application, network, database, messaging and backend integration on
one blade. It was a pretty aggressive goal. We found we could run 25 to
50 concurrent users, and the economics of a blade per tenant are very
good. We never said we would go for 100 tenants on a huge server–that
doesn’t work for us. If salesforce.com has customers with 5 users, then
it makes more sense to have more customers per blade. We start at 25,
and those customers could be 50 users tomorrow, so we have room for
growth and adding more sophisticated business processes. There isn’t
much treasure in going beyond one customer per blade for us.We also have perfect tenant isolation through database techniques.
In normal multitenancy you are using the same database scheme. We have
done that for 30 years on the applications side. Instead, we are using
database technology for tenant isolation. We run our own MaxDB
[an open source, SAP-certified database for OLTP and OLAP usage] and
run virtualization on the database with multiple instances that do full
tenant separation. If a customer decides to migrate from “A” to “B,” we
can do that “in flight.” If customers are sharing table schemes it is
more difficult to move from machine to machine. With MaxDB in our own
hands we are in a better starting position than others.DF: What is the plan for introducing more AJAX into the Business ByDesign user experience?PZ: AJAX comes step-by-step. The NetWeaver collaborative portal is
AJAX based and open for us to use, but it’s not in the design corridor
of mySAP. We have an [AJAX-based] smart client coming soon.DF: You have talked about a model-driven approach for Business ByDesign. What have you done that is unique?PZ: There is a debate whether a pure model driven approach is
working. What we have doe is drawn a very clean line on what is
happening below and above services. On top is everything that a user
sees–the UI, portal, work center. The Java code is generated or
preassembled based on certain building blocks. This is a breakthrough,
understanding user needs, what should be the user interaction and the
user interface is something that developer community hadn’t achieved.
The world below is still traditional coding, done end-to-end on ABAP
objects and reuse of intrinsic services with strict governance. For
each function there is one implementation.We introduced the concept of process components that aren’t based on
database integration. But that’s not to say every object stands on its
own. We aggregate about 10 to 15 objects into one process component so
we end up with roughly 25 of these process components and then strict
governance between independent components. There is only message-based
integration–no database integration. An overall point is that if you
are too granular, you could have performance problems. If you had only
five components, then you end up with the old world of CRM, ERP, SCM.There is one-to-one correspondence between every object on the model
layer and what exists in the implementation. Objects and process
components are active and you can go from model to code. Not everything
is generated from the model, but it is controllable and has more flat,
modular structure.DF: Giving some of the rigidity of the system, how customizable is it?PZ: You would be astonished to see how flexible it is from a
configuration point of view. The number of customization parameters,
which we have in ERP, have been reduced by at least factor 10, in fact
closer to 100. The parameteization of the system is limited for the
sake of complexity. Let’s not inflate the variations, but be powerful
in the combinations of elements so overall it is very powerful.DF: You have said that Business ByDesign is a different kind of
sales proposition. What are you doing to train system integrators and
other channel partners?PZ: The business process models, as important as they are, aren’t
the entry point for system integrators. On top of Business ByDesign is
a new configurator with a question and answer and constraint engine. It
doesn’t touch the process model but influences it. The process model
reacts against the settings. In the beginning we though we could work
with process models, but it was too complex. We are hiding complexity
for the sake of faster adoption.DF: It seems that SAP is a very patient or stubborn company in the way you have slowly introduced on demand services.PZ: We have a prudent way forward, with a brand new product and
architecture. Some people are skeptical–some say we are too early and
others are pushing us to move faster. We want to be responsive to early
customers–it’s not as easy as click, click, click get your
configuration. We are talking about mission critical systems, not a
salesforce.com or Workday.DF: Given the benefits ascribed to Business ByDesign, are customers
outside of the mid-market and standardized on other SAP suites hungry
to get those benefits?PZ: If we were to overload the solution with all functionality of All-in-One
it will kill the beauty of that solution. For SAP this is white space
and the solutions are either outdated or hard to afford. The key
question is can we change the economics of the solutions."

said Wednesday that it is buying YASU Technologies, which makes rules
management systems.SAP said it will embed YASU’s technology into SAP NetWeaver to add
business rules to its software architecture. The general idea behind
YASU is to ensure compliance as you implement new software modules in a
service oriented architecture. In a nutshell, YASU makes sure Web
services follow business process rules. YASU falls into the
business process management category.The company in a statement (Techmeme)
described the YASU pickup as “continuing evidence of SAP’s strategy to
use targeted, fill-in acquisitions to complement its broad solution
offering and successful organic growth strategy.”That’s a long winded way of saying SAP isn’t completely following Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) path despite its recent purchase of Business Objects (BOBJ).The YASU purchase was announced at TechEd ‘07 being held in Munich.

is full of all the great statistical and IR-spin nuggets an analyst

highlight of the year in 2008 is as follows. Sometime in 2007, for the
first time this decade at least, and I suspect in SAP company history,
SAP ended the year with more customers than employees. The document
says:
At the end of 2006, SAP had 38,000 customers and over 40,000 employees.
Hopefully the milestone is a sign that the small/medium enterprise [SME] strategy is beginning to kick in. But with headcount up 12% in
2007, there's a way to go before they really have the SME religion. For
perspective, I point out that back in 2005, with ""only"" 32,000
customers, SAP crossed the 100,000 installation mark. I don't see a
comparable statistic in the document this year but presumably that
number is north of 120,000 these days. The customer count includes ERP,
NetWeaver and Business ByDesign users and I am assuming it doesn't
double count. I'll dig deeper in an upcoming IT Investment Research
report.SAP has a goal of hitting the 100,000 customer mark
sometime in (presumably late) 2010. Do they have one of those big
plywood thermometers set up on the side lawn in Walldorf so that you
can see it from the Autobahn?"

The Business Users, by the way, is an untapped base that SAP really wants to penetrate, to raise its adoption and usage in the enterprise customers. Since my SAP and Enterprise 3.0 post, SAP in September unveiled Business ByDesign, its on-demand business software solution. It has spent €85 million on the solution which is targeted at the mid-size segment of the SaaS market. In the SOA product line, SAP has recently announced the latest version of SAP Discovery System.Other milestones in the quarter have been its $6.78 Billion acquisition of Business Objects (BOBJ), its signing of a Global Enterprise Agreement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and winning a contract from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).For the third quarter, SAP repurchased 6.2 million shares for nearly €250 million. SAP Executive Board canceled 23 million shares from treasury on September 7, 2007. On September 30, 2007, treasury stock stood at 42 million shares. For the next quarter, it expects to spend another €250 million on share repurchases, bringing the total spend to nearly €1 billion. Its stock is currently trading around $53 after hitting a 52-week high of $59.86 on Oct 1. Its market cap is around $65 billion.In stark contrast to Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) strategy, SAP’s does include SaaS and SME markets. SAP also does not have a database business which Oracle does, and often, finds itself in a rather distasteful situation of making Oracle rich by selling their product to its customers. As far as I or anyone else can tell, the only way out of this rut would be for SAP to acquire IBM’s database business, but there really is not much reason for IBM to sell. It’s rather unfortunate that the brilliant Hasso Plattner did not see the vertical integration coming …Way below Oracle or IBM (NYSE:IBM) in market share, however, is a database company that is still independent, and perhaps one that SAP might consider acquiring. I am talking about Sybase (Nasdaq: SY), of course. It’s market cap is only $2.5 Billion, and while it would not offer an immediate market leadership, it is certainly a possibility for SAP to consider, now that they have signaled that large acquisitions are fair game!"
47994,20412,2007-09-24T04:36:22-04:00,,"In the wake of the hype and commentary on SAP's (NYSE:SAP) midmarket product announcement on September 19, 2007, we've begun interviews with SAP's beta customers. Here's what the Fesnak & Associates' partner in charge of the SAP BBD project had to say about their experience so far.
 Background 
Fesnak & Associates is a 50 employee accounting and management consulting firm based in Blue Bell, PA. They are currently ""live"" on two modules – HR and CRM, and have a phased implementation plan to rollout AP/AR, time and attendance, and billing in the months ahead, probably in mid-2008. Given the dramatic seasonality in their business, they are unlikely to be doing anything major with the system during Q1 of 2008 (tax and audit season).
Behind the Hype 
""Live"" is somewhat misleading – they have a single HR user, and a single CRM user. The CRM user is collecting sales leads that are typed into excel, and re-keying them into the BBD system. In time, the CRM functionality will replace their usage of excel, and they anticipate 20-25 users on the system. On the HR side, they have outsourced payroll, and had paper-based HR processes that are being replaced by the SAP system. The financials, time and attendance and billing functionality will displace their current software solutions. 
Why SAP?
 The credibility of SAP was a significant part of their decision to join the beta program. In addition, Fesnak has a growing BPO practice, in which they provide outsourced finance to mid-size growth companies. Their vision is to use BBD as a competitive differentiator, enabling Fesnak to provide BPO services to their clients in a single solution. Currently their clients use software packages from companies like Intuit (Quickbooks), Sage (Peachtree financials), Netsuite, and Microsoft (Solomon). Fesnak has been impressed with SAP's commitment to the project. SAP has been an active listener and responsive to Fesnak's input. It sounds like the SAP implementation team has had a fairly high degree of involvement in the project, which is to be expected for a beta program. Our contact at Fesnak has hands-on experience implementing ERP systems, and has been positively surprised at how much functionality SAP has built into the BBD system, and how relatively easy the system has been to configure and use. Bottom lineBBD is clearly a beta product in its infancy, not yet out of the delivery room, let alone the hospital. 
The good news is that the vital signs appear to be normal. SAP claims 20 beta customers (companies). 
We would be pleasantly surprised if the system has more than 100 users in total at this point in time. The next milestone will be when a customer puts confidence and a real workload (50 plus users, multiple modules, and unplugs its old systems) on the system – likely in late Q4 or Q1 next year."
47714,21619,2007-09-20T03:36:43-04:00,,"Dennis Byron submits: Sorry, SAP (NYSE:SAP), I am a great admirer but Business ByDesign (codenamed A1S) has a few problems. The name is too long, the beta set of users is too small, the price is too high, the reference implementations and demos are too much old SAP, and the channel strategy is too 20th century. 
The name issue is no big deal; let’s just call it BBD. The others will require a lot of work to overcome because BBD is the linchpin of SAP’s objective of 100,000 users by the end of CY 2010. SAP doesn’t consider BBD to be in “volume availability” until 2008 so there are a few months left to work out the kinks. SAP says the small/medium enterprise [SME] BBD solution is already helping “an inaugural group of 20 live customers” in the United States and Germany. I’ll have to dig out some old notes but I think SAP had more beta users when it brought Pandesic to the same market with the same delivery-model/channel strategy10 years ago. Given SAP’s estimate of 1.5 million prospects in the 100-500 employee market band (60,000 in the U.S. and Germany alone), 2000—not 20—is the reference threshold it needs to shoot for. SAP BBD is available today for selected early customers in the United States and Germany, with the “opportunity now opening for early customers in China, France and the United Kingdom.” 
Hopefully there is multiple-thousand-client business in that pipeline given the test marketing that has been ongoing this year. During 2008, BBD is planned for expansion to countries such as Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Nordic region, South Africa and Spain.There is good news in the fact that the solution was built from the ground up on SAP NetWeaver. Its host in the Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery model will reportedly use SAP’s own MaxDB open source software database and Unix. But do companies with 100-500 employees even have someone that can use SAP BBD Business Designer?  The indirect channel is of course key to the SME market and the eventual success or failure of BBD. That is not the same as saying it will be sold indirectly (such as via telemarketing). SAP needs to and says it will “rely significantly on its partner ecosystem strategy” to drive the SAP BBD offering. The only ecosystem member announced or on SAP’s website as of noon ET 9/19 is ADP. Some of its All-in-One-brand partners were shown on videotape at the press event but that makes channel overlap (SAP used the word “cannibalization” in the Q and A session) a real concern.And most important, a minimum $4000-5000 per month price tag just does not feel “affordable and easy to adopt.” I am not even sure per-user pricing is even the way to go but I need to do a little more research on that issue. I am guessing SAP’s current SME installed base might be part of the pricing equation. SAP has a lot of customers in the 100-500 employee market band, especially outside of the U.S.  That base could be used to build the BBD reference base quickly. But what would extensive customer migration from All in One to BBD do to the revenue flow from those current customers?As Research 2.0 has discussed in its annual review of SAP, SAP BBD complements the existing Business One, Business All-in-One and SAP Business Suite (nee R/3) solutions. Business One is designed for the small business segment, while SAP Business All-in-One is built “specifically for midsize companies that need deep industry-specific functionality,” what SAP calls microverticals (of which it has hundreds).The offering puts SAP right up against offerings from its long-time partner Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as well as Inuit (NASDAQ:INTU), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and many others. It will not be just a matter of competing for customers, as SAP is used to. SAP will have to get its BBD ecosystem from Microsoft, Intuit, Lawson (NASDAQ:LWSN), Infor, and so forth as well."
48112,20412,2007-09-25T04:46:06-04:00,,"On September 19, 2007, SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) unveiled Business ByDesign (""BBD""), its long-awaited ""on-demand"", software-as-a-service (""SaaS""), entry in the enterprise application market. The initial description of BBD sets it apart from most other competing offerings - both proprietary and open-source, and our initial reference checks confirm this (See ""SAP's BBD Beta Customers Speak Out""). When completed and delivered, BBD aims to dominate the applications software market for small and medium sized enterprises and lets business people operate and manage the product rather than rely on IT organizations. Positioned as a product for midsize companies with 100-500 employees, Business ByDesign (formerly referred to as A1S) is much more than that. It is clearly the next-generation, ""bet-the-company"" product for SAP. SAP stated ambitious goals for BBD: $1 billion+ in revenues and 10,000 new users by 2010. In our view, SAP will likely fall short of its aggressive targets. The company does not yet have a dedicated re-seller channel for BBD and building up a network of re-sellers, data centers and services specialists will take at least 24-36 months. BBD is also a highly proprietary product that is in Beta test and pays limited lip service to the ""open source"" hot button of many IT users. However, BBD is arguably the biggest announcement in enterprise applications of this decade. It has major implications for the entire industry and for SAP customers and investors. BBD represents a polar philosophical opposite to SAP's key competitor -Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), world view of business applications, - a view centered on economic consolidation rather than SAP's drive for technological breakthrough. The BBD announcement signals a new playing field for large application software providers - an environment that is akin to car and computer hardware companies that can be defined by the technological race for engineering superiority. The new BBD product has both a new framework and a new and complete set of enterprise applications that are scalable, connectable and in fact in a page taken from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategy, subsumes many of the functions previously provided by separately sold third-party products. It remains to be seen if the mid-market and small business customers will see the SAP's value proposition in the same positive light. SAP is betting the company future on BBD and moves the minimum standards and goal posts of business software applications to a new level for the entire software industry. SAP is the first large incumbent software vendor to announce such a broad set of business application functionality available on-demand. BBD aims to give business users actionable information, rather than a transaction processing system. The last time SAP announced such a transformative product was the launch of R/3 – which is by far the most successful ERP product in history. SAP's intent with BBD is to deliver a broad array of enterprise-wide functionality (financials, manufacturing, supplier relationship management, CRM, BI, project management, etc.), at a price that compels the users to change the status quo. In another analogy to Microsoft, this is what Microsoft Office did to the stand-alone desktop productivity applications – over time customers will question the need to spend incremental dollars with a wide-array of software providers (BI tools, report writers, process modeling tools, et al) when they can get it all from SAP. Market Impact While BBD will generate lots of industry buzz, it is unlikely to freeze the market in 2007, and even into the first half of 2008.  Infor, Microsoft, Netsuite, Epicor, IFS, and QAD, among others will be impacted by SAP's BBD. Upstart open source ERP and CRM solutions like Compiere and SugarCRM will be forced to compete on more than ""low TCO enabled by open source"". The competition is now on notice, and will have to respond by the first half of 2008 or risk being left in the dust. Application software vendors lacking stand-out vertical industry capability (e.g., QAD in Tier 2/3 automotive) or departmental/business process expertise (e.g., Salesforce in sales automation) will be gasping for air as SAP sucks the oxygen (and money) out of their markets. SAP's potential to succeed is undeniable. 1) SAP is one of the few software companies to be successful in more than one era of computing. There are few, if any, technology companies who have successfully transitioned from one era to the next. SAP was strong in mainframe business applications (R/2), and globally dominant in client/server business applications (R/3). The same team that made R/2 and R/3 a global success (notably Peter Zencke and Gerhard Oswald) led the BBD team. Combined with SAP's already considerable investment and the fact that this is the first time the company has made such a singularly bold announcement since R/3, it is clear that project Business ByDesign (""BBD"") is the true progeny of R/2 and R/3. 2) SAP has the patience and resources to invest for the long-haul. 200-400 million euros is a substantial commitment, and SAP has proven to be much more patient than its competition. Only Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM (NYSE:IBM) could match the financial commitment of SAP – and none has shown the intent to take such an approach. 3) SAP is making a very deliberate strategic choice. They have decided not to go the M&A consolidation route, have not pursued growth in services (although it would be a path of least resistance), and they are not going into horizontal technology (and have historically stayed away from it). 4) SAP brand equity is strong, it has global reach, and deep expertise in business processes. SAP knows business processes better than any other major software company (although Oracle is closing that gap). SAP is leveraging its strong reputation to enter a market that historically has been filled with opportunistic, unsophisticated software vendors. The company has spent millions on an ad campaign during the past ten months, raising awareness for its SMB efforts. 5) SAP's competition can be divided into two segments – the SMB incumbents, and the traditional applications software market opponents led by Oracle. The incumbents with on-demand solutions are an easy target for SAP. It is full of under-capitalized, software companies that struggle to articulate their ROI proposition. A number of the mid to large size players in the SMB apps market, e.g., Infor and Sage Group, are an amalgamation of un-connectable legacy products more focused on maintaining a reliable stream of maintenance revenues than delivering break-through innovation. On the other hand, SAP's success is not guaranteed. 1) The SMB market is fundamentally different than SAP's core business. SMB customers are a) very price sensitive; b) have few, if any, tech resources; c) are not tech savvy. This is the exact opposite of SAP's traditional sweetspot – large sophisticated enterprise customers with competent, well-staffed IT organizations. The corporate genetics of SAP are counter to what makes a successful SMB software vendor. 2) Business ByDesign is just the latest in a long string of mostly unmemorable SMB initiatives by SAP, further convoluting SAP's already complex product line up. SAP has done a decent job positioning its offerings in an attempt to avoid overlap and cannibalization. However, the current SAP product line-up will need to be rationalized -- e.g., should a midsize customer buy SAP Business One, SAP Business All-in-One, or Business ByDesign? BBD is receiving the lion share of investment funds and resources – Business One and All-in-One customers will need to take that into consideration before making additional commitments to those products.
Furthermore, many large SAP customers also have small and midsize operations not currently using SAP products. If they chose to adopt Business ByDesign, how will those implementations integrate into their large, complex, global SAP system? 3) BBD is neither cheap nor easy. At $125/user for a minimum of 25 users, that works out to $135,000 for three years. Most organizations will need to license 50+ users. Even at $135,000 many SMB's will find they can purchase applications that are ""good enough"" at the same or lower cost (even when you include hardware, implementation, etc. With impressively complex plumbing lurking just below the surface of BBD, it's reminiscent of early R/3 days when a German dictionary and ABAP programming skills were highly recommended for the early adopters installing the product. 4) Enterprise applications are not trivial (as SAP well knows), and the launch event was short on pragmatic details. For example, how will customers migrate their data? Who will do the business process consulting? Are customers forced into the SAP reference models for industries and business functions? It's relatively easy to offer a single business capability/process on-demand (e.g., sales lead management/customer tracking, HR application management, web conferencing). Configuring an enterprise-wide system, loaded with clean data is a much bigger challenge – even for a relatively small company. 5) To quell the doubters, SAP will undoubtedly refer to its history and its engineering prowess. Its current market-dominating product, ERP 6.0 (nee R/3), they will insist, was originally intended to be the ""little brother"" to R/2. It has matured into the most scalable packaged application in the market. SAP has thousands of Mittelstand (German mid-market) customers today, further proof that the company understands the SMB market. And SAP will quietly remind its critics that there was no migration path from R/2 to R/3. R/2 customers had to purchase the system anew and undergo an often lengthy and complex implementation of R/3. In spite of these drawbacks, SAP rocketed to the top of one of the largest, fastest-growing segments of the IT industry during the 1990s. Yet, these are different times today and there ar"

SAP is the first among large software makers, which have traditionally focused on desktop-based applications, to offer web-based software services of this magnitude.  SAP CEO Henning Kagermann commented, ""We're not just launching a new product. We're creating a new business model and a new market."" SAP plans to offer customers free trials in order to keep sales and marketing costs down.

35318,20468,2007-05-14T07:11:50-04:00,,"A little more than a year ago I was discussing a story I wrote with SAP (NYSE:SAP) executives. They were peeved that I referred to SAP as a German company while failing to note the headquarters of a rival I mentioned. 
That sticking point–which was an oversight–stuck with me. It seemed to me that SAP was a bit too touchy about being known as a German software maker. The big question: Why?
Now that item is clearer to me thanks to a Wall Street Journal story (subscription required) Friday. The gist of the story was that SAP's plan to globalize out from its Walldorf, Germany headquarters has had its troubles. 
To be sure globalization is never easy due to cultural barriers and worker fear. But the WSJ story also hints at how the recently departed Shai Agassi was often in the middle of a tug of war between American, Indian and German developers. 
SAP adopted English for meetings even at its German headquarters. Veteran German developers chafed at the move and worried about quality. American developers, based in Palo Alto, Calif., worried SAP wasn't moving fast enough. These cultural issues were compounded because product development was spread around the globe and run by Agassi, who seemed aloof to his German workers. 
As a result, traditional SAP programs clashed with Agassi's baby, NetWeaver. The Journal story also details how clashes even spilled out to the newspapers in German. Last year, SAP hosted a town-hall meeting over the ""Americanization of SAP.""
Whether these issues are globalization growing pains or something more serious remains to be seen. SAP's top brass–Henning Kagermann and Hasso Plattner and now  Leo Apotheker–remain committed to globalization. After all, they have no choice. 
But now that Agassi is gone the messaging becomes more difficult. The Journal noted that Kagermann and Plattner are now trying to convince U.S. developers that the company won't become Walldorf-centric again. How convincing that message is will be critical since SAP will need all the developers it can get to combat Internet-based software models and build next-generation SAP apps."
42671,21620,2007-07-27T08:04:57-04:00,,"Not everyone knows SAP (NYSE:SAP) like they think they do. Our senior analyst, Dennis Byron, released a 14-page report to our clients earlier this week that delves into some of the details behind the SAP evolution in functionality and architecture, the market, and the competitive environment. SAP is a larger player in middleware and tools than most realize and can sit at the same table with IBM (NYSE:IBM), BEA (BEAS), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Here is the full summary: SAP is focusing on growth in mid-market and smaller companies by grappling with the related industry trends of both architecting its next generation service oriented architecture [SOA] and deploying the resulting software as a service (SaaS). The complexity of that two-pronged task makes 2007 a building year in Waldorf. SAP has emphasized publicly that it will not reach “volume readiness” in SaaS (and implicitly SOA) until 2008. There appears to be little if any optimism built in to the current share price regarding SAP’s ability to leverage these recent industry trends. SAP stock has dramatically underperformed both Oracle and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) by a wide margin over the past few years. We want to be clear however that SAP’s dominance of large enterprises is quite secure and profitable owing in major part to its comprehensive industry-centric application functionality. Our analysis suggests that the strategy SAP has for long-term growth is credible but that it will take some time to be reflected in operating results. The current company valuation appears to underestimate the value of the SAP franchise, its dominant market share in applications, and its current strong financial position. Our long-term valuation methodology suggests a share price of $52 if the company can be moderately successful in executing its plans. SAP 1-yr chart:"
45579,20358,2007-08-24T06:17:17-04:00,,"I met with Denis Browne, senior vice president of  imagineering at SAP (NYSE:SAP) Labs. He isn’t on loan from Disney (NYSE:DIS), which came up with “imagineering” portmanteau in the 1950’s. Browne is tasked with imagining, developing and evangelizing Web 2.0 innovations–social networks, widgets, RSS, blogs, wikis, SMS, virtual worlds, etc.–across various SAP’s various product divisions and 39,300 employees in 50 countries.
However, SAP takes a very conservative approach to commercializing and mainstreaming the imagineering from Browne’s group.
 Widgets and social networking aren’t exactly  revolutionary at this point, but Browne is cautious about introducing these tools to employees and customers, “We have to be careful how we introduce new technology. We don’t want to create a headache for IT organizations.” Headache meaning it’s not managed, secure and compliance. Yet, widgets are social networks flooding through the back doors of enterprises.
Browne’s time horizon for introducing new technologies is 18 to 24 months, which is a snail’s pace compared to companies addressing consumer audiences.
Browne’s group has made progress in developing Harmony, a social network behind the firewall. “The $64 million question is will social networks work in the enterprise and what is the secret sauce,” Browne said regarding social networks. Harmony was first introduced on April 10 to SAP Labs users in North America. So far, 1,000 of the 1,700 SAP Labs employees have signed up for Harmony and 10 to 13 percent use it every day.

“We need to weave it into the fabric of all mission critical applications in the enterprise, so it's relevant and available when they need,” Browne said. He gave an example of integrating social networks with SAP’s CRM and HR applications, allowing employees to have more control over what information is propagated about themselves in the organization. Harmony, for instance, can surface more color about the person and their expertise, creating an interaction between Harmony and the HR system, with end user and company created content.
So far, Harmony usage is more social than professional. Members have created 136 groups, such as photography and yoga. The groups formed on Harmony led to the establishment of a quiet room for yoga and ping pong tables. “[Without Harmony] the company wouldn’t have known about those needs,” Browne said. “Now we are buying ping pong table for the Palo Alto campus.”
Ping pong tables is modest evidence of some utility for enterprise social networks, but it won’t sell  any CEOs on the concept and neither is Browne. “We have a small team and we are in the imagineering phase. [Harmony] may never turn into a product. We are actively trying to roll it out globally to employees, but there are cultural, language, security and legal issues, such as does the company own data employees contribute.
Larry Dignan posted about his conversation with executives from Trampoline Systems, one of the companies that is commercializing social networking for enterprises while SAP imagineers. They agreed with Browne that culture, security, manageability, integration with group policies and privacy are challenges.
In addition, explaining social networking remains a hurdle to adoption. “From where I sit probably the hardest part is that there isn’t vocabulary to describe it really. Social networking for the enterprise makes most people in the enterprise cringe, but we also have to explain it more clearly than enterprise 2.0,” said Peter Biddle, vice president of development at Trampoline.
On the other hand, social networks offer a far better way to leverage resources within a company, such as finding people who have expertise in a particular area.  It’s also a way to bridge the generation gap, giving those entering the workplace a familiar tool and interface and the older generation a way to connect and share knowledge.
SAP’s widget platform is for delivering data on desktops, mobile devices and in browsers.  Browne described SAP’s widget effort “iTunes for the enterprise.” The company plans to create a gallery of widgets interfaces and already has delivered an Eclipse plug-in for developing widgets to the SAP Developer Network.
Currently, SAP is testing widgets internally, but has no plans to roll them out to customers any time soon. “It takes a long time to navigate through SAP and determine if it’s a viable business for us to enter. We need to ensure that customers want it and understand the impact the environment, such as support, could have on us,” Browne said. “It doesn’t fit the norm in the way SAP has done business. The approach of an entire collection of componentry and elements is new to SAP as well as how we are going to market with it.”
He went on to explain that SAP cannot “disrupt the core” of 40,000 customers where SAP is deeply embedded with next generation applications and technologies. “No company could do it in a swift manner. It would be dangerous for the user base.”
It’s understandable that SAP should be cautious in introducing new technologies, especially concepts like social networking that are early in their maturation phase and difficult to explain to executive management, unless they are under 30 years old. Yet, I can’t help but think that SAP has its head partially in the sand. It certainly has the resources to be at the forefront of  the next generation of applications, just not the mindset. It makes you wonder how revolutionary SAP’s A1S product can be given the conservatism of the company."
33082,20171,2007-04-22T12:30:08-04:00,,"We have been complaining lately about U.S. companies reporting sales gains that were fairly weak even with the benefit of favorable currency movements.

33268,20358,2007-04-24T05:23:46-04:00,,"SAP's (NYSE:SAP) been working three years on developing a new business application suite and business model. Code-named A1S, the suite is aimed at the lower end of the mid-sized company segment, which is comprised of about 1 million companies. 
It's part of SAP's goal to grow from 39,000 customers to 100,000 by 2010, according to Hans-Peter Klaey (pictured below), president of Global SME for SAP. For context, he sized the large enterprise market at 20,000, upper mid-size at 60,000, and small business at 55 million. 
""We are adding 6,000 customers per year, so every 55 minutes we have a new customer, Klaey said. ""We need to accelerate that by three to four times to come to number.""
At this point, SAP is still being coy about precisely what A1S is going to be when it grows up. It's based on enterprise service architecture and will be first delivered as an on-demand service, Klaey said during an interview. Given A1S's heritage, it will have a strong underlying SOA foundation. Customers don't care about the engine, just whether is works in a way that fits their business and workflow. It's success will be closely tied to usability, configurability and pricing. A1S will have its share of Web 2.0 features and mashup capabilities.  
 
SAP has been showing the product to beta customers since March, Klaey said, with over 150 firms checking it out.  
Klaey explained the positioning and go-to-market strategy for the suite. SAP is investing $300 to $400 million in bring the suite to market, mostly on service, support and marketing, Klaey said. He said SAP is working in three different areas to make the 100,000 customer number–the product portfolio; service, support and consumption (product distribution); and go-to-market strategy. 
Besides the phantom A1S, SAP's SME product portfolio includes All-in-One (A1), aimed at the upper mid-market, with a deep industry and micro-vertical focus, and Business One (B1), which is aimed at the pool of 55 million small businesses.  
Service and support for A1S cannot be a high cost to customers, and the on demand consumption model will allow customers to pay for only what components they use, on a subscription basis, Klaey said. 
Klaey compared A1S to an off-the-rack suit, which allows for some customization, but not comparable A1, which is more like a hand-tailored suit that can be composed out of many kinds of fabrics and styles.
However, A1S won't be generic, Klaey said, and will have some industry flavors, but limited to manufacturing, service and trade businesses at the beginning. With an on demand model, the suite can more readily incorporate new functionality and get customers up and running. He also allowed that A1S will be more than a suite, but also a platform with exposed Web services that supports mashups and an ecosystem of add-ons, similar to salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) AppExchange.   
The go-to-market strategy is new for SAP, using the Web, telemarketing, indirect partners, its own sales force and indirect sales forces to sell. ""You do not go from a sales-push model, you need a buy-pull model. It can only be Web-based, and you have to make sure you get on short list of this type of company,"" Klaey said. As part of the new marketing strategy, SAP will offer A1s on a try-before-you-buy basis. 
Speaking at Sapphire, SAP Chairman and Chief Software Advisor Hasso Plattner envisioned software that customers play with before they sign a contract, and once there is a real project, the customer comes up with a snapshot of forms, reports, workflow and user interface changes that tailor the application to business needs without high cost or days of development time.
""We believe nobody else in the market has this,"" Klaey claimed. ""We are not jumping into a traditional product launch. We are using this year to validate each step–usability, service and support and go-to-market. In 2008 we are volume ready. If we open up and make it available for masses, we won't have a big issue with lead generation if we get the steps right and it works together,"" Klaey said."

SAP and partners, including Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) as well as ISVs and systems integrators, will work on joint projects and utilize a simulated, heterogeneous data center with hardware and software from participating vendors. The Co-Innovation Lab houses 1,600 SAP employees, including 1,000 engineers.
It’s not exactly a keiretsu, but a compatible federation of companies that have a shared interest in building next-generation solutions, not just products, that integrate with SAP’s ERP and NetWeaver platform.
“There is a constant demand from ISV partners to sit down with our developers and engage and imagine the future. We should not forget the human collaboration necessary to make innovation happen,” Yusef said. For SAP, the Lab provides a showcase for its SOA-based platform and allows ISVs to test and demonstrate its products in a real world environment, and also highlight partner products.

“We want to bring partners in and show them that it is not ‘marketechure,’ ” said SAP CEO Henning Kagermann. “Here, we can show much more variety. Before customers make a choice, they can see a variety of options, more than what they get from a reference site.”
Kagermann also talked about proving to customers, via co-innovation, that there is no customer lock-in. “We are giving customers the freedom to choose,” he said. “If others do it we appreciate it if they are successful. We are willing to compete on the best product.”
SAP is being more open and global as a culture than in past decades, but the company fundamentally hopes to hook customers on its SOA platform. While it’s not a formal lock in, once you make such a huge investment in a complex stack, feeling completely free is elusive.
A1S 
During a Q&A after the announcement, SAP executives discussed the latest state of the new A1S on demand slated to ship next year. The company expects to reveal the real name of the product in the next few months, said Leo Apotheker, deputy CEO of SAP.
“The fact that we have announced A1s has had a positive effect. It shows that we are committed to the mid-market, and we have made it very clear with the first test customers. It addresses a totally untapped part of the market, so it is all net additional business,” Apotheker said regarding whether A1S would cannibalize existing business.

When asked about comparison to salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Kagermann said, “You cannot compare salesforce.com with A1S. It’s just providing a piece of CRM.” He said that A1S, which could be currently classified as vaporware, is more complete, covering manufacturing, supply chain management, financials and other functions.  “A1S is dedicated for the mid-market. We have to do it on demand to significantly lower TCO. It’s not only a new product, but also a way go to market…you can only start with a radical approach and greenfield. You can’t do that approach for HP,” Kagermann said.
“We want to prove that we can run an entire business in an on-demand mode. No one has proven it so far. You have to select the right segment, and we felt the lower mid-market is the right segment. This fits better for business reasons–it’s a $15 billion untapped market for SAP,” Kagermann said. NetSuite has developed an on demand product that has more breadth than salesforce.com, covering ERP, CRM and ecommerc, and addresses the small and lower mid-market customers, but wasn’t mentioned by the SAP team.
He reiterated his position that software-as-a-service is not the ultimate answer. “The answer is choice for the customer. You need a hybrid model so the customer has choice,” he said. For on demand, SAP advocates isolated tenancy for customers who are concerned about sensitive data as well as multitenancy, where customers share server infrastructure. Using blade servers, SAP believes that it can deliver TCO similar to that of  multitenant architectures via isolated tenancy.
 Web 3.0
During his remarks, Kagermann discussed his notion of Web 3.0. “Web 2.0 is coming up in value. We want to take Web 2.0 to 3.0.” It’s a version of the semantic Web theme, but focused on business software. “If you look to the services that we are defining with our enterprise SOA and things a bit beyond, we know that these type of enterprise services over time, in collaboration with many customers, associations and partners, are a kind of standard that can form the Internet of business services,” Kagermann said. “We don’t have the semantics today that go beyond Web 2.0 and will allow software to to speak to each other.”
I asked Vishal Sikka, CTO of SAP, for further detail about what Kagermann meant in his definition of Web 3.0.
“Thousands of services have emerged from our code base, and we have a good handle on what they mean. It gives us an opportunity to solve the problem of linking up interactions more automatically via semantics,” he said. “We are working with groups at Stanford and in Germany. The next step of intra-company an inter-company integration is making service semantics more visible. I’m not implying automated integration any time soon, but we are seeing steps forward.
He also viewed Web 2.0 technologies, such as tagging, as another way to to build semantic knowledge from the ground up. Ultimately, standards for business service semantics,like RosettaNet, will be need to evolve.

39690,20521,2007-06-29T02:28:14-04:00,,"Over numerous articles in the past, I have talked about some emerging players, which are redefining the enterprise software landscape. These players are working on cutting-edge applications, which bring vital, but non-core entities like vendors, suppliers, and even customers within the folds of the enterprise. And these applications are being delivered on-demand without the baggage of legacy systems or lengthy and cumbersome implementation phases.
Any evaluation of key players in the Extended Enterprise and on-demand trends will be incomplete without analyzing the leaders in enterprise applications—SAP and Oracle. In this piece, we look at the former.  
SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) is the world’s largest business software provider and the third-largest independent software vendor. Incorporated in 1972, SAP today has a market capitalization in excess of $60 billion and a footprint in 120 countries.
Though some of the largest companies in the world use SAP applications, the company’s solutions also cater to smaller and niche segments. The company has more than 25 industry specific solutions, which incorporate its customized SAP Business Suite applications. The SAP Business Suite are developed on the SAP NetWeaver platform, and includes applications like SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), SAP CRM (Customer Relationship Management), and SAP SRM (Supplier Relationship Management), SAP SCM (Supply Chain Management), and SAP PLM (Product Life-cycle Management). For the mid-sized companies segment, SAP offers its All-in-One solutions. SAP Business One is specifically aimed at the small business segment. SAP also provides on demand options for its CRM and SRM applications.
In 2006, SAP’s total revenue grew by 10% to €9.4 billion from €8.5 billion in 2005. The total revenue growth, though impressive for a company with SAP’s size, was less than the 15% mark that the company had projected. Therefore, while net income rose by a staggering 27% to €2.0 billion from €1.6 billion and adjusted EPS were €1.61 compared to €1.25 in 2005, the company’s shares did not do that well. Oracle’s acquisition spree, which placed it in direct competition with SAP in the business applications software market, also contributed to SAP’s ordinary performance in the share market.
SAP has announced new initiatives acknowledging the changes in the business applications marketplace. The company is investing heavily in its enterprise service-oriented architecture [SOA], which it feels will define the technical standards to help integrate various enterprise software applications currently in use. For the mid-sized and small business segments, SAP is also developing “A1S”, a code name for an on-demand enterprise solution. The company is also planning to use a “try-run-adopt” model where small business could customize A1S and use it before actually purchasing the solution from SAP.
The very fact that SAP is seriously considering these alternatives gives credence to the fact that on-demand and Extended Enterprise trends have truly arrived. In the upcoming months, we’re likely to see more SaaS /SOA / On-Demand announcements from the SAP camp. However, what I don’t expect to see, is too many acquisitions in the space. I did suggest Citrix as one exception,  but players like Rightnow, Omniture, Taleo, Concur, etc. are more likely to find their exits in the arms of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), or in a category consolidation roll-up, rather than SAP. SAP’s Enterprise 3.0 journey is likely to continue to be an organic process, as it has been through its long and steady history."
41593,20954,2007-07-19T06:42:40-04:00,,"SAP said Thursday that second-quarter software license sales rose a better-than-expected 18% to €715 million amid double-digit growth in all its regions. Operating profit also bested forecasts, rising 10% to €577 million, despite a weak U.S. dollar versus the euro, in part because the company held back spending on new software development. The world's largest maker of business software posted a currency-adjusted 19% rise in software and software-related service revenues to €1.71 billion, in line with expectations. Analysts had expected SAP to report license sales of €674 million, software and software-related service revenues of €1.658 billion, and operating profit of €556 million. Net income was €449 million, or €0.37/share, up from 8% in 2006. Fund manager Michael Vieker told Bloomberg, ""Expectations had been very low, so it was rather easy to surprise on the upside."" The company reiterated its outlook for full-year 2007 software and service revenues growth of 12-14%, compared to 2006 growth of 12%. Full-year operating margin is expected to be 26-27%, compared to 2006's 27.3%. ""Europe was very good for them, but they're not raising guidance,"" WestLB AG analyst Jonathan Crozier told Bloomberg. ""The message of one good quarter and not raising guidance is clear: you can't expect every quarter to outperform just because one does."" The company made no mention of a charge, anticipated by some analysts, to cover the costs for ongoing litigation with Oracle. SAP acknowledged earlier this month that its Texas-based customer-support unit had made ""some inappropriate downloads"" from Oracle's Web site, prompting investigations from the U.S. Department of Justice.

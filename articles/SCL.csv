Moreover, this dynamic will likely persist.Moreover, the economy will recover over time, and this will continue helping SCL's Polymer segment.Together, these two trends will probably boost SCL's financials for years to come.Unfortunately, my valuation model suggests that the shares have already priced in all of these positives.Thus, I recommend holding the shares for now and buying them if SCL dips by 20%.","Stepan Company (SCL) is one of those rare companies that benefited from the coronavirus pandemic. Since it's a chemical company at its core, it was perfectly positioned to reap the benefits of increased demand for cleaning products. In my view, such a demand increase will persist for the foreseeable future, as I think cleaning standards all around the world will remain high. After all, the coronavirus pandemic has been, in many ways, a traumatic experience for the whole world, and its memory will stay with us for years (if not decades) to come. However, as investors, we can't forget about the company's fundamentals and valuation. And unfortunately, SCL's current stock price seems a bit too generous given its underlying financials. Thus, I consider SCL an excellent ""hold"" for now, and it would be a ""buy"" if it dips at least 20%.Source: SCL's website.SCL produces and sells specialty chemicals. Hence, its revenues are relatively diversified because its products are used in various industries and applications. In particular, the COVID pandemic has proved highly lucrative for SCL because it generated additional demand for cleaning and disinfecting products. Therefore, interestingly enough, SCL became an unlikely benefactor of the coronavirus. But it's all because SCL's revenues are highly diversified, so it's almost guaranteed that at least some of its products will always be in demand.Source: Statista. Cleaning product sales have increased due to the pandemic.For example, most recently, SCL's surfactant income benefited from increased demand for cleaning and disinfection products. But at the same time, SCL's other segments (polymers and specialty) declined slightly. Such declines were mainly COVID related. After all, SCL's Polymer segment suffered along the rest of the economy. You see, Polymer income declined because constructions slowed down or were canceled due to the pandemic. Hence, reduced Rigid Polyol and Phthalic Anhydride volumes negatively impacted this segment.Furthermore, SCL's Polymer segment also suffered from higher raw input costs. Hence, overall this segment's sales dropped a whopping 20%. And again, such a decline is entirely in line with the rest of the economy. But regardless of the broader economic cycle SCL as a whole seemed to deliver consistent results.Source: Seeking Alpha. So far, in 2020, SCL has beaten both revenue and bottom-line expectations.Here's where SCL's diversified revenue streams come into play. You see, despite the worldwide economic shutdown, the company's Surfactant revenues managed to grow by roughly 6% QoQ. And even more surprisingly, its operating income increased a whopping 51% QoQ. To me, this shows that the company's Surfactant results proved not only resilient to a steep unprecedented economic recession, but it even acted as a hedge for investors.In my opinion, SCL can now be considered as an effective hedge against any COVID related issues. Likewise, SCL is also a relatively safe bet that enhanced cleaning and disinfecting standards will persist going forward.Source: SCL's earnings slides.So, it's almost undeniable that the pandemic has been a net positive for SCL. After all, most of SCL's additional revenues have been attributed to North America's increased consumer demand for cleaning and disinfecting products. I believe this consumer trend will not change, even after the pandemic subsides.As previously mentioned, the Polymer segment did suffer due to a steep drop in economic activity. However, I gather this will be a nice tailwind from now on. This is because, as the pandemic subsides, economic activity will pick up again. As a result, SCL's Polymer segment will most likely benefit from a recovery in construction projects. Accordingly, SCL could go into overdrive if its Polymer segment recovers, while the Surfactant section continues growing (or even sustains) its current results. In my view, this would translate into a multiyear secular tailwind for SCL.Source: SCL's earnings slides.On top of that, SCL's balance sheet seems to be reasonably robust. In fact, since 2016, SCL's Net Debt to Cash Flow ratio has continued trending lower from 16% to -8% as of Q2 2020. This is excellent news because it provides safety to investors, while also giving management another potential growth vertical through M&A. This is important because SCL's market doesn't typically offer explosive growth opportunities for investors. Thus, having deep pockets can allow SCL to purchase competitors or otherwise strengthen their value proposition.Moreover, it's undeniable that SCL's liquidity is in fantastic shape to endure any possible future shutdowns (which I consider are unlikely). Specifically, the company's liquidity dwarfs its near-term debt maturities. Plus, SCL's strong FCF of roughly $81 (NYSE:TTM) ensures that these liquidity metrics will only continue improving.I believe that SCL's liquidity and FCF are so good that dividend hikes are entirely possible. Alternatively, management could attempt to pursue more ambitious M&A opportunities to spur growth. However, I think dividends are a more flexible approach and would be very welcomed by shareholders. You see, SCL's dividends represent a measly $23 million yearly commitment. Therefore, I assume SCL could easily hike its dividend by even 50% and still have an exceedingly comfortable FCF.Source: Seeking Alpha. In my view, SCL's dividend yield is poised for an increase.Besides, it's also worth noting that SCL repurchased approximately $13.18 million in its stock during 2019. In theory, stock buybacks could also be another viable alternative for returning cash to shareholders. Nevertheless, I'd argue that given SCL's current valuation, a savvier financial move would be a special dividend or just hiking regular dividends. So, management could also decide to redirect those funds to enhance its dividend.If you put all of these variables together, we could be talking about almost $25 million in additional dividends. For context, this would more than double SCL's current dividend. But more importantly, it would do it without jeopardizing the long-term health of its balance sheet.So overall, I'd say that SCL is incredibly well-positioned to thrive in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, if such a scenario plays out, and monetary policy remains dovish, I can picture SCL's stock doing well over the long-term. Unfortunately, my valuation model for the company suggests that the shares are indeed relatively overvalued. For this, my model used the CAPM's discount rate, which benefits SCL considerably due to low interest rates. Then I used that rate to value SCL's estimated future FCF.As you can see, my valuation model suggests SCL has a 16.36% potential downside at these levels. In other words, SCL is somewhat expensive, given its fundamentals. However, if I were to price SCL using a reasonably higher discount rate (like 10%, for example), then SCL would become significantly overvalued. In fact, at a mere 10% discount rate, SCL's fair value per share would be just $57.14 (according to my model).Naturally, I believe that higher interest rates are incredibly unlikely given the present macroeconomic picture. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that SCL is only slightly overvalued. Still, it's worth keeping in mind that a good deal of SCL's generous valuation is due to an accommodative Federal Reserve.Overall, I feel that SCL is a robust company. I also think that SCL is a much more valuable stock today due to its diversified revenue streams and its utility as a COVID hedge. Yet, it looks like by now, most of these positives are fully priced into the stock.Consequently, SCL remains a decent hold if you already have it. But if you don't, it's probably best to sit on the sidelines and wait for better prices. In my opinion, if SCL's price were to dip by approximately 20%, it would bring it back to a much more reasonable valuation. Assuming interest rates don't increase significantly, I deem that SCL would be a solid buy at those levels.Thank you for reading and good luck."
4313952,101693,2019-12-23T21:31:44-05:00,"Stepan Company's revenues seem to have stalled during 2019 due to hiccups in Germany and Mexico. I think this sheds light on the company's core strengths: its management and balance sheet.In my view, the company's future will depend on its ability to keep expanding its margins as it has done in the past. After all, the top line growth prospects aren't promising.In particular, I consider M&A in the polymer segment would be fantastic, as it would allow the company to double down on its highest-margin section.I believe Stepan Company's robust balance sheet puts the company in a perfect position to pursue aggressive M&A opportunities into 2020.Nevertheless, I can't justify the company's current premium. My valuation suggests the shares' fair value is $66.30, which implies a 33.7% potential downside. Hence, I recommend passing up on the shares for now.","I consider Stepan Company (SCL) the typical dull stock in an industry with little to no growth. Yet, its fundamentals are attractive and its management team is exceedingly competent. So, it's no wonder that investors have bid up the company's shares, as it promises safety over the long term. Unfortunately, I doubt SCL's lack of organic growth will adequately compensate new investors at these levels. Therefore, I estimate it's best to pass up on SCL for now but consider accumulating some shares on pullbacks.SCL produces specialty chemicals and operates under three segments: surfactants, polymers, and other specialty products. The surfactant segment accounts for roughly 68% of the company's total revenues. On the other hand, the polymers and other specialty products represent 28% and 4% of total revenues, respectively. However, even though most of SCL's revenues come from surfactants, most of its operating income was produced by polymers during the most recent quarter. This proves how valuable the polymers segment is for the company. It also shows the potential this segment holds if the company keeps growing this division while sustaining its margins.Source: SCL’s 10-Q (see link above)For context, the polymer segment supplies polyurethane polyols used in rigid foam. These materials are typically used in construction for thermal insulation, but also coatings, adhesives, and sealants. Moreover, polymers are also used to make resins, which also have applications in automotive components. Thus, it's interesting to see that the polymer segment (SCL's highest-margin section) seems to correlate with demand in the construction and automotive industries. Since both of these industries are cyclical, I imagine that SCL's polymer segment should follow them as well. So, the takeaway here is that even the company's most promising division likely doesn't offer significant growth over the long term.Source: SCL’s 10-Q (see link above)Nevertheless, it’s fair to say that SCL's products are highly diversified across industries, which should make its sales relatively stable. Moreover, the company's geographic operations are also highly diversified. In fact, it has operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Yet, investors should keep in mind that most of SCL's revenues still come from the North America region. This region, in particular, accounts for roughly 62% of total sales. So, even though the company has a worldwide footprint, the US remains its most valuable market.After looking at the company's core businesses, it's challenging to find areas for future explosive growth. Thus, given SCL's current valuation multiples, I suppose the market is likely pricing in significant EPS expansion soon. The only way I see this happening is through M&A. In particular, I think an acquisition that expands SCL's presence in the polymer segment would be incredibly beneficial due to its better margins. However, it'd have to be a relatively notable transaction, and currently, I don't see any tangible possibilities. This is why it's tough to justify the company's current premium that way.Source: Reuters, plus author’s annotationsIt is possible investors have flocked to SCL due to its robust balance sheet. You see, the company has a net positive cash position after factoring in its outstanding debt. This is important, because it means that the company is poised for growth through M&A. Hence, SCL can keep growing its bottom line through synergies, cost efficiencies, and so on. In my view, growth through M&A makes perfect sense for a company like SCL because it would 1) increase the company's sales and 2) open the doors for synergies and cost efficiencies. In fact, over the years, company management has consistently found plenty of cost and tax efficiencies.In my view, this dedication to maximizing profits is a testament to a professional and capable management team. I gather it's evident that they're likely tracking every cent spent on different activities across the whole organization. In my opinion, management's notable work ethic is another tremendous plus for shareholders.Furthermore, I believe that this level of micromanaging and attention to detail is why since 2005, SCL's EBITDA margins have consistently grown from 5% to currently over 11%. In fact, during the company's last quarter, most of its positive developments didn't stem from increased demand. Quite the opposite, SCL saw a contraction in some of its regions. Nonetheless, management continued to deliver stronger margins, which compensated for the company's top line headwinds.Source: SCL’s 10-QIn my view, Germany is a perfect example of SCL's cost efficiencies in spite of revenue declines. Believe it or not, during the last quarter, the company's revenues dropped in the surfactant segment because it ceased its production at its German plant during the fourth quarter of 2018. Naturally, this translated into a 16% YoY decline for SCL's surfactant revenues in Europe (see image above). Nevertheless, SCL's actual gross profits for the very same segment and region increased. The explanation is that the company ultimately benefited from lower overhead costs and higher unit margins resulting from closing the German plant. In other words, it continued to find ways of cutting the fat out of the organization. This a great example of the company's ingenuity for delivering bottom line growth in spite of revenue declines.Source: SCL’s 10-Q (see link above)Another excellent example of SCL's resiliency is the recent equipment malfunction at one of its newly acquired plants in Mexico. Naturally, the stock tumbled roughly 10% on the news. Despite this, the company continued to focus on execution, and today it looks like the stock is entirely over the news. Two factors played a vital role in this: 1) management's focus on executing despite the setback, and 2) management's prudence by insuring against such events.Source: Yahoo FinanceAs a result, since then, SCL has traded up roughly 20% up and is currently sitting at new all-time highs. Consequently, the equipment malfunction will likely only represent a blip on the company's long-term performance. Still, I would point out that the recent rally in SCL shares has mostly tracked the broader market's multiple expansion.Despite SCL's sound fundamentals, I can't justify its current price tag. After all, the company now trades at a P/E of 20, while expected to have little to no organic growth for the next couple of years. In my opinion, this seems excessive. For context, the company's forecasted expected EPS growth until 2020 is 3.33%. This implies a whopping PEG ratio of 6, which indicates SCL is likely grossly overvalued.Furthermore, my valuation model also seems to corroborate this. For this, I estimated SCL’s future free cash flows based on its historical EBIDTA margins and CAPEX guidance. With this information, I used the CAPM to value those free cash flows.As you can see, my valuation implies a 33.7% downside for the shares at current levels. In my opinion, these also make sense, because the company's free cash flow will likely remain somewhat flat for the next couple of years. Hence, under those assumptions, it’s almost impossible to justify SCL’s current valuation.Source: SCL’s investor presentation. Management’s strategy is focused on creating shareholder value.As a whole, SCL is a reliable company with a strong balance sheet and a capable management team. It also seems like a shareholder-friendly company with a long track record. Naturally, this makes it attractive for conservative investors looking to park their funds and collect a decent dividend of 1.10%. However, I deem the company's lack of organic growth makes it difficult to justify its current valuation. The truth is that there are likely better investment alternatives that offer higher dividend yields, while also growing organically. Hence, I believe SCL shares don't deserve their current premium. Therefore, I think investors should pass up on SCL for now but consider adding it on dips.Thank you for reading, and good luck."
4258462,105178,2019-05-01T09:52:37-04:00,"We do not expect it to produce double-digit growth like today’s tech companies; it is a relatively “boring”, stable company that provides consistent, growing results.Our models currently project the company’s stock being worth about $90 per share, while it is trading at about $89 today.Short-term investors should shy away from Stepan's stock, but long-term investors should consider starting a position to hold for the long-haul.","Stepan Company’s (SCL) (“Stepan”) increase in sales in 2018 was driven primarily from its largest product segment, Surfactants, having record-breaking earnings. Overall, surfactants have increased by 5 percent with the major contribution from its newly acquired plant in Ecatepec, Mexico. As Stepan continues to grow, it believes that with its diversified product portfolio, planning to develop next-generation technology and with newly acquired the plant in MexiCo, it will cause the supported market position and a strong customer build. For short-term investors looking for a quick turnaround, we do not recommend investing in Stepan’s stock. However, for a long-term investor, Stepan is a strong stock to purchase for the long haul at today’s fairly-valued price.Stepan, with its headquarters in Northfield, Illinois, was founded in 1932 by Alfred C. Stepan, Jr.; the business is currently run by his grandson, F. Quinn Stepan, Jr. Stepan has 21 manufacturing locations in 11 countries with 2,000 employees, worldwide. The company is ISO 9001:2015 certified and manufactures three products: Surfactants, Polymers, and Speciality Products. Stepan is one of the largest surfactant manufacturers in the world and sells to a wide range of manufacturers in many industries.The company has three reportable segments:Source: Data, Form 10k. Graph, self-created.SurfactantsStepan is one of the leading merchant producers of surfactants in the world. The company’s consolidated net sales are accounting 70 percent by surfactants alone. Surfactants are the principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products, such as a detergent for washing clothes, dishes, carpets, floors and walls, and shampoos and body washes.The company does not sell directly to the retail market. The manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, body wash, fabric softeners, toothpaste, and cosmetics are the principal customers for surfactants. In addition, it sells Surfactants in agricultural herbicides and also into oil field markets to aid production, drilling, and hydraulic fracking.PolymersPolymers, which accounted for 26 percent of consolidated net sales in 2018, include polyurethane polyols, polyester resins and phthalic anhydride. Polymers are used in the construction and appliance industries and in applications for the coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomer industries. Phthalic anhydride, a polymer product, is also used by automotive, boating and other consumer product companies. In the manufacture of polymers, Stepan competes with the chemical divisions of several large companies, as well as with other small specialty chemical manufacturers.In the year 2018, the company’s operating income has shown a decline of 22 percent for Polymers segment because of lower sales volume and unit margins in North America. The company is planning to continue its investment in the development of next-generation polyol technology, providing improved insulation and flammability performance. This next-generation technology will benefit the company when trying to compete with its rivals, as most of the companies are away from smart technology. Smart technology and involvement of AI & Machine learning in the chemical industry will lead to a drastic change for the industry and company.Specialty ProductsSpecialty products account for four percent of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2018. Stepan's Specialty products are naturally derived and its ingredients will benefit Food, Nutrition, Flavors, beverages & Pharmaceutical market. The net sales of specialty products have been decreasing over the past 3 years due to high competition with other large firms which are owing specialty chemicals as the main product.Decreasing the debtStepan’s balance sheet remains strong in the year 2018. Stepan has returned $36 million to his shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In 2018, the company has also increased its cash dividend for the 51st consecutive year, placing them in a very select group of companies.Source: Data, Morningstar. Graph, self-created.Naturally derived surfactantsSeventy-five percent of Stepan’s product portfolio offers sustainability advantages related to bio-renewability, energy efficiency, or reduced environmental impact. The company has introduced new naturally derived surfactants for the personal care market that deliver performance and sustainability advantages for the customers. In addition, it continues to create high-active surfactants that require less energy and fewer resources to transport.The market of naturally derived surfactants is growing fast in developed & developing countries as the customers are becoming more aware of the ingredients of the products they use on their skin & in their home. Naturally derived surfactants are coming with very few or no side effects, which will capture the consumers very easily. This point is understood by Stepan very well and the company is focusing more to launch as many as products which are naturally derived & with fewer side effects. To convert this thought into a reliable way, the company has introduced a new technology for two bio-based surfactants which mainly concentrated in the personal care market - NINOL CAA and STEPANQUAT Helia.Recent AcquisitionOn March 26, 2018, the company, through a subsidiary in Mexico, acquired BASF’s production facility in Ecatepec, Mexico, and a portion of its related surfactants business. The facility, which is near MexiCo. City, has over 50,000 metric tons of capacity, 124,000 square feet of warehouse space, a large laboratory and office space. The acquired assets and business are included in the company’s Surfactants segment. The initial purchase price of the acquisition was $21,475,000 and was paid with cash on hand.BASF is the leading global supplier of industries like cosmetics, detergents, and cleaners. I believe that this acquisition will lead to good customer acquisition and as per industry data, the use of surfactants & specialty chemicals are growing fast in Mexico, will lead to giving much more benefit to the coming years. The synergy effect of this acquisition will cause a big effect in capturing the chemical market because both the companies have very well diversified product portfolios and having a vast and strong customer base.Shut down of German plantStepan in its third quarter of 2018 has approved the plan to shut down its German surfactant operation plant site. The company recognized restructuring costs of $1,404,000 comprised asset and spare part write-downs. The company’s German plant is going through higher plant expenses resulted from planned 30 days mandatory inspection shut down of the plant. The shutdown decision was made in order to reduce the company’s fixed cost base. This plant has been incurring losses since 2016. With this decision of shutting down the plant, the company will save expenses year-over-year and will ultimately result in increased operational efficiency.Industry ViewIn the personal care product market, surfactants that are gentle on skin and hair and are also environmentally sustainable will see the best growth prospects in dollar terms. Naturally derived biosurfactants, which tend to see limited use in industrial and cleaning product markets, will expand their share of the personal care product market in dollar terms as many consumers increasingly favor products that are marketed as “natural.”Increasing Demand for Household Soaps and DetergentsSource: Mordor IntelligenceNorth America accounts for one-third of the global manufacturing for soaps and detergents. The United States and Canada account for most of the manufacturing and consumption of soaps and detergents.The United States to Dominate the MarketThe United States is the largest consumer of surfactants in the region. Due to the expanding personal care industry, the usage of surfactants has increased over the past few years, which is expected to further increase over the forecast period. The food processing industry in the country is expanding, which is expected to augment the use of surfactants. Surfactants are used in lubricants and fuel additives. This factor has been driving the increased usage of surfactant in the automotive industry over the years. The structure of the surfactant supply industry in the country is stratified and complex. It comprises players who manufacture surfactant and raw materials for surfactants. One of the main segments of the beauty & cosmetic industry in the country is the premium product segment.Source: Mordor IntelligenceAs we are seeing in the industry overview from Mordor Intelligence, the future of the surfactant market is growing at a CAGR of 3.2% will leads to increase the market share of Stepan as Stepan is the leading manufacturer of surfactant in the world.As discussed above, people tend to prefer products that are named “natural”. Using the naturally derived surfactants will lead to capturing the whole market of surfactant. Stepan at the other hand has covered 60% of its market in the US will turn into growing revenues & profits to the company.Looking at the Volume of surfactants by country, Stepan has done its expansion in these countries with its totality of 21 plants. Surfactant is the daily used product and people who are shifting from hardcore detergent to softcore detergent or liquid will be increasing the demand for surfactant in the country.In considering valuation approached for Stepan Company, we applied the Market Approach. For this approach, we reviewed the performance of a set of guideline public companies in the public market in a similar industry. We relied on traditional market multiples such as EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples as presented below.Source: Author-createdThe company’s EV/Revenue is 0.96x which is near to the average multiple of other peer groups, i.e. 1.0. The lower multiple compare to industry multiple shown as the company has a growing potential in the near future. As per the ideal ratio analysis, lower the EV/Revenue multiple, good it is to invest or stay longer with the company but one should also not forget to look into other factors. Looking at the EV/EBITDA, the company is trading exactly with the industry average which is good. It means that the company is fairly valued to its current price as compare to EV/EBITDA multiple.Moving further, the P/E ratio indicates how much an investor is willing to pay the price to the stock, for every rupee of the profit the company generates. Higher the P/E, more expensive the stock. As shown in the PDF, the company is trading above the average industry P/E. which means that the company is slightly overvalued & seems quite expensive to the investors.Source: Author-createdBased on the above analysis, we conclude the value to be $90.52, while the current price of the stock is about $89-$92. This tells us the company is relatively fairly valued at today’s prices.Data by YChartsStepan Co. is a well-managed company with consistent growth in an industry/market that we do not expect to go anywhere any time soon. While this company does not compare to most of today's high-flying tech companies, it does provide steady, consistent growth at a reasonable price. While we do not expect the company to double or triple any time soon, we do expect Stepan Co. to be a successful investment for long-term buy-and-hold investors at today’s prices."
4229778,50452,2018-12-22T09:36:36-05:00,"Stepan Company is a chemical manufacturer with a 51-year dividend growth streak.The business has struggled with consistency in margins, and cash flow generation over the years.The company is investing in growth markets, but remains highly exposed to oil and gas.The stock isn't unreasonably valued at current levels, but sub-benchmark operational metrics and worries over the economy have us avoiding Stepan Company at this time.This article is part of a series that will put a spotlight on ""Dividend Champions"" and the fundamentals behind their success.","Industrial stocks are often great dividend growth investments because industrials feed the constant needs for advancement and expansion of global economies. Across the world, products are being made in larger quantities and innovation is changing the way that products are made. Today's dividend champion spotlight is cut from the industrial cloth. Stepan Company (SCL) has raised its dividend for more than half a century, a whopping 51 years. While the company doesn't fit the ""cash cow"" profile, the company's prudent management of its financials and steady growth have put the company in position to deliver solid dividend growth for years to come. Despite this, Stepan Company's subpar operational metrics and status as an industrial in a peak cycle environment have us cautious about the stock in the near term.Stepan Company manufactures and sells specialty and intermediate chemical products. The company operates in three business segments: Surfactants, Polymers, and Specialty Products. The majority of revenues are derived from Surfactants (67%), with another 28% stemming from the Polymer business. Just 5% of revenues come from specialty products. The company was founded in 1932, and is based in Northfield, IL. The company generates approximately $2 billion in annual revenues.Source: Stepan Co.The company is a leading producer of surfactants which are used in products such as detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, foaming agents, and more. While a small part of the business (but a nifty little factoid), Stepan's specialty unit includes being the only company authorized in the US to extract coca from cocoa leaves via its plant in New Jersey.Source: YchartsThe company derives 60% of revenues from non-cyclical applications. Still, the company has seen fluctuations due to its exposure to economically sensitive applications including oil and gas. Over the past 10 years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 3.77%, while earnings per share have grown at a CAGR of 17.98% over the same time frame.To gain a better understanding of the company's financial and operational strengths and weaknesses, we will begin by analyzing Stepan's operating margin and FCF conversion rate. It's important that the business is consistently profitable within its own operating environment, so we look for margins that are consistent or expand over time. Additionally, we want to invest in companies that generate strong cash flow streams. Therefore, we look for a company to convert at least 10% of its revenues into free cash flow.Source: YchartsThe company has seen fluctuations in both of these metrics over the past 10 years. This can be due to a number of factors including the economic environment, as well as underlying input cost fluctuations from movements in commodity prices. Both metrics typically perform under our benchmark, so we would like to see a stronger performance in that regard. This is partially due to the business model, as not many chemical manufacturers are pulling in extremely high margins - the industry is just too competitive.The next metric we will look at is the cash return on invested capital (CROCI). This gauges how efficient management is at utilizing the company's resources in order to generate cash flow. The CROCI is also a baseline indicator of the strength of a company's competitive ""moat"". A strong CROCI (usually in the low-teens or higher) is often a sign that a company is well managed, profitable, and not overly capital intensive.Source: YchartsThe company again fails to meet our benchmark. What is encouraging, though, is the long-term uptrend in the metric. Stepan's CROCI has slowly improved over the past several years. Still, the company operates from a position of low pricing leverage. This doesn't necessarily reflect on the company itself, rather the fact that a chemical company only has limited means of generating premium margins/cash flow/profits.The last area of review before moving on is the balance sheet. It is extremely important for a non-cash flow rich business such as Stepan to operate within its financial means. Over-leveraging can lead to vulnerability to rising interest rates, or a potential liquidity/cash flow problems in the event of an unexpected downturn in the business.Source: YchartsThe balance sheet is where Stepan really excels. The company carries $286.24 million in total debt, but carries a strong cash balance of $273.99 million against it. The current leverage ratio of 1.28X EBITDA is also well below my ""warning sign"" level of 2.5X. Having a strong balance sheet enables the company to maximize the cash flow it does generate, rather than tie up its cash with interest expenses and having to pay down debt.Stepan Company has been raising its dividend for decades. Its most recent increase represents the 51st year in its current streak. The dividend is paid every quarter, and totals an annual sum to share holders of $1.00 per share. The current yield based on the stock's share price is 1.38%, so Stepan Company may not appeal to investors trying to generate income from their investments. For reference, investors can get 2.78% from 10-year US treasuries.Source: YchartsThe dividend has maintained a solid growth rate over the past 10 years at a CAGR of 7.4%. That rate has held pretty consistently throughout the time period, with this year's rate even coming in higher at 11.1%. While the company doesn't generate mountains of cash flow, the cash payout ratio has remained very manageable at just 23.39%. As long as the operating environment stays somewhat healthy (and it should considering more than half of revenue is non-cyclical), the dividend has years of growth ahead of it. Investors can reasonably expect the long-term growth rate of 7% to continue for the short- to medium-term future.To drive growth, the company is targeting a number of macro level trends and markets to position itself in. As a manufacturer of Polyols used to make insulation, Stepan is poised to benefit from continued efforts by regulators to increase energy efficiency in commercial buildings throughout global markets.Source: Stepan Co.While mature industrial countries such as the US lead these efforts, there are long-term opportunities in emerging markets such as China and India where commercial buildings are behind modern energy conservation standards.Another large growth market for Stepan Co. is the agriculture industry, where a number of Stepan's chemical products are used for the farming of crops and feed. Given the continual need to boost crop yields in the face of a growing global population, the demand for chemical products will thrive well into the future.These types of applications will help diversify the company away from its large exposure to oil and gas production. Many of the chemicals that Stepan produces is used in a variety of aspects in the extraction of oil from shale and oil sands. This year, the US became the world's leading oil producer.Source: EIAWhile this means that demand is high for chemicals produced by Stepan, the oil and gas industry is volatile so diversification is a positive for long-term earnings stability.The largest risk to Stepan Company is the economic environment within the United States. For much of the past 10 years, Stepan has benefited from a bullish economy following the recession. In the event of a downturn, manufacturing activity would be suppressed, which would obviously hurt Stepan Company.Industrials have been hurt by the recent downturn in the stock market, and Stepan Company is no exception. Shares are currently trading at just over $71 per share, almost at 52-week lows. Analysts are currently projecting full-year earnings at approximately $4.69 per share, putting the stock at an earnings multiple of 15.13X. This is a modest 6% discount to the stock's 10-year median earnings multiple of 16.19X.To gain additional perspective on the valuation, we compare the earnings multiple to the FCF yield. Cash flow is the ""life blood"" of a business, and is an organic measure of a company's performance. For that reason, it makes for a great valuation tool.Source: YchartsThe current yield of 5.16% is higher than what Stepan Company has yielded for much of the decade. However, the current yield doesn't compare to the large yield it offered during the last recession. Industrial stocks are severely punished during recessionary events, which is why we often don't look to them during peak phases of economic cycles.While Stepan Company deserves respect due to a well funded dividend growth streak of 51 years, there are a number of factors that point us away from this stock. The operational metrics leave us wanting more cash flow generation and consistency. Additionally, the company is sensitive to industrial activity and oil/ gas production. We are bearish on most industrial stocks at this time due to an increasingly likely recessionary event as interest rates continue to rise. We don't feel that Stepan Company is offering a compelling enough story, or valuation to overlook these concerns at this time.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

4327652,104744,2020-02-27T07:18:32-05:00,"Stepan's 2019 revenue fell 7% primarily because of the bleak performance of the Surfactants segment.Surprisingly, its adjusted EPS rose 7% despite pressure on margins.In 2020, the company encountered challenges from the power outage at the Millsdale site to the repercussion of the coronavirus.I believe not all risks are priced in.","Stepan Co. (SCL), one of the global surfactants industry heavyweights, has recently wrapped 2019. The company presented surprisingly strong results that topped both revenue and adjusted EPS estimates of the Wall Street pundits. The company had been delivering better-than-expected adjusted EPS since June 2018, but its top line had been, contrarily, way below what Wall Street expected to see. Q4 2019 was the first quarter when SCL managed to beat both on EPS and sales.However, investors paid little attention to better than forecasted figures; the share price went slightly up, but then slipped on February 21. What is more, the stock was also not immune to the Monday sell-off, when international capital markets experienced panic-like fear, as the coronavirus outbreak in Northern Italy sparked concerns the repercussions of the pathogen had been hugely underestimated.Data by YChartsI covered this dividend king for the first time in December 2019, when I concluded SCL had a surfeit free cash flow that buttressed its dividend. Now, I suppose it is worth providing an update on the stock while also briefly assessing how the coronavirus outbreak that has been buffeting the Chinese economy since January can impact operations, financials, and market value of SCL in 2020.It would not be fair to say the 2019 performance of Stepan was exemplary. Last year, its consolidated revenue contracted by around 7%; now, a five-year revenue CAGR is sub-zero and stands at -0.72%. Three divisions delivered unequal results. The flagship segment, Surfactants, that is responsible for 68% of consolidated revenue, suffered from softness in the U.S. surfactants market that led to an 8% drop in annual net sales. Polymers' revenue was supported by rigid polyol market growth, which, in turn, was spurred by the construction sector where the material is used in insulation; its revenue also fell but only by 3%. By the way, in the longer term, energy conservation should be supportive of segmental sales growth. Specialty Products, the third division, was also under pressure; its annual net sales were 8% lower than in 2018.During the earnings call, Stepan's Chief Financial Officer Mr. Rojo elucidated what had been the principal culprit of the slipped revenue of the flagship segment. Among other things, he mentioned lower personal care commodity volume in the U.S., as one key customer lost ""an important piece of business.""Lower revenue took a toll on margins, so, profitability was also afflicted; moreover, earnings before interest, tax, and D&A together with operating income slipped even deeper than revenue. For instance, GAAP operating income dropped 15% year-over-year to $127.3 million; operating margin stood at only 6.8%. EBITDA fell 10.5%.Surprisingly, while GAAP figures were down, adjusted earnings per share were up 7%. Among the one-off items that SCL added back to adjusted EPS were restructuring expenses, deferred compensation, and an increase in environmental remediation (e.g., costs associated with the site in Wilmington, Massachusetts, which the company sold in 1980). Also, it is worth noting that SCL's interest burden reduced 45% YoY; however, it was not a consequence of a debt restructuring or radically reduced leverage. In 2018, the company repatriated a sizable amount of cash to the U.S., and interest earned on increased cash balances largely offset interest on the debt.In January, SCL faced an issue of an unpredictable nature, the power disruption at the Millsdale plant in Illinois, the company's largest facility (492 acres in the site size) that produces both surfactants and polymers. Though the undertaken measures bear fruit and power was restored, emerged challenges were not easy to cope with. Besides, the incident also led to waste-water treatment plant failure on February 17; production was stopped. Replying to an analyst's question on what products were affected, the CEO said:At the moment, it is impossible to quantify the effect of these issues on the results.Another obvious matter that will certainly buffet FY 2020 results is COVID-19. Mr. Stepan, the Chief Executive Officer, said that the Chinese government asked the company to temporarily shut down its manufacturing sites in the country to reduce the risks of the virus spread. As comes from the most recent Form 10-K, the company has one facility in China, in the Nanjing Chemical Industry Park in the Jiangsu province. According to the annual report (see page 14), the plant is a part of the Polymers segment; it manufactures polyurethane polyols and specialty polyols. SCL's plant was closed for twelve days and then reopened, but logistics remained challenging, as there are roadblocks along supply chains. So, there is no doubt that it will be reflected in Q1 2020 results.There were no data on annual or quarterly operating cash flow and capital expenditures in the press release. Also, 2019 Form 10-K has not been published yet (as of February 26, 9-30 AM, Eastern Time). In this sense, I cannot make any conclusions regarding the company's annual free cash flow; I also have no data to compute Cash Return on Total Capital. So, I have to use operating income as a substitution. As of my calculations, in 2019, ROTC stood at 11.7%, which looks nice but surely not perfect, as I consider figures close to 20% to be an indicator of exemplary capital efficiency. Also, another metric worthy of discussion, Return on Capital Employed (expressed as operating income divided by the averaged difference between total assets and current liabilities) hit 10.7% for the year, which is also acceptable but not stellar.Stepan exited 2019 with an extremely robust financial position fortified by the enormous cash pile on the balance sheet. That is of unquestionable importance, as this year, the company has been tackling the headwinds both related to operational issues and the virus outbreak. As in the past robust cash flow made it possible to amass a cash pile solid enough to more than fully cover total debt, in mid-2019, the company's net debt dived below zero; at the moment, the net debt stands at -$93.3 million, while Total debt/EBITDA is slightly above 1x.Speaking about the dividend, after another DPS hike in 2019, SCL pays $1.1 per share annually. Unfortunately, I have no cash flow data to assess the rewards coverage. In the previous article, using historical and LTM figures, I concluded that the dividend was secure. On the negative side, while SCL has been increasing DPS for 52 consecutive years, the current 1.17% yield is barely tempting.Valued at ~$93.79, the stock is trading close to an all-time high. While Stepan is testing choppy waters, its 10.2x Enterprise Value/EBITDA multiple likely does not factor in the risk discount related to the Millsdale issues and the virus. The stock is too still richly valued and has obvious downside risks.Analysts anticipate the 2020 revenue to improve insignificantly by 0.4% to around $1.87 billion; they are bearish on the adjusted EPS and expect it to contract at a high-single-digit rate. This level of growth does not justify the valuation.SCL is neither a dream growth stock nor a value stock. Its moderate growth has recently decelerated, while trading multiples are approaching a decade high. Its issues like a power outage at the Millsdale site in Illinois and the temporary facility shutdown in China point to the fact both Q1 and FY 2020 results will be afflicted.I am neutral on SCL, as I struggle to find meaningful catalysts (except for the overall market bullishness if the COVID-19 threat will be ultimately eliminated) that can push the share price higher in the short term; valuation also does not look supportive."
4313830,104744,2019-12-23T10:08:21-05:00,"In October 2019, SCL increased its quarterly dividend by 10%.Thanks to a robust position in the surfactants market, SCL has double-digit Cash Return on Total Capital and copious free cash flow.In the late 2010s, SCL substantially reduced debt.The stock is relatively reasonably valued compared to peers but looks expensive compared to average EV/EBITDA in the 2010s.A 1.1% yield is too low for my taste.","In October 2019, Stepan Co. (SCL), an American specialty chemicals company, increased its quarterly dividend by 10%. The firm has a history of 52 years of consecutive quarterly dividend hikes; as it is immensely tough to deliver more than 50-year DPS growth, I reckon Stepan Co. deserves an in-depth assessment.The company's portfolio encompasses three segments: Surfactants, Polymers, and Specialty Products.Its revenue has been growing with a 2.14% CAGR in the last three years, while the 10-year CAGR amounted to 3.5%. Yet, the compound annual growth rate hides one essential matter: cyclicality.Data by YChartsIn the 2010s, its sales were unstable; the highest revenues were achieved in 2014 and 2018. Yet, despite lackluster sales growth, the stock has more than doubled its value since end-2014. So, it was double-digit net income growth that potentiated the rally, and I suppose in the future, the capital gain will almost entirely depend on EPS and the company's ability to secure and expand margins.The Surfactants segment is dominant, as, in FY 2018, it underpinned 70% of revenue. In Q3 2019, it added 66.4% to total net sales. In FY 2018, Polymers brought another 26%, while the contribution from Specialty Products equaled to a tiny 4%.Surfactants or surface-active agents are considered to be among the most versatile products of the chemicals industry. Key players in the surfactants market are Stepan Co., BASF AG, Evonik Industries AG, Nouryon, and Kao Corporation.Surface-active agents lower the surface tension between two liquids, a gas and a liquid, or even a liquid and a solid. They serve as an essential cleaning agent in detergents; they are also used in fabric softeners, shampoos, toothpaste, body wash, conditioners, etc. So, manufacturers of consumer staples that operate in the recession-resistant sector are Stepan's principal customers.Another implication of surfactants is in agricultural herbicides, insecticides, and lubricants. Soft agricultural demand caused by floodings in the U.S. was one of the culprits of a 14% drop in Q3 2019 net segmental sales. Another culprit of weaker sales and tumbled quarterly operating income was the company's exit from its sulfonate business in Germany. Still, this did not hinder Stepan from delivering a 19% increase in diluted EPS compared to Q3 2018. The adjusted net income was up 6%.The issue with this segment is that buyers of surfactants are not only in the recession-proof consumer staples industry but also in the highly cyclical oil & gas industry, where producers utilize these chemicals in hydraulic fracturing. To promote oil flow in porous rock, they use fracking fluids based on water and sand, but other essential ingredients like anti-bacterial agents, corrosion inhibitors, and surfactants are also needed.So, when drilling & completion activity decreases, rig count edges lower, a surfactant company will feel the ramifications. Still, in my view, the impact on the top line of Stepan is quite meager, as it has a broad and diversified customer base, and surely does not entirely depend on the oil & gas industry.Polymers underpinned 26% of sales in FY 2018 and 30% in Q3 2019. The products are polyurethane polyols, polyester resins, and phthalic anhydride. This segment enjoys a vast and versatile customer base in the construction, appliances, coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomer industries. Phthalic anhydride is also in high demand among automotive companies.Apparently, the demand for polymers fluctuates, and so does the segmental revenue. In Q3, global rigid polyol volume growth (primarily in North America and Asia) and slight margin improvement underpinned the increase in segmental operating income and also was behind adjusted and GAAP EPS growth mentioned above.Specialty Products are sold to companies that operate in the food & nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical industries. The segment does not bring that much regarding sales, operating income, and cash flow. In Q3, segmental sales dropped 13.8%.In the previous four years, the company did an excellent job reducing its total debt and growing the cash pile on the balance sheet. Data by YChartsAs cash grew at a rapid pace, at the moment, Stepan's net debt is negative, while Debt/Equity stands at 27%. So, its Enterprise Value is mostly comprised of market capitalization. It is far better compared to, for instance, The Chemours Company (CC), which has a Debt/Equity ratio of 486%.To gain a profound understanding of Stepan's fundamentals, I took a more in-depth look at the three matters I consider essential: Total Capital (the sum of both debt and equity, averaged), Cash Return on Total Capital, and Free Cash Flow (I used levered variant). To make it easier for my esteemed readers to comprehend these figures, I visualized the data.All the figures were computed by the author using raw data from Seeking Alpha.The takeaways are as follows:To briefly assess if SCL is over- or underpriced compared to peers, I selected a few companies that operate in the specialty chemicals industry: Celanese Corporation (CE), PolyOne Corporation (POL), H.D. Fuller Company (FUL), and Innospec Inc. (IOSP). I collected a few ratios and metrics like revenue, revenue growth YoY, EBIT margin, ROTC, EV/Sales, EV/EBITDA and visualized the data.So, Celanese is the most expensive in the group, while Stepan clearly looks underpriced as it trades at a 12.5% discount to average EV/EBITDA and a 30% discount to average EV/Sales. This is perhaps because it has the lowest EBIT margin and negative revenue growth YoY. Meanwhile, its Return on Total Capital is on par with peers.All the above point to the fact that SCL is relatively reasonably valued at the moment.Data by YChartsHowever, the issue is that in the 2010s, SCL traded at double-digit EV/EBITDA only three times, in early 2014, mid-2017 and late 2019. It twice abruptly corrected to a single-digit ratio. So, I suppose by now it is quite expensive, which poses certain risks.Stepan is a dividend champion with 52 consecutive years of DPS increases; a 10% dividend hike in October 2019 secured its status. The stock yields ~1.1%.To assess the robustness of dividends, I summarized a few metrics that help to analyze how well both DPS and share repurchases of SCL have been covered by free cash flow left after financing all investing activities inclusive of capital expenditures and acquisitions. All the figures were computed by the author using raw data from Seeking Alpha. Data in $ million.As comes from the data, in 2010-2011 and 2013-2014, cash generation was not robust enough to fully cover investments in PP&E and acquisitions. Nevertheless, since 2015, Stepan has been generating free cash flow to equity copious enough to excessively cover both dividends and buybacks.In conclusion, Stepan Co. might be worth considering and scrupulous researching for investors with the long-term investment horizon (over ten years) who want to benefit from single-digit growth in the surfactants market. However, given double-digit EV/EBITDA, the stock does not look underpriced and misunderstood, while its revenue growth prospects are too low to label it a growth stock.Meanwhile, its dividend yield is fully secured, as copious free cash flow backed by low reinvestment needs buttresses DPS coverage. The flip side is that a 1.1% yield is too small for my taste."
4217520,87336,2018-11-02T08:26:25-04:00,"Stepan's place in the market allows for a couple of moat potentialities.A couple of Stepan's primary end markets are in slowdown mode.Despite its prodigious dividend growth history, Stepan is not a suitable choice for income-focused investors.With shares fully valued, Stepan's outlook for total return does not appear stellar, either.","Image SourceInside my self-directed 401k, the search has been on to find companies that are paragons of stability. If the perpetual doomsayers are indeed right some day soon, to paraphrase Warren Buffett, I don't want to have been one of the naked swimmers.I have been on the search for companies that do not need a good economy to do well. This led me to recent research of Stepan Company (SCL) to determine if it was a good fit for my portfolio. I ultimately decided to take a pass, and here is my rationale.Stepan Company is the epitome of a company whose products are used every day without much realization. In a nutshell, they make stuff that goes into other stuff. Getting its start in 1923 when a 23 year old Alfred Stepan Jr. asked his mom for $500 so that he could start distributing chemicals to control road dust in rural Illinois, Stepan Company has grown into an indispensable firm in forgotten segments of the market. To buttress this assertion, Stepan is the largest producer of anionic and amphoteric surfactants in the Western Hemisphere.Stepan breaks sales of its myriad of products into three reportable segments:Data from 10-Q, chart created by authorSurfactants (70% of Q3 18 sales), the short name for ""surface acting agents"", are simply chemical compounds that manipulate how two surfaces interact with each other. The most common instance of this would be detergency - laundry and dish detergent, shampoo or body wash. But surfactants also touch the agricultural industry in pesticides and herbicides, or serve as emulsifiers (chemicals that stabilize processed foods).Polymers (26%) are chemicals used in the construction market among others. They are used in making plastics, form the foam in thermal insulation, or are the base material for a myriad of coatings, adhesives and wood treatments.Specialty Products (4%) refers to chemicals and powders used in food and pharmaceutical products, among others. Products include Omega-3 triglycerides and dietary supplements aimed at weight loss.While certainly not front-and-center, Stepan Company has integral ingredients in the products that humanity uses every day. Image SourceQuite simply, the best possibility for a moat with Stepan is its unique place in the market. As a case in point, inside their Specialty Products segment is undoubtedly the most unique moat setup of any U.S. publicly traded company. Stepan is the only company legally allowed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency to import coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine. Stepan imports roughly 200 tons of coca leaves per year into their Maywood, NJ plant. The cocaine is extracted, carried away in armored trucks, and then sold to Mallinckrodt (MNK), which is itself the only company that is allowed to legally purify cocaine, which they turn into a local anesthesia for ENT surgery. The remaining neutered coca leaf is then sold to Coca-Cola (KO) as a namesake ingredient in their flagship product.The chance for the unwinding of this symbiotic relationship appears remote at best.However, in addition to this, one could potentially see how Stepan products can become entrenched in a hurry. For instance, once a product becomes part of the ingredient list for All laundry detergent, it is hard to imagine Henkel changing the recipe on a whim. Moreover, success with one formulation could likely result in more business. Two things could potentially derail a company like Stepan - a better mousetrap, or a similar one that can be had for cheaper.In my view this is the first chink in the armor for investing in Stepan Company. Necessarily so, Stepan and other companies in the space spend so much to develop new products, to discover new iterations of their current ones, or simply to stave off competition.Data from SCL 10-Ks, chart created by authorSince 2008, capital expenditures have consistently been equal to or have outpaced net income. And with 2018 capital expenditures recently confirmed at $90-100 million, this trend shows no sign of slowing down. This leaves less money for me as a greedy income investor.Secondly and most importantly, two of Stepan's primary end markets appear to be setup for decline.EnergyStepan products are all over the energy market, covering everything from foam drilling to corrosion control. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a long-term bear on the oil and gas market. It is quite easy for me to see a future administration attempting to do to oil and gas companies what a previous administration tried to do to coal firms.The political winds have already started blowing in this direction, as governments around the world have commenced the move away from internal combustion engines. By 2030, Austria, Costa Rica, Denmark, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands and Norway, as well as the cities of Barcelona, Brussels, Cape Town, London, Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, Seattle, and Vancouver will have all banned gasoline or diesel engines from being sold. It is easy to see geopolitical peer pressure bringing a number of other countries or cities to the table. Even barring what appears to be an eventual inevitability at this point, numerous auto companies are now in the electrification game. Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Volvo, Volkswagen, Aston Martin, Fiat Chrysler, Jaguar and Land Rover are all in various stages of development of electric vehicles, with some shooting for the goal of electrifying their fleet in the next few years. According to the Energy Information Administration, gasoline accounted for 47% of US petroleum consumption as recently as 2017. With demand necessarily coming offline in the coming years, it appears to me that the long-term bearish outlook for oil and gas is the correct call.HousingThanks to the Great Recession, prospective home buyers have enjoyed historically low interest rates for the better part of the last decade. However, it appears that these historic tailwinds are slowing. Interest rates are on their way up, ostensibly so that the Federal Reserve has cushion to lower them again if they need to. Housing inventory is higher now in 30 of the U.S.'s largest 100 cities than a year ago, and mortgage applications for new housing are down 9% year-over-year.Additionally, it appears that the prices of housing stocks are trying to brace for a coming housing bear market, as Mr. Market appears to be telegraphing the felt need to get out beforehand:TOL data by YChartsImage SourceMost likely though, any bull case for Stepan Company shares will touch on the fact that it is a so-called ""dividend king"", the rare moniker reserved for the nearly two dozen companies out of multiple thousands who have increased their shareholder payouts for at least fifty consecutive years. With their most recent increase, Stepan has recently cemented fifty one consecutive years. It screams stability that a company has increased its shareholder payouts every year since Jimi Hendrix released his debut album.Moreover, the dividend has consistently been covered by free cash flow. Since free cash flow turned positive in 2012, the dividend payout is consistently well below the 75% of free cash flow that gives me pause. Dividend/FCF data from M*, chart created by authorA prodigious dividend history and great dividend coverage seem to make this prospect a can't miss for the income-focused investor.There is a catch, though. In fact, the attractiveness immediately falls away when it is discovered that the dividend yield regularly hovers around 1%. Simply put, Stepan is insufficient to be considered as an income investment. For current retirees seeking income, more can be had elsewhere. And those who would say their lengthy time horizon makes it sufficient are overruled by math. As a case in point, let's compare Stepan's prospective future dividend profile with the similarly priced stock of Procter & Gamble (PG). Let us lock in Stepan's recent 11% dividend raise in perpetuity (probably more aggressive than is realistic) as well as Procter & Gamble's 4% most recent raise (probably more conservative than is realistic). Which would be the better income play?Chart created by authorAt current rates, it would take until 2035 for current Stepan shares to generate more income than P&G. Or put another way, it would take Stepan shares purchased today until 2028 to generate roughly the same amount of income that P&G shares do now. If shares are DRIPed, the discrepancy is even greater. Ostensibly then, potential outsized shareholder returns from Stepan must come from somewhere else. If shares were undervalued at this point, we could just collect the dividends as shareholders and wait for a reversion to the mean. However, Stepan shares appear to be trading at a premium to historical PE, PS, EV/EBITDA, and dividend yield averages.SCL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsWith this being the case, then barring a precipitous drop in price, we couldn't expect any greater returns as Stepan shareholders than its return on invested capital. But since that number is conceivably capped due to the inherent capital-intensiveness of its industry, then this number too appears to be also-ran.Data from M*, chart created by authorStepan Company is a good-to-great company in a forgotten industry, with a few characteristics one could deem moat-worthy. If one currently holds it, there is really no reason to sell given a long-term time horizon. However, with shares fully valued and prime end markets appearing to be in slowdown mode, the next big leg for shares appears to be downward.In the face of this though, the dividend yield is nowhere near sufficient to protect investors provided an economic slowdown, or high enough to rightfully be considered an income investment until shares are held for decades. There is no compelling reason for me to buy shares. Author's Note: If you found value here, I'd be honored if you followed me to get semi-regular updates.

The company was founded in 1932 by Alfred C. Stepan Jr. Headquartered in Northfield, Illinois, Stepan manufactures basic and intermediate chemicals, including surfactants, specialty products, germicidal and fabric softening quaternaries, phthalic anhydride (P.A.), polyurethane polyols and special ingredients for the food, supplement and pharmaceutical markets.Benjamin Graham is known as the ""father of value investing"". Warren Buffett writes that he's been exclusively following Benjamin Graham's Value Investing framework for 57 years.Previously, we discussed Graham's five investment strategies in How To Build A Complete Benjamin Graham Portfolio.Graham's criteria for Defensive investment - the most stringent of his strategies - are as follows:The above rules are from Chapter 14: Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor of Graham's magnum opus, The Intelligent Investor.Criterion #1 works out to $500 million today, based on the difference in CPI/Inflation from when the book was written in 1971.The Intrinsic Value for a Defensive stock can be calculated from the quantitative criteria (#6 and #7) for Defensive investment given above, and is popularly known as the Graham Number.Let's see how SCL's numbers stack up against the above requirements.Given below are SCL's Sales and Balance Sheet figures.Note: Graham analyses are done exclusively with annual data.Given below are SCL's BVPS and EPS values used to calculate its Defensive Price (Graham Number).Defensive Graham investment requires 10 years of uninterrupted positive earnings. Using the above figures, we get the following Graham Ratings for SCL.A Defensive Graham grade requires that all ratings - except the last three - be 100% or more. From the above ratings, we see that SCL:Using the above data, we also get the above price calculations for SCL:SCL clears Graham's qualitative criteria for the Defensive investment grade. Therefore, its Intrinsic Value is equivalent to its Defensive Price (Graham Number).Incidentally, the Intrinsic Value(%) too is the same as the Graham Number(%) for all for Defensive grade stocks.However, SCL's Intrinsic Value(%) evaluates to less than 100% - 58.70% - because its Previous Close is higher than its Intrinsic Value.But we're not done yet.Graham's Intrinsic Value formulas actually allow for P/E ratios of 30 - or more - today based on current bond yields. This means that we need to multiply the Graham Number above by 1.41 to arrive at the true Intrinsic Value for SCL.Final Intrinsic Value = $52.00 x 1.41 = $73.50Another way to put this would be that considering today's bond yields, Defensive grade stocks only need an Intrinsic Value(%) of 70% to be considered true Graham stocks.This is because 1.41-1 = 0.7 or 70%.At 58.70%, SCL falls short of that requirement by a bit. But then, as explained in the Graham Ratings section, SCL far exceeds the qualitative criteria that Graham required.It may be helpful to remember that Graham himself wrote:"
4111734,102114,2017-10-05T07:30:00-04:00,Stepan is about to hit its 50th year of consecutive dividend increases. It's steadily growing dividend and capital appreciation make it a solid long-term play.60% of Stepan's business is tied to non-cyclical industries that insulates it from extreme revenue fluctuations.Stepan's ridiculously low 18.1% payout ratio supports above-average dividend increases in the future.Five 2-for-1 stock splits since 1972.,"Some of the strongest dividend payers available can get overlooked if their yield isn't strong enough to satisfy the typical investor's need for income. On the other hand, younger investors tend to ignore soon-to-be Dividend Kings like Stepan Co. (SCL) because they don't necessarily believe that a consistent dividend-paying stock would be the place to go to achieve a focus on capital appreciation.The goal of this article is to review SCL's operations and demonstrate why investors shouldn't be discouraged by a 1% yield. SCL's potential is so much more than its 1% yield for investors who are looking to pick up this high-growth stock.It's easy to dismiss a stock that only yields 1% because a dividend payout that low is trivial to the average Dividend Growth Investor (DGI) who wants the income soon or even immediately. There are however a few exceptions to this rule:The benefit of investing in SCL is that the company has become significantly more profitable in the last three years and their business continues to boom because of an increased reliance on surfactants, polymers, and specialty consumer products.I first covered SCL on January 4, 2017, and during the last 10 months the stock hit a 52-week high of almost $93 per share and then took a dramatic fall to $76 per share. At the time of writing this article, SCL's stock price is $86.02. (For disclosure purposes, I want to note that John and Jane are two clients of mine that currently hold SCL stock based on my recommendation. They have an average cost basis of $81.27/share.)Given the significant price drop over the course of the last year, I wanted to see if I could find a good explanation of why this occurred. In my opinion, it looks like there are a couple of events that resulted in such a significant decrease in share price.Of these events, the reduction of polymer income is the only true concern because the first bullet point is related to significant one-time items that aren't recurring expenses. My concerns are alleviated by management noting that this decrease was impacted by shortages of a chemical in Europe that is used to manufacture polyols. Additionally, management has stated that demand for polymers is strong and their continued investment in additional polymer manufacturing facilities supports this. Although my thoughts on this are speculative, I believe that SCL's management has earned the benefit of the doubt.SCL's management is so confident in the increasing demand for polymers that it is adding capacity at existing facilities and establishing new facilities in growing markets. Here are SCL's most recent developments:Using the non-GAAP measurement of adjusted net income (this excludes significant and nonrecurring expenses) SCL's performance in Q2-2017 resulted in an adjusted net income of $30.9 million which exceeds the adjusted net income of $30.7 million in Q2-2016. Adjusted earnings per share indicates a very similar story with $1.32 per diluted share in Q2-2017 versus $1.33 per diluted share in Q2-2016.The current ratio is calculated by taking a firm's current assets and dividing them by the current liabilities. This ratio is useful for determining whether or not a company is well-positioned to cover short-term liabilities\debt.SCL's current ratio stands at 2.67 which means that it could cover 267% of its short-term liabilities with its current assets. A generally accepted guideline for a reasonable current ratio is one mean that a firm can cover 100% of it short-term liabilities\debt with its current assets. Given this guideline, SCL has one of the strongest current ratios of any company on the market.To give this perspective, two chemical companies that are significantly larger than SCL are BASF Group (OTCQX:BASFY) and LyondellBasell (LYB) have current ratios that are 1.88 and 2.44 respectively. With a current ratio as high as SCL's, it tells me that the company is poised for continued responsible growth.The quick ratio (also commonly referred to as the acid-test ratio) is a liquidity ratio that is more conservative than the current ratio. This test excludes things like inventory and other current assets because they are typically more difficult to convert to cash. Ultimately, the quick ratio ensures that the company is able to pay its current liabilities with things like cash, securities, and accounts receivable.Similar to the current ratio, a ratio of one or greater is considered to be reasonable as this means a company could cover 100% of its current liabilities with liquid highly-liquid assets.SCL's quick ratio stands at 2.02, which I consider to be excellent given that BASFY and LYB sport quick ratios of 1.19 and 1.47 respectively.SCL has experienced a number of significant or nonrecurring charges that have impacted its overall net income, so for this reason, I prefer to use adjusted net income when assessing the true strength of the company. In their most recent presentation, SCL provided the following illustrations to demonstrate how much more efficient the company has become over the last three years.Source: Stepan Investor Presentation - Sept-2017Based on these charts, it is easy to see that SCL has continued to improve its processes, close inefficient plants, and continue restructuring in order to achieve a more efficient company. Here are a few more observations to consider:SCL has continued to focus on decreasing its overall debt load as it has increased debt repayments from $11.4 million in 2016 to $20.7 million in 2017. This has reduced the interest expense from $13.2 million in 2016 to an estimated $11.5 million in 2017.SCL's short-term and long-term debt stands at approximately $21.21 million and $283.22 million, respectively. With a total cash balance sheet of $223.81 million, I am increasingly fond of SCL's ability to be flexible going forward.By using Q1/Q2-2017 reports as the baseline of the forecast we can see the SCL is off to a great start if it wants to beat its 2016 record-breaking adjusted net income of $98.2 million. Here are the current figures for the first two quarters of 2017:Q3 and Q4 tend to be slower times of the year for SCL as Q1 and Q2 have historically generated over 60% of their adjusted net income. In order to gain better insight for Q3\Q4-2017, I want to first review the adjusted net incomes of the same quarters' in 2016.Because non-GAAP EPS removes significant and nonrecurring expenses I believe that it is possible we will see a Q3-2017 adjusted net income of somewhere between $25-$30 million. My prediction is in line with analyst estimates of $1.11 EPS (when multiplied by the number of outstanding shares this results in a GAAP earnings total of approximately $25 million). The high end of my estimate is based on the continued expansion of SCL's polymer and specialty product divisions along with continued management's continued focus to improve asset utilization.As for Q4-2017, I can only assume a stagnant or slightly reduced adjusted net income at this point in time due to the less consistent adjusted earnings associated with Q4 of previous years. Until Q3-2017 earnings reports come through I believe that it is fair to assume an adjusted earnings per share estimate of approximately $12 million.Given the actual adjusted net income of Q1/Q2-2017 and my estimates for Q3/Q4, I predict that the adjusted net income for 2017 will be between $100-$105 million and an estimated total adjusted earnings per share between $4.43 and $4.66 per share. This would indicate a forward-looking payout ratio estimate of 17.5% to 18.5%.Prior to 2012, SCL offered annual dividend increases that were slightly in excess of 6% but over the last five years, this average has edged up closer to 8%. SCL typically announces its dividend increase before the October dividend payment.Source: Charles Schwab - SCLGiven SCL's focus on growth, I expect to see continued dividend increases between 6% to 8% (following in line with previous years). I estimate that the new annual dividend payout will be between $.87 and $.885 per share. If this holds true we will see the payout ratio rise to approximately 19%.If my increase estimates hold true we will see the payout ratio rise to approximately 19% given an 8% increase. This is an extremely conservative payout ratio when compared to BASFY's payout ratio of 49.5% and LYB's payout ratio of 36.5%.SCL is not the stock for investors who need immediate income, but those who do not currently need the income or who can allocate some of their capital towards purchasing shares should see strong capital appreciation and consistently high dividend increases no less than 6%. For this reason, I consider this stock to be one of the better plays for young dividend growth investors who have a timeline in excess of a decade or more. In addition to its growing dividend and capital appreciation, SCL has demonstrated that it is willing to be generous with stock splits. The last split took place on December 17, 2012, at a share price of approximately $110. Given the growth trajectory of its current momentum, I would expect that we should see another stock split sometime in 2018. Final Note: If you enjoy my articles, please take the time to follow me.

3987695,101959,2016-07-11T22:39:14-04:00,"Stepan is a small-cap chemical company and also a dividend champion.
        They have experienced a downturn in the last few years due to their oil and agricultural exposure.
        They are trading around fair value today with the possibility for very high earnings growth going forward.","Stepan (NYSE:SCL) is a small-cap dividend champion offering excellent growth prospects and trading around fair value.Business Overview:Stepan is a chemical company founded in 1959 which produces products in 3 segments:They have decent diversification, with no customer accounting for more than 10%. Their segment sales are split as follows:Source: Midwest Investor ConferenceRecent Operating PerformanceStepan's performance during the Great Recession might lead one to believe that they are recession-proof, considering that they managed to increase EPS every year through it. However, their revenues did decline, and they were able to cut costs and increase margins to counteract the negative effects. A good portion of their business is tied to the energy and agriculture sector, both of which are highly cyclical due to commodity prices. The last couple of years, both sectors have had a rough time, with fellow dividend champions Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) also being forced to cut costs to deal with declining revenues. Stepan has been forced to turn around their business, which has led to their earnings per share breaking through their 2012 high only this year. The good news is that their polymers business has been growing at an excellent rate, and their shift towards more profitable growth has begun to pay off in the form of expanding margins and stabilizing revenues. Their revenue stream has shifted to 60% coming from non-cyclical industries, which should provide more stability going forward. They have a long growth runway, and continue to execute on their restructuring plans, which should begin paying off for patient long-term investors.Finding GrowthThe acquisition of an agricultural chemical plant in Brazil provides a large international growth opportunity for the company. Brazil accounts for 36% of total global agricultural exports, according to the Rio Times. Chemicals produced by Stepan are used to improve yield and treat crops. They have also built a research and development plant in China. Chinese laws are moving towards higher energy efficiency, which should be a tailwind in their polymer business going forward. However, the Chinese economic slowdown is a near-term headwind which the company expects to continue through at least 2017 for their construction polymers.Stepan seems to be sacrificing short term gains for long term growth prospects. I believe that investing their capital into projects to drive growth while simultaneously cutting costs and divesting non-performing assets will lead to long-term success. Their chemicals have typically been used in cyclical industries, but management is shifting the company towards more non-cyclical revenue, which should further enhance stability in the future.Dividend:Stepan has increased their dividend for 48 consecutive years, according to David Fish's CCC List. That is an astounding record, and is even more so considering their small size. Smaller companies tend to have equally small moats which makes them less able to hold up in deep downturns. However, Stepan has been consistent and has kept their capital allocation conservative. Their dividend growth rates aren't going to set the world on fire, and neither will their yield, but if their growth initiatives start to pan out, I expect the DGR to increase.As far as sustainability of their dividends, the payout ratio is a low 20.6%, which is expected given their ~1.3% yield. Their FCF was negative in 2014 and has been positive since then. They have been investing lots of available cash into capex to improve efficiency in their business. This will drive savings down the road and will be reflected in their ROIC metrics. However, it means that this isn't a wide moat business. It's difficult to compare Stepan to other well-known champions that are household names. That is part of what interests me in the company so much, since this small-cap's dividend growth record is on par with companies that are 200-300X their size.Profitability:Stepan's ROIC-WACC spread has been consistently positive, driving shareholder gains over time. This metric will be increasingly important going forward, as they invest most of their available cash into their business. If they were to yield poor returns on that capital, it would have been better spent on dividends or buybacks to return it to shareholders.Source: GuruFocusTheir return on equity has taken a hit, but the last 2 years of increases show that the company has likely turned a corner.Source: MorningstarValuation:Although there was a better entry point to Stepan at the beginning of the year (there was for many companies), I believe they are trading around fair value at this time. Combine their ~16.5 ttm P/E ratio with an expected EPS growth rate of 18% per year for the next 5 years, and the company actually seems undervalued. However, due to their recent investments, their FCF yield is only 2.6%. This shouldn't worry investors, though, since they can easily cut back and maintain profitability and their dividend, as evidenced by their streak of dividend increases and performance during the Great Recession.Source: FAST GraphsForward Look:I expect Stepan to grow its earnings at an excellent rate going forward. Once they overcome some near-term headwinds and some of their recent investments begin to pay off, they should be able to drive excellent returns for shareholders. 18% per year for 5 years may be a little lofty, however, considering the uncertainties in the oil and gas business.Investors should watch their margins and ROIC going forward. I believe that these metrics will help show how well their growth is progressing. Their goals of driving higher margin growth and building new plants while divesting unprofitable ones should help them emerge as a leaner business.Conclusion:Stepan is an interesting company trading with a margin of safety to fair value. Their growth prospects are intriguing, as well as their dividend growth record. I believe this represents an attractive entry point to this company.Other dividend champions offering value today:PPG Industries: A Dividend Aristocrat Offering Value Post-BrexitFears Over Cardinal Health Are OverblownIf you liked this article, and would like to read more like it, please click the follow button next to my picture at the top.Financial statistics were sourced from FinViz, unless otherwise stated.

3295035,24063,2015-06-30T16:48:54-04:00,Seven funds reduced their stakes and two exited.Hedge fund activity likely a sign that Stepan has reached full value.Stepan more of a long-term investment at this point.,"By Andrew SebastianStepan Company (NYSE:SCL) is coming off a good quarter in which it beat its EPS estimate but missed on revenue. Stepan reported EPS of $0.90, beating the estimate by $0.33, while falling short of its revenue estimate by $2.65 million with revenue of $460.45 million. Stepan's top line, like with most U.S. companies with international business, was negatively affected by the strong dollar. Currency adjustments reduced sales by 6%, but volumes grew by 2%, leading to a net reduction of 4%. Nonetheless, it is good to see that the ""real"" side of Stepan's business increased, and although currency headwinds will likely persist over the next year, in the long-term they are transitory and growth in volume should not be marginalized.Stepan's earnings beat was largely driven by the company's efficiency initiatives. It improved gross margin to 16.6% from 13.2% in the prior year's quarter. Operating margins have expanded even more impressively - from 2.6% in 2013 to 19% in 2014. On a trailing twelve months basis, operating margin has grown to 21.3%.Stepan's improving margins are likely why a number of hedge funds have positions in the shares of the company. We follow hedge funds because our research has shown that their stock picks historically managed to generate alpha even though the filings are up to 45-days delayed. We used a 60-day delay in our back tests to be on the safe side and our research showed that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Total Return Index by an average of 95 basis points per month between 1999 and 2012. After adjusting for risk, our calculations revealed that these stocks' monthly alpha was 80 basis points. We have also been sharing and tracking the performance of these stocks since the end of August 2012, during which time they have returned 142%, outperforming the S&P 500 ETF by nearly 84 percentage points (see more details here). Stepan is a small-cap company with a market capitalization of just $1.2 billion.Six hedge funds increased their positions in Stepan in their latest filings, while seven reduced them and two exited their positions completely. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group had the largest position in Stepan among funds raising their positions with a $5.5 million stake, an increase of 2%. D. E. Shaw had the second largest at $2.7 million after increasing its position by 74%, and Paul Tudor Jones was third with a $1.7 million stake through his hedge fund after an increase of 67%. Royce & Associates still had the largest overall holding among hedge funds even after reducing its position by 12% to $12 million. Millennium's $5 million stake showed a 19% reduction and Renaissance Technologies' $3 million position was a 3% decrease. Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management and Arrowstreet Capital exited their positions, but both positions were relatively modest at $526,000 and $321,000, respectively.As Stepan's margins have improved, so have its returns on equity and capital. In 2013, Stepan generated returns on equity and capital of 14.1% and 10.9%, respectively. In 2014, those numbers just about doubled to 30.6% and 20.8%, respectively. Moreover, Stepan has generated a 35.9% ROE and a 24.1% ROC in the last twelve months, putting it up there with some of the best companies in the U.S. The company is also highly liquid with current and quick ratios of 2.4 and 1.8, respectively, and those numbers have been largely the same going back ten years - never exceeding one for either metric. On the valuation side, it seems investors are not paying much for Stepan's future growth as its 5-year PEG is currently at 0.9. In comparison, competitors such as Huntsman Corporation (NYSE:HUN) and Koppers Holdings (NYSE:KOP) trade at PEG multiples of 1.5 and 2.4, respectively.Stepan has had a marvelous 2015 with its stock appreciating 35% during the year. Over the next couple of months, however, there is likely not upside to that scale as the word gets out about the company's improving operations and return metrics. The shaving of positions by hedge funds is likely a sign of this. In the long-term, however, Stepan should be a great holding as companies that can generate returns on equity and capital to the degree that Stepan is doing right now will likely outperform over that time horizon. Negative impacts from a strong dollar will likely mitigate over the long-term as well. Thus, Stepan is more of a long-term play at its current price and investors should not expect big jumps in the stock's price in the interim."
4034313,102114,2017-01-04T14:19:16-05:00,"Chemical company that is focused on development and production of surfactants, polymers, and specialty products.Net operating income has grown by 17.7% in the first nine months of 2016.Payout ratio of 18.9%.","As many of my followers know, real estate investment trusts (REITs) tend to be my primary area of focus, but I have decided to change gears for a while. My goal going forward is to identify companies that would be excellent additions to the most conservative income investor's portfolio. I expect that some of my picks will be controversial, but my plan is to show yield-chasers why choosing a stock that pays a lower-than-expected dividend can make sense, and why income investors need to think about the long term gain and review corporate financials. The first company I am going to review is Stepan Co. (NYSE:SCL).Stepan Co. OverviewI want to set the tone early on about SCL, because it is one of the most consistent dividend-paying companies you can buy (one of 27 companies with a 48+ year annual dividend increase track record), but most people (including myself) have never heard the name. SCL is a chemical company that specializes in surfactants, polymers, and other specialty products (more explanation on these product lines to come). SCL been in business for over 82 years and has been paying a growing dividend since 1968 (49 consecutive years of growth) and has executed five 2-for-1 stock splits since 1972.According to SCL's corporate profile, they claim that their competitive advantage comes from the fact that it does not have ""competitors to precisely match its businesses because its products have a specific focus.""Worldwide ReachSCL has 18 plants in total spread throughout 12 countries. Through geographic diversification, SCL is able to maintain and expand operations in North America, South America, China, Philippines, and Europe.Product LinesTo better understand the company's product lines, I decided to do a little research online in tandem with the company overview to better explain what each product line means to SCL.Surfactants - According to the Essential Chemical Industry, ""Surfactants are one of many different compounds that make up a detergent. They are added to remove dirt from skin, clothes and household articles particularly in kitchens and bathrooms. They are also used extensively in industry."" In addition to surfactants, SCL produces germicidal quaternary compounds which are essential for killing germs, mold, and mildew. The following lists give you an idea of what types products are dependent on surfactants:Consumer ProductsIndustrial ProductsPolymers - According to the Essential Chemical Industry, polymers are formed by many molecules of a simple compound joining together. The primary category of polymers made in large bulk, but more recently three new types of polymer categories are:The following is a breakdown of SCL's polymer product line offering and common uses for those polymers.1. Phthalic Anhydride2. Polyurethane Polyols3. Polyurethane SystemsSpecialty Products - SCL's specialty products focus primarily on consumer applications that include natural flavors for the beverage industry and esters for the food and pharmaceutical industry, according to SCL's corporate profile.Many of the products that SCL develops compounds for are common household goods that are more resistant to recession and financial disturbances. I see this as a competitive advantage for SCL.Capitalizing Higher-Margin ProductsSeveral product lines have seen flat sales over the last half decade, but other areas have seen tremendous growth, primarily in polymers. The following graph demonstrates the significance of polymers to SCL's rapidly growing revenues.Source: September's Investor Presentation - KeyBanc Basic Materials & Packaging ConferenceBased on this graph we can see that the greatest opportunity for growth appears to be in polymers. In many ways, this makes perfect sense, because polymers improve the efficiency of nearly every industry from construction to healthcare. In the KeyBanc Investor Presentation, SCL noted that polymers sales were almost flat, but the operating income from the polymer segment was $2.5 million for the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the first nine months of 2015. This increased income is approximately a 10% year-over-year increase. It is also worth noting that a new specialty polyol reactor in Poland began production in Q4-2016.The benefit polymers add to the SCL product line can be seen in the most recent revenue and operating income section of the Q3-2016 10-Q Filing.If we only reviewed SCL's revenues, we would be looking at a very lackluster year of growth for the company. We could also assume that the company is overwhelmingly dependent on surfactants, but when we review the operating income statement we can see a very different story. SCL has made tremendous efficiency improvements that have improved the profitability of all three segments, but most significantly for polymers and specialty products.In SCL's case, operating income provides clarity as to why their company is such a powerhouse for shareholder returns. Even with revenue almost completely stagnant, operating income grew over 17.7% year-over-year. The same trend is true for the specialty products, as this product line is close to doubling the operating income in the first nine months of the year.Operating Income EfficiencyI have prepared the following table to put this in a different perspective that better represents how significant these improvements really are. (Remember, this chart is covering the first nine months of 2015 and 2016 sales/operating income).This table tells me that SCL is doubling down on efficiency, because the improvement in contribution margin clearly demonstrates a company that is improving processes and focusing on getting the most bang for the buck.Dividend HistoryBy now I am sure that many readers are wondering why I am so excited about a company that has a current dividend yield of 1.01%, but I encourage you to think about the following items:While an investment in SCL will only yield 1.01% at today's levels, investors' need to be considerate of the regular dividend increases and the potential for stock splits in the future. A payout ratio of just 18.9% is one of the lowest I could find.Here are some comparable chemical company payout ratios according to dividend.com (these are not necessarily direct competitors):Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW)- 50.5%Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) - 30.3%SCL has the safest and most consistent dividend I could find in the chemical industrial arena.Bottom LineWhile I am not suggesting this company is right for a large stock position, I would contend that a small one should be considered, especially for those who have several years before needing the income. Establishing a portfolio of good yield-on-cost companies will be what sets a portfolio apart when the income becomes necessary in retirement. Although revenue growth was minimal, we are seeing a company that grew operating income at 17.7% year-over-year (first nine months comparison, 2015-2016), so locking it in with time on your side should result in above average gains).Final Note: If you enjoy my articles please take the time to follow me.

4073277,102758,2017-05-15T11:40:36-04:00,"Stepan Company is, in my opinion, underfollowed and trades in extremely low volume.The company carries a fair valuation and has posted some excellent growth.Stepan has also increased its dividend for 49 years straight (wow).","ThesisStepan Company (NYSE:SCL) has a lot going for it. The company has displayed a solid history of growth and has increased its dividend for forty-nine years straight. I believe that Stepan Company remains a good opportunity going forward. If you are looking to add a mid cap stock to your portfolio, Stepan may fit the bill.About The CompanyStepan Company produces and sells specialty and intermediate chemicals for use in various end products globally. The company operates in three segments: surfactants, polymers, and specialty products.Surfactants are used as ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products. This includes detergents used to clean clothes, dishes, and floors, as well as shampoo and body wash. Surfactants represents 67% of sales for the company and about 48% of net income. It is the largest segment.The polymers segment makes up 28% of sales and a whopping 47% of net income. It provides polyurethane polyols that are used to manufacture rigid foam for thermal insulation in the construction industry. Other resins from this segment are used in construction materials and components of other consumer products.Specialty products is the smallest segment. It makes up 5% of sales and 5% of net income. Offerings from this segment include flavors, emulsifiers, and solubilizers. These are used in the food, flavoring, nutritional supplement, and pharmaceutical industries.Stepan carries a market cap of $1.88B and would be considered mid cap. The company trades in extremely low volume with an average of 80,000 shares per day. It is important to note that almost 13% of stock is held by insiders. The company was founded in 1932 by the Stepan family and two of the largest insiders are members of the Stepan family. The Stepan Company Profile is shown in Figures 1 and 2.Figure 1: Stepan Company ProfileFigure 2: Stepan Company Profile Pt. IISource: Stepan Company Great Lakes PresentationWhat I LikeI believe Stepan has significant growth at a reasonable price. Current P/E is 21 and Forward P/E is an even more impressive 16. PEG comes in at 1.2 for the company which does bake in some growth. Valuation metrics are shown in Figure 3. You can see that Stepan carries a more attractive valuation than the average materials company.Figure 3: Stepan Company Valuation MetricsSource: Simply Wall StStepan has displayed a very strong history of growth. In Figures 1 and 2 you can see that the CAGR of adj. net income over 10 years is 22%. In the last three years adj. net income has increased over 70%. Analysts predict earnings will increase 18% next year. This is the growth that I believe more than justifies the company's valuation.The company's performance metrics are also fairly good. Return on equity is 14.2% which is just under the materials industry average. Return on assets is 6.7% and exceeds industry average. Return on capital is 12% and is way ahead of the competition. Performance metrics are shown in Figure 4.Figure 4: Stepan Company Performance MetricsSource: Simply Wall StI believe the amount of debt Stepan has is very manageable. Current debt/equity is 47%. The company has almost $200M in cash and only $316M in debt. Both operating and levered free cash flow are very strong. It is worth noting that the company pays a dividend as well. Current yield is just under 1%, however, Stepan has increased its dividend every year for the past forty nine years. The payout ratio is only 20% meaning the dividend is safe and has room to grow.Opportunities And DriversWhat I like most about Stepan is that 60% of annual net sales are tied to non-cyclical markets. This provides a stable baseline of revenue and is a major driver of long term success.The company identifies the construction market, oilfield chemicals, and agricultural markets as growth opportunities. However, the one I would like to expand on is agricultural chemicals. The combination of rapid population growth and greater protein demand will result in increased yield from crops. Agricultural chemicals will be part of the solution. This is perhaps the largest opportunity for the surfactants segment, in my opinion.The polymers segment has identified CASE expansion as a growth opportunity. CASE stands for coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers. The growth is expected to come from increased use in vehicle production.The company has made cost reduction and asset utilization a major priority. In 2016, it saw $15M of benefits through efficiency. Stepan has also invested in growth. The company has opened two new R&D laboratories, one in China and one in Texas. It has made accretive acquisitions as well.RisksAll investments have risks. The fact that 60% of sales are non-cyclical reduces a whole lot of risk for Stepan. Stepan does operate in a highly competitive market. The company depends on raw materials and commodities which can be volatile at times. Customer reformulations may decrease demand for Stepan's products. The company does have some debt, although I believe it to be manageable.Reading through the company's 10-K I really couldn't find anything that jumped out at me. I suppose it is worth mentioning that the company is still run by the family that started it. It is up to you to determine if this is a risk or a good thing. I would highly recommend checking out the 10-K on your own before deciding to invest in Stepan.Final ThoughtsThere is a whole lot to like about Stepan Company. I believe they are an excellent example of growth at a reasonable price. I see the company as safe due to the non-cyclical nature of their sales. I also see opportunity for them to continue growing. Stepan also has an impressive history of increasing dividends. If you are looking for a safe, unknown mid cap, consider Stepan Company."

Some of these chemicals are used in making rigid foams for thermal insulation. In the specialty segment, Stepan Company makes various specialty chemicals to meet individual customer needs. Some of the examples of specialty products include flavors, emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries.Stepan Company operates a total 17 ISO 9001:2000 certified manufacturing plants in 12 countries throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia.Analysis of Q3 2015 Financial Results Figure 1: Stepan Company's Q3 2015 Revenue Declined by 9.65% Compared to Q3 2014On October 21, 2015, Stepan Company released its Q3 2015 financial results. In our list of concerns, the first item was the revenue. Stepan Company's revenue has had some major swings since 2011. But, the quarterly revenue mostly fluctuated between $425 million to $500 million. In Q3 2015, it came out at $444.01 million, representing a 9.65% decline compared to the same quarter last year.Figure 2: Stepan Company Q3 2015 EPS Came Out at $1.09, Highest in the Last Five YearsAlong with the revenue, Stepan Company's EBITDA has also gone down to $38.79 million. However, as the operating expenses continued to go down over the last few quarters, quarterly earnings per share (EPS) has gone up to $1.09, which is the highest in the last five years.Although the revenue and EBITDA have slightly gone down compared to Q2 2015, on a Year-to-Date (YTD) basis, revenue is still up around 56.67%, which is still pretty good.As the EPS growth came despite a drop in revenue, it indicates an improvement in internal efficiency of the company, which is a more important factor for an 83 year old company compared to a 2 year old startup.As a result of this improved efficiency, Stepan Company's Q3 2015 return on equity (ROI) has jumped to 18.04%. Compared to the Q3 2014 ROE of 9.29%, that is an 8.75 percentage point improvement within a year.Figure 3: Stepan Company's ROE (TTM) Has Finally Started to Go Up after Declining for Four YearsThe latest improvement in the internal efficiency in the company has helped it to finally reverse its declining ROE (TTM) trend as well, which has been the name of the game for last four years.Revenue Growth Undermined by ""Other"" FactorsOf course, full credit goes to the management for improving the asset utilization of the company that helped drive its growth in North American market in the last year or so. Two of its main product lines, Surfactant and Polymer contributed to increasing operating income, 96% and 35% respectively.Stepan Company saw improved sales performance in Latin America and Europe. However, the strong valuation of the Dollar against the Euro over the last quarter was one of the main reasons its revenue growth came out much lower on the books. Otherwise the revenue would have been much higher because of its growth in the international markets.Moreover, effective tax rate has gone up to 28% compared to 27% during the last year, explained the VP and CFO of Stepan Company, Scott Beamer, during the earnings call.ConclusionAlthough the revenue has been declining, according to Cube Capital, Stepan Company's revenue has been significantly higher compared to the peer median, which is the median revenue of its closest competitors. Moreover, its earnings history also indicates a higher level of earnings compared to the same group of competitors in the industry it operates in.The highest quarterly EPS in the last five years has encouraged Stepan Company Board of Directors to declare a $0.19 per share quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock, which is a 5.6% increase.Global Hunter Securities currently have a $56 price target for Stepan Company's common stocks. As of writing this analysis, it still offers investors a 6.5% upside potential based on the October 23, 2015, closing price of $52.59 per share.We must remember that Stepan Company's products are mostly commodities and they hardly sell any differentiated products. Which magnifies the significance of these improved, but basic financial metrics, which the management delivered despite a drop in top line growth over the last 12-month period. We believe the upside potential of this company is much higher than the price target(s) set by some of the mainstream equity research firms."

This would be its 48th year of dividend growth.The company has grown dividends at about 9% over the last 5 years, but has dramatically underperformed the market in that time.","About Stepan CompanyStepan Company (NYSE:SCL) produces specialty and intermediate chemicals that are used in a variety of end products. Stepan Company products are used in the manufacture of toothpaste, soap and detergent, and in the production of shale oil and oil sands. The company is headquartered in Illinois and employs over 2,000 people worldwide.Stepan Company has three reportable business segments: Surfactants, Polymers, and Specialty Products.The term surfactant is a contraction of ""surface active agent."" Surfactants are chemicals that affect how two liquids or a liquid and a solid interact; for example, they enable water to remove soil from another surface. The Surfactants segment produces these chemicals, which are a basic cleaning agent in detergent, shampoo, soap, toothpaste, and cosmetics. Stepan also sells surfactants to end users in the enhanced oil recovery markets. This business segment produced 67% of total company sales in 2014 and 46% of total company operating income. The bulk (61%) of the segments sales were in the North American market, with another 22% in the European market.Polymers are large chemicals composed of repeating smaller molecules. They are used to manufacture rigid foam for thermal insulation in the construction industry, and as a raw material base for coatings, adhesives and sealants. They are also used in the manufacture of appliances. The Polymer segment provided 29% of total company sales and 46% of total company operating income.Finally, the Specialty Products segment produces chemicals used in food products and pharmaceutical applications. This segment provided the remaining 4% of total company sales and 8% of operating income.The Specialty Products segment includes the operations of the Maywood, New Jersey manufacturing plant, which was acquired by Stepan when it purchased the Maywood Company in 1959. This facility has the distinction of being the only legal importer of coca leaves in the United States. This facility extracts cocaine from the coca leaves and sells the cocaine-free extract to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for use in their eponymous product. The extracted cocaine is sold to Mallinckrodt Inc. (NYSE:MNK), a St. Louis-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, which purifies it into cocaine hydrochloride. Mallinckrodt is the only company in the United States licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal purposes. Eye and ear, nose and throat specialists use the cocaine hydrochloride as a local topical anesthetic.In 2014, Stepan Company had net sales of $1.97 billion, which was up 2.5% from 2013's sales. Net income was $57.1 million, a drop of nearly 22%. Net income per share was also down 22% to $2.49. Given the annualized dividend of 72 cents, Stepan has a current payout ratio of 29%.Several factors contributed to the drop in net income in 2014. The cost of raw materials - which are mainly petroleum and plant-based - increased, primarily for the Surfactants segment, and the bankruptcy of a major Polymer customer increased selling expenses. The effects of a strong dollar also reduced pre-tax income by 1.2%. A bright note is that the company was able to increase prices, which offset the decline in the sales numbers.In the 1st quarter of 2015, Stepan reported that adjusted net income was up 59% to 90 cents per share. The bulk of this came from an 84% increase in the Surfactants segment operating income. Net sales were down 4%, mainly due to currency effects from a strengthening dollar. In a recent investor presentation, the company expects to see future growth for the Surfactants segment from expansion in the energy sector and for the Polymers segment from tighter energy efficiency requirements in China.The company has an active share buyback program. Back in February 2013, the Stepan board authorized the repurchase of 1 million shares of stock. As of the end of 2014, nearly 804,000 shares remained on the authorization. This represents 3.6% of the 22.3 million outstanding shares.The company is a member of the S&P Small Cap 600 and Russell 2000 indices and trades under the ticker symbol SCL.Stepan Company's Dividend and Stock Split HistoryStepan Company has compounded dividends at nearly 9% since 2009 and nearly 6% since 2004.Stepan Company has increased dividends since 1968. The company announces annual dividend increases in mid-October; the stock goes ex-dividend at the end of November. In October 2014, Stepan announced a 5.9% increase in the dividend to an annualized rate of 72 cents per share. I expect Stepan to announce its 48th annual dividend increase in October 2015.Stepan has a history of modest dividend increases, usually in the high single digit percentages. From 2009-2014, the company compounded the dividend at 8.92% a year. The growth rate over longer periods is lower; for the 10 years ending in 2014, the growth rate is 5.97%. For the 20 and 25 years ending in 2014, the growth rate is 5.85% and 6.44%, respectively.Stepan Company has split its stock 5 times, each time 2-for-1. The most recent stock split was in November 2012. Prior to that, Stepan split its stock in December 1994, December 1988, December 1981, and September 1972. Had you owned a single share of Stepan Company stock through all 5 stock splits, you'd now have 32 shares.Over the 5 years ending on December 31, 2014, Stepan Company stock appreciated at an annualized rate of 5.87%, from a split-adjusted $29.89 to $39.76. This dramatically underperformed the 13.0% compounded return of the S&P 500 index, the 15.9% annualized return of the S&P Small Cap 600 index and the 14.0% compounded return of the Russell 2000 Small Cap index over the same period.Stepan Company's Direct Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment PlansStepan Company does not have a direct purchase or dividend reinvestment plan. In order to invest in the company's stock, you'll need to purchase it through a broker; most will allow you to reinvest dividends without any fee.

But, I use it exactly for the reason stated by Buffett - as the growth value component of the equation.Intrinsic value = growth + tangible assetsInstead of locking myself into a zero growth valuation and getting tunnel vision, a growth based valuation is also required to get a much clearer view of the company and its future.For no growth, I could easily get it from my EPV calculations which have zero growth value in the final number.Yes. Growth is difficult to predict.Ask all the AAPL analysts. 100% of them failed to get the latest quarter estimates correct.But, by zooming out and using different views, it gets easier to estimate the growth for valuation.It's why I advocate getting to know multiple valuation methods, so, that you can use the best stock valuation method for that particular situation.See here for a deeper discussion on the true way to use the Graham Formula and Graham Number.Precautionary point:Arrow Electronics (NYSE:ARW)I used to work in the same office park as Arrow Electronics and never looked into what they did.Based on this performance chart, investment opportunities can be right under your nose.ARW vs. Peers vs. S&PBut moving on...Looking over their catalog, the company sells electrical components like diodes, amplifiers and all the little stuff that go into electronic products.Engineering services are also offered, as well as IT and computing solutions which came along with an acquisition in 2013 of ComputerLinks.The Main NumbersWhat's to LikeThere's room to grow via acquisitions in fragmented and competitive industries.Arrow Electronics isn't the biggest name in the space, and so far, their acquisitions have been small. 3 small acquisitions were made in 2014 with cash and 4 in 2013.The company also has a TTM Piotroski score of 7 which is an improvement from the 5 it received in 2013.Return on Assets, Gross margins and asset turnover improved but quality of earnings fell.Quality of Earnings is determined by checking that cash from operations exceeds net income. If cash from operations is consistently below net income, it's a red flag.What's to DislikeThe obvious one is the competitive nature of the industry. Average net margins are thin at around 2.3% even after excluding 2008.Very Thin Margins | (Source: Old School Value)Although it's consistent, any one-time event could turn profitability upside down, just like 2008.And when you see a company with thin margins, it's not surprising that it doesn't have a moat.One quick way I verify this is, to check the Net Reproduction Cost of the business with its Earnings Power Value.EPV is Less than Reproduction Cost(For a more complete discussion on EPV and other valuation methods I use, get my valuation ebook via email.)The last piece that I don't like is the amount of working capital required as well as the inconsistent FCF.You can see how much working capital a business needs by going through the cash flow statement, but a quicker way that I've found is to get the FCF number and compare it with the Owner Earnings calculation.My version of owner earnings excludes changes in working capital, so it's easy to identify a company that needs a lot.Here's what I mean.FCF vs. Owner Earnings Easily Shows Working Capital RequirementsThose are some big differences.And the message I get when I see this is that,Off my hunch on the third point above, it looks like the debt to equity is 52%. There isn't any financial difficulty as it's all long-term debt with a good current ratio, but this is something to consider with the business.Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL)Stepan is a manufacturer of specialty and intermediate chemicals used in a variety of applications and industries.It ranges from cleaning and washing chemicals (detergents, shampoo, fabric softeners), to paints, cosmetics, food and a whole lot more.According to Stepan, the company says that it isBut, the company has 3 reportable segmentsThe Graham NumbersWhat's to LikeConsistent dividend payer with a decent balance sheet to counter the weak efficiency and margins.The price has come down quite a bit from its 52-week high of $66 and there is a fair amount of pessimism. There are certainly headwinds going forward and management has grand plans which will require several years before results will be reflected.There was a tiny bit of insider buying at $52 and $43. Insider buying signals only one thing.That the insider thinks the stock price is cheap. But with a high intrinsic value of $45, I wouldn't want to buy above $33 anyways.What's to DislikeHere's one of the reasons why I don't like to buy anything straight from a screen.In a single year of holding the company according to the rules, the stock may do well, but as a long-term hold, it's not a keeper.There are clearly more negatives here than positives.Starting from the top, sales are slowing, gross margins are decreasing, and net margins are still thin.These declines are easily seen in the ratios that I follow.Declining Important Ratios The total debt to equity ratio is 46% with 40% of it made up of long-term debt. However, management has expressed that they want to leverage the balance sheet further to increase capex and expand more overseas.This is just one of the slides from their presentation which I find to have a lot of optimism.Stepan's Balance Sheet Leverage PlanThe Andersons (NASDAQ:ANDE)The company has been around for over 70 years which started out as a single grain company and is now a diversified agricultural company.It's been punished since early September when it was trading at its historical peak of around $70. With the stock down about 30%, let's see why it shows up on the Graham formula screen.They have 6 operations which has helped them grow nicely over the past decade:Here's a nice image from their website with more details about each group.The 6 Groups of The AndersonsThe Main NumbersWhat's to LikeAgriculture and grain will always be needed. The majority of revenues comes from the grain group and makes up 65% of sales.Ethanol is a distant second at 15%, plant nutrients at 12%, rail at 3%, turf and specialty at 2.5% and retail at 2.5%.The median EPS CAGR over the past 5 years is actually 24.1% compared to 15.6% over the past 10 years.These are fantastic numbers, but not to be relied on as the big EPS jump in 2010 were thanks to acquisitions. Despite this, at 8% growth, where analysts are expecting 11.2% growth, the current price is in attractive territory.It's hard to get high ratios for commodity businesses, but the numbers look good for the business it's in.Near 5-Year LowsWhat's to DislikeTo invest in The Andersons, you have to have a good understanding of 6 industries. Somewhat similar, but still different.Outside of rails and retail, it's also a commodity business which is reflected in low margins. But the consistency and ability to generate an ROE above 10% is impressive.Unless you are confident in your ability to understand the futures market (particularly grain, ethanol and oil), The Andersons is a tough one to figure out an entry price.I wouldn't go as far as to say that The Andersons is a value destroyer, but Greenwald's EPV model certainly doesn't like the business.The Andersons = No MoatSumming UpThat's three stocks I picked out from the screen, but when looking deeper, they are not companies I would jump at the opportunity to buy.From a valuation stand point, The Andersons is the best pick, but with a complex and commodity business, I'd rather pass for now.I'll continue to see whether I can get some better picks from the other value screens and let you know.Read more: http://www.oldschoolvalue.com/blog/ideas/3-graham-formula-growth-value/#ixzz3Qgc6ynVS"
2669005,63893,2014-11-12T07:10:00-05:00,"Stepan Company's latest operating results support my previous investment thesis and concerns regarding the company's lack of a sustainable competitive advantage.Though the company looks to move away from highly commoditized consumer applications for its surfactant products towards higher margin activities, it will take time for this change to occur.In the meantime, weakness in target markets and the company's vulnerability to commodity tradewinds weigh upon operating results and increase near-to-intermediate term uncertainty.Though the company should be able to produce high single to low double digit total returns, I view shares as at best fairly valued, with a high degree of uncertainty.","Stepan Company's (NYSE:SCL) latest operating results confirm my view that the company lacks a significant bargaining position or economic moat, and that near-term macroeconomic headwinds are making it difficult for the company to make any headway even as it positions itself for better opportunities ahead. Though little has changed to suggest that the company's prospects for applied surfactant sales are materially different in the long term, conditions and performance were both marginally worse than I had expected, and I am lowering my fair value estimate for the shares. Though the stock currently trades with a mild margin of safety at present, I would urge caution and demand a greater discount to my fair value estimate, given the significant near-term risk of continued operating deleverage.Operating Results:Revenues for the quarter were generally flat (up a mere 3.4% year-to-year and 4.7% year-to-date), with growth for the quarter about 200 BPS below historical norms. Adding to the company's woes, operating and net margins both declined to the tune of over 200 and 150 BPS, respectively, as the company's inability to demand higher prices for what amounts to a highly commoditized feed product is readily shown in an adverse macroeconomic environment. Sales costs rose 7%, linked in part to the company's contractual obligations to link prices to raw material costs.Results on a segment-by-segment basis were somewhat heterogeneous. Surfactant sales were flat on the back of lower volumes but positive sales mix. Sales mix continued to follow established trends, with conventional consumer products declining and functional applications climbing, though overall volumes were down 8%. Conventional product sales struggled in North American markets, as surfactant usage per laundry load continues to decline, based upon reformulations and production of surfactant by customers. Contributing to revenue growth difficulties was the company's exit from the biodiesel market, which no longer exhibits attractive margin opportunities as biodiesel subsidies expire. This revenue decline was only somewhat offset by an unexpected improvement in enhanced oil recovery (""EOR"") surfactant sales, even as weakness in oil prices continues. Also positively, sales of agricultural applications improved by about 6% worldwide. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Asia weakened after a difficult comp from last year, and flat to mildly positive elsewhere. Overall, the company's strategy to move away from consumer products and towards functional surfactant sales continues apace, but the prolonged weakness in conventional applications is making the job a whole lot harder than it would be otherwise.Also consistent with recent trends, sales volume in the company's Polymers segment grew a robust 8%, with revenues climbing a robust 11%. Higher energy efficiency mandates in North America and Europe helped push demand for insulation higher, and global polyol volumes (used in rigid insulation foam) were up 9% year-to-year. Volumes were positively influenced by the integration of the company's Georgia polyester resin facility (which added $800 thousand in net earnings), which was partially offset by weakness in European sales as the eurozone seems to be slipping back into recession.Turning to the balance sheet, Stepan remains in good shape. Book value, NCAV per share, and tangible book value all improved moderately year-to-year, and the company's current ratio remains strong. Improvements in book value came about with diminished total debt and an increase in working capital commensurate with selling price increases and expected with seasonality. The company guided to full-year capital expenditures of $100-$110 million, and plans to continue with its modest share repurchase program.Assessment and Outlook:Stepan's third-quarter operating results were within my expectations from a qualitative standpoint, though it's clear that even my bearish stance on commodity surfactant sales did not fully encapsulate the difficulties the company experienced this quarter. I am encouraged by the company's good progress in oilfield revenues, and the overall sales mix for the surfactant business supports my previous investment thesis.Looking ahead, management expects recent trends to continue for the near-to-intermediate future. CEO F. Quinn Stepan guided towards continued weakness in commodity surfactant volumes in North America, and suggested that functional sales growth would continue to show difficulty with higher oilfield volumes being offset by weakness in agricultural sales. Enhanced oil recovery (""EOR"") is expected by management to be an area of strength, though I would temper my view of this, should oil prices continue to exhibit prolonged weakness. Polymer growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter as per usual, and it remains to be seen if growing weakness in European markets will be enough to disrupt the growing business in North America and Asia.I remain cautiously optimistic on Stepan, but reiterate my view that the company lacks a viable economic moat, trading as it does in a highly commoditized industry, with little to differentiate its core products from its competitors. I view the company's strategy to move away from commoditized products into higher margin items as a positive one, but it is clear that this change will take some time to figure out, and continued weakness in revenue growth should probably be expected.Valuation:I am lowering my fair value estimate for Stepan shares from $52 to $46, with an uncertainty range of $36-$54. I take a statistically weighted average of the results of a discounted cash flow model ($44), earnings-based model ($36), and historical valuation model ($53) to achieve my result. For my discounted cash flow model, I assume consolidated revenue growth of 5.0-5.5% over the next 5 years, and EPS growth of 7-8% over the next 5 years (after a significant EPS contraction this year). I assume operating margins to improve by about 150 basis points to an average of 8-9% with improved product mix, but also assume that surfactant revenue growth in the interim will slow, as it will take time for the company to transition to higher margin activities like oilfield and agricultural applications. The model yields an estimate of FY 2015 full-year EPS of $2.88 per share, not counting the effect of the company's modest buyback program. I continue to utilize a weighted average cost of capital of 10% to discount cash flows. Model data are reproduced below.My fair value estimate implies a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.6 times my estimate for 2014 earnings and a forward PE of 16.7 times 2014 earnings, as well as an EV/EBITDA ratio of 7 times. Both of these are lower than the industry average P/E ratio of 21.5 times and EV/EBITDA ratio of 7-9 times, which helps reflect the uncertainty I have regarding the company's near-to-intermediate term outlook. By comparison, larger competitors like Ecolab and Praxair, for example, attract higher P/E and EV/EBITDA ratios in the 20-30 times range and the 12-16 times range, respectively.Quantitative Analysis and Conclusion:Though I still envision Stepan as being able to generate high single digit to low double digit total returns, the company's lack of an economic moat, susceptibility to commodity tradewinds, and near-to-intermediate term risk as it transitions towards higher margin activities lead me to view shares with a bit of a jaundiced eye. I view my fair value estimate uncertainty as high, given the above mentioned factors, and as such would demand a larger margin of safety than what's on offer at present before committing any money to the name. I would consider the shares attractive in the $35-$38 range."
2511685,63893,2014-09-23T08:34:13-04:00,"Shares in Stepan Company, an intermediate chemical manufacturer, have taken a beating of late and are now trading just above 52-week lows. Is this an opportunity or a value trap?
        Long-term, Stepan is positioning itself to benefit from several macroeconomic trends, but short-term headwinds will likely weigh upon profitability and growth for the next year or two.
        Product commoditization, intense competition, and lack of a significant economic moat necessitate a higher margin of safety before I would commit new money to any shares.","One thing about this new hobby of mine-- that is to say, researching companies as potential investments-- is that I find it a lot more fun to look at companies that don't get a lot of coverage. For one thing, if one can find a ""diamond in the rough,"" so to speak, without a lot of analyst coverage, then one potentially can benefit by ""getting in early,"" before the broader market can appreciate the company's performance. For another, as a contributor, it's easier to find new things to say about those companies, rather than coming basically to the same conclusion that everybody else has about the same company (or, at least, falling on one side of the argument or the other).That said, not every company that comes out of this process is an unadulterated winner. Some under-covered companies indeed have competitive advantages that the broader market just doesn't appreciate yet; some of them are just starting to cash in on the early stages of wider macroeconomic trends. But there are still others that don't fit neatly into either of these categories, and despite the lack of analyst coverage, the market seems to have taken these factors into account. I think the latter is the case with a company I recently began to read about, Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL), which as of the market close on Friday looked to be trading just off its 52-week lows:SCL data by YChartsHaving experienced a ""death cross"" way back in mid-May, the stock price has been plummeting downward of late, now down some 31% from its peak March this year, and doesn't show any signs so far of establishing a level of support. And yet, the company has been consistently profitable over the past 10 years, and has been growing its dividend steadily, and sports an attractive PEG of 0.84.SCL Dividend data by YChartsUsually, when I see the combination of falling stock price with consistent profitability and dividend growth, I get excited about the possibility of market overreaction giving me the opportunity to buy a good company at a good price. But with Stepan, the bull case is a bit more complicated. As I'll explain below, Stepan may be a good company, but it isn't a great one (i.e., one with significant, sustainable competitive advantages), and while the selloff may have been overdone, Stepan does face some near-term headwinds. Here's a closer look at Stepan Company and why I think potential investors should let the market discount shares a bit further before jumping in.Company and Industry Overview:Stepan Company is a global producer of specialty and intermediate chemicals (which means it doesn't sell its products directly to consumers, but rather as either as intermediate inputs for consumer products or directly to institutional customers). Stepan occupies an intermediate position between feedstock suppliers and application producers, focusing on the chemical conversion of raw materials like palm kernel oil and petroleum products into complex molecules, through sulfonation, ethoxylation, and quaternization techniques. With its multiple product lines, the company maintains a diverse customer base, and no single customer generates more than 10% of consolidated revenues. The intermediate nature of its products leads the company to do most of its business on a spot delivery basis, which means that Stepan generally doesn't have a significant backlog-- earnings visibility is largely a matter of ""what you see is what you get.""The company is divided into 3 main segments, the first two of which generate the bulk of revenue and operating income (the third, Specialty Chemicals, produces a relatively negligible level of revenues and profits):Surfactants: This segment focuses on producing chemical agents that affect the interaction between 2 surfaces. The easiest way to visualize surfactants in ""the real world,"" so to speak, is simply soap-- and just as a soapy surface is often the slipperiest, so do surfactants reduce friction between surfaces.For those most of us who can't remember high school chemistry, most surfactants, at the molecular level, are the combination of a hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-fearing) structures. When in the presence of two different liquid media, This functionality has a surprising cornucopia of commercial applications besides getting your clothes clean (though surfactants will do that too). In addition to simple detergency, surfactants are utilized as lubricants, biocidal disinfectants, in emulsification (getting 2 unlike liquids to mix together), demulsification, and to modify the viscosity of various liquids (more on this later). As you would probably guess, surfactants are found in consumer products like shampoos, body wash, conditioners, fabric softeners, toothpastes, and so forth, but industrial applications vary from simple emulsion polymers (like floor polish) to being used to help enhance yields from oil reservoirs.In 2013, Stepan's Surfactants segment accounted for 70% consolidated net sales, gaining 1% year-over-year, with the majority of the gain coming from increased sales in Asia and South America (sales in Europe and the US were flat to slightly negative). Surfactant operating income accounted for 65% of the company total, but were down 15.5% year-over-year. Though net sales were higher by 11% year-over-year, driven mostly by agricultural, biodiesel, and consumer applications, operating income declined on the back of adverse product mix, increased operating and administrative expenses, and higher maintenance and depreciation costs. Input costs (related to the raw cost of petroleum and plant-based inputs required) decreased, but this decrease in raw inputs was passed on as decreased sales prices, resulting in no significant change in margins.Polymers: This segment has 2 primary product lines-- polyols and Phtalic anhydride products. Polyols form the basis for rigid foam, which is often utilized as thermal insulation in construction projects, as well as the raw material for coatings, adhesives, sealents, and elastomers (which the company refers to collectively as ""CASE"" applications). Phtalic anhydride products include polyester resins and plastizers, which in turn are utilized in other construction materials, boating, automotive, and other consumer products.In 2013, Polymers accounted for about 26% consolidated net sales, increasing 14% year-over-year from 2012. Improved sales came as the result of higher sales volume in combination with higher selling prices and favorable foreign exchange effects. Segment operating income accounted for approximately 35% of total operating income, improving by about 13 percent year-over-year based largely on improved sales volume.Industry Overview: Stepan operates in a huge and fragmented marketplace. Though the company claims on its website to have no specific competitor that matches its particular focus, it actually competes against hundreds of industrial concerns for a surfactant market reaching over $30 billion in total revenues. The market for surfactants is expected by analysts to grow to about $40 billion by 2019 (which implies a 4-5% CAGR over this timeframe). And though the company's polymer products contribute only a small minority of total revenues and profits, there, the company again competes against hundreds of chemical companies for a share of a $450 billion market, which analysts project to grow at a 3.8% CAGR for the remainder of the decade. In comparison to these, Stepan's $1.9 billion revenue take looks relatively paltry, but this reflects largely on the incredibly fragmented nature of both industries.The commoditization and lack of differentiation between the products made by chemical converters like Stepan means that companies must compete with each other on the basis of operating efficiency, such as competent management of supply chains, management of input costs, and proximity to growing markets. In both the surfactant and polymer production industries, geographic positioning of manufacturing assets in close proximity to low-cost feedstock is critical to maintaining a competitive advantage. For polymers, this has meant (n recent years) a shift in production areas to areas with low cost raw material like the Middle East and SE Asia. With that, the industry has seen a gradual shift in the global trade balance away from Western countries acting as the main suppliers of polyethylene and polypropylene products. For surfactants, the boom of shale gas has been a significant contribution to decreased production costs, which has led to increased production focus in North America and Asia (the latter of which controls the majority of worldwide palm kernel oil production).Stepan has done its best to cope with this change, building out new facilities in Asia and in South America, to take advantage of both low input costs as well as proximity to growing markets. The company continues to invest in new plants in Brazil, having already built up neutralization capacity there with a previous plant, and-- having built a Methyl-ester plant in Singapore to take advantage of its proximity to biorenewable feedstocks (read: probably palm kernel oil), it plans on building out additional capacity in China. (It should be noted that the company's previous facility in China was summarily closed by the Chinese government).Investment Thesis and Company Performance:Stepan Should Benefit from Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Though Stepan can't claim to benefit from efficient scale in comparison to its competitors, given its size, even if the company runs in place with regard to overall market share, it should benefit from macro growth trends over the next decade or more. The company's core surfactant consumer products business (soap, laundry detergent) is both slow and predictable, making it relatively ""recession proof""-- but even this should benefit with an expanding worldwide middle class, as more people start using liquid detergents and other household cleaners that utilize a higher concentration of surfactants.Moreover, Stepan, like its competitors, has sought new applications for surfactant technology in seemingly unrelated industries. The company favors functional surfactant sales for their higher margins, and over the past few years has grown these at a double-digit pace.One of these functional areas is the agricultural industry, which uses special surfactants to aid spraying of herbicidal and pesticidal products. As I've mentioned elsewhere, a growing world population with a growing taste for protein, combined with an inherently limited amount of agrable land, will drive the need for ever higher crop yields in the coming years. With all of these factors in mind, the company's move into Brazil-- with its rapidly expanding middle class and national status as a burgeoning exporter of grains and other crops to the rest of the world-- makes a lot of sense.That's not to say that surfactants don't see use here in North America. The growth of alternative techniques to extract oil and the increasing difficulty of squeezing every last drop from existing reservoirs has led oil E&P companies to examine surfactants and polymers as a way to help push oil out of the ground. Though carbon dioxide still remains by far the most common method of enhanced oil recovery (""EOR""), surfactant-polymer injection has grown somewhat in popularity in recent years, and the continued expansion of EOR as a percentage of overall oil production suggests that there's still room for growth.Source: chemanager-online. Percent of revenue by chemical flooding type in EOR chemicals market in the United States.Stepan's long-term strategy for its polymers segment hinges on an intermediate length macro tailwind: China's growing middle class and need for energy efficiency. With both Chinese regulatory concerns and a national focus on improving energy efficiency, Chinese demand for insulation materials is projected to grow 9.4% per annum through 2016 to $10.6 billion in total sales. Foamed plastics are expected to constitute about 80% of these sales as changes to building codes take hold. Stepan already is trying to position itself to take advantage of these trends by building out infrastructure in China, though a 2013 shutdown of its original facility mandated by the Chinese government has led to both significant delays and additional costs as the company scrambled to establish an interim supply chain.Multiple Caveats and Near-term Headwinds: But despite these long-term macroeconomic tailwinds, there are a few short- to intermediate term concerns. For one, both overall economic growth and housing and construction in particular are slowing in China, with falling housing prices and the strong possibility of an outright housing glut weighing against new construction. Though the longer-term outlook may be positive, the overall construction market in China appears uncertain in the short-term, and expansion into Asia will be fraught with some degree of risk.For another, the recent drop in oil prices bodes ill in the near-term for Stepan's nascent EOR business:WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YChartsEOR is already expensive and logistically complex, and surfactant and polymer flooding techniques are themselves expensive and logistically complex EOR processes. Though polymer flooding is capable of recovering 8% of oil in place, for example, the process adds an incremental cost $8-16 per barrel, and the large volumes of polymer required make the process logistically feasible for a minority of applications. Similar caveats apply for surfactant flooding. The additional costs associated with these techniques make them less economically viable in the face of reduced oil prices, and while EOR techniques will probably grow in the long-term, the industry in general looks to be under pressure in the short-term until prices recover, which will probably weigh on the profitability of the firm's efforts in this area.A similar dynamic looks to be at play with the company's agricultural surfactant products. As noted elsewhere, prices for agricultural commodities like corn, soy, and other grains have been under pressure from extraordinarily strong worldwide production, and that pressure may continue for at least another year or so. With other agricultural industrial firms seeing a decline in profitability due to these cyclical headwinds, it seems reasonable to expect similar difficulties for Stepan.It seems, then, that Stepan will need to rely upon its tried-and-true core markets-- consumer products and industrial products-- to maintain profitability while it waits for the cyclical headwinds in its higher-end, functional markets to abate. But even there, Stepan faces risks, and has seen actual declines in its core business over the past year which offset the gains in its Polymers segment.The company attributes this to decreased surfactant composition in North American laundry applications, due to a number of factors:Finally, the company can hardly argue to have a dominant position within either the surfactants or polymers market. As competition has heated up over the past couple years, the company's cash conversion cycle has worsened, revenue growth has slowed, and profit margins have been pressured, all suggestive of a lack of significant bargaining position.SCL Cash Conversion Cycle (Annual) data by YChartsThat the company is unable to leverage lower input costs into wider margins (an industry-wide dynamic, to be fair) suggests that the there are both limited switching costs or barriers to entry in its target markets that might lead to the development of a sustainable competitive advantage. This lack of a sustainable competitive advantage is demonstrated with the company's decline in economic profit over the past 5 years.SCL Return on Invested Capital (Annual) data by YChartsSource: self-produced. 10-Year financial data from Morningstar; S&P 500 price data from Yahoo!Finance, Long-term historical treasury rates from Treasury.gov.Most Recent Quarter Results: Many of these short-term concerns made their presence felt in the most recent quarterly earnings call. Operational earnings were flat year-over-year due to decreased surfactant sales volumes and higher costs in North America, offset in part by higher polymers income from organic volume growth. Agricultural surfactant demand came in lower than expected in North America and Brazil and overall surfactants ales volumes declined by about 8%. Though volumes did improve by 15% for polymers y/y, the lower contribution to operating income meant that operating income only increased by about 1% y/y, with EPS coming in only about 4-5% higher. For the remainder of the year, the company projected continued weakness in the North American surfactant business with improvements expected in Brazilian agricultural sales and EOR surfactant sales. EPS growth for the year is expected to be flat, weighed on by EPS decline in the first half of the year.All those short-term caveats aside, the company has otherwise been a steady performer, growing revenues and earnings at a strong and predictable rate, with revenues growing at about 6.5% per annum and EPS growing at a 18% CAGR over the past decade.Looking closely at the most recent years, though, this robust growth has slowed some, with revenue growth averaging about 2% over the past 3 years, and EPS growth essentially flat. Despite this lack of growth, the stock price has rocketed up anyway, and only recently (as mentioned above) has come back down to earth.SCL data by YChartsAll told, then, the outlook for the company looks bright in the long term, murky in the short-term. The company's steady growth over the past decade looks to have taken a step back, and while growth prospects should be aided by a number of macro trends, the short-term picture is being dimmed by a number of cyclical headwinds. Combined with the lack of a strong competitive advantage, enthusiasm for future growth must be tempered with a healthy dose of skepticism.Valuation: My fair value estimate for Stepan Company is $52 per share, with a moderate value of uncertainty (range $47-$55). I average the results of a discounted cash flow model, dividend and earnings growth model, and historical valuation model to arrive at my result. For my discounted cash flow model, I project slightly negative EPS for 2014 of $2.96, and 5-year revenue growth of 5.6% per annum as growth in functional markets starts to overtake slowdown in the company's consumer products applications. I project EPS to grow in line with revenues as continued competition in the company's target markets weighs on margin expansion. I expect capital expenditures to remain steady at around 4-5% of revenues as the company continues to build out its capacity in Asian and South America. I use a weighted average cost of capital of 10% to discount cash flows, and arrive at a FVE of $53 per share. Model data are reproduced below.For a historical valuation model, I apply historical price-to-earnings, price-to-book, and price-to-sales ratios of 17.3, 2.2, and 0.53 to analyst forward estimates to arrive at a FVE of $54. An earnings / dividend growth model generates a FVE of $49. My fair value estimate implies a forward P/E ratio of 17.6, relatively in line with historical averages, and slightly less than the industry average of 18.1.Quantitative Analysis and Conclusion:Long-term, I expect Stepan to be capable of mid-single digits total returns, which seems appropriate given the long-term prospects for growth of its core markets. Should the company be able to leverage additional growth in functional markets like EOR and agriculture, then double-digit total returns would be conceivable, but the lack of a sustainable competitive advantage, intense competition, and commoditization of its products make me hesitant to forecast that rosy of an outlook. Nevertheless, should to company merely stabilize revenue and earnings growth, it should be able to weather near-term headwinds to take advantage of some long-term opportunities. The degree of uncertainty that I have regarding this makes me want a larger margin of safety before committing any money to shares, and I would target a margin of safety of about 20-25% before accumulating any shares-- targeting an entry price of about $40-42."
1388681,40021,2013-05-01T07:47:08-04:00,,"In my continuous search for 'boring but beautiful' stocks, companies that remain relatively unknown by the majority of investors because they operate outside of popular/trendy industries, I have come across quite a few specialty chemical makers. Perhaps the reason is that no industry embodies the phrase 'boring but beautiful' better than the chemical/cleaning products segment. It is an industry that creates products meant to operate primarily behind the scenes and outside of the public's field of view. Most people don't want to know how medical equipment is sterilized or how the chemicals in their favorite laundry detergent operate; they merely want to know that the items are made clean and safe to use.So it's no surprise that I have turned up another hidden gem in the industry: Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL). Much like Balchem Corp. (NASDAQ:BCPC), the previous chemical designer/manufacturer that I researched, Stepan Co. is a relatively small company that has provided investors with large gains over the years through a rare mix of revenue/earnings per share growth and consistent dividend-growth. As such, Stepan is a great consideration for long-term investors seeking both market outperformance and steadily increasing dividends.The Company:Stepan Co. is a global manufacturer of basic and intermediate chemicals. Founded in 1932 by Alfred C. Stepan Jr. and headquartered in Northfield, Illinois, the company currently employs over 2,000 people and owns and operates 16 manufacturing plants, located in 12 countries throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia. The company's chemical offerings are broken down into three main segments:· Surfactants - As an essential ingredient in consumer/industrial cleaning compounds, the 'Surfactants' segment represents the majority of Stepan Co.'s business. Includes the sale of the company's anionic, cationic, nonionic and amphoteric surfactant product lines. Stepan Co. also creates custom surfactants based on the specific needs of customers.· Polymers - Includes the manufacture and sale of Polyester Polyols, which are used as coatings, adhesives and insulators in commercial construction, Polyurethane Systems, which includes products for commercial roofing as well as engineered specialty foams used in aerospace and defense markets and Phthalic Anhydride, used as a key ingredient for plasticizers.· Specialty Chemicals - Includes the production and distribution of naturally derived ingredients/oils used in the food, nutrition and pharmaceutical industries. Includes brands such as Clarinol, Marinol and PinnoThin.The Stock:In almost any comparable time period, SCL has outperformed all major indices by a wide margin. The following is a breakdown of the equity's performance compared to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the last decade:(Numbers from YCharts.com, as of 4/28/13, all with dividends reinvested)With a total shareholder return of over 600%, SCL easily bests the S&P 500's total return of 115.8% during the last decade. On a five-year basis, the stock's outperformance continues, as SCL's total shareholder return of 258.6% compares favorably to the S&P 500's total return of 26.57%. Even on a one-year total return basis, in which SCL is currently off 8.23% from its highs, the stock still significantly outperforms the S&P 500, up 30.96% versus the index's 15.32%.What's more impressive is that SCL has provided these robust returns while maintaining relative trading consistency. The following is a chart of SCL over the past five years (included are 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages as well as MACD and slow stochastic indicators):(Chart courtesy of Yahoo! Finance)First and foremost, SCL's chart is displaying an overall uptrend, which is indicative of a positive growth story. Since recovering from its 2009 lows, the stock has largely obeyed its major moving averages, only faltering significantly twice in 2010. Over the last year-and-a-half, SCL has traded exceptionally well, appropriately bouncing off of major moving average support. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows steady buying pressure and weak selling pressure, particularly since late 2011.Growth:For comparative purposes, I have chosen to include the growth rates of the aforementioned Balchem Corp., a company whose business mix and market capitalization match up well with that of Stepan Co. Additionally, I have included industry stalwart The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE:DOW) to give investors a better perspective on the kind of growth small cap chemical companies provide compared to their much larger peers.(Numbers from Yahoo! Finance, as of 4/28/13)Surprisingly, Stepan Co. is projected to underperform both its smaller peer Balchem and its larger peer The Dow Chemical Company in revenue and earnings per share growth for the next two years. Balchem is expected to grow revenue the fastest over the next two years, at 12.45% per year on average, and Dow Chemical is expected to grow EPS the fastest over the same two-year period, at 23.55% per year on average.Let's see how the relatively weak 2013-2014 projected revenue/EPS growth estimates for Stepan Co. compare to the company's historical growth rates. The following is a breakdown of SCL's revenue and earnings per share growth rates over the last seven years:(Numbers from MSN Money, as of 4/28/13)The seven-year results are interesting and indicate that management at Stepan Co. has traditionally done a better job at growing earnings per share than revenue and this is projected to be the case going forward until at least 2014. A positive is that projected earnings growth for 2013 and 2014, at 13.2% and 9.9% respectively, are above the company's earnings growth rates for the prior three years (abnormally large EPS growth in 2007-2009 distort the 7-Yr. average growth rate). However, the results also indicate that both revenue and EPS growth have been very sporadic, despite being positive overall.While volatile, the results are not too surprising considering the apparent patchiness of the chemical sector as a whole and the vast majority of the companies that operate in it. My previous analysis of Balchem revealed similar results on a seven-year historical basis. While not nearly as sporadic as that of Stepan Co., Balchem did experience frequent ebbs and flows in both its revenue and EPS growth rates, in a few instances going negative as SCL has in the past. Similarly, The Dow Chemical Company has experienced massive fluctuation with regards to the growth of its revenue and earnings per share.Fundamentals:(Numbers from Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, as of 4/28/13)Stepan and Balchem stand out as being very small compared to the massive chemical giant that is Dow Chemical. While not burdened with an excessive amount of debt, SCL's current debt load of $182.4 million is equal to 13.92% of the company's current market capitalization; Stepan Co. falls short in comparison to Balchem's total absence of debt. However, both smaller companies appear healthy when positioned next to Dow Chemical, whose debt is equal to just over 50% of its current market capitalization. Similarly, SCL's cash position, currently equal to 5.86% of the company's current market cap, is healthy but pales in comparison to Balchem's $144.74 million, equal to 11.48% of the company's market cap.On a revenue basis, Stepan Co. impresses as it is expected to generate $1.85 billion in sales for 2013, robust sales indeed for a $1.3 billion company that is still growing. For a company of similar size, Balchem is projected to generate just 18.44% of the revenue that Stepan is expected to generate in the same fiscal year.With regard to 'Return On Invested Capital,' the measure of a company's efficiency at generating return from capital investments, both Stepan and Balchem appear very healthy. Although Balchem leads Stepan in this metric as well, management at both companies have proven that they are dedicated to providing consistently high return off of capital, as both companies have a five-year average ROIC of above 10%. Dow Chemical falls short in this regard, with ROIC of just 2.2% and a meager five-year average of 3.1%.In terms of valuation, Stepan Co. is the cheapest out of all listed peers on a trailing twelve-month basis, with a P/E of 17.07. On a future twelve-month basis, Stepan appears cheap as well with a forward P/E of 12.45, behind only Dow Chemical's forward P/E of 11.52. However, when viewed historically, SCL appears slightly expensive on both a current and future basis, as it's five-year average P/E is just 11.06.Finally, SCL's dividend of $0.64 is equal to a yield of 1.1%, which is more than double BCPC's yield of 0.5%. Dow Chemical has the highest yield by far, currently at 3.8%. However, similar to Balchem, the more interesting aspect with regard to Stepan Co. is in the dividend-growth over the years.Dividend-Growth:(Numbers from Yahoo! Finance, Dividend-Stocks.com, as of 4/28/13)With regard to dividend increases, Stepan Co. is the very model of consistency. The company has increased its dividend every year for the last decade without falter. In fact, the history of dividend increases extends much further back; as SCL has managed consecutive yearly increases in dividends for the past 45 years! When there is so little to depend on in investing, extreme dedication to dividend increases, like Stepan has displayed for nearly half a century, is encouraging and should be a welcome comfort to investors.The dividend-growth rates are admirable but nowhere near the best levels that I've seen among the top echelon of dividend-growth stocks. A total dividend increase of 68.42% over the last decade is merely decent, especially compared to Balchem's 1,285% increase over the same time period.However, what is particularly interesting and most important is that dividend-growth has been accelerating over time. The ten-year average dividend-growth rate is at 4.7%, while the five-year average comes in at a more robust 7.1%. Even better still is the three-year average growth rate of 8.8%. To top it off, the last dividend increase, payable on 11/28/12, was at a robust 14.28% rate. Almost half of SCL's ten-year dividend growth rate percentage (33.33% to be exact) has happened in the last three years alone.By analyzing the annual yield over time, it is apparent that the stock's current yield of 1.10% is far off from normal levels, which indicates that stock appreciation has outpaced the company's dividend-growth rate, even at its more recent robust levels. This is to be expected, as the stock is up approximately 25% since November alone, which is when the most recent dividend increase was approved.The company's strong revenue/EPS growth has fueled rapid gains in shares of SCL over the past five years and has forced management to increase dividend-growth at higher levels. Unfortunately, the dividend increases have not been able to keep up with stock appreciation and the yield has declined over time. However, with revenue/EPS growth projected to slow for at least the next two years and management's dedication to raising dividends each year at more robust levels, it may be just a matter of time before SCL's yield is significantly closer to its historical highs.Growth Catalysts:Stepan's 'Surfactants' business segment, which accounts for approximately 70% of the company's net sales, was a laggard performer in 2012. Sales for the segment were down 4% last year due mainly to lower selling prices. Gross profit for the segment, however, was up 14% to $203.4 million due mainly to margin recovery. Despite lagging sales growth, management remains confident in its plan to evolve the 'Surfactants' business by improving the global product mix. Management's goal for 2013 is to increase distribution to key markets like agricultural/oil field as well as consumer/industrial cleaning. Although most likely modest, management at Stepan expects its largest business segment is ""positioned for earnings growth in 2013.""The company's 'Polymer' segment, which accounts for approximately 25% of Stepan's net sales, grew revenue 1% in 2012, volumes 3% on the addition of new adhesive applications and gross profit 17% to $71.9 million on a favorable sales mix. The segment is expected to grow in 2013 on the continued use of polyol as an energy saving insulator as well as the compound's newer applications in metal panels and cash products. However, results will most likely be restricted once again as the company battles ""higher costs of operating in China"" that ""may limit overall profit earnings growth in 2013.""Additionally, management is in the process of making improvements to operating efficiencies across the board, including an expected increase in the capacity of its polymer plant in China from 20,000 tons to possibly 50,000 tons. Management also stated that they are considering either expanding the company's production plant in Brazil or building an additional plant to improve Stepan's emerging market presence.Finally, after raising the dividend in the fourth quarter, management at Stepan also bought back 23,000 shares of its common stock, worth approximately $1.37 million at current pricing. Just in late February, the board approved a new share repurchase plan of up to 1 million shares of common stock.Q1 2013 Earnings Results:Stepan Co. recently reported first quarter earnings results on April 30 and the results were down from the comparable 2012-quarter. First quarter net income in 2013 dropped to $19.034 million ($0.83 per diluted share), down approximately 15% on a year-over-year basis from $22.302 million ($0.98 per diluted share) in 2012. Net revenue in the quarter dropped approximately 2% year-over-year to $456.5 million, down from $465.2 million in 2012.However, similar to the entirety of fiscal 2012, sales volumes in the first quarter grew, by approximately 3%. Management attributed the drop in net sales dollars to overall lower selling prices, which dropped approximately 5% in the quarter.The 'Surfactants' segment, which saw sales volume rise 5% and net sales drop 2% in the first quarter, is expected to experience improved margins throughout the year and should continue to benefit from strength in agricultural markets. The 'Polymers' segment, which saw sales volume decline 7% and net sales decline 1%, was hurt in the quarter by a particularly slow start to the construction season and weak demand in Europe.Additionally, management reiterated its plans to expand geographically and to improve the company's global sales mix, with a focus on ""higher value added products,"" according to President and CEO F. Quinn Stepan Jr. Management also highlighted strong growth in Brazil, driven by the company's large 'Surfactants' segment, and is planning ""additional investments to support Brazilian growth"" in the future.Finally, alongside earnings, the company also announced the acquisition of North American Polyester Resins from Bayer MaterialScience. The deal includes Bayer's production facility in Columbus, Georgia, which has 21,000 ton per year capability with room for additional expansion, as well as an advanced R&D laboratory. The business, which centers on CASE (Coating, Adhesives, Sealants, Elastomers) and PUSH (Polyurethane Systems House) polyol applications and generates annual sales of approximately $64 million, will expand Stepan's offerings in both areas and is expected to be ""accretive to 2013 earnings.""In summation, the lower-than-expected first quarter earnings results will make it difficult for Stepan Co. to deliver full-year earnings growth in 2013. However, CEO Stepan Jr. stated that management would continue to ""evaluate additional investments that can accelerate growth and deliver value to our shareholders.""Risks:As was mentioned prior, the main risk for Stepan Co. going forward is the rising cost of raw materials, which could negatively impact the earnings of company's two largest business segments, 'Surfactants' and 'Polymers.' Indeed, as was gathered from the most recent earnings report, management expects the rise in raw materials to limit the company's overall earnings growth for 2013-2014, possibly even stifle growth altogether.China will also be a particular area of concern for Stepan during the next two years, as the company has been forced to relocate its production plant by government mandate. Management has stated that the company will continue to provide its Asian customers with product from other Stepan production sites until the relocation is complete.Conclusion:Growth has definitely started to slow for Stepan Co. as of late. Fiscal 2012 was a mixed year for revenue and earnings per share growth for the company and projections for the next two years, although slightly better than 2012, are still well off the company's historical average rates. The company's most recent and disappointing first quarter results have only highlighted some of the serious headwinds the company faces with regard to future growth and presents management with a tough task in growing earnings for the full 2013 year. Since Stepan Co. is no longer growing revenue/EPS at the rates that it has in the past, it would be ideal to see valuation drop to levels that accurately reflect the growth challenges going forward, which would be a forward P/E ratio below the company's 5-year historical average of 11.06.However, the company has long excelled at maintaining a healthy balance sheet and providing investors with increasing dividends every year. It is hard to find many companies more consistent with regard to dividend increases than Stepan has been over the last four-and-a-half decades. Perhaps more importantly is that dividend-growth has been accelerating as of late and this appears to be a trend that will remain viable long into the future. As stock appreciation presumably slows over the course of 2013-2014, due to expected weakening in revenue/EPS growth, and dividend-growth accelerates I expect to see Stepan's yield increase and reach its more historical average rates in the coming years.I think Stepan Co. is best viewed in comparison to Balchem Corp. Both are high quality stocks that suit long-term investors looking for stock appreciation and dividend growth. Balchem is a nice consideration for investors looking for larger revenue/earnings per share/dividend growth but willing to accept higher valuation levels/lower yield. On the other hand, Stepan is a nice consideration for investors looking for slower growth at lower valuation levels and higher yield.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2524115,70315,2014-09-26T15:06:51-04:00,"Stepan Company is a specialty chemical company that sells chemicals used in detergents, resins, food and pharmaceuticals.Adverse working capital, inventory and increased capital expenditures contributed to a decline in free cash flow over the past five years.Stepan Company possesses long-term debt equating to less than 50% of stockholder’s equity.","It's important for long-term investors to develop a guide for doing their investment research. Over the years I have developed six questions to guide me in my thinking when researching the publicly traded universe. Today's let talk about Stepan Company (NYSE: SCL), a specialty chemicals company.1.) What does the company do?When you buy shares in a company you effectively become part owner of that company. Therefore, it's important for an investor to understand what a company sells. Specifically, Stepan Company operates in three lines of business according to its 10-K: ""surfactants, polymers and specialty products."" Surfactants represent chemical agents that serve the function of ""detergency"" or ""soil removal from another surface."" Surfactants are used in applications such as detergents, floor polishes and oil recovery. The company also sells polymers used in ""coatings, adhesives"" and ""sealants."" Stepan Company's specialty products unit is made up of chemicals used in flavoring, food and nutritional supplements in addition to pharmaceutical applications.2.) What do the fundamentals look like?Investors should also look for companies that grow revenue and free cash flow over the long-term and retain some of that cash for reinvestment back into the business and for economic hard times. Excellent revenue and free cash flow growth serve as catalysts for superior long-term gains. Over the past five years Stepan Company's revenue and net income grew 47% and 15%, respectively. However, its free cash flow declined 53% during that time (see chart below).SCL Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsA steady year-over-year growth in the company's polymers and specialty products segments over the past three years contributed to the increases in revenue and net income. Adverse working capital, inventory and increased capital expenditures contributed to the decline in free cash flow during that time.Stepan Company's negative free cash flow expansion contributed to subpar returns over the past five years giving shareholders a 56% total return vs. 108% for the S&P 500 (see chart below).SCL Total Return Price data by YChartsSo far this year, Stepan Company's revenue has increased 5%. However, year-to-date net income has decreased 11%. Stepan Company's year-to-date free cash flow clocked in at negative $24 million vs. a negative $191,000 the same time last year. Higher selling prices in the surfactants business and higher selling volume in the polymers business contributed to the increases in revenue. Weaknesses in the surfactant business led to lower net income for the period. A build up in inventory contributed to free cash flow deficit.Stepan Company sports an OK balance sheet with cash and long-term debt to equity ratios clocking in at a reasonable 17% and 40%, respectively. Long-term debt creates interest which chokes out profitability and cash flow over the long-term. Investors should always look for companies with long-term debt to equity ratios of 50% or less.Stepan Company does pay a dividend. Last year the company paid out 25% of its free cash flow in dividends. You want a company to hold back some cash for reinvestment back into the business. Investors should look for companies that pay out less than 50% of their free cash flow in dividends. Currently, Stepan Company pays its shareholders $0.68 per share per year and yields 1.5%.3.) How much management-employee ownership is there?Investors should always look for businesses where the managers and/or employees own a lot of stock in the company. Managers with a great deal of stock in the company will take better care to maximize company profits which will enhance share price and their personal wealth along with the wealth of shareholders.Stepan Company's board of directors own 15.2% of the company according to its latest proxy. F. Quinn Stepan, Chairman of the Company, owns 7.4% of the company's common stock. His son, F. Quinn Stepan, Jr., is the company's CEO; he owns 6% of the company's common stock. Scott Beamer, the company's CFO, owns 2.4% of the company. This ownership should give them extra incentive to guide the company in the right direction.4.) How does its ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"" stack up?Every year a company employs external auditors to audit financial statements and evaluate whether it maintains adequate financial controls. At the conclusion of the audit, you want to see a letter from auditors with the language ""unqualified"" or ""fairly presents"" which generally means that the financial statements and internal systems in constructing them were clean or adequate. If you see ""qualified"" or ""adverse"" in the auditing letter's language then deeper issues in a company's financial statements may exist.Last year, external auditors gave the company a ""fairly presents"" opinion on its financial statements which means that they are clean based on the audit. Stepan Company's auditors also gave its internal controls an unqualified opinion meaning that they are ok based on the audit.5.) What types of risk does it have?It's always important for investors to weigh the various risks such as exposure to political risk in parts of the world where war is the norm, competitive positioning, and market price risk. Stepan Company derived roughly 15% of its 2013 revenue from emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America meaning it possesses some exposure to political risk.Stepan Company, like most companies, operates in a competitive business competing sometimes with the internal development departments of its own customers. However, it represents one of the few publicly-traded chemical companies listed that caters to the cleaning industry. Market price risk resides in the low range for this company.Stepan Company trades at a P/E ratio of 15 vs. 18 for the industry and 19 for the S&P 500, according to Morningstar. Looking ahead it's even better with the company trading at a forward P/E of 11 vs. 18 for the S&P 500.6.) What does its forward analysis look like?Stepan Company possesses the balance sheet to get it through any slump. However, investors should keep an eye on the company's surfactant business which is seeing weakness in the North American market. This company is a hold or neutral to use Wall Street terminology. Investors should wait and see if the company can get all three of its segments moving in a positive direction."

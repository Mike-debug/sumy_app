4375305,105526,2020-09-20T08:05:24-04:00,"SecureWorks posts a resilient FQ2, but the billings decline, along with weaker guidance for FQ3 and fiscal 2021, is concerning.However, shares remained well-supported post-earnings, likely on improved profits and M&A.But with the top line slowing and execution risk around the ongoing business transition, I am cautious.","As one of the largest MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) out there, SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX) offers investors exposure to growth in the security outsourcing space. But even though FQ2 results were strong at first glance, the guidance miss highlights many of the drawbacks to the long-term outlook. Not only has the growth outlook slowed considerably (the latest FQ3 guide calls for Y/Y revenue declines), but there's also uncertainty around execution and headwinds in security consulting amid a challenging macro backdrop. Even at c. 1.5x fiscal 2021 revenue, I am cautious on SCWX shares.FQ2 results were positive relative to some fairly underwhelming expectations heading into the announcement. Total revenue and annual recurring revenue rose c. 1% Y/Y as newer products such as the Red Cloak Threat Detection and Response (TDR) and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) solutions showed healthy adoption trends. As a result, total customers and recurring revenue for the Red Cloak offerings grew significantly in the first half of the year, driving the user base on its cloud-based Red Cloak TDR offering to over 200 (out of the 5,500 total customer base).Source: FQ2 '21 10-Q FilingThe positive performance on the TDR and MDR fronts highlights SCWX's progress in shifting towards more recurring software solutions from the security and risk consulting business, which declined -4.8% Y/Y for the quarter. Overall, revenue from the managed security solutions segment (where TDR and MDR are currently accounted for) grew 3.4% Y/Y and accounted for c. 77% of total revenue in FQ2.Source: FQ2 '21 10-Q FilingAdmittedly, the ongoing software transition is positive, considering the higher margins which come with software revenue, but it does add execution risk to future results. Thus far, FQ2 billings offer little comfort, considering the -4% Y/Y result (down from the +5% Y/Y increase in FQ1). The fact that management did not offer a great deal of color on this (other than that a) collections have remained consistent and b) it does not see any systemic issues within billings overall) adds to the uncertainty around future growth trends.Source: Company DataEncouragingly, non-GAAP gross margins did expand to 59.7% for FQ2 (up c. 340bps Y/Y), benefitting from the ongoing transition towards higher-margin managed security services and pure software products. Meanwhile, the non-GAAP operating margin of 7.2% also benefited considerably from COVID-19-related savings (e.g., c. $0.6 million in reduced travel expenses), which should normalize over the medium term.Source: FQ2 '21 10-Q FilingThe improved margin profile led to a narrowing in GAAP net losses to a -0.9% net margin for FQ2 (improving from -7.5% in the year before), with non-GAAP net income (adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization, and tax benefits) turning significantly positive at $8.4 million.Source: FQ2 '21 10-Q FilingDisappointingly, total revenue guidance for FQ3 '21 and full-year 2021 came in under consensus expectations - FQ3 revenue is guided to reach $137-$139 million (implying a c. 2.4% Y/Y decline), while the full-year revenue guide at $556 million (midpoint) only implies 0.6% Y/Y growth.The margin outlook for this year is encouraging, but there remains limited visibility around long-term growth and profitability. I would also highlight the uncertainty around the security risk consulting business, which will likely see headwinds in the near term amid a challenging macro backdrop. The execution risk involved with the shift toward software/managed security is also worth considering.While the company is operating with greater efficiency relative to historical levels, it also remains unclear how opex trends in a post-COVID-19 environment. Accelerating Services revenue growth, for instance, comes with higher selling costs. Meanwhile, a likely normalization in operating costs as the economy recovers could also see margins come under pressure.The latest full-year guidance for Operating Cash Flow would seem to support this view – it implies a steep decline of c. 27% Y/Y at the midpoint. As management highlighted, the guide already incorporates a major receivables collection in FQ4, resulting in a back-half-weighted cash flow profile.SecureWorks is currently in the midst of a transformation toward becoming a product/managed services company - a shift from its managed security/consulting business before. That has major implications for the margin profile (if successful) over the medium term, but the growth implications are less clear.With the focus increasingly on incident response, there is no guarantee that SCWX will replicate the success of the Mandiant segment for FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Crypsis (since acquired by Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW)). Thus far, MSS growth has slowed, and I am concerned about both the sustainability of the TDR and MDR growth coming out of the pandemic and ongoing declines in the rest of the business.Alongside the FQ2 '21 results, SecureWorks also announced the Delve Laboratories acquisition. Delve delivers cloud-based, AI, and machine-learning-powered SaaS products that enable asset discovery and classification, vulnerability assessment, and risk prioritization across the network, endpoint, and cloud environments.I see the acquisition as a positive overall. It expands the existing product portfolio, allowing it the scope to more comprehensively address security needs – for instance, more accurate and prioritized asset data and better threat detection. Delve's VM solution also holds value both as a standalone product and as an integration into the Red Cloak SaaS platform. Terms of the deal remain undisclosed, but the company has guided toward a close over the coming weeks.There were several puts and takes in the quarter, but the improved profit profile and M&A are likely helping to support shares despite the weak guide. Admittedly, the steady progress toward a more software-oriented business will be positive for the margin profile, but without growth (the current FQ3 revenue outlook implies Y/Y declines), I see little reason to get more constructive on shares at c.1.5x fiscal 2021 revenue. With execution risk also ever-present amid a challenging macro backdrop, I remain firmly on the sidelines.Data by YCharts"
4229791,103480,2018-12-22T12:45:48-05:00,"Eschewing a downturn in the broader technology sector, SecureWorks has continued its massive year-to-date rally, up 67% so far.The company's most recent quarterly results showed an impressive acceleration in growth to 14% y/y, helped by strong international growth.However, SecureWorks' gross margin remains in the low 50s and below most cybersecurity peers, justifying some of its valuation discount.Analysts also pointed to weak monthly recurring revenues, leading to lumpy results. This quarter's beat could easily be reversed the next time SecureWorks reports earnings.","Almost every stock in the technology sector is in the red for the year, but one little-known name has quietly powered to the top of the charts with barely any pullback this year: SecureWorks (SCWX), a cybersecurity company focusing on threat response that is controlled by Dell (DVMT). The company has benefited from a year of high-profile cyber attacks raising awareness for its product, and its revenue growth - though slim compared to most peers - is quietly accelerating. There's no doubt that SecureWorks had a well-deserved recovery this year on the back of strong results. The company's top line is coming in much better than expected, and in addition, it's achieving significant margin growth (except for on gross margins) and improving free cash flows. In addition, the company is notching excellent growth overseas, even though the major international markets - Western Europe and China - are undergoing economic tremors.With SecureWorks churning out repeated ""record quarters,"" it seems like the company can do no wrong. But going into 2019, I fear the company's hot streak may come to an end. It's true that SecureWorks is cheap - at 2.1x forward revenues, it sits well below most stocks in the cybersecurity and software spaces. But are there any growth drivers left for the company, or is it just business as usual next year? SecureWorks recently suffered through a spate of downgrades from Wall Street, adding some negative voices to the mix. One pointed specifically to SecureWorks' weak monthly recurring revenues as a bearish catalyst. For the fiscal year ending in February, SecureWorks guided to MRR of $36.5 million, which annually translates to $438 million. Figure 1. SecureWorks guidanceSource: SecureWorks earnings releaseThat represents 77% of FY20's expected revenues of $570 million (per Yahoo Finance). While we note that this seems to be a high recurring mix, we also must acknowledge that a large part of SecureWorks' recurring revenues comes in the form of support and services contracts, not bona fide SaaS subscriptions. Indeed, SecureWorks' more service-oriented business (rather than product sales) is one of the major drivers behind its margin gap to other cybersecurity peers, and why many investors remain bearish on this stock.In my view, investors should turn toward faster-growing cybersecurity stocks that have a much higher mix of product and subscription sales, such as Mimecast (MIME) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Both of these stocks are down sharply from YTD highs, and both also generate significant free cash flows. SecureWorks is at best a hold - while acknowledging this year's strong results, it's also difficult to point to bullish drivers to keep the stock's rally going in 2019. Here's a look at SecureWorks' third quarter results:Figure 2. SecureWorks 3Q19 earnings resultsSource: SecureWorks earnings releaseEven as a bear on this stock, I'll acknowledge that there are a lot of strengths to call out in the quarter. Top-line revenues grew 14% y/y to $133.1 million, accelerating three points over last quarter's 11% y/y growth rate and beating Wall Street's expectations of $130.5 million (+11% y/y) by a strong three-point margin. In a quarter where many slower-growing, legacy technology stocks have missed on top-line results, SecureWorks' robust revenue beat comes as a breath of relief. International growth was the big outperformer this quarter. Michael Cote, SecureWorks' CEO, noted as follows on the Q3 earnings call:Despite this growth, however, subscription metrics fell rather flat. The company noted that average subscription contract values rose only 9% y/y to $99,000 per quarter, while major contracts more than >$1 million only saw a 4% y/y increase. Monthly recurring revenues for the quarter also exited at just $35.1 million, up only 5% y/y. The company also reported that net retention rates fell to 91%, down six points year-over-year and seven points sequentially.The problem with SecureWorks' top line, in my view, is contained in its revenue mix. An increasing percentage of the company's intake comes from its consulting practice, which grew at 29% y/y (eclipsing overall revenue growth) and represented 24.5% of total revenues, up from the prior year. The company continues to expect consulting to represent 24%-25% of revenues over the next few quarters as well. Consulting and services are often performed at or just above cost (something common among most software companies), so a strong consulting revenue mix will hold back SecureWorks' gross margin.Note that gross margins expanded 50bps this quarter to 53.3%, up from 52.8% in the year-ago quarter. But that's still significantly weaker than many cybersecurity peers, as shown in the chart below:SecureWorks was able to make up for its gross margin weaknesses by capturing plenty of operating expense efficiencies, however. In particular, the company cut back 300bps of sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues, while general and administrative spending also fell 340bps as a percentage of revenues. This allowed SecureWorks to begin closing its loss gap and improve its operating margin to -4.9%, up 760bps from -12.5% in the year-ago quarter. On the cash flow front, SecureWorks has generated $26 million of operating cash flows and spent $7 million on capex in the year-to-date, indicating FCF of $19.0 million. While that's significantly improved from negative FCF in the prior year, we note that the 5% FCF margin on year-to-date revenues of $388 million also falls flat against peers. Palo Alto Networks, for example, consistently generates FCF margins in the high 20s.Figure 3. SecureWorks cash flowsSource: SecureWorks earnings releaseSecureWorks' rally may be short lived. While the company has pulled off a couple of good quarters this year, some potential weaknesses are emerging. Particularly concerning is the company's sharp six-point decline in net retention rates. SecureWorks' CFO has assured that this is due to a particular large customer transition in which legacy services are being replaced with new offerings (which also shaved off $1.2 million of MRR), but if the replacement deal doesn't materialize or comes in smaller than expected, SecureWorks could see a sharp deceleration in revenues once again.SecureWorks, in my view, lacks any unique drivers that can propel the stock in 2019. Its product, too, is up against plenty of competition from both entrenched incumbents like FireEye (FEYE) and Splunk (SPLK), as well as up-and-comers like Darktrace. The stock is likely to see a lot of profit taking as it remains one of the best-performing tech stocks of the year. Investors would be wise to lock in gains while they can."
4326343,35181,2020-02-21T16:42:29-05:00,SecureWorks continues to have underwhelming revenue growth.Subscription customer base is decaying.The stock recently jumped on rumors that Dell may acquire the remaining shares in the company that it doesn't own.A brand new cast of management may signal that Dell wants the company in better shape before deciding what to do with it.,"Late last year, a rumor emerged that the remaining outstanding shares of SecureWorks Corp. (SCWX) might be purchased by parent company Dell (DELL). Dell would be purchasing the shares that it doesn't already own, then consolidating SecureWorks with its other operations. This is a 180-degree about-face as Dell was rumored to be considering a sale of SecureWorks about a year ago.SecureWorks stock spiked to over $17.75 on the buyout rumor but have since drifted back to ~$14.75.It doesn't appear that Dell is 100% sure of what it is doing with SecureWorks, or if it is, it certainly hasn't communicated this with the company. The reason I say this is because SecureWorks has been shoring up its management with a new CFO, new Chief Channel Officer, new Chief Sales Officer, and Chief Marketing Officer. SecureWorks wouldn't be doing this if it was going to be absorbed by Dell or VMWare (VMW) which recently acquired Carbon Black.In any case, I don't find SecureWorks to be a compelling investment case, and I wouldn't pin my hopes on a buyout offer. Revenue growth is not in the same league as with other cybersecurity firms and its subscription customer base has dropped from 4,300 to 4,100 over the last year.(Source: SecureWorks)For the above reasons, I am giving SecureWorks a neutral rating.The following management additions were made over the last several months:These changes were made prior to the rumor regarding the Dell buyout. My speculation is that the original thought of selling SecureWorks wasn't panning out, perhaps due to lack of interest, and they were beefing up management in preparation for a spinoff. But the company performance hasn't been sufficient to make a go of it, so Dell is considering buying out the company and folding it into its existing operations.SecureWorks' newer products are compatible with Dell's sales structure:SecureWorks' revenue growth which was once in excess of 30% has been slowing since 2017 and now stands at 6.5%.(Source: Portfolio123)This is in stark contrast to other cybersecurity companies that are experiencing strong double-digit revenue growth. One of the reasons for the anemic growth has to do with the maturation of the Managed Security Services industry, for which SecureWorks is a leader.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates SecureWorks' stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the chart, SecureWorks is somewhat undervalued relative to its peers based on its forward sales multiple.But when I use next year's earnings estimate in place of next year's sales estimate, I find that SecureWorks is quite overvalued.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)If only we could trust in rumors! Rumor had it back in December that Dell was considering the purchase of SecureWorks' outstanding shares. This probably makes sense given the fit between SecureWorks products and Dell's sales machine. If the rumor turns out to be true, then it might make sense to be a shareholder, although the premium that Dell offers may not be substantial. I believe that Dell likely shopped SecureWorks around but couldn't get an acceptable offer for the company. In the meantime, SecureWorks has been beefing up its management, presumably with the belief that it would be spun off or possibly sold to a company that would be operating it independently.In any case, I don't find SecureWorks to be an attractive investment. The Managed Security Services industry is mature and doesn't offer the high growth that other cybersecurity niches offer. Dell may buy up the outstanding shares but the stock may drift substantially lower before that happens. For this reason, I am giving SecureWorks a neutral rating."
4294225,35181,2019-09-30T14:39:43-04:00,SecureWorks stock price is severely undervalued after taking a 50% haircut this year.Revenue growth is anemic and growth-profitability characteristics are poor compared to other SaaS companies.Product development is too slow and the company is losing ground to other next-generation cybersecurity companies as a result.I give SecureWorks a neutral rating.,"I just discovered another cybersecurity company. SecureWorks Corp. (SCWX) keeps a pretty low profile on Seeking Alpha, there hasn't been an article written on this company in 2019. Like other SaaS companies, SecureWorks stock has taken a pretty big haircut this year, from $25 down to a recent price of $12.59.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)SecureWorks is the leader in the field of Managed Security Services, but this area of cybersecurity is fairly mature. SecureWorks is introducing a new generation of software but appears to be well behind its competitors.(Source: SecureWorks)While the stock price appears to be severely undervalued, there are several reasons why I won't recommend this stock as an investment. The reasons include anemic growth, declining subscription customer base, slow introduction of next-generation cybersecurity products, and the low gross profit margin due to the managed security aspect of the business. I am, therefore, giving SecureWorks a neutral rating.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a significant factor in present value models such as DCF. A higher level of future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 84 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, SecureWorks is significantly below the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that SecureWorks is substantially undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.(1) Growth vs. Profitability - I have developed a scatter plot for evaluating SaaS companies by examining their growth versus profitability relationship. The scatter plot is similar to the stock valuation scatter plot (above) but uses ""Forward Earnings/Forward Sales"" instead of ""EV/Forward Sales"" for the vertical axis. The Forward Earnings is the analysts' mean estimate for next year's non-GAAP earnings.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)As can be seen from the above plot, SecureWorks sits well below the trend line, meaning that it is below the growth-profitability profile for the typical SaaS company. This suggests that next year's earnings estimate is not up to snuff given next year's revenue growth. This, of course, is relative to other SaaS company expectations.(2) Low Gross Profit Margin - The poor forward-looking earnings estimate appears to be partially explainable by the low gross profit margin of 58%.(Source: Portfolio123)SecureWorks has the lowest gross margin of all cybersecurity companies in my database. In fact, none of the others have a gross margin of less than 70%.(Source: Portfolio123)The low gross margin is due to the support staff required in order to operate the managed security capability as well as the sale hardware security appliances. Low gross margin translates to low financial leverage and low-profit margin. Management is aware of this issue and made the following statement in the annual report:(3) Falling Subscription Customer Base - Growth of customer base is one metric that is critical for SaaS companies. SecureWorks' subscription customer base has been in decline for at least a couple of years.(Source: SecureWorks)One explanation for this declining metric is the company's introduction of the new software platform. In such cases, it is not uncommon to see customer churn. But why over such a long period of time? I don't believe that it is wise to invest in SecureWorks until there is a turnaround in this metric.(4) VMWare Acquisition of Carbon Black - Both VMWare (VMW) and SecureWorks are owned by Dell Technologies (DELL). Yet, VMWare chose to acquire another cybersecurity company, Carbon Black (CBLK), instead of merging with SecureWorks. This speaks volumes regarding the strategic value that Dell places on SecureWorks.Most cybersecurity companies are fighting for market share ""at all cost"". But not SecureWorks. SG&A expenses are low compared to other SaaS companies and the total number of shares are being reduced.(Source: Portfolio123)In all likelihood, Dell wants to dress up SecureWorks and shop it around for a sale. While this could be considered bullish for the stock, I believe that the managed security aspect of SecureWorks is a liability.Based on what I see with other acquired SaaS companies, the workforce tends to disappear quickly unless there are significant perks for sticking around. Cybersecurity experts are in high demand but short supply. SecureWorks has hundreds of cybersecurity experts that would be in a position to demand high levels of compensation, putting any acquirer in a bad situation.(5) Relationship with Dell Technologies - This is stated as a risk in the annual report:In other words, the relationship with Dell may not be in the best interests of SecureWorks or its investors.SecureWorks and VMWare are both owned by Dell but curiously VMWare has acquired Carbon Black, to some extent SecureWorks' competitor in the cybersecurity industry. It doesn't appear to me that SecureWorks is a ""going concern"" for Dell, not in terms of being able to carry on business, but perhaps not part of Dell's future plans as a subsidiary.Dell may be wanting to dispose of SecureWorks in order to pay down Dell's own debts, but I am not sure how marketable SecureWorks is in its current state. Revenue growth is anemic and the company has a large quantity of support staff for its managed cybersecurity offering. This staff would be difficult to retain in a takeover, and the low gross profit margin is also primarily due to the high quantity of support staff.The stock price appears to be severely undervalued but growth-profitability isn't up to the level of the average SaaS stock, and I don't see this improving in the near future. Next-generation products are not coming out fast enough and managed security services is a mature industry. Companies are moving towards AI-based support which carries a lower price tag then retaining a staff of experts. Therefore, I am giving SecureWorks a neutral rating."
4161728,103480,2018-04-09T03:48:05-04:00,"SecureWorks has sunk to new all-time lows on the back of its Q4 earnings report.Despite a modest top-line beat and decent FY18 guidance, SecureWorks showed an alarming decline in its gross margins.Revenue growth has slowed down to the single digits, as SecureWorks faces competition from best-of-breed companies like Splunk as well as emerging startups.Its relationship to Dell (which owns 86% of the company) is another risk, as Dell is exploring multiple avenues for paying down its debt which can involve gutting its subsidiaries.Though SecureWorks appears cheap, the risks far outweigh the opportunities.","There seems to be a storm of issues swirling around SecureWorks (SCWX) at the moment, in a 2018 that has thus far seen the stock plunge 12% to new all-time lows. At this point, value investors are likely crowding around the stock, wondering: is this the right time to buy into a rebound?As with most falling knives, buying into SecureWorks now would be playing with fire. The stock has attracted a bevy of Wall Street downgrades recently, and while analyst opinions should almost always be taken with a grain of salt, the considerable power they have over negative market sentiment should definitely be noted. I don't see SecureWorks climbing out of this hole, at least not anytime soon.Some investors might be thinking: how bad of a position can a company owned by Dell (DVMT) be in? After all, doesn't the PC giant have essentially unlimited resources to ""save"" SecureWorks?In my view, the fact that Dell has a controlling stake in SecureWorks - 86% of the company, according to the 10-K that SecureWorks filed a couple of weeks back - is more of a risk than a safeguard. The reason is simple. Dell has recently been struggling with its >$50 billion debt load, and in the wake of new Trump tax regulations that limit interest deductibility to just 30% of EBITDA, it's no longer capital structure-optimal for Dell to retain the huge debt that it incurred in buying EMC two years ago. The company has explored a variety of options to raise cash quickly to pay down debt. One of the major strategies that it has floated has been a ""reverse merger"" of VMware (VMW), in which Dell acquired a majority stake through its purchase of EMC. Like SecureWorks, Dell currently owns about nine-tenths of VMware, and is proposing to absorb it in order to take advantage of VMware's huge free cash flows to help pay down Dell's debt. The consensus opinion among VMware shareholders is that it's a terrible, value-destroying transaction for VMware owners, and the possibility of an unfavorable acquisition has sent VMware shares sliding over the past month.Then there's the IPO of Pivotal Software (PVTL), filed last month and expected to raise hundreds of millions sometime in Q2 or Q3. Pivotal is another wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell, and though its S-1 filing currently states that none of the IPO proceeds will be funneled to Dell and its debt repayment efforts, some market observers have hypothesized that this may change.The bottom line: with its recent intentions toward VMware and speculation of doing the same in the Pivotal Software IPO, Dell doesn't seem too concerned about sacrificing limbs to save the body. Even the recent strength in PC shipments isn't enough to accelerate Dell's debt paydown, and this puts SecureWorks' assets at risk.Here's a look at the quarterly results that prompted the decay in SecureWorks shares:Source: SecureWorks investor relationsOn a nominal basis, SecureWorks grew revenues by 1.4% y/y to $120.7 million in the fourth quarter (though the company disclosed that when excluding the impact of a 53-week fiscal year in the year-ago fourth quarter comparison, revenues are actually up 9.7% y/y). This is marginally better than the $117.7 million that analysts were expecting, but the top-line beat was all but ignored as investors digested the blows to profitability.Notice that SecureWorks' gross margin declined a massive 300bps to 49.7% in 4Q17. With a gross margin now under 50%, SecureWorks is already one of the lowest-margin companies in the software sector. A similar decline in gross margins is what sent shares of Twilio (TWLO), a customer communications-focused PaaS company, spiraling to multi-year lows two quarters ago. Is the gross margin decline an implicit hint that competition is heating up? SecureWorks has retained its position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Security Services in 2018, but more agile and cloud-friendly security vendors have become increasingly popular with IT buyers in recent days.The dark horse here is Splunk (SPLK), which focuses on extracting insights from machine-generated data. The primary use case for this data has thus far been security-related, but it can also extend to business analytics. Splunk's ~40% growth as it marches to a ~$2 billion run rate has propelled the stock to all-time highs in recent months. Other threats include AI-driven startups like Darktrace, which looks increasingly appealing against ""legacy"" providers like Dell SecureWorks as it continues to rack up awards. The gross margin decline has exacerbated a huge profitability drop. Sales and marketing expenses have also leapt up 460bps as a percentage of revenues, despite producing just a modest gain in top-line revenues this quarter. These two negative effects have produced an operating loss of -$26.1 million in 4Q17, more than doubling last year's losses and widening the GAAP operating loss margin to -21.6%, from -10.1% in last year's fourth quarter. We'll ignore GAAP net income here as it includes noise from the Trump tax bill, but SecureWorks' pro forma EPS of -$0.12 also missed analysts' expectations of -$0.08 by a sizable amount.And looking ahead, the coast looks stormy as well, with this year's guidance of -$0.16 to -$0.20 in pro forma EPS disappointing against Wall Street's expectations of -$0.16, despite a modest beat to top-line guidance.With 81.773 million shares of SecureWorks currently outstanding (86% of which, as previously mentioned, are controlled by Dell) currently trading at $8 per share, SecureWorks currently has a market cap of $654.2 million. Netting out its clean balance sheet cash of $101.5 million and no debt, SecureWorks currently has an enterprise value of $552.7 million.Against the company's guidance range of $512-$516 million in revenues for this coming year, that's an EV/FTM revenue multiple of just 1.08x - possibly one of the lowest valuation multiples in the software sector. Yet SecureWorks shouldn't be considered a value play. At its huge ~$500 million scale, it should be producing positive profits - or at least, positive cash flows (OCF for the prior year was essentially breakeven; free cash flow was -$13.1 million). But on the contrary, SecureWorks is slowing down growth while seeing worsening margins - a terrible harbinger for future performance.And uncertainty over Dell's intentions for its many subsidiaries adds another wrinkle for SecureWorks investors. As it currently stands, I'd steer clear of this name."

Now, after SecureWorks' Q1 earnings release this week, the company is back on track to chasing 52-week highs.Shares are up more than double digits after reporting Q1 earnings that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, and overall, since last quarter's fall from grace, SecureWorks' stock has recovered about 50%:SCWX data by YChartsClearly, investors who timed this company's rise and fall have made out like bandits. But the question is: has anything about this company fundamentally changed, or is it still facing the same troubles it did last quarter?Certainly the revenue acceleration this quarter helped a lot (we'll dive into deeper detail on SecureWorks' Q1 earnings in this article), especially after posting flat performance last quarter. Investors took last quarter's flat revenue performance as a potential signal that competition was eating into SecureWorks' business, with more cloud-friendly vendors taking a greater share of the market. This quarter's return to double-digit growth, even if not as robust as in years past, somewhat assuaged these concerns.But the major specters hanging over SecureWorks are still certainly present. The first, of course, is gross margin compression - a major topic this year not only for SecureWorks, but across the broader software industry. SecureWorks' gross margin already hangs at an industry-low ~50%, which looks extremely unfavorable against software peers in the 70-85% gross margin range. Even sacrificing a few points of gross margin is essentially an admission that competition has toughened in cybersecurity services, and SecureWorks has to compete on pricing to survive (much like its parent hardware company, Dell (DVMT), which is not known as a best-of-breed OEM but as a price discounter).Which brings us to the next point - Dell. As most investors know, Dell is an extremely active company on the M&A front, and its corporate history is littered with a fascinating web of acquisitions and buyouts. It has controlling stakes in a wide array of public companies, including 86% of SecureWorks and similar ownership percentages in the virtualization giant VMware (VMW) and recently public PaaS company Pivotal Software (PVTL). Dell is struggling to bring down its ~$50 billion debt load emanating from the Silver Lake/Michael Dell buyout, and its exact strategy for doing so is unknown.Dell recently hosted its Q1 earnings call, and its SVP of Investor Relations, Rob Williams, kicked off the call with this cryptic message:These filings both relate to the ""potential transactions"" surrounding a potential reverse merger of VMware, or an IPO of Dell Technologies, both of which are considered the primary strategies for fundraising. The full text of the 13-D is available here and the text of the 8-K is available here, both through the SEC website. VMware's shares have recovered sharply over the past month as investors have lowered the probability of an unfavorable reverse merger happening, suggesting that Dell might turn to another trick in its sleeve to raise funds. Given its controlling stake in SecureWorks (though SecureWorks is much smaller than VMware and unlikely to move the needle), anything could happen to the company and shares will be at risk until Dell is able to disclose its plan in firmer detail.The bottom line on SecureWorks: Continue to stay away from this company. With the ~50% rise over the past month, SecureWorks' risk-reward profile has tilted heavily against a bullish position, especially as the company hasn't exactly signaled a full recovery in the health of its fundamentals. Though SecureWorks looks like a value play, there are much better (and more modern, faster-growing) cybersecurity companies to buy. Those I like in particular are recent IPO Carbon Black (CBLK) and longtime firewall stalwart Palo Alto Networks (PANW).Let's turn to SecureWorks' Q1 results, shown in the table below:Figure 1. SecureWorks Q1 earnings resultsSource: SecureWorks investor relationsRevenues grew 11% y/y to $126.2 million, up from $113.7 million in the year-ago quarter and surpassing analyst expectations of $122.5 million (+8% y/y) by a respectable three points. Note some context around this growth number - last quarter, revenues had been flat at +1% y/y growth (though the y/y compare last quarter was impacted by a 53-week fiscal year in the prior-year compare; without which revenue growth would have been just under 10%). In any case, the re-acceleration of SecureWorks' revenues certainly was a positive sign. Michael Cote, SecureWorks' CEO, called it the ""best first quarter sales in our history"".However, the issue that plagued SecureWorks last quarter is still very present this quarter. Gross margin dollars of $65.6 million this quarter represented a gross margin of just 52.0% this quarter, still very much below typical industry averages in both the software and cybersecurity sectors. Of course, this is influenced by the fact that SecureWorks carries a large portion of its business in consulting/professional services, which is often done at very low margins or even below cost in order to entice subscription revenues through the door. Cote noted the following on the earnings call:As a result, gross margin continued to drop 80 bps this quarter (from 52.8% in the year-ago quarter), though this was substantially better than the 300 bps drop in Q4. Even though the margin drop can be explained by the mix shift into lower-margin services, the fact that SecureWorks has a margin deficit to peers does justify its lower valuation against other software and cybersecurity stocks.Fortunately for the company, SecureWorks was able to make up for the gross margin drop and reduce its sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenues, thinning out the operating loss margin to -13.9% in Q1, 280 bps better than -16.7% in 1Q17. A much lower tax rate (19% versus 32% in the year-ago quarter), thanks to the Trump tax overhaul, also helped SecureWorks' pro forma EPS of -$0.06 edge out slightly over analyst expectations of -$0.07.While SecureWorks showed minor improvements in its fundamental performance in Q1, the ~50% lift in shares over the past month already more than compensates for the better results this quarter versus last. In addition, the core issue at the root of SecureWorks' ""cheaper"" valuation - a large gross margin deficit - still persists. Investors are paying top dollar for high-margin subscription SaaS businesses right now - and while SecureWorks has a subscription component to its business, its reliance on professional services revenues for growth is a big handicap.Overall, with shares having rebounded so robustly over the last month, it's difficult to envision further upside for SecureWorks. Continue to stay on the sidelines for this name."

We have experienced many hacks over the past few years - of celebrities, confidential client data of all kinds of companies, security threats, and perhaps, also country or corporate espionage. Late ""Russian Hackers'"" comical and populist comments of now elected Trump got a lot of attention.This weekend one of the biggest and unprecedented malware attacks that spread throughout many parts of the world and gained a lot of attraction in media occurred. Maybe in part because a lot of different government and public agencies were affected. Given the widespread nature that didn't target particular company/agency/or country, most likely, it wasn't politically motivated. Attackers - that by coincidence probably originated from Russia - were simply looking for money. The malware is asking for paying ransom within 72 hours, otherwise, it wipes out data from the affected PC.These and similar attacks, or hacks, are becoming increasingly more frequent. No one would like to see delays of flights and public transportation, or their medical and other confidential data stolen or corrupted in any way. Especially banking accounts and transaction processing data might be seen as very sensitive. More threats and more demonstration of hackers' ability will, in my opinion, lead to increasing spending on cyber-security by corporations in pretty much all industries. This traction is creating opportunity for cyber-security companies that are on the market, and some might also see immediate stock gains due to the Saturday's attack. Based on Morgan Stanley's survey of chief security officers, the spending for cyber-security will accelerate to 9% compounded growth over the next three years.Looking at the tradable opportunities on the market, there are few options; anti-virus and malware software such as Symantec (SYMC), which is the only company from the lists of top 10 in their industry and still publicly traded. There are other large multinationals that have divisions focusing on security and cyber-security as well - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM (NYSE:IBM). Broad ETFs - HACK (NYSEARCA:HACK) and CIBR (NASDAQ:CIBR) that gained 25% and 35% respectively over the past 12 months. Or other companies that focus on wide solutions for corporations, and there are plenty of them. I will focus on a small-cap stock called SecureWorks Corp. (NASDAQ:SCWX).This stock is not very favourable and price momentum is not very good.SCWX is an April 2016 security spin-off of Dell, which still owns majority of the stock and voting rights. The company provides intelligence-driven information security solutions. The company is focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks. SCWX services over 4000 customers in 61 countries. I think current situation of the stock provides good risk-reward opportunity because of these reasons - large growth, good potential to improve bottom line margin, industry and broad cyber-security spending momentum, under-priced earnings upside.The closest competitor is Varonis Systems Inc (NASDAQ:VRNS), which trades at significantly larger price than SCWX. Below is the comparison of their income statements for past few fiscal years, as well as their last reported quarters.Source: 10-KSCWX had stellar growth over the years, and yet its market cap is merely $758 mil., whereas VRNS capitalization is $950 mil. The latter has somewhat larger growth, but the difference is not that large, especially when considering that SCWX has roughly 2.5 times the revenue of VRNS. Neither of the companies had any profitable year yet, but that's natural characteristic of the growing phase. SecureWorks seems to be working towards black numbers.The major drop of price that occurred from 29th of March wasn't due to announced FY 2016 results, but due to forward-looking guidance. FY 2017 will most likely again see loss of $-0.49 EPS, or $42 mil., and this alone caused the drop. Markets were projecting smooth transition towards becoming profitable by FY 2018, but it doesn't look like it. However, the revenue growth is expected to be roughly 8% and end up at $460 mil for full year, and SCWX's monthly recurring revenue, which is subscription based revenue, is expected to increase to roughly $35 mil per month, which is 12% increase.The profit is the market's issue with this company. From their income statement, costs are declining steadily over time, although the company is bulking up R&D expenditure. If they capped it at a steady rate, there would be good possibility that SCWX could bring in profit. But do they need cash? Not really - cash and cash equivalents stood at $117 mil, and receivables at $113 mil. Hence, they can fully focus on growing revenue without worrying much about income at this stage, although this might not maximize shareholder value. The balance sheet looks particularly healthy, given how young the company is. Current price/book value is 1.1, which is very small for a fast growing tech company. However, I must point that $416 mil of assets are goodwill.Members of the board of directors seem strong as well: CFO of salesforce.com - Mark J. Hawkins, Michael Dell, CEO of SAP - William R. McDermott. I believe SCWX can benefit from their guidance and broad network, as well as existing network of Dell's clients. Dell still owns majority of company stock - 86.9% and majority of voting rights - 98.5%. I am not sure whether this might create conflict of interest between Dell and other shareholders - it very well might. However, why would Dell spin off a company that it wouldn't want to eventually sell for maximized price? Dell is a private company and doesn't need to care about market moods anymore.SCWX exceeded expected earnings and revenue over all the past quarters since its IPO - since April 2016. It might be that market/analysts expectations are too low for the company. This sector is gaining increasing momentum, which will surely be further ignited by Saturday's malware attacks. If I used anchoring to its market competitor VRNS (which behavioral economists hate), having the same price/sales ratio would result in $2.48 bil market cap for SCWX. It's too huge of a difference relative to current price. Even if VRNS has a little bit higher growth, it doesn't explain why SCWX is not a favorite for markets.For these reasons, I believe there is potential hidden in this stock."
4205719,103480,2018-09-12T07:05:34-04:00,"SecureWorks is rallying again after reporting strong Q2 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines.The company was able to revive growth for the second quarter in a row, with revenue growth of 11% y/y matching last quarter's growth rate.Still, one of the company's main problems has yet to be cured - a gross margin deficit to SaaS peers. Rather than improving, gross margins actually fell 50 bps this quarter.This is a slow-growing company with very limited profitability. There are better cybersecurity stocks to buy.","SecureWorks (SCWX), the Dell-controlled cybersecurity vendor that applies machine intelligence toward cyber threat detection, has continued its recent hot streak. The company reported Q2 earnings last week that, like last quarter, dazzled investors and beat Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines. For a stock that was rather flattish on the growth front for most of last year, and suffered a sharp stock pullback in consequence, SecureWorks is having a banner year. Year to date, shares of SecureWorks are up more than 55%, vastly outperforming its peers in the software and cybersecurity sectors:SCWX data by YChartsI, however, continue to be skeptical of SecureWorks, a viewpoint I shared last quarter. In my mind, a good software investment falls into one of two categories:SecureWorks, though having revived its growth to low double-digits from a flattish base, is clearly not a growth stock. But despite this slower growth trajectory, the company's bottom line isn't that exciting either. A weak gross margin is the main drawback here - with a gross margin just barely above 50%, SecureWorks is essentially in the bottom tier of the software sector, most of whom have margins in the 70-80% range. Yes, it's true that the company produces a marginal amount of free cash flow - but not nearly enough to make up for its lower growth.The only thing SecureWorks has going for it, in my opinion, is its low valuation. But in my view, the low valuation is a reflection of SecureWorks' so-so prospects: lower growth and lower margins than most of the software sector, plus a highly competitive area of cybersecurity in which it can hardly assert dominance. Among the companies that perform similar services to SecureWorks are machine data giant Splunk (SPLK) and well-recognized cybersecurity startup Darktrace. Over time, SecureWorks will lose its clout to these faster-growing names.I'm extremely bullish on several names in the cybersecurity industry that I believe to be far superior investments. On the growth side, I'm very partial to Mimecast (MIME), a UK-based cybersecurity vendor that specializes on securing corporate email communications. On the value/cash flowing side (though still growing faster than SecureWorks), I'm bullish on Palo Alto Networks (PANW), the longtime leader in firewalls that is generating 30% y/y revenue growth despite reaching a $3 billion revenue scale, plus a huge ~40% FCF margin.Stay cautious on SecureWorks - there are far better investments to be made in the SaaS/cybsersecurity space.Here's a look at SecureWorks' Q2 results:Figure 1. SecureWorks 2Q19 resultsSource: SecureWorks investor relationsRevenues grew 11% y/y to $128.8 million, matching Q1's 11% y/y growth pace and, at the very least, comforting investors that SecureWorks hasn't returned to the flat revenue pace at which it exited Q4. Analysts had expected $127.6 million in revenues, or +10% y/y - so SecureWorks only beat consensus estimates by a thin hair. Monthly recurring revenues, on the hand, saw slightly stronger growth at 12% y/y.The company attributed the slight revenue beat to a more tenured sales force with ""sales leadership now in place,"" as well as a more dressed-down go-to-market approach. Here's further commentary from Michael Cote, SecureWorks' CEO, on the earnings call:SecureWorks also noted that its net retention rate this quarter was 98%, up 2 points from a year-over-year standpoint, but down two points from last quarter's 100% retention rate. On the bright side, the company noted that it had a large client up for renewal this quarter that it successfully managed to retain. In addition, SecureWorks noted that its international revenue growth was 50% y/y - representing 22% of the total revenue base and a huge leap ahead of overall revenue growth, particularly in APAC, where IDC has recognized SecureWorks as a growing vendor. It's clear that on the U.S. side, however, SecureWorks might be running into saturation issues. The CEO noted that ""although our performance in North America improved, we still see significant room for accelerating our growth domestically.""It's on the margin side, however, that SecureWorks continued to disappoint. On a pro forma basis, SecureWorks' gross margin shed 80 bps to 54.3%, continuing a trend from last quarter of falling margins:Figure 2. SecureWorks 2Q19 margin trendsSource: SecureWorks investor relationsOn a GAAP basis, SecureWorks' margin also shed 50 bps. The company already has one of the lowest gross margins among peers in the SaaS sector, owing to a larger mix of low-margin professional services revenues.Luckily for SecureWorks, the company was able to scale down its sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues, down 310 bps to 27.0% on a pro forma basis - reflecting the ""in place"" sales force that management noted. This helped to offset the gross margin declines and produce a 250 bps improvement in pro forma operating margins to -1.8%.A breakeven pro forma operating margin may be impressive for faster-growing SaaS companies, but for SecureWorks, it's more or less expected. There are much faster-growing companies, such as Red Hat (RHT), that are able to produce positive earnings while still maintaining growth.One of the other pieces of commentary that stuck out from this quarter's earnings was management's comments that larger clients typically tend to demand more consulting/incident response work. SecureWorks effectively blamed this quarter's dip in gross margins on a shift to a larger clientele - which is exactly the opposite of what we'd hope for as a company grows. As investors, we'd want margins to improve as companies land larger and larger clients. This comment, in my view, is a telling signal that SecureWorks' gross margin deficit may never be fully corrected.SecureWorks, to me, is a so-so company with below-average growth performance, a weak margin profile and unattractive unit economics, and insufficient profit levels to make up for its top-line deficiencies. The cybersecurity space is chock-full of higher-quality names to invest in - so stay on the sidelines for this one."

(NASDAQ:SCWX) priced its IPO of 8 million shares (down from 9 million filed) at $14.00, below the anticipated range ($15.50-17.50), raising $112 million in proceeds. The company will have a market capitalization of approximately $1.14 billion. Active bookrunners for the offering are BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman, Sachs & Co., and J.P. Morgan. The proceeds of the offering will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.SecureWorks was purchased by Dell Inc. in 2011 (which subsequently went private through an acquisition by Denali holding). It is a global provider of intelligence-driven information solutions. It provides a counter-threat platform through advanced analytics, data sciences, and machine learning. The company says it processes 160 billion events per day, with 99.99% handled by its system. It has 4200 clients in 59 countries, including 36% of the Fortune 100.The company describes its business model as a ""land and expand"" strategy. It claims to produce approx $3.80 in lifetime value per customer for every dollar in acquisition cost. It works with existing point solutions, building on existing solutions to fill the gaps. SecureWorks boasts that it moved to Gartner's magic quadrant in 2015 of managed security service providers (sharing the space with IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Symantec (SYMC) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ)).The company has grown revenue from $216 million in FY 2014 (its fiscal year ends January) to $342 million in 2016. Its client count has grown from 3500 to 4200 over this period, and average revenue per client has grown from $64k to $81k. Gross margins of 52% are below the industry average, but the company says the higher cost of sales is due to its counter-threat operation, which is critical to its business.SecureWorks competes primarily with point solutions and the companies described above in the ""magic quadrant"". However, for valuation purposes, some other cybersecurity software companies that have gone public in the last couple of years can be looked at: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), and Mimecast (NASDAQ:MIME). The first two had strong opening debuts, and MIME opened up 10% despite pricing at the low end of the range. However, all three currently trade below. On the other hand, cybersecurity firm CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), which priced in 2014, is trading well above its IPO price. The one significant difference between these firms is that CyberArk is profitable.At the $14.00 price, SCWX is at approximately 2.9x TTM EV/Sales. The recent security IPOs listed above trade between 2.65x and 5.6x. Though the higher multiple is that of CYBR, which is a profitable company. Excluding CYBR, the range is 2.65x to 3.7x.While the U.S. IPO market appears to be making strides, with successful debuts of BATS Global Markets (BATS:BATS) last week and MGM Growth Properties (NYSE:MGP) and American Renal Associates (NYSE:ARA) this week, the first tech IPO of the year doesn't appear to be following suit. While the below-range pricing could be viewed as being priced right to ""work"", the reality is that non-profitable tech growth stories are still a tough sell in this environment. SCWX stock was described as oversubscribed early in the week, but reports of price sensitivity emerged as the week progressed."

3964472,72095,2016-04-11T13:45:34-04:00,"SecureWorks will be going public this month after its roadshow starting on April 11, 2016.The technology IPO market and the general IPO market have been relatively slow recently due to market uncertainty and volatility.Valuation is extremely uncertain as is the projected outcome of the IPO.","Introduction to SecureWorksIf you've heard of Dell computers, which is now private, then you're close to learning about SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX). Just like Dell, SecureWorks is a subsidiary of Denali Holdings and was acquired by Dell in 2011 (Nasdaq). SecureWorks is a cyber security company that helps its customers, which are a variety of corporations, protect their computer systems from hackers (WSJ) via a subscription service and contracts (Nasdaq). About 80% of SecureWorks revenues are generated from the subscription services part of the business that primarily handles the management of security (Channelnomics). The other services range from firewall protection to consulting, including web and email security as well as many other monitoring and management services. Clients vary among size and industry, but are primarily Fortune 100 or mid-size firms. SecureWorks also is a global company and has spread its services across the United States, Middle East, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa (Wikipedia). The company's largest customer is Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which brings in about 12% of revenues (Nasdaq).Additionally, SecureWorks manages a platform focused on counter threat that focuses on preventative cyber security measures, such as suspicious activity and malicious events detection. ""The platform aggregates as many as 150 billion incidents to represent activity or trends across the client's network"" (Nasdaq). The platform was designed to find trends and continuously build off of its prior ""knowledge"" in order to pick up on security threats before they even arrive. The platform also includes incident response features (Nasdaq).SecureWorks is looking to go public this month on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""SCWX."" If the company is able to follow through, it is notorious for possibly being the first US technology firm to go public in 2016, which has been very rare recently. The last company to file was a no-name Chinese company in December of 2015 (WSJ). SecureWorks plans on using any proceeds from the offering for working capital, operations, and/or investments, such as acquisitions to expand (Channelnomics).Now let's take a look at why the SecureWorks IPO is a dangerous idea for investors to become involved with.Why you should be cautiousYour first warning sign should be the painfully slow IPO market. The way the company is going about their initial public offering is as though it is making itself a guinea pig. According to the Wall Street Journal, ""SecureWorks will likely sell a relatively small portion of itself in the offering because of uncertainty over how investors will receive it in a tough IPO market."" With so much uncertainty, to the point where the company only has one foot in the door, why are they going public? If they are successful after the initial market excitement that tends to follow technology IPOs, then it is supposed to be an indication of a healthier IPO market (WSJ). Personally, I would like to see this situation turned around before I consider investing in this IPO.With all the volatility recently, which would take a separate article of its own just to analyze, the IPO market has not been faring too well. One technology IPO is not going to turn that around. This past quarter was noticeably slower with technology IPOs, which are generally in abundance. Only nine deals pulled through and only raised about $1.2bn combined. Market analysts don't believe that this quarter or even this year is going to show a turnaround (WSJ).As I wrote further down in this article, the valuation of SecureWorks had to be discounted because of the trend in industry peers. Market participants seem to be concerned that technology companies are far overvalued and that SecureWorks is no different, despite its age and sophistication. Many might try to say otherwise because of its connection to Dell and Denali, but the company hasn't even turned a profit yet even though its past reported annual revenues jumped by 30% (WSJ). Why would an investor put their money where there is almost no sign of making steady money? The excitement of ""Mr. Market"" is not enough to pull SecureWorks through.ValuationBefore it went private, Dell acquired SecureWorks in 2011 for about $612 million when the target's revenues were just over $120 million. In FY 2015, revenues increased by about 27% from $172.8 million in 2014 to $262.1 million (Inorganic Growth). For FY16, revenues increased 30% to about $340MM. SecureWorks has not generated any profit, however. In FY14, net losses amounted to $44.5MM. In FY15, losses came in at $38.5MM. For the fiscal year 2016, SecureWorks reported net losses of $72.3MM. The primary reason for the increase in net losses was the nearly 50% spike in operating expenses. SecureWorks is expected to raise only $150MM from going public because of their small starting offer (Nasdaq).So far, with so little time before the IPO valuation of SecureWorks is very uncertain. Originally, the company's own valuation had it pegged at $2MM (Channelnomics) with some analysts giving it a nearly $3MM value because of the increased sales (Nasdaq). Many of its peers in the industry, though have lowered their own valuations because of the rocky industry and SecureWorks followed suit to be less than $2MM (WSJ). The elephant in the room seems to be asking, though, how the valuation drastically changes from Dell's acquisition in 2011 for $612MM to the $2MM it is offering to the market this month? Going off of the 2011 valuation by Dell, one third of SecureWorks, which is supposedly the chunk being offered, would be about $200MM. Going solely off of revenues, that chunk would then be worth over $100MM (Re/Code). So where is that gap coming from? Perhaps it is all about the net losses, but there could be something else fundamentally wrong, such as the fact that it fed off of its parent like a parasite since it was acquired.ConclusionIn the age of constant cyber attacks, a company like SecureWorks that handles IT security and cyber hackers would seem like a plausible investment choice. Its services are in high demand and has very reputable customers like JPMorgan. There are many factors that could play into the consistent losses over the past decade and a half. IT takes a lot of intelligence and R&D in order to remain successful in a rapidly growing industry. It is uncertain the real reason for such large operating expenses as there aren't any financial statements filed with the SEC right now. Simply scratching the surface, however, is enough to prove that SecureWorks is far from a stable investment choice."
3978744,84596,2016-05-31T09:19:55-04:00,"Strong recurring revenue profile with a growing sticky customer base and major industry tailwinds.Lack of profitability, large well-funded competitors, and relatively low gross margins are pressures on the stock.Company may present an attractive investment opportunity in the future but investors need to see execution of the business over the next few quarters before paying higher multiples.","Disclosure: All the information in this article is based on SecureWorks' S-1/A filed 4/11/16 and my personal views. The link to the SEC filing is here.SummarySecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX) is a 16-year-old company focused on providing intelligence-driven security services to enterprise, SMB, and government customers. The company was acquired by Dell in 2011 for $612mm and recently IPO'd for $1.12bn as part of Dell's financing strategy to purchase EMC (NYSE:EMC). The company offers Managed Security and Consulting Services to 4,200 clients in 59 countries. Approximately, 80% of FY16 revenue is recurring from managed security contracts with an average duration of 2 years.About half of the managed security clients pay full contract value upfront. The managed security space is highly competitive and fragmented with large well-funded corporations such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), which currently has the largest market share at ~4%, and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). SecureWorks is the only pure-play cyber security-focused company in the space with ~3% market share in 2015 according to Gartner research.The company's main technology evolves around a Counter Threat Platform (""CTP"") that analyzes 160bn global events daily and uses machine learning to seek out common traits of potential security threats. The platform is a multi-tenant, distributed architecture meaning that multiple groups of users can access the platform with each computing entity having separate processing power and memory so that a failure allows other entities to pick up the slack.This is incredibly important for a service that is trying to prevent threats which are occurring 24/7. According to management, the number of events analyzed by the CTP doubles every 16 months creating a large network effect that compounds as more customers are added allowing better threat prevention. This engine fuels many of the other products that the company offers.Unfortunately, SCWX is currently unprofitable with negative FCF and so is hard to value using traditional valuation metrics such as P/E, EV/EBITDA, and FCF yield. As such, the best way to ""value"" SCWX is the company's TAM (Total Addressable Market) and its EV/Sales multiples in relation to other comparable companies. For this reason, this write-up will not serve as a valuation analysis but rather a primer on the company and what investors would like to see executed in order to increase the valuation they are willing to pay.Business ModelOne of the most important aspects of SecureWorks business model is the vendor-neutral approach to the market. The company can integrate with many other security products and licenses many solutions directly from point solution providers such as Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) to provide an even more useful security offering.Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems are now commoditized products but as new threats are detected, innovators will develop new security products that can handle these threats better than existing solutions. SecureWorks will be able to license this tech to always stay ahead of threat prevention, which wouldn't be possible if the company only worked with certain vendors.SecureWorks employs a direct sales team to execute a ""land and expand"" sales strategy. This means the company goes in selling a specific solution, whether consulting or managed security, and then upsells other solutions later effectively lowering their initial customer acquisition costs. In FY16, ~6% of sales were due to channel partners, which the company has outlined as a key focus going forward.Channel partners also help to lower customer acquisition costs and shorten the sales cycle (which can be over 12 months for large enterprise customers) although there is typically a rev share that will affect the total sales collected per customer, presumably made up in volume. Dell will continue to be a large channel partner for the company going forward.The company's pricing model is highly flexible and depends on the following variables: level of management requested (fully-managed, co-managed, or monitored), number of solutions selected, and number of users/devices covered. Managed security solutions are recurring contracts ranging from 1-3 years of contract life. Consulting engagements are one-time fees with lower margins due to the human capital needed although customers can pay a retainer type fee for the Incident Response team who handles breaches.Reinvestment of capital goes directly towards R&D, the Counter Threat Platform and building out the sales team. In order to maintain its leadership position in the Managed Security Market, SecureWorks needs to innovate on new products particularly cloud security and endpoint protection as mobile and cloud usage is only gaining more traction. The Counter Threat Platform needs to improve its algos to better parse through threat data and the Counter Threat Unit research teams need to continue expanding to learn about new breaches and feed this data to improve the platform.Market OpportunityAccording to Gartner, the Managed Security Services market is forecasted to grow at a 14% CAGR over the next 3 years compared to the general IT Outsourcing market growing at an 11% CAGR. In 2015, the managed security market was $8.7bn with SecureWorks having a 3.2% market share. The top 10 in the market only accounted for 34% of the market with no company having more than 5% share. The fragmented market presents an opportunity for SecureWorks to gain share as the only pure-play managed security company competing against larger IT services providers and telcos.Other qualitative trends that are apparent in the market is the increasing complexity of security point solutions and lack of trained talent in the security industry. These are tailwinds for managed security providers as it is harder to hire to set up in-house security teams, difficult to manage the Qualys/FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE)/Palo Alto Networks (to name a few) different security solutions, and a time drain to set up more compliance/regulatory guidelines to comply with government rules. Managed Security providers handle all of these while significantly reducing the costs for the customers.CustomersSecureWorks serves customers across various industries including: financial services, manufacturing, technology, retail, healthcare, insurance and utilities. Financial Services customers were 39% of 2016 revenue (Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was 9%) and manufacturing customers were 18%. The company's flexible pricing model splits the customer base between various sizes: Enterprise was 64% of 2016 revenues, SMB was 30% and Government was 6%. This benefits the company as it has the ability to see threats at all levels of company size and industry and provide that info to the Counter Threat Platform to detect future threats.ProductsThe Counter Threat Platform utilizes Forsee - a machine learning algo that score events to determine the degree of the threat and the Multi-Purpose Logic Engine to sort through daily events and find actionable insights. Other products include firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and endpoint threat detection software. These are offered as part of the managed security and threat intelligence product set which are sold in recurring revenue contracts. The goal of these products is to provide visibility into threats and prevent potential issues.The security & risk consulting and incident response teams are short-term human capital heavy projects such as compliance/regulatory testing and immediate remedy of security breaches. The incident response team can be paid as a recurring retainer fee while the consulting fees are one-off.Valuation and FinancialsThe company has grown revenues in the upper 20% range for the past 3 years and according to Wall Street consensus estimates is projected to grow >20% for the next couple of years as well. In FY2016, the company grew 24% and reached revenue of $341.6mm. Gross margins were at ~52%. SecureWorks has great unit economics with CAC/LTV ratios of 3.8x that have held steady over the past 3 years according to management.This means that the company is acquiring each customer profitably. Since ~90% of managed security customers renewed their contracts over the past 3 years, the company is experiencing ~10% churn. However, the company has also had >~100% retention ratios over that same time period meaning that SecureWorks has successfully been upselling additional products (land and expand strategy) and making up for whatever churn occurs.As of January 2016, the company had $28.6mm of MRR (monthly recurring revenue). On an ARR basis, the company has $343mm of revenue already ""booked"" for next year. Since the retention ratios are great and churn moderate, we can expect to actually see all of this revenue recur in the next year regardless of new customer growth. As such, the company has ~82% of the consensus Wall Street revenue estimate of $420mm in revenues for Fiscal Year 2017 booked.Based on consensus Wall Street estimates and the IT services competitors and security companies mentioned in the S-1/A, SecureWorks is trading at 2.3x NTM revenues compared to security companies trading ~4x and other IT services companies trading ~2.5x but with less growth.SecureWorks is trading at a discount to other companies for many reasons including: revenue concentration, lower gross margins, unprofitability, and the Dell voting ownership overhang (Dell still owns 98.6% voting power in the company). However, with the significant future growth expected from the company compared to other IT services companies, investors may be able to acquire SecureWorks at a cheaper revenue multiple now than where it may trade in the future.Investors will be watching many things over the following quarters to pay more for the company including: improving gross margins due to international expansion (higher utilization of counter threat unit research teams already established internationally) and outsourcing of talent to cheaper locations like India, continued rapid growth of recurring revenue, and operating leverage to show the path to profitability. Personally, I will be waiting to see how the next couple of quarters progress before initiating a position but definitely will keep this one on the radar."

The market was estimated to be worth $106.32 billion in 2015. North America is expected to continue to be the largest market on the basis of spending while Latin American and Asia-Pacific regions will see the highest growth rates.SecureWorks' HistoryAtlanta-based SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX) was founded in 1999 by Michael Pearson and Joan Wilbanks to deliver information security offerings to companies worldwide. By 2011, the company was offering Security-as-a-Service solutions which included Managed-Security Services, Security and Risk Consulting Services, and Threat Intelligence. It was an attractive target for Dell, which was expanding its enterprise offerings. Dell agreed to acquire SecureWorks for an estimated $612 million in 2011. At the time of the acquisition, SecureWorks was trending at revenues north of $120 million.In the years to follow, though, Dell itself turned into a private organization. Last year, Dell announced its lofty $67 billion acquisition of EMC (EMC). Given the size of the acquisition, Dell has had to rethink its business portfolio. As part of the re-organization, Dell announced plans to list SecureWorks instead of merging it with the EMC-owned RSA security offering.SecureWorks's OfferingsToday, SecureWorks is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions focused on defending cyber attacks. Its suite of solutions enables organizations to prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity in real-time, prioritize and respond rapidly to security breaches, and predict emerging threats.SecureWorks' proprietary Counter Threat Platform is the basis of its intelligence-driven information security solution. It has been built with the ability to provide global visibility into the threat landscape. The platform aggregates as many as 150 billion incidents to represent activity or trends across the client's network. Its platform then analyzes these events with sophisticated algorithms to discover malicious activity and deliver security countermeasures, dynamic intelligence and valuable context regarding the intentions and actions of cyber adversaries. The platform keeps learning from experience and is able to deliver enhanced actionable security information and incident response measures.SecureWorks' FinancialsSecureWorks operates on a subscription-based service for its managed security and threat intelligence solutions. Additionally, it also generates revenues from security and risk consulting engagements through fixed price or retainer-based contracts. Its revenues grew 27% in 2015 to $262.1 million and 19% in 2014 to $172.8 million. Last week, it reported its fiscal 2016 revenues which grew 30% to $339.5 million. Despite its size and age, the company has not turned in profits. Net losses for fiscal 2015 came in at $38.5 million, compared with $44.5 million for 2014 and $41.5 million in fiscal 2013. Recently reported fiscal 2016 losses grew 88% to $72.3 million driven by 47% growth in operating expenses.SecureWorks has over 4,100 customers spread across 61 countries. Its customer list includes names like Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Barclays Capital (NYSE:BCS) and Citigroup Global Markets (NYSE:C). Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is its biggest customer and it generated 12% of its revenues last year.Dell plans to float 20% of SecureWorks' stock in the listing that's expected to hit the stock markets later this month. It is expected to raise $150 million through the listing. Latest valuation estimates are not known, but back in June last year, analysts estimated that SecureWorks was valued at close to $2 billion. Given their current revenue number, the valuation will likely be upwards of $3 billion."
3962956,61281,2016-04-04T11:24:41-04:00,"Dell’s SecureWorks is expected to go public soon.The 18-year-old cyber security company has a net loss, disappointing margins, and questionable ability to operate independently from its parent company.Even though cyber security is a great segment for the long haul, SecureWorks is not the best peak right now.","Shortly after Dell and EMC (NYSE:EMC) announced the expected merger between the two computing giants last year, speculation started around the businesses that Dell will offload in order to finance the massive $67B deal. Many tried to assess how Dell and EMC would merge their cyber security divisions, software divisions, professional services, and more as they formed the new computing behemoth. Investors look closely to see what the efficiencies that the merger brings and which assets Dell offers to the highest bidder to help finance the deal. Last week, Dell made one of the most significant steps in offloading assets when the company announced that Japan's NTT agreed to buy Dell's IT services unit (aka Perot Systems) for an amount slightly above $3B.The second significant step Dell made is to take its cyber security company, SecureWorks (Pending:SCWX), public and slightly reduce the substantial size of the Dell-EMC cyber security business that includes, besides SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal, and VMware's NSX. Even though SecureWorks filed its S-1 in December of last year, unrest in the markets and private market valuation bubble concerns drove many companies to halt their IPO plans until the markets settled down. So far in 2016, the markets have not settled down, and the IPO market is experiencing its slowest first quarter since 2009, as shown in the chart below. However, Dell has to proceed with its plans to complete the EMC deal, which leaves no other way than to take SecureWorks public despite the current IPO market.Looking at the IPO, SecureWorks does not offer any tremendous opportunity to investors. The 18-year-old company has been around for a while, and it managed to survive the dot-com bubble burst and the financial crisis before it was acquired by Dell in 2011 to boost its services business. SecureWorks has an extensive cyber security offering that varies from firewalls and managed security services to incident response and threat intelligence. Even though SecureWorks is a cyber security veteran, company losses have widened in the last four years alongside top-line growth, as shown in the chart below.The financials trend above shows that SecureWorks generates an increasing amount of revenues each year. However, growing operating expenses drive the negative operating income, which is slightly offset by a significant tax benefit. This financial growth model might fit a small, growing startup and not to a well-established tech firm with almost two decades of experience. Like many startups, SecureWorks needed an external cash injection that came in the form of $22M of convertible debt that was issued in mid-2015, carries a 5% interest rate and has an automated conversion in case of IPO that will entitle its holders to a 20% discount on the IPO share price. Most of the company's cash generated from issuing that convertible debt, which serves as another indicator that the company is not mature enough to go public.Some might say that SecureWorks worked within a huge corporation and didn't have to break even or generate a positive bottom line, which is a fair statement as long as the business operates as a private fully-owned subsidiary of Dell. However, when the public is offered to buy a piece of the company, they need to rely on the company that it can stand by itself and not seek additional cash injection from the parent company when needed? SecureWorks will be similar to VMWare when most of the company is kept private by Dell and its affiliates and a limited number of the shares of ahres are listed for trading. However, while VMWare has almost $1B in net income, an 84% gross margin, and 3 P/S ratios profitable with attractive multiples, SecureWorks generated a net loss of $72M with a 46% gross margin and a P/S ratio of 6. VMWare is more than capable of standing by itself. However, in SecureWorks' case, it's not that clear.An 18-year-old company with an increasing net loss, disappointing margins and multiples, and serious doubts as to whether it could stand by itself as it goes public at terrible market timing just to finance a tiny portion of the Dell-EMC deal and inject additional cash is not an investment I would make. While I believe that cyber security is a great segment to invest in for the long haul, SecureWorks is not a company in which I would like to have a piece. Investors should be very careful before they leap into this IPO."
3771716,70035,2015-12-22T13:13:59-05:00,SecureWorks is an Atlanta-based cybersecurity business.Dell took over Secure Works in 2011 for $612 million.SEC filing suggests SecureWorks put in a placeholder figure.SecureWorks lost nearly $57.5 million in sales compared to last year.Dell is shedding non-core assets in light of EMC acquisition in October.,"It is an interesting time to be in tech. The old guard are adapting to new ways. Dell has been opaque about its attempts to take its company into the future by abandoning hardware. Now, Dell is focusing today's tech issues like big data and security.To prove its commitment to the cause, Dell acquired SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX) in 2011 for $612 million. SecureWorks is a cyber-security company that focuses on providing managed security and network security at the enterprise level. It'd direct competitors are the likes of Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Now, SecureWorks is planning an IPO to raise cash for operational costs.In light of Dell's recent $67 billion acquisition of data giant EMC, some suggest that Dell is relieving itself of its initial investments.Because its parent company has taken on so much debt, SecureWorks needs to find a way to ensure that its funding is not cut off at the knees. All proceeds will go to SecureWorks' own corporate investment. This means the company does not plan to share its earnings with Dell or anyone else owned by the parent company.SecureWorks told the SEC that it expects to raise $100 million from the IPO; however, this is a common placeholder figure. SecureWorks may be worth as much as $2 billion. This valuation is not final and further details are expected.Who is SecureWorks?SecureWorks is now known as Dell SecureWorks. The company has operated under this name since the Dell takeover in 2012.The company aims for a broad focus on IT security for enterprises. In addition to combating threats, the company also focuses on firewall management services. Its global headquarters is in Atlanta. The company performs much of its security research there in collaboration with other US offices.SecureWorks has won several industry awards both in the United States and in Europe over the last few years. It was the SC Magazine Award winner in 2015 in America and in 2014 in Europe. SecureWorks also routinely wins industry awards for its place as a top IT vendor at the midmarket level. It has been winning these awards regularly since 2007.A Secure InvestmentSecureWorks sets industry standards in an area of IT that is rapidly growing. Rather than operating as part of a conglomerate or trying to juggle multiple hats, SecureWorks offers a singular focus on security solutions.SecureWork's revenue went up 29% compared to 2014. The first nine months of 2014 saw $245.4 million in revenue. Its health growth rate could leave the window open for it to reach the $2 billion valuation, making it more valuable than gold at today's prices..SecureWork's focus earned it 4,100 customers including behemoth customer Bank of America. Bank of America accounts for 12% of its turnover.Ducking Out of the Dell DealThough SecureWorks is not the ideal IPO, it is not a reason to stay away on its own. Its SecureWorks's parent company that should keep investors away.Some analysts suggest that the time is not right for Dell to set SecureWorks free. Although its revenue continues to grow, its losses are also growing at an alarming pace. SecureWorks's losses grew from $8.8 million to $18.5 million in a single year.SecureWorks could stand to live under the Dell umbrella a bit longer. Yet, SecureWorks's losses are nothing compared to its parent company's financial state. Dell has swung between profit and loss for several years. Between 2013 and 2015, it went from a $2.4 billion profit to a $1.2 billion loss.Dell is doing everything it can to make the largest tech takeover of all time happen. Dell borrowed $50 billion to grab EMC. This $50 billion does not include the debt it already owned. Now, Dell is selling off its parts to raise money.The EMC deal is not done yet. Dell is leveraging itself significantly for a deal that is seeing issues on multiple fronts. Tax issues and problems with VMWare's stocks continue to plague the acquisition. Both Dell and EMC may sound confident now but the deal is far from over. The state that this acquisition will leave Dell in is currently unknown.The Bottom LineSecureWorks has a good customer base and a valuable reputation but that is not enough to prevent this small fish from becoming a casualty of the risky EMC merger. The rate at which Dell is considering spinning off its assets suggests that it has not yet had the time to consider whether the SecureWorks is ready to go public. Hedging a bet on SecureWorks involves hedging a bet on Dell. It is too early in Dell's enormous, debt-ridden game plan to consider SecureWorks to be a safe bet."

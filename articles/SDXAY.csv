With attractive relative valuation and strong historical performance, Sodexo’s recovery is going to be quick and solid.Sodexo S.A. is a French food services and facility management company operating worldwide with a presence in 80 countries and a workforce counting over 425,000 employees. Every day, the company serves over 75 million consumers, with approximately a third of them representing corporate clients and about two-fifths of the total consisting of education and healthcare professionals.Source: Sodexo's investor presentationLooking at headlight figures of Sodexo’s most recent quarterly earnings announcement, year-on-year revenues have declined by more than 30 percent to €3.91 billion. This is a considerable hit which management of the company addressed with the following words:As a recent study indicates that more than half of Brits are keen to return to stadiums and cultural venues as soon as they become available again, Sodexo, with its new programme, seems prepared to provide solutions to help clients reopen safely, efficiently, and successfully.From the perspective of financial statements, Sodexo has strong profitability metrics (double-digit ROE) and sustainable level of long-term debt on its balance sheet (long-term debt representing around 45 percent of total capital).Plugging in Sodexo's financial statement figures into my DCF template, the company's shares seem to be substantially undervalued. Under the perpetuity growth method with assumptions of a terminal growth rate of 2 percent, 2.6 percent annual revenue growth over the next five years, and fixed operating earnings margin of 5 percent, the model's estimate of intrinsic value of the stock comes at 244 EUR. Under the EBITDA multiple approach of a discounted cash flow model, the intrinsic value per share value of the company stands roughly at 117 USD if we assume that the appropriate exit EV/EBITDA multiple in five years' time is around 10x.Source: Author's own modelTo sum up, Sodexo is an outstanding company with its shares currently trading at very inexpensive levels (Price to Earnings Ratio, 13.58x; Price to Sales Ratio, 0.69x). With signs of share price stabilization and non-cyclical nature of the industry the company operates in, the downside risks of potential investment might be largely limited while the upside potential on economic recovery significant. Lastly, in the current low-interest-rate environment, Sodexo can showcase an exceptional track record of dividend payouts, making it a safe bet in the post-pandemic recovery."
4162837,95206,2018-04-13T09:05:39-04:00,"Sodexo is the second-largest global player in the fragmented market for catering and facility management services.Food services companies run fairly resilient businesses throughout the economic cycle, underpinned by multi-year contracts with customers.While profitability levels aren't high, these are asset-light businesses that earn decent returns on investment and generate strong free cashflows.Following a reduction in guidance earlier this year, Sodexo's stock price has declined meaningfully and the company is now worth taking a close look.","Despite operating in an industry that is rarely at the center of attention of the investment community, Sodexo (OTCPK:SDXAY)(OTCPK:SDXOF) is a solid and resilient consumer discretionary company that is worth putting on your radar for a number of reasons described in more detail below. Founded in 1966 by Pierre Bellon in Marseille, France, Sodexo is the second-largest food services company globally. As of the end of 2017, the company served over 100m customers daily in 80 countries, employing some 427’000 people worldwide.The company organizes itself along two main segments: i.) on-site services, and ii.) benefit & reward services. In 2017, on-site services accounted for 96% of sales and 77% of operating profits, while benefit & reward services accounted for only 4% of sales but 23% of operating profits. Across both reporting segments, food services account for 66% of total sales, with other services such as facility-management accounting for over 30% of sales. The company derived 44% of sales from North America, 38% from Europe, and 18% from the rest of the world in 2017.Source: Sodexo Investor Presentation 2017 According to market-leader Compass Group Plc, the global food services market amounts to over US$ 250 billion annually. It is a highly-fragmented market, in which less than 25% is served by global companies such as Compass Group, Sodexo, and a few other players. Smaller, regional players account for another 25% of the global market, leaving a sizable 50% of the market self-operated, which represents a structural growth opportunity related to the ongoing trend of outsourcing to drive cost savings. Overall, the global food services market is expected to grow at about 4% over the next decade.Source: Compass Group FactsheetSodexo operates in what is essentially a duopoly, as far as global players are concerned. The market leader, Compass Group Plc, holds a global market share of approx. 11% in 2017, while Sodexo is the #2 player with a global market share of approx. 9%.As such, Sodexo holds a strong competitive position in this market, protected by customer switching costs, as well as some level of intangible assets related to brand name and a small cost advantage from scale versus smaller regional players.Customer switching costs stem from the fact that food services contracts are typically multi-year agreements, with legacy contracts ranging from 3 to 5 years. More recently, Sodexo has pursued a differentiated strategy, whereby it aims to sell ‘integrated contracts’ to its clients, combining food services with other facility-management activities. Not only are such integrated contracts of greater length (for example, Sodexo signed a 10y contract with Rio Tinto in 2016), they also serve to further embed the firm into their client’s activities. As a result, client retention rates in the industry are extremely high. For instance, Sodexo boasts a 90%+ client retention rate over the past decade, and a client retention rate of 94% in 2017.Another aspect that differentiates Sodexo from its competition is its benefits & reward services segment, which offers pre-paid vouchers (such as a meal pass, gift pass, culture pass, sport pass, childcare pass, mobility pass, …) to employees on behalf of their employers. This is a highly profitable and asset-light business, which contributes over 20% of the firm’s operating earnings.Overall, we would argue that as one of only two global food services providers in a highly-fragmented market, Sodexo is well-positioned to benefit from the structural growth of what remains largely under-penetrated market.Profitability, capital efficiency, and returns on investment:While profitability levels in the food services industry aren’t particularly high, as these represent services of low value-added to customers, they are remarkably stable, even during severe macroeconomic downturns. As shown next page, over the past 10 years, Sodexo has consistently achieved operating margins of 5-6%. This is of course helped by the fact that there is a high share of recurring revenues via multi-year contracts. There is some operating leverage built into these business models, and Sodexo will typically benefit from a higher growth environment in expanding operating margins (and vice versa).While not terribly attractive in terms of profitability levels, food services companies such as Sodexo are very capital-light businesses, both in terms of fixed assets and working capital requirements. As a result, the average asset turn over the past 10 years is nearly 1.5x, while the invested capital and equity turns are approx. 2.5x and 6.0x respectively.Therefore, Sodexo consistently generates ROICs and ROEs in excess of our hurdle rates, averaging nearly 10% and 18% respectively over the past 10 years.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonGrowth:Sodexo’s growth profile over the past decade is pretty indicative of what one can expect from the company going forward. Once again, perhaps the main thing that stands out is how resilient the underlying business is, even during weak macroeconomic backdrops such as the 2008-2009 period. Having said that, it should be noted that the growth rates below incorporate external growth via acquisitions, and that Sodexo did make meaningful acquisitions in 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2017.Looking forward, total sales should grow slightly in excess of global GDP growth, at approx. 4% p.a.. Operating profits and EPS can reasonably be expected to grow a tad faster, resulting in mid-single-digit EPS growth rate.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonCashflows:As an asset-light business model, Sodexo is a highly cash-generative company. This is helped by the fact that the company holds little to no inventory, and is typically able to collect receivables within 70 days. As a result, its cash conversion cycle is only 40 days on average over the past decade, with working capital averaging only 10% of sales.Predictably, earnings quality and cash conversion are therefore very high. Over the past decade, cash from operations has averaged over 150% of net income, and free cash flow has averaged over 100% of net income.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonSodexo is in a strong financial position which affords the company a significant amount of flexibility. At the end of fiscal 2017, the company had over € 3’500m in debt, over € 2’000m in cash & equivalents, and about € 3’500m in shareholders’ equity. Its net debt to equity stood at about 40%, and net debt to EBITDA stood at 1x. Note that these figures exclude approx. EUR 900m held as restricted cash and financial assets related to the benefits & rewards services activity, which, if included to the firm’s cash & equivalents, would further reduce leverage metrics.Sodexo’s debt load of EUR 3.5b at the end of 2017 carried an average cost of 2.4%. Over 90% of the debt is contracted at a fixed interest rate. Nearly 60% of the debt load is EUR-denominated, while the rest is mainly US$-denominated. Nearly 60% of the firm’s debt load has a maturity of over 5 years.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonAs is not uncommon for family-owned businesses, Sodexo has had a very low level of management turnover throughout its corporate history. Pierre Bellon founded the company and ran it as CEO between 1966 and 2005, at which point he became Chairman of the Board. He remained Chairman of the Board until 2016, until his daughter Sophie Bellon took over. It is also worth noting that another 4 family members are also on the company’s Board of Directors.Michel Landel ran Sodexo as CEO between 2005 and 2018, and has completed a 30+ year career at the company. In January 2018, Denis Machuel was appointed as Sodexo’s new CEO. Previously, he ran the firm’s highly profitable benefits & rewards services segment and has been at the company since 2007.Sodexo’s historical track record of capital allocation decisions paints a remarkably coherent and consistent picture. First and foremost, the company aims to achieve profitable growth of approx. 4-7% p.a. over the mid-term by a combination of organic and external growth via acquisitions. Remaining cashflows are typically returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Source: Thomson Reuters EikonAs shown below, capital expenditures in productive assets as well as acquisitions have accounted for approx. 60% of the firm’s cumulative operating cash over the past decade, split more or less equally. The remaining 40% have been returned to shareholders, mainly via dividends (30%) and share buybacks (10%).The Group’s dividend policy is ‘aimed at securing long-term shareholder loyalty’ by a regularly increasing the dividend, a dividend payout ratio of around 50% of net income, and a dividend premium of 10% for shareholders who have held their shares in registered form for an unbroken period of at least four years (capped at 0.5% of the share capital for any single shareholder).This is a rather unusual combination of items, but which combined are clearly in the interest of income-focused investors. And the dividend premium of 10% for long-term shareholders is a nice touch.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonLooking at the company’s dividend track record since 1992, or a 26-year period, one can observe that the company has never cut its dividend, although it did freeze it for a couple of years on a number of occasions (1993-1995, 2000-2001, 2002-2003, 2008-2009). On the positive side, the company has increased its regular dividend per share at a CAGR of 9% over the past decade, and 11% since 1992.The fiscal 2017 dividend rate of € 2.75 per share represents a yield of 3.5% at today’s price, vs. 2.4% for the MSCI World and 3.2% for the CAC 40. The EPS and CFO payout ratios stand at approx. 57% and 39% respectively. Considering the reasonable payout ratio, the strong balance sheet, and the firm’s resilient underlying business, we rate the dividend as very safe presently. We believe that the company will grow the dividend at about the same pace as long-term earnings per share growth of about 5.0%, which together with the current 3.5% yield, leads to a total return proposition of 8.5%. This only just about matches our current hurdle rate for a (defensive) consumer discretionary company such as Sodexo.Last, please note that the dividend is paid out annually, typically throughout the month of February. Dividend payments from public French companies are subject to a 30% withholding tax. Having said that, under the double taxation treaty between the U.S. and France, U.S. investors are only subject to a 15% withholding tax. This does however require some paperwork. Whether you are considering investing in the shares listed on the Paris stock exchange, or the American Depositary Share (ADR), you should first assess the tax consequences of such an investment.We model Sodexo’s intrinsic value using a range of valuation methodologies including a discounted cashflow model, a dividend discount model, earnings power, and multiples, to derive a fair value estimate of approx. € 90-100 per share, or an upside of 15-20%.To give you more details on the main inputs to our DCF model, we assume sales to grow at a CAGR of only 3% over the next 10 years, average EBIT margins just shy of 6%, a 2% terminal growth rate, and a WACC of 7% (CoE of 9%, CoD of 2.7%, and equity ratio of 80%).Looking at forward (FY18) valuation multiples based on consensus estimates, we would argue that Sodexo is attractively priced relative to its historical trading range. The current forward PE multiple of about 15x is sensibly below both its 10y and 20y averages of 18x and 20x respectively.According to our estimates, the forward free cash flow yield is close to 7%, and EV/EBIT is about 11x, both of which are reasonable in today’s market.The Bellon family owns slightly over 40% of the outstanding shares, but control nearly 56% of the voting rights. Most of the remaining outstanding shares are held by French and foreign institutions, amongst which First Eagle, Janus, Comgest, Artisan Partners, and DNCA Investments.We generally have a positive inclination towards family businesses, and like the owner-operator model, as it creates a strong alignment of interests between all stakeholders. However, we do believe that it is very important for family-owned businesses to adhere to sensible corporate governance practices, and think long and hard about succession planning. Here, we take comfort in the fact that if need be, the company is willing to go outside of the family in order to find the necessary business acumen to run the firm, as evidenced by the recent appointment of a second consecutive CEO that isn’t part of the Bellon family.Source: Sodexo Annual Report 2017Sodexo is a family-owned business that boasts a solid 50+ year corporate history. In that time, the company has established itself as the #2 player in the global food services market, not far behind market leader Compass Group Plc.The company has an ‘installed base’ of over 100 customers and a proven ability to retain and attract new clients, which makes for a highly resilient business. The underlying market is expected to continue to grow steadily as a result of the structural trend of outsourcing, in what remains a largely unpenetrated market. The company consistently runs a profitable business and achieves satisfactory return levels while maintaining a high level of financial strength and flexibility. Despite the second consecutive CEO appointment going to a non-family member, Sodexo remains a family-owned and family-controlled business, which largely aligns the interests of all stakeholders, resulting in a sensible capital allocation policy. Shareholders are regularly remunerated via dividend payments, and long-term shareholders are rewarded for their loyalty.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3787146,50662,2016-01-03T18:58:06-05:00,"Sodexo's 15 year dividend CAGR is almost 10%.On top of that, long-term shareholders receive a 10% dividend boost, incentivizing investors to keep their shares for an extended period of time.The FY 2015 dividend is 22% higher than the FY 2014 dividend. Plus, Sodexo has begun a sizable share repurchase program.Sodexo is a strong buy now on share price weakness, and will remain a long-term hold, as the Bellon family retains nearly 40% ownership.","I have always had a soft spot for companies that not only were built from scratch, but also still have their founders at the helm — and that's the case at Sodexo (OTCPK:SDXOF, OTCPK:SDXAY) (note: 1 share of SDXAY, the ADR, represents one-fifth of an SDXOF common share). Chairman Pierre Bellon is getting ready to step down after 49 years with the company, and his daughter Sophie will step into the chairmanship, very likely continue the his hard work. There are currently no fewer than six Bellons on the company's board, and the Bellon family owns approximately 37% of Sodexo's shares. A family legacy is something I like to see as in investor. SDXAY data by YChartsUnfortunately, Sodexo stock doesn't have a primary listing in the U.S., so instead of trading in the company's shares on the not-very-liquid OTC market, I'd recommend investing in the ticker SW via Euronext Paris. The average daily volume there equates to roughly $27.7 million.2015 was an excellent year for Sodexo, as the weak euro had its advantagesSodexo posted very impressive financial results in 2015 and wasn't hurt by a difficult year on the European markets, thanks to the weaker euro. The company's total revenue increased by 10%, which cannot all be attributed to the weak euro; approximately one-fourth of this top-line growth resulted from organic expansion. This immediately had a huge impact on the company's financial statements, with gross profit and operating profit increasing by double digits.With a 22% increase in operating income providing an operating margin of 5.73%, Sodexo's financials continue to improve as you work down its income statement:Source: Annual report.Thanks to the low-yield environment and further debt reduction (more later), Sodexo's net financial expense fell remarkably, from 173M EUR ($187M) in FY 2014 to just 107M EUR ($116m) in FY 2015. The attributable profit increased by more than 40% to 700M EUR ($756M).Source: Financial statements.And the nicest thing of this all? The conversion of net profit into free cash flow was close to 100% -- something I really like to see. The operating cash flow, adjusted for changes in Sodexo's working capital, was approximately 975M EUR ($1.05B) and after deducting the 302M EUR ($327M) in capital expenditures, the free cash flow was approximately 673M EUR ($727M) for a free cash flow yield of 5%:Source: Financial statements.2016 will be even better, with an expected 8% increase in the operating profitThe company's operating profit increased by around 22% to almost 1.14B EUR ($1.23B). That alone is a decent result, but Sodexo seems to be extremely optimistic about the future, as the official outlook for 2016 calls for another 8% increase in the operating profit, which would add another 90M EUR ($97M) to the equation. This would mean a 2016 operating profit of 1.23B EUR ($1.33B) — impressive considering the higher organic growth rate of 3%.With interest expenses roughly flat, the only party-pooper will be the higher tax bill, but even after taking this into consideration, I expect Sodexo's net profit to increase even faster than its operating income. I think a 10% bump in Sodexo's attributable net profit is quite achievable.This will also have a huge effect on the company's operating and free cash flows, which would provide significantly more financial flexibility. And the reason I like this type of family-controlled company? To protect the family legacy, they will do whatever they can to keep the company healthy. Instead of spending on corporate jets and excessive share repurchase programs, the entire excess free cash flow in FY 2015 was put toward reducing total debt by approximately 1 billion EUR. This big-picture thinking should reduce interest expenses by a few million dollars in the current fiscal year.Source: Company presentation.With approximately 3B EUR ($3.24B) in long- and short-term debt remaining, Sodexo could be debt-free by the end of the decade. However, I would expect the company to reduce its deleveraging rate and do something more shareholder-friendly with the cash. Share repurchases are a good possibility (with an initial $324M program already underway), but the lower finance expenses and higher free cash flows will underpin Sodexo's continual dividend increases. The dividend payable over FY 2015 will be boosted by 22% to 2.20 EUR.Is Sodexo a DGI candidate with a nice hidden kicker?With the euro quite cheap now versus the U.S. dollar, it makes some sense for American investors to take advantage of this favorable exchange rate and invest some cash in European companies. Additionally, I consider Sodexo an excellent candidate for a DGI portfolio, based on this 15-year dividend payout history:Over this time period, even during the global financial crisis, Sodexo has kept the dividend at least stable. The dividend's CAGR from 2000-2015 is 9.55%, with a higher CAGR of 10.26% for the past five years. As I wrote earlier, the dividend for FY 2015 has been confirmed at 2.20 EUR, and is scheduled to be paid on February 10. But there's one very nice feature that might be especially attractive to DGI investors with long-term holding plans Sodexo's by-laws allow for the company to pay a 10% dividend premium to shareholders who have kept their shares for at least 4 consecutive years in a registered form — a very nice kicker for investors who see Sodexo as a long-term investment. If you're interested in buying Sodexo stock, be certain to ask your broker about the documentation required to register your shares to qualify for the 10% dividend premium.Investment thesisSodexo isn't an exciting company, but boring companies can be the best investments. Based on a history of at least 15 years wherein the average annual dividend increase was almost 10% (including two years of holding it steady), Sodexo could be an attractive addition to any DGI portfolio.This doesn't mean Sodexo is a bargain right now, with the company trading at a free cash flow yield of approximately 5%. But fortunately, the yield is expected to grow, as Sodexo makes it its corporate mission to increase profit at a high-single-digit percentage rate. Shares traded at 75 EUR just three months ago, and I would be very interested in initiating a long position if shares retreated to that level (FCF yield at 75 EUR per share would be almost 6%.) Be a sniper, and wait for the right moment to pull the trigger.I'm also mulling over writing a put option with a strike price of 80 EUR, maturing in March, for an option premium of 1 EUR. If I'm assigned to buy the stock, I'll do so at an average price of 79 EUR, and if I'm not, I keep the option premium for a return of 1.25% in 2.5 months — an annualized return of in excess of 5%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3390915,79115,2015-08-04T13:21:31-04:00,Dividend growers who use the CCC list as a screening tool may be missing out on unseen dividend growers.Currency changes with ADR stocks may cause USD dividends to change but the dividends are still going up.A closer look at dividend CAGR shows little variance when currencies are taken into account.Off the radar dividend growers with solid dividend CAGR are out there. Investors just need to find them.,"I almost missed it. I saw it on the name badge of individual serving food in the cafeteria. I had seen it earlier on an employee at a hospital who was waxing the floors. It was also on the back at the bottom of a home care for the elderly brochure I was had been provided. It was right in front of me, but I didn't realize it at first.It was Sodexo (OTCPK:SDXAY). I didn't know anything about the company except that they were obviously in the service industry. But I was curious, and decided to go to work. According to Google Finance:I also learned that Sodexo is one of the largest companies in the world in its business, with 380,000 employees, representing 130 nationalities, present on 34,000 sites in 80 countries. But what I wanted to know were the numbers. I ran the basic quote and came up with a share price of about $91 per share, representing a 1:1 ratio for the ADR to French shares. It has a planned split of 5:1 on 8/11/15, where the SDXAY to French shares will be reduced to a 5:1 ratio. It had a dividend yield of about 2.33% and has been trading between $89.82-$105.99 over the past 52 weeks.I hadn't remembered seeing Sodexo on any dividend grower list in the past, so it was no surprise I didn't know much about them. Nevertheless, I decided to look them up. When I pulled up the chart, I saw gaps in dividends at Google Finance, and I saw different dividend numbers being reported at a variety of sites like Ycharts, Wolfram Alpha and Yahoo. This obviously wasn't a dividend grower.Do You Even Dividend Bro?After seeing this company multiple times in my daily activities, I decided it merited a deeper look. First, I checked to see if they paid a dividend. I went to Sodexo's official site and saw dividend growth that looked like this.I found a 10-year average dividend growth rate of 10.58%, a 5-year dividend growth rate of 6.06% and a dividend freeze in 2010. As of 2015, it would be a dividend contender with 5 years of dividend growth. But obviously these were on the French exchange; I wanted the USD ADR dividends. I had a hard time finding good data, but eventually I came up with this.The numbers were up, down, sideways. The dividends were all over the place. No wonder this never appeared on a dividend grower list. The dividends don't grow year over year.Still, I wanted to take a closer look. I knew it was a euro dividend grower, it just wasn't a USD dividend grower. The variations in the USD to euro exchange rate was the culprit for differences in dividends. What kind of impact would this have on a portfolio, I wondered? So I did the math.I found the 10-year average dividend growth rate in USD ADR to be 9.95% and a 5-year dividend growth rate of 6.84%. Not stellar, not a good Chowder number, but not bad either. I was surprised that the currency effects didn't grossly change my results.In fact, there is less than 1% difference between the two 10-year dividend growth rates and less than half a percent in the 5-year DGR. The year over year USD ADR dividend growth was bumpy, but only due to currency effects. The overall dividend growth was still there and still putting more money in my pocket over the years.But to consider buying a bumpy dividend grower, a stock not on the CCC list due to currency issues, I had to explore the currency idea further.Thought Exercise: Country Of OriginGo out on a limb and let's imagine that the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was founded France. Just change the country, don't change the product, their commitment to dividend growth, or their global sales. Just change the country and give the USA an ADR version. As a result of changing the country of origin, we would have a Coca-Cola ADR with dividend growth that was bumpy due to currency fluctuations. In fact, we'd have times at which the dividend didn't grow, but in fact got smaller due to the exchange rate.The same company with a 53-year history of dividend growth would now under this thought exercise be excluded from many a dividend growth investor's list simply because the USD ADR didn't grow its dividend. Would this mean that the company wasn't worth a closer look? Absolutely not. Would investors at Seeking Alpha's be praising Coca-Cola's impressive history of dividend growth? Well, it depends who you ask.But let's flip this thought exercise on on its head.Let's create a fictional country called Barsaive. On the Barsaive exchange, you can buy Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) equivalent shares 1:1 in as Barsaive Deposit Respository shares. But due to exchange rates between the currency in Barsaive and the USD, PG never makes it onto a dividend grower's list.Would investors in Barsaive be negligent in not considering PG due to bumpy dividends? I would argue that they would.Regardless of where we live, I think we should consider those companies with dividends that are growing, but due to bumpy exchange rates might be excluded from the standard screens that most dividend growth investors use.I submit that dividend bumpiness should not be a hard rule or electric fence issue for dividend growth investors.Back to SodexoAfter examining the numbers, I purchased a very, very small position. But the overall picture discouraged me from buying a whole position today. The P/E ratio is currently around 21, close to the 2-year low, but also at the 13-year median of 21.Of course there is the obvious tax issue with a French ADR. While I appreciate the earnings growth in 2014 over 2013 and the relatively low payout ratio of 42%, I felt like there was a slight slowdown in earnings growth rates over the past 3 years compared to the previous 5- and 10-year earnings per share rates. While the previous 12-month growth rate was 2.9%, the 5-year growth rate was 3.5% and the 10-year was 10.5%. I felt the decreased earnings growth didn't merit average P/E ratio material.That said, I am long the stock with a very, very small position as I feel I can live with the bumpy dividend growth. In fact, I would encourage DGIs with the risk tolerance to enjoy committed bumpy dividend growers to keep an eye out for stocks like Sodexo and other such ADRs.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2985106,44691,2015-03-09T11:04:45-04:00,Sodexo is a well run food service company.Stock is too expensive at this time but could be a buy at the right price.Five year return on the stock has been great.,"Sodexo (OTCPK:SDXAY) is one of the leading food services companies in the world. If you have ever been in a corporate cafeteria, there is a good chance Sodexo operates it. This company has shown decent growth over the past few years.Sodexo is based in France but operates in 80 countries. The company employees 419,000 people. 39% of its revenues come from North America, 41% from Europe and the UK, and 20% from the rest of the world.The places where they operate is unbelievable: offshore drilling rigs, mines, airlines, military bases, and just about anywhere in the world. A few clients include: Mayo Clinic, the Knesset in Israel, William & Mary College, Ensco (ESV) offshore rigs, and BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP). Sadly, an employee was recently killed in the Charlie Hedbo terrorist attack.The company posted €18 billion ($19.62 billion) in the most recent fiscal year. It has 157.1 million shares and trades at €91 ($99.19) for a market cap of €14.3 billion ($15.6). 37.7% of the capital is held by the Bellon family (founders) and 52.4% of voting rights. There is an annoying share of double voting class stock. Also, if stock is held for more than four years, registrants are eligible for an extra 10% in dividends. I don't like these provisions but they do this in Europe.The stock has a dividend of €1.8 ($1.96) for a yield of 2%. Earnings per share is €3.23 ($3.52) for a price to earnings ratio of 28. The company has shown pretty decent growth over the last four years. From fiscal 2010 to 2014 revenues have grown from €15.2 ($16.7) billion to €18 ($19.62) for a growth rate of 4.32%. EPS has grown from €2.64 ($2.9) to €3.23 ($3.52) (5.17% growth) and dividends from €1.35 ($1.47) to €1.8 ($1.96) (7.46% growth). Going back to 2003, it's grown its revenues by a little over 4%.SDXAY data by YChartsSo is it a buy? Not in my opinion. The stock is too expensive. I'm not a huge fan of the PEG (price to earnings to growth ratio) but I'm going to use it in this instance. A price to earnings ratio of 28 divided by a growth rate of 5% equals 5.6. Way too expensive for me. A 2% dividend yield does not get me excited either.Having said that, it's a quality company. It takes very little capital to run cafeterias. With thousands of customers, Sodexo is not too reliant upon any one outfit. The founding family does not allow the share holder base to get diluted (though they have some strange double voting shares). In some ways, Sodexo's financials are almost like college finance 101. Clean revenues, earnings, dividends, not too much debt, and easy to understand assets. I'd buy if the stock fell by quite a bit, maybe 50%.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

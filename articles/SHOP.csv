Shopify has exhibited tremendous business performance and has exciting growth prospects ahead, as there is ample room for the company to keep growing for several years. Nevertheless, as the stock has reached a market capitalization of $134 billion and it is trading at an exceptionally rich valuation level, it has become risky.Shopify provides a cloud-based commerce platform, which helps companies become much more efficient in the current business landscape, in which competition has become fiercer than ever.Shopify benefits from a strong secular trend, namely the shift of consumers from brick-and-mortar shopping to online shopping. This secular shift has greatly accelerated this year thanks to the pandemic, which has rendered online shopping much more attractive than physical shopping. Many merchants were caught off guard in the seismic shift caused by the pandemic and thus Shopify has enjoyed impressive business momentum this year.The tailwind from the coronavirus crisis was evident in the results of Shopify in the second quarter, which was marked by unprecedented lockdowns. Its gross merchandise volume jumped to its highest level in more than five years while the stores selling on Shopify sold 1.5 times what they sold in the fourth quarter of 2019, the strongest quarter of the year from a seasonality point of view. Moreover, the total revenue of Shopify essentially doubled over the prior year’s quarter and it smashed the analysts’ earnings per share estimates ($1.05 vs. consensus of $0.02).Shopify has also taken advantage of the need of merchants for liquidity amid the pandemic. Numerous U.S. merchants accessed capital from Shopify in the second quarter while the company also offered financing to merchants in the U.K. and Canada for the first time. As a result, funding in the second quarter jumped 65% over the prior year’s quarter and the cumulative funding of Shopify in all the regions reached $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. While financing is not the core business of Shopify, it can be an additional growth driver, particularly under the harsh economic conditions prevailing right now.As the secular shift from conventional shopping to e-commerce is only in its early stages, Shopify still has ample room to continue growing for more than a decade. To provide a perspective, in its latest conference call, management stated that the total addressable market for Shopify is $78 billion and the company has captured just a tiny portion of this market so far.The growth potential of Shopify is also evident from the impressive performance record of the company, which is characterized by consistent revenue growth, without any intervals, and has absolutely no signs of fatigue.Source: Investor PresentationAs shown above, Shopify has grown its revenue at eye-opening double-digit rates every year in the last five years.It has also grown consistently its monthly recurring revenue, which is equal to the number of merchants who have a subscription plan times their subscription fee.Source: Investor PresentationShopify has grown its recurring monthly revenues at a 46% compounded average annual rate over the last five years.Recurring revenues are important, as they result in reliable cash flows and thus provide a strong buffer in the event of an unforeseen downturn. It is costly and inefficient for merchants to switch from Shopify to another platform and hence the recurring revenues of Shopify are reliable, particularly given that the merchants who have resorted to Shopify have done so in order to enhance their efficiency.It is also worth noting that Shopify has become the largest holding of the stock portfolio of Lone Pine Capital, currently comprising 8% of the portfolio. Lone Pine Capital is well known for having outperformed the broad market by an exceptionally wide margin since its foundation, in 1997. The fund has been able to outperform the broad market thanks to the exceptional competency of its founder, Stephen Mandel, in identifying stocks with immense growth potential, especially in the tech sector. The large investment of Lone Pine Capital in Shopify is a great endorsement to the quality and the growth potential of this company.Due to its extraordinary rally, Shopify is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 457. This is an extreme valuation level but the company is growing at a fast pace and hence this earnings multiple does not reflect the full valuation picture. A more informative measure is the fact that the stock is currently trading at 23.0 times its expected earnings in 2027, as analysts expect Shopify to grow its earnings per share 20-fold, from $2.39 this year to $47.41 in 2027.Unfortunately, the estimates of analysts are unreliable in such long-term horizons, as many unexpected headwinds may show up over such long periods. Moreover, one could rely on such long-term forecasts if Shopify had a wide business moat and thus it essentially operated without any effects from competition. However, this is not the case for Shopify.The business of e-commerce platforms has very low barriers to entry, as it does not require much capital to build such a platform. This business is the exact opposite of utilities or telecommunications companies, which have to spend enormous amounts to build the infrastructure required to serve their customers and thus there are too high barriers to entry in these businesses. On the contrary, in the business of Shopify, new competitors, with competency in information technology, can enter the market with very low amounts of invested capital.BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) is an example of a competitor which conducted its IPO just two months ago. The company develops e-commerce software and offers it to online retailers. BigCommerce has provided its software to approximately 60,000 online stores in 120 countries so far. In the same way, many other competitors can show up in Shopify's business. These competitors will not only affect the pace of growth of Shopify in the future, but they will also limit the subscription fees it charges to its merchants.On the bright side, the growth potential of this business is so immense that Shopify can continue growing at a high rate for a considerable period, without being affected by its competitors, particularly given its strong business momentum. On the other hand, it is too risky to forecast that Shopify has a decade of uninterrupted, relentless growth ahead in this fast-changing business, which has essentially no barriers to entry. The market has already priced 7 years of tremendous growth in the stock of Shopify, thus rendering the stock highly vulnerable in the event of business deceleration.It is also important to note that Shopify has reached a market capitalization of $134 billion. This is 72% higher than the total addressable market of $78 billion of the company, according to its management. To provide a perspective, Costco (COST) and Target (TGT) have market caps of $166 billion and $82 billion, respectively, and Shopify is just about to exceed the market cap of Exxon Mobil (XOM), which currently stands at $146 billion. While these large-cap companies are not competitors of Shopify, their market cap is useful in understanding how much growth the market has already priced in the stock of Shopify.While analysts expect Shopify to grow its earnings per share 20-fold over the next seven years, from $2.39 this year, to $47.41 in 2027, it is important to note that Shopify has never made a profit in the last eight years. The company has grown its revenue at a tremendous pace throughout this period but its losses have only widened. This is certainly a red flag for the profitability potential of this business model.It is also worth noting that the second quarter of this year was the first quarter with a meaningful profit in the last eight years. As Shopify enjoyed a strong tailwind from the lockdowns caused by the pandemic in that quarter, it is only natural to wonder how the results will be affected when the pandemic subsides. On the bright side, the existing customers of Shopify are not likely to terminate their subscriptions and hence the revenues of Shopify are not likely to decrease if the pandemic subsides. However, its growth pace will certainly be affected whenever the coronavirus crisis subsides.Shopify is an exceptional company, which helps other companies adapt to the challenging business environment of the new decade, and thus it has exciting growth potential ahead. However, the market has already priced the growth of the company in the next seven years in the stock. As there are very low barriers to entry in its business, Shopify may decelerate at some point in the future due to pressure from its competitors or the end of the pandemic. It is also much harder for a company to keep growing at a breathtaking pace as it grows bigger. Whenever Shopify decelerates, its stock will have significant downside risk due to its lofty valuation. At its current valuation level, Shopify would be investable only if it had a wide moat in its business.On the other hand, all the above do not mean that the Shopify's stock will plunge anytime soon. The company has strong business momentum, which is likely to remain in place for a while thanks to the impact of the pandemic on most retailers. As a result, the stock can maintain its positive momentum and its premium valuation for a considerable period. Nevertheless, it is not a sound strategy to rely on the rich valuation of a stock and try to profit from its momentum."
4384984,105619,2020-11-04T16:37:19-05:00,"Shopify's platform offers an unmatched ecosystem of tools and services for merchants looking for effective omnichannel solutions to empower selling activity and analytics.The enterprise SaaS business model includes a success-based component which provides significant operational leverage, as merchants sell more, Shopify makes more money.Shopify is the only at-scale ecommerce operating platform, with competitors offering parts of what the platform does.Over 1m merchants use Shopify's platform ranging from small 1-person companies up to large Fortune 100 names.","We believe Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is superbly positioned to benefit from the increasing proliferation of eCommerce, particularly companies looking to own their own brands. The business has multiple competitive advantages working in its favor, including customer switching costs, network effects and scale. We think it is well-positioned to continue to win as a beneficiary of major secular tailwinds including rising adoption of ecommerce, merchant demand for effective omnichannel sales tools and centralized fulfilment services. Long-term investors looking for a good entry point should keep an eye on the stock, we would strongly advocate a long position near $900 as this would present significant upside to fair value.Shopify was started to solve a problem. Tobias Lütke opened an online snowboard store (Snowdevil) and was dismayed at how difficult it was to start an internet business. It was difficult to build and manage the website, inventory, to engage with customers, and accept payments. Lütke used the open source web application framework Ruby on Rails to build Snowdevil's online store, and launched it in 2 months. The Snowdevil founders launched the platform as Shopify in June 2006.Lütke effectively built Shopify's business with a dogmatic focus on merchant experience, making it as easy as possible to set up an online store. This creates huge value for merchants in the form of time and money saved, and places Shopify in a great position to take a small percentage of a merchant's revenues. Shopify Gross Merchandise Value and Revenue grew at 106% and 95% CAGRs respectively over the past five years, and the stock is up over 3,800% since IPO.Through a series of acquisitions and internally developed initiatives, Shopify has broadened out its capabilities and offerings into a complete end-to-end global commerce operating system for merchants to run their business across all their sales channels. Importantly, merchants own their own brand and develop direct relationships with their customers and empower them in a symbiotic relationship, rather than compete with them or each other as done by Amazon (AMZN).The business model consists of an enterprise SaaS subscription business and a success-based component. Merchants pay a monthly recurring subscription to access the platform and features, with multiple subscription options which scale with required functionality. The model incorporates a ""land-and-expand"" or ""up-sell"" element as the platform allows merchants to purchase services they require to scale their business as they grow, e.g. ability to add the following on top of a company's website: shopping cart, checkout, payment processing, additional channels (Facebook, eBay, Instagram) shipping and fulfillment, in addition to physical point-of-sale solutions to help physical stores become omnichannel.The model is driven by Shopify's ability to attract new merchants, retain existing merchants, and increase sales to both new and existing merchants. Merchants represent a wide array of retail verticals and business sizes. The heart of Shopify's business model is a flywheel - merchant growth fuels investment in product & offering which fuels scale which fuels further merchant growth:Source: Shopify Q3 2020 Investor PresentationBy working with partners, the business has an expanded sales force, the partner ecosystem helps drive the growth of our merchant base, which in turn further accelerates growth of the ecosystem. Source: Shopify Q3 2020 Investor PresentationShopify offers subscription solutions revenues from the sale of tools and services merchants can use to start and/or scale a business. Features include:Subscription SolutionsOnline store creation and management which includes all the features required to run an eCommerce store like store front/full website creation, shopping cart, marketing & SEO, web hosting, analytics, mobile app support, technical support, blogging platform, order processing, customer accounts and order fulfillment.Point-of-sale or 'POS' which integrates accepting payments across online and offline channels. Features include Mobile POS, personalized marketing, integrated loyalty programs, staff roles and permissions, in-store analytics, ""buy online, pickup in store"". Includes hardware solutions similar to Square's (SQ) POS and accepts all major payment methods: Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), American Express (AXP), Google (GOOG) & Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) - allowing merchants to accept cards for a 1.5% fee.Merchant SolutionsThese augment solutions provided via subscriptions to address the broad array of functionality merchants commonly require, including accepting payments, shipping and fulfillment, and securing working capital.Shopify Payments is a fully integrated payment processing service that allows merchants to accept and process payment cards online and offline and is also designed to drive higher retention among merchant subscribers. Over two-thirds of merchants in 15 countries use the functionality which allows merchants to track their orders and payments via integrated back office functionality and analytics.Shopify Shipping was launched in the USA in September 2015 and in Canada in September 2016, and allows merchants doing their own fulfillment and shipping to select from a variety of shipping partners to buy and print outbound and return shipping labels and track orders directly within the Shopify platform. Supports major shipping services including USPS, UPS (UPS), DHL.Shopify Fulfillment Network was launched in June 2019, for merchants looking to outsource fulfillment. Leveraging a partner network of fulfillment centers dispersed across the USA, it is designed to help ensure orders are delivered quickly and cost-effectively by leveraging Shopify's scale with machine learning tools, including demand forecasting, smart inventory allocation across warehouses and intelligent order routing. Shopify leverages cloud-based software and collaborative mobile robots to increase the speed and reliability of their warehouse operations by empowering on-site associates with daily tasks, including inventory replenishment, picking, sorting, and packing.Shopify App Store allows third party developers to build applications that integrate into the Shopify platform to facilitate specific services for merchants. These include integrations into advertising channels like Google, Facebook (FB), Instagram and TikTok in addition to third-party marketplaces like Amazon and eBay (EBAY). Apps also serve to enhance the functionality of the platform for merchant-specific use cases, e.g. the Jioukou app allows merchants to add group buying functionality to their shops.Shopify Capital was launched in the United States to help eligible merchants secure financing and accelerate the growth of their business by providing access to simple, fast, and convenient working capital. Shopify applies underwriting criteria prior to purchasing the eligible merchant's future receivables. Shopify has an agreement with a third party insurer to guarantee some of the merchant cash advances offered by Shopify Capital.Over 1 million merchants use Shopify's platform ranging from small 1-person companies up to large Fortune 100 names. Some of the larger merchants are:Source: Author, logos from merchant websites disclosed by Shopify.Shopify remains significantly under-penetrated in their addressable market, measuring by number of merchants and on Gross Merchandise Value. There are 47m small businesses globally (<500 employees) of which Shopify has about 2.9m representing about 6% by number of merchants. Shopify did $61b of GMV in 2019 which is about 4% of US GMV of $1.5tn alone.Shopify estimate their small-medium business ('SMB') addressable market to be around $78bn assuming the 47m SMBs generate $1,653 average revenue per merchant each based on 2019 numbers. This excludes large enterprise customers.The global eCommerce market is expected to grow at 11% p.a. over the next 5 years according to research from Meticulous Research which is the same as the US. Shopify's expansion has far exceeded 11% p.a. growth given its embedded operational leverage on eCommerce. Over the 5 years to FY 2019, Shopify's revenue growth averaged 73% p.a. which excludes Pandemic tailwinds. Current analyst expectations as pooled from Bloomberg indicate 76% year-on-year revenue growth for this year or FY 2020.Source: Meticulous ResearchThe eCommerce opportunity remains massive as it is still just 14% of total worldwide retail sales. Unless Amazon will account for 100% of eCommerce (unlikely), there is room for others. Mobile represents 51% of online purchases, in which Shopify has a particularly strong offering it developed much faster than peers. New modes of consumption, channels (wearables, social media) are constantly under development. China remains the fastest growing eCommerce market globally, expansion in Asia represents a good potential future growth avenue, although we think local players will dominate in China. Falling shipping costs, localized fulfillment and innovation around last mile delivery networks are working to enhance speed and quality of delivery as well as lower cost - 50% of consumers who abandon an online purchase do so because of extra costs, primarily shipping.CompetitionThere is no like-for-like competitor offering an integrated platform like Shopify, allowing merchants to retain ownership of their brand.Many small competitors exist which offer pieces of what Shopify does, they include longstanding eCommerce website tools like Magento which was acquired by Adobe (ADBE) in June 2018, SAP Hybris (SAP) and Oracle ATG (ORCL), however these are tailored to large enterprises who are effectively forced to adopt subpar expensive products - worked in the days of on-prem solutions when it was expensive and time consuming to rip out established solutions. But Shopify's cloud-based offering allows for quick implementation and scaling, as evidenced by Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics creating a billion-dollar business on Shopify within 3 years.The smaller DIY website builders like Wix (WIX), Weebly, Squarespace and GoDaddy (GDDY) are more focused on creating a landing page or basic online presence. Most of them have third party partners that provide the ancillary software needed to actually run a business. This makes the process more complex than the one-stop Shopify.On the payments or point-of-sale side, Shopify competes against Square and Stripe. Whilst their offerings are great on a standalone basis, they lack the rest of the Shopify package.End-to-end online merchant solution providers like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Amazon crucially do not allow merchants to really own their brands. Their business models are built on the notion that customers come to their platforms to find goods, hence they own the customer relationship, not the merchant. This results in merchants often having poor experiences on these marketplace platforms, particularly when Amazon decides to compete against the merchants on its own platform. Etsy is significantly more expensive vs. Shopify, and merchant functionality does not offer the same level of control and flexibility - it also lacks omni-channel capabilities and is suited more towards low-volume arts and crafts producers.Merchants who want to preserve their brands do not want their products commoditized on the ""everything store"". Shopify merchants are purposefully building their own brands, going around Amazon, selling through other channels, and owning that direct-to-customer relationship. Amazon also takes between 7%-15% in referral fees for merchants selling via Marketplace. In September 2015 Amazon announced it would be closing its Amazon Webstore service for merchants, and had selected Shopify as the preferred migration provider - a big win for Shopify and a testament to the strength of the proposition.Shopify has around 20% market share of eCommerce platforms:Source: The Ultimate List: 50+ Surprising Shopify Statistics | Konstruct DigitalAggregating across all merchants using Shopify, it would be the second largest eCommerce marketplace in the US:Source: Shopify Q3 2020 Investor PresentationSwitching costs: once merchants adopt the platform, it becomes a mission-critical component of their operations that they struggle to switch away from given the expense and potential disruption to core business from doing so. This allows Shopify to upsell additional services to their existing merchant base which enhances customer lifetime value.Network effects: Shopify allows third-party developers to sell tools on its app store and gets a cut of each sale. Over 1m merchants using the Spotify platform helps attract additional app developers.Partner ecosystem: two types of partner build apps which enhance the platform and help bring in new business via referrals. According to Shopify 30,300 partners referred new merchants in 2019 - acting as a distributed salesforce. Shopify pays a referral fee to partners when they bring new merchants to the platform.Breadth of offering: Shopify offers the most complete, end-to-end, omnichannel solution for merchants. The most important tangential offerings they have are a point-of-sale system for physical retail, Shopify Payments to manage the actual transactions, Shopify Capital makes loans to customers to help them grow, Shopify Shipping helps with shipping and returns, and Fulfilment Network is their newest undertaking. Shopify's proposition is broad enough to accommodate merchants of any size which is another strong selling point for those expecting to scale up their businesses rapidly and do not want to encounter growing pains.Strategic Partnerships: in June 2020, Shopify partnered with Walmart which opens up Walmart's Marketplace to Shopify's small business sellers which expands reach of the participating brands by placing them in front of Walmart Marketplace's 120m monthly visitors and offer free 2-day shipping. Shopify sellers have access to Walmart locations as shipping destinations. Shopify has demonstrated a strong willingness to work with third parties to enhance its platform. In Q3 2020, they launched a TikTok integration, enabling merchants to market their products using TikTok for Business. Merchants are able to create in-feed video ads that autoplay between videos while users scroll through their For You page. Shopify and TikTok will also collaborate to test new commerce features over the coming months that will further empower merchants to expand their paid and organic reach in video and on profiles.Scale/Flywheel: there are over 319m average monthly unique visitors to Shopify merchant shops resulting in 65.5m orders per month or $61.1 GMV in 2019. Last year, Shopify accounted for 5.9% of all U.S. retail e-commerce sales, compared to Amazon's 37.3% share. By attaching its ecosystem to Walmart (4.7% of U.S. e-commerce sales), Shopify complements its long-term growth strategy and gives merchants a significant boost to their visibility. Achieving scale allows Shopify's flywheel business model to work, much like Amazon. Shopify is using its scale to leverage transaction data as it has visibility across tens of billions of transactions accumulated over 10+ years of operation. The company is applying machine learning to this data to enhance its products and services e.g. analytics for merchants to reduce cart-abandonment, product enhancement, competitive positioning, advertising optimization etc.We ran a 2-stage DCF model assuming:Shopify remains well-positioned to gain share in the eCommerce market, as it continues to expand internationally and up-market and grows its merchant solution portfolio, driven in part by accelerated adoption thanks to the Pandemic. Expected revenue growth for next year using consensus (+65% YoY) and trailed to give 35% p.a. over the next 10 years. This Base case growth path is consistent with Amazon's path from 1999, when revenues were about $1.6bn, similar to Shopify's current level. If Shopify does 10% of US GMV by year 10 (up from 4% today), that represents $150bn in GMV, and would equate to an additional $10.3bn in Merchant Solutions revenue implying an additional $11.5bn in Subscription Solutions revenue to hit $21.8bn in year 10 - assuming current conversion rates, which we expect to improve over time. We expect Operating Margins of -2% to reach 30% over 10 years, a lot higher than Amazon's 5.7% margins, as we don't believe Shopify will embark on costly infrastructure build-outs, rather continue its current strategy of partnering with third parties where Capex is intense and focus on the software subscription side. The 30% is consistent with established enterprise SaaS business margins, but in practice could be a lot higher if the company maintains its asset-light approach.Source: Author's calculationsOur DCF implies a fair value of $1,066 per share up +15% vs. $925 close on 27 November 2020.

4382740,104812,2020-10-29T15:42:45-04:00,Shopify reported its Q3 results which beat expectations with strong growth momentum and accelerating earnings.A solid trend of new merchants joining the platform is driving monthly recurring revenue and gross merchandise volume higher.The stock continues to trade with a high valuation premium although we believe the bullishness is justified given the positive long-term outlook with significant expansion opportunities.,"Canada-based Shopify Inc. (SHOP) just reported its latest quarterly result highlighted by stronger than expected sales and firming earnings. The company's e-commerce platform offering merchant solutions and payment tools continues to benefit from underlying trends in online retail which got a boost this year from the pandemic. The stock has been a big winner in recent years, and up over 155% in 2020, gaining momentum as a recognition of its market-leading position. While there are concerns regarding the company's sky-high valuation, we believe the results speak for themselves and the bullishness is warranted considering this is one of the best growth stories in the market. Shopify continues to defy expectations and maintains a positive long-term outlook.(source: finviz.com)Shopify reported its Q3 earnings on October 29th with non-GAAP EPS of $1.13, which was $0.63 ahead of estimates. More impressively, the company delivered a positive GAAP EPS of $1.54 compared to the consensus for a quarterly loss of $0.15. The earnings trend here was driven by a big beat to the revenue figure which came in at $767 million, $115 million above expectations, and up 97% year over year.(source: Company IR)Across the two operating segments, subscription solutions revenue climbed 48% y/y while merchant solutions led growth up by 132% compared to Q3 2019. The gross margin declined to 52.8% from 55.5% last year given the shift in revenue mix as the merchant solutions have gained importance. Nevertheless, we highlight that operating expenses grew below the rate of revenues at 41% y/y, which led to a surge in operating income. There is an expectation going forward that the company can benefit from scale as the existing internal corporate infrastructure supports a higher capacity.In terms of operating metrics, the gross merchandise volume ""GMV"" conducted through the platform reached $30.9 billion, up 109% y/y. Gross payments volume ""GPV"" reached $14.0 billion, up from $6.2 billion in Q3 2019 as a high margin segment. Management noted results were driven by new merchants joining the platform which can drive the demand for related tools and services as the businesses grow going forward. Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) reached $74.4 million with the company seeing success in conversion from its program of an extended free trial to new merchants offered since June of this year.(source: Company IR)While the company did not offer full-year earnings guidance or growth targets, management expects positive trends in online retail due to the pandemic to continue supporting the business environment. The company ended the quarter with $6.1 billion in cash and equivalents against less than $1.0 billion in total long-term liabilities. The rock-solid balance sheet is a strength of the company's investment profile.The strength of Shopify's business model is that merchants entering the platform essentially become tied to the ecosystem representing a long-term relationship of recurring revenues. As the merchants grow their independent businesses, Shopify captures higher fees through expanded sales opportunities with more tools and services. The result is that recurring revenues can scale over time and it becomes harder for merchants to leave and find alternative solutions. The bullish case for Shopify is that it is still in the early stages of its earnings growth and has room to exceed expectations to the upside.(source: Company IR)That being said, even with this exceptional quarter for growth and earnings, Shopify continues to trade at what can otherwise be referred to as an extreme valuation. Including the latest Q3 data, the stock's price to sales multiple over the trailing twelve months is approximately 50x. Still, one justification is that there are few companies the size of Shopify able to deliver revenue growth near 100% and expected to maintain the momentum.One relevant comparison to Shopify is Zoom Video Communications Inc. (ZM) which has seen a windfall this year with its video conferencing technology based on trends in work-from-home and virtual-learning. Zoom revenues grew by 355% y/y in the last quarter and the stock now trades at an even higher price to sales multiple of 107x, compared to 50x for SHOP. Curiously, considering SHOP EPS of $1.57 over the trailing twelve months, the P/E ratio of ~635x is similar to the P/E for Zoom at 630x.While both of these companies are in different sectors with a completely different business model, the point here is that the market tends to reward this type of growth dynamic. We argue that Shopify with a more diversified business with an expanding portfolio of tools and services for customers is a stronger company compared to Zoom which is essentially a one-trick-pony, in our opinion.According to consensus estimates for Shopify, the company is expected to continue its growth trajectory and again double revenues by 2022, and even remain with a growth rate above 25% in 2023. Keep in mind that these estimates have not yet been updated to incorporate the latest Q3 results which will likely lead to revisions higher based on the momentum. The cohort of new merchants and trending higher MRR provides a framework to place these estimates as achievable.(source: Seeking Alpha)If these forecasts are confirmed, the stock has room to effectively grow into the price to sales ratio which would narrow down to under 20x over the next four years. At that point, a case can be made that a tech company growing revenues in the double digits with accelerating earnings and a high degree of recurring revenues would continue to command a high premium in the market.Longer term, the underlying growth tailwinds include the penetration of online shopping which continues to gain market share over traditional brick-and-mortar retail. Data suggesting only 60% of the world's population is connected to the internet show that there is significant white space for e-commerce on a global scale which Shopify is well-positioned capture through its market-leading platform. Shopify's platform-agnostic to e-commerce solutions can benefit regardless of which retailer succeeds over the next decade. Initiatives like the rollout of more payment and shipping tools, ongoing international expansion, and a push into the wholesale/business-to-business segment represent continued growth opportunities.(source: Company IR)It's hard to argue against 97% year over year revenue growth and a new outlook for accelerating earnings. While recognizing the strengths of the business and positive long-term outlook, we rate shares of SHOP as a hold considering the current valuation and already extremely bullish expectations. Our message here is that while we might be on the sidelines in terms of the stock price with a neutral view, there is nothing to suggest Shopify is a ""great short"" opportunity or shares can crash in the near term.Tactically, the stock has been trading in a relatively tight range around $1,000 per share in recent months. In many ways, the consolidation process is healthy and can help build a solid base for the stock to climb higher as it continues to deliver solid operating and financial results. A move under $900 may set up a new buying opportunity.The risks here beyond a global deterioration to the macro environment is that the company misses upcoming quarterly growth estimates with a more visible slowdown in the business. Shares would likely be under pressure if the speculative flows in the stock get pulled out and attract more bearish sentiment. Monitoring points include gross margins which we'd like to see remain above 50% along with progress by the company expanding to new international markets. Over the next year, Shopify will likely face some difficult comps considering the exceptional trends this year given the pandemic. Still, the story going forward will be the higher earnings momentum as the company can pull the lever to drive profits and free cash flow more positive."

However, despite positive industry trends, fiduciaries should beware of the abnormally high level of risk in Shopify (SHOP).While Shopify’s stock performance is attractive to many momentum investors, investors with fiduciary responsibilities should take notice of how quickly high-flying tech stocks can come back down to reality and should consider the deteriorating fundamentals, increasing competition, and the unrealistic increase in profits implied by the current valuation.This report helps investors of all types see just how extreme the risk in SHOP is based on:We recently highlighted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Wayfair (NYSE:W), Carvana (NYSE:CVNA), and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) as firms that fiduciaries should avoid, in large part because each of these businesses possess very few sustainable competitive advantages. Shopify is another example of a business with limited barriers to entry that's attracting lots of competition.Shopify aims to provide a unique, integrated e-commerce platform – not exactly an original idea. Many other firms also host online stores and process payments at competitive prices. With very little technological advantage, Shopify will have a difficult time protecting its market share from larger competitors or new entrants.Figure 1 shows just a sample of the many firms involved in facilitating e-commerce transactions and how many provide the same services as Shopify. We classify these services as:We think Shopify’s operating segments, subscription solutions and merchant solutions correlate most closely to the web content management market (projected by Prescient & Strategic Intelligence to grow at 18.4% per year) and the global payment gateway market (projected by Grand View Research to grow at 21.5% per year). Using these growth rates, the total addressable markets for these two markets are estimated to be $22.8 billion and $71.2 billion in 2027, respectively. Therefore, we estimate the TAM for Shopify to be $94 billion in 2027. This calculation plays an important role in the valuation section of this report below.Figure 1: E-commerce Service Industry Is Filled With CompetitionHeavy competition will not only make adding more merchants more difficult, but it puts a limit on how much Shopify can charge for its services. Shopify has not increased the price of its monthly subscriptions on any of its three existing plans since 2017, which as we’ll show below, has been a drag on profitability. One of Shopify’s biggest competitors, WooCommerce, is keeping the pressure on by offering its e-commerce plugin for free to all WordPress users.Despite stiff competition, Shopify has grown its top line in recent years. The gross merchandise value (GMV), or value of all sales Shopify’s merchants generate on the firm’s platform, increased from $26.3 billion in 2017 to $61.1 billion in 2019. The firm’s 2019 GMV represented 1.7% of the global e-commerce market, which was up from 1.1% in 2017.Competitive pressures have slowed Shopify’s YoY GMV growth rate, though. Per Figure 2, Shopify’s GMV growth rate declined YoY from 2017 to 2019. While the GMV growth rate is improving in the TTM, we believe this bump is temporary and related to COVID-19 temporarily boosting online sales (as we saw with Wayfair).Figure 2: Shopify’s YoY GMV Growth Rate Since 2016Over the long term, Shopify will find it difficult to maintain the year-over-year (YoY) growth it's experiencing in the TTM period largely due to a secular slowdown in the overall e-commerce market. The market already expects Shopify will not sustain its current revenue growth rate. Figure 3 shows Shopify’s consensus estimate YoY revenue growth rates for 2021 and 2022 are much lower than the 2020 consensus estimate.Figure 3: Shopify’s Revenue Growth RateGrand View Research expects the global e-commerce market to grow by 16% compounded annually from 2020 to 2027. While this tailwind may help Shopify grow revenue over the next few years, it's not enough to produce the above-market growth rates necessary to meet the expectations baked into its current stock price, as we’ll show later.Shopify’s growth, and ultimately, its path to profitability, are hamstrung by the firm’s lagging operating efficiencies relative to competitors. While Shopify’s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) margin improved from -9% in 2015 to -3% TTM, it remains well below peers, per Figure 4. Peers include the following firms: Etsy Inc (ETSY), Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE), Oracle Corporation (ORCL), Square, Inc. (SQ), SAP SE (SAP), GoDaddy Inc (GDDY), Salesforce.com (CRM), and Wix.com (WIX). We do not include BigCommerce (BIGC) because we do not cover it. However, with BigCommerce reporting -$5.4 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2Q20, it's safe to say that its inclusion in the peer group would only lower the group’s average NOPAT Margin and ROIC.Shopify’s invested capital turns, a measure of balance sheet efficiency, are better than its peer group.Nevertheless, Shopify’s superior capital efficiency is not enough to offset its negative margins. The firm has never generated positive NOPAT in any year of our model (dates back to 2015), and Shopify’s return on invested capital (ROIC) fell from -10% in 2017 to -12% in 2019. However, over the TTM, the firm’s ROIC improved to -5%, far below the firm’s peer group market-cap-weighted average ROIC of 15%.Figure 4: Shopify’s NOPAT Margin, Invested Capital Turns, and ROIC vs. PeersThe hope for this high growth company is that it will eventually become profitable once it reaches a certain scale. Shopify does not appear to be heading in that direction unless one believes the COVID-19 boost will be permanent. Per Figure 5, Shopify has grown revenue by 67% compounded annually since 2015. Shopify’s rapid revenue growth has come with little regard for actual profits. Shopify’s core earnings[1] have fallen from -$18 million in 2015 to -$46 million over the trailing-twelve-months.Figure 5: Shopify’s Revenue and Core Earnings Since 2015Shopify has a history of significant free cash flow (FCF) burn that's unlikely to change anytime soon. Since 2016, the firm has burned a cumulative $1.6 billion (1% of market cap) in FCF. What’s worse, the firm’s FCF burn is accelerating. Shopify burned $1.1 billion in FCF in the last two years combined and $759 million in the TTM period. While the firm has ample liquidity to continue operating, investors who care about fundamentals and shareholder value will not fund such a significant cash burn forever.Despite the deteriorating fundamentals and tough competition, Shopify is priced as if it will achieve massive growth in revenue and profits and grow to be 51% of its total addressable market.To justify its current price of ~$950/share, Shopify must:See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario. In this scenario, Shopify’s revenue in 2027 would be over 30 times higher than its 2019 revenue.Figure 6 shows the revenue growth expectations baked into the stock price compared to the firms historical revenue. In this scenario, Shopify will grow revenue from $1.6 billion in 2019 to $47.5 billion in 2027, or 51% of Shopify’s TAM of $94 billion, as calculated above.Figure 6: Current Valuation Implies Unrealistic Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.While the revenue growth implied by the stock price is 51% of the projected TAM, the implied growth of the firm’s gross merchandise value (GMV), or value of all sales Shopify’s merchants generate on the firm’s platform, is even more astonishing. Last year, Shopify generated a total of $1.6 billion in revenue from a total of $61.1 billion of GMV – or $1 of revenue from every $38 of GMV. In the scenario outlined above, assuming the same revenue to GMV rate, the firm must generate $1.8 trillion in GMV in 2027 – or 30% of Grand View Research’s 2027 global B2C e-commerce market forecast of $6.2 trillion.Per Figure 7, Shopify’s GMV in 2027 would be over 30 times the size of its 2019 GMV, over 20 times larger than eBay’s 2019 GMV, and five times bigger than Amazon’s.Figure 7: Current Valuation Implies Unrealistic GMV GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 8 shows the NOPAT growth expectations baked into the stock price compared to the firms historical NOPAT. In this scenario, Shopify will grow NOPAT from -$122 million in 2019 to $8 billion in 2027. For reference, Amazon generated an average of $5.7 billion in NOPAT over the past five years and eBay averaged just $1.9 billion in NOPAT over the same time.Figure 8: Current Valuation Implies Unrealistic NOPAT GrowthEven if we assume Shopify can grow revenue and NOPAT at above industry average rates, SHOP still has significant downside risk. In this scenario, Shopify:See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario. In this scenario, Shopify grows NOPAT from -$122 million in 2019 to $3.7 billion 10 years from now, and the stock is worth just $355/share today – a 63% downside. In this scenario, the firm grows revenue to $21.8 billion in 2029. If we assume, as we did in the previous scenario, that Shopify will generate ~$1 of revenue for every $38 of GMV, then the firm reaches $826.7 billion of GMV a decade from now – nearly 2.5 times Amazon’s 2019 GMV.Figure 9 compares the firm’s implied future NOPAT in this scenario to its historical NOPAT.Figure 9: Shopify Has Large Downside Risk: DCF Valuation ScenarioIf we assume Shopify can grow revenue at the same rate as its TAM, SHOP has much more downside risk. In this scenario, Shopify:See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario. In this scenario, Shopify grows NOPAT from -$122 million in 2019 to $389 million 10 years from now, and the stock is worth just $44/share today – a 95% downside. In this scenario, the firm grows revenue to $8.5 billion in 2029. If we assume, as we did in the previous scenarios, that Shopify will generate ~$1 of revenue for every $38 of GMV, then the firm reaches $398 billion of GMV a decade from now – 19% above Amazon’s 2019 GMV of $335 million.Figure 10 compares the firm’s implied future NOPAT in this scenario to its historical NOPAT.Figure 10: Shopify Has an Even Larger Downside Risk With Realistic ExpectationsEach of the above scenarios also assumes Shopify is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are. For reference, Shopify’s invested capital has increased by an average of $331 million (21% of 2019 revenue) over the past four years.Often the largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk,” which means an acquirer comes in and pays for Shopify at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. While we think competitors would be off building rather than buying e-commerce capabilities, it's plausible that a competitor could decide to buy Shopify. However, given the highly negative margins and overvalued stock price, we think it would be unwise for a larger firm to acquire Shopify at current levels.The likelihood of someone acquiring Shopify is further reduced by the low barriers to entry in e-commerce. The firm does not have a substantial technological or behavioral advantage which means other firms can replicate its business model easily. Nevertheless, we think it helps to quantify what, if any, acquisition hopes are priced into the stock.First, investors need to know that Shopify has large liabilities that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers would initially suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. For this analysis, we chose Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) as a potential acquirer of Shopify since Alphabet could create a one-stop shop offering with Shopify by integrating it with its existing domain, advertising, and search services. While we chose Alphabet, analysts can use just about any company to do the same analysis. The key variables are the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and ROIC for assessing different hurdle rates for a deal to create value.Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, Shopify is worth less than its current share price.Figures 11 and 12 show what we think Alphabet should pay for Shopify to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. There are limits on how much Alphabet should pay for Shopify to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ""goal ROIC"" assuming different levels of revenue growth. In the first scenario, we use 66% revenue growth in year one, 30% in year two, and 46% in years three through five (vs. consensus estimates of 66% in 2020, 30% in 2021, and 46% in 2022). In the second scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate for years one through five is 66% (equal to 2020’s consensus estimate). We use the higher estimates in scenario two to illustrate a best-case scenario where we assume Shopify could grow revenue faster while being integrated within Alphabet’s online operations.We conservatively assume that Alphabet can grow Shopify’s revenue and NOPAT without spending any working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume Shopify achieves an 18% NOPAT margin, which equals Alphabet’s TTM NOPAT margin. For reference, Shopify’s TTM NOPAT margin is -3%.Figure 11: Implied Acquisition Prices for Value-Neutral DealFigure 11 shows the implied values for SHOP assuming Alphabet wants to achieve an ROIC on the acquisition that equals its WACC of 6%. This scenario represents the minimum level of performance required not to destroy value. Even if Shopify can grow revenue by 66% compounded annually for five years and achieve an 18% NOPAT margin, the firm is worth much less than $949/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 6% ROIC would not be accretive, as the return on the deal would equal Alphabet’s WACC.Figure 12: Implied Acquisition Prices to Create ValueFigure 12 shows the implied values for SHOP assuming Alphabet wants to achieve an ROIC on the acquisition that equals 29%, its current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to Alphabet’s shareholders. Even in this best-case growth scenario the implied value is significantly below Shopify’s current price. Without significant increases in margin or revenue growth assumed in this scenario, an acquisition of SHOP at its current price destroys significant shareholder value.At the end of April, the consensus estimate for Shopify’s 2020 earnings was just $0.02/share. Jump forward to today, and the 2020 consensus estimate has risen all the way to $2.32/share. The 2021 consensus earnings estimate has followed a similar trend. In April, 2021 consensus earnings estimate was $0.44/share. As of Sept. 7, 2020, the consensus earnings estimate for 2021 has increased to $2.16/share. Since May 2017, Shopify hasn’t missed earnings once. With higher expectations making a beat that much more difficult, an unusual earnings miss could send shares lower.Further, the COVID-19 bump in sales will undoubtedly give the firm a relatively strong year of performance. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons in 2021 might not be so good. If sales don’t grow as fast as they did in 2020, disappointed investors might dump their shares.SHOP already has fallen 19% since its closing price on Sept. 1, 2020. A continuation of the market’s recent sell-off of tech high fliers (TSLA, W, and CVNA, to name a few) could bring this stock back down to earth soon.These days, fewer investors pay attention to fundamentals and the red flags buried in financial filings. Instead, due to the proliferation of noise traders, the focus tends toward technical trading tends while high-quality fundamental research is overlooked. Here’s a quick summary for noise traders when analyzing SHOP:In its proxy statement, Shopify states that its executive compensation plan “aligns the interests of our executives with shareholder interests, so that we may attract, motivate and retain executives who will continue to create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders.” While those words sound great, a closer study reveals the compensation committee is not putting its money where its mouth is.On top of base salaries, Shopify executives receive stock options and restricted share units (RSUs) that vest at 33% per year over a three-year period. The issuance of stock options and RSUs are based on several factors such as total compensation opportunity, attraction and retention, market competitiveness, and CEO recommendations among others.Of particular concern for shareholders is Shopify’s history of value destruction. The firm’s already negative economic earnings fell from 2015 to 2019. Over the TTM, the firm’s economic earnings have slightly improved with the COVID-19-induced bump in revenue.Even as shareholders have experienced value destruction, management has seen its stock-based compensation soar over the same time. Per Figure 13, shareholders experienced a cumulative -$473 million in economic earnings from 2015 to 2019, while management has been rewarded with a cumulative $334 million in stock-based compensation over the same time.Shopify should link executive compensation with improving ROIC, which is directly correlated with creating shareholder value, so shareholders’ interests are properly aligned with executives’ interests.Figure 13: Shopify’s Economic Earnings vs. Stock-Based Compensation Since 2015Over the past 12 months, there have been no insider transactions.There are currently 1.7 million shares sold short, which equates to 1% of shares outstanding and less than one day to cover. The number of shares sold short has increased by 7% since last month.As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings as shown in the Harvard Business School and MIT Sloan paper, “Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence.”Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Shopify’s 10-Q and 10-K:Income Statement: We made $99 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $2 million in non-operating expenses (<1% of revenue). You can see all the adjustments made to Shopify’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $2.7 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $2.2 billion. One of the most notable adjustments was $327 million for midyear acquisitions. This adjustment represented 10% of reported net assets. You can see all the adjustments made to Shopify’s balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $6.2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by $725 million. The most notable adjustment to shareholder value was $3.5 billion in excess cash. This adjustment represents 3% of Shopify’s market cap. See all adjustments to Shopify’s valuation here.The following funds receive our Very Unattractive rating and allocate significantly to SHOP:This article originally published on September 10, 2020.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Matt Shuler receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, style, or theme.[1] Our core earnings are a superior measure of profits, as demonstrated in Core Earnings: New Data & Evidence a paper by professors at Harvard Business School (HBS) & MIT Sloan."

I rate Shopify a HOLD, and I maintain my price target of $1,000.","Since my last article on Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), the company broke out to the upside through the 1-year price target of $1,000. In this article, I evaluate the most recent developments and trends affecting Shopify and its industry. Although I remain bullish on the long term, several signals point to a future slowdown in growth that could be reflected in the stock price.SourceThe pandemic has reshaped the retail industry at an incredible pace. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) experienced growth levels they weren't expecting for 3 to 5 years. Similarly, Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) data showed accelerated growth in online sales equivalent to 4 to 6 years. The transition from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce was very strong over the past few months, but we cannot be sure whether this spike is sustainable or short-lived.To obtain an insight into the matter, I analyse the US quarterly e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales. The figure below is pretty clear, in the US, e-commerce is still in growth mode. Total retail sales over the period decreased only 3.6% while e-commerce increased 44.5% over the second quarter of 2019. At the end of Q2, e-commerce is estimated to account for 16.1% of total sales.Figure 1Source: US Census Bureau of the Department of CommerceBasing the analysis only on this data would paint a rosy picture for Shopify, whose major source of revenue comes from transaction fees over its e-commerce platforms. However, these data points end in June, offering an incomplete picture. In the current dynamic environment, three months of data could already be outdated. For a more up-to-date reflection of current retail industry trends, I also took a look at the UK Office for national statistics data, which is updated every month.Figure 2Source: UK Office for National StatisticsInterestingly, in the UK, e-commerce growth seems to have topped at the end of May. Data over June, July, and August show a constant decline in internet sales as a percentage of total sales. The timeline coincides with the initial relaxation of lockdown measures ordered by Boris Johnson, so a significant increase in brick and mortar sales could have helped to push the industry into a mean reversion trend.Has to be said that things can change quickly. New lockdown measures are always around the corner, and it is also possible that the UK trend won't be reflected in the US, or elsewhere. Shopify's business is heavily concentrated in the US rather than the UK, but human behaviour shouldn't be too different between the two countries. To predict US numbers, I use the more granular UK data as a leading indicator of retail trends in the US. The UK figure sees the e-commerce percentage in free fall, with a sharp deceleration in July followed by a slower one in August. In particular, should the deceleration continue past August, a new baseline for e-commerce could form at around 25% of total retail sales, a 5-6% increase from pre-pandemic levels. In the US, an equivalent move would set the new post-pandemic baseline at around 15%, or a 3% increase. The picture is, therefore, clearer in the long term, with the pandemic accelerating the already pre-existing retail trends.The latest (May 2020) US Census Bureau data shows a 13% e-commerce growth YoY for 2018, with US retailers pocketing $520 billion in sales. For 2019, growth accelerated to 15%, with total e-commerce sales reaching $600 billion. For 2020, Figures 1 and 2 clearly show that, overall, growth will achieve even higher numbers.Figure 3Source: US Census Bureau of the Department of CommerceShopify is capitalizing on these trends in a spectacular fashion. Q1 momentum has continued into Q2, as revenues rose 97% YoY and GMV 119%. In particular, online store GMV grew by 73% in Q2 2020 over Q1 2020. I expect the momentum to continue into Q3, but based on the figures above, it will probably happen to a lesser extent.Applying a discounted cash flow valuation method that makes sense to a company like Shopify is nearly impossible. Shopify generated $165 million in cash from operations in Q2, but this can't be used as a reliable measure of future cash flows. Revenue growth, expenses, and balance sheet metrics are all too unpredictable to formulate a proper DCF exercise. Instead, I take an approach based on scenario analysis and a price/sales valuation metric. I formulate 4 scenarios with different levels of growth as detailed in the table below.Figure 4Source: Author calculationsThe best-case scenario sees the high levels (+60%) of growth experienced in the past few months to continue over 2021. The negative scenario sees growth levels diminishing over time to 30% growth in Q4 2021. The neutral scenario sees the pandemic levels of growth to continue towards the end of 2020, before reversing and flattening out to pre-pandemic levels of 45%.The following table shows Shopify's share price based on the different scenarios and over different P/S ratios (accounting for a 5% increase in shares outstanding).Figure 5Source: Author calculationsShopify's P/S ratio is currently near 50. Despite the high growth, I reckon such a high ratio won't be sustainable over the long term. A more manageable P/S ratio of 30 sets Shopify's price range in the $881-1,075 range by Q4 2021. My expected scenario sees Shopify maintaining growth levels in the 45-65% range in 2021, and with a P/S of 30, I expect Shopify to trade around $960 in 2021, a 12% appreciation from the current price level of $860. In a negative scenario and a P/S of 20, Shopify's price would base at $588, or a 32% loss. The asymmetric risk/reward ratio doesn't look advantageous enough to reiterate my BUY rating on the stock. I rate Shopify a HOLD, and I maintain my price target of $1,000.Author's Note: If you found this article of value and want to receive updates on this research, just click the ""Follow"" button near the title.

Many stocks are still struggling to get back to where they were pre-COVID, but tech stocks are flying high. This includes Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). The company is up over 245% off the March lows and has cleared to new all-time highs on the earnings news. Shopify continues to set itself apart from the field in what it does, and it is translating to the stock price even with the crazy high valuation.(Source: Google)Shopify crushed Q2 earnings. Some of the highlights include (All numbers from earnings call):All in all fairly good, which is why the stock popped almost 12% on the news. Of note was that the GMV was accelerating in April and May, but has slowed for June and July. But Q2 GMV growth accelerated to its highest level since before the 2015 IPO. The conversion rate of the 90-day free trial was lower than the rate pre-COVID. This could be due to several factors including the inability for some of the merchants to continue to operate at all.(Source: Company Presentation)Revenue continues to climb at a very quick rate, which is part of the reason the stock is exploding the way it has. As long as Shopify can maintain these kinds of growth rates, there's no reason for the stock to slow down. Merchants are seeing more local shoppers. This is great news for both small businesses and Shopify. A theme for COVID across social media has been to shop local, and Shopify's numbers are confirming this is happening. Curbside pickup is also a hit right now due to COVID. 39% of the brick-and-mortar merchants have set up some sort of local in-store curbside pickup delivery sources. Shopify Plus has been a success thus far with many large companies signing up like Hurley, Schwinn, Snickers, Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) to name a few. Multiple companies across multiple industries showing how versatile Shopify is.There is no question that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to rule the space. But the competition is getting more fierce. Especially with the developments, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is trying to reach its customers more efficiently and faster. I fully expect it to climb the rankings as shown below. As for Shopify, it needs to try and steal more market share to justify the current valuation.(Source: Company Presentation)Sitting pretty in 2nd place is great, but as I mentioned with Walmart, the chase is on. Amazon has officially recognized Shopify as a competitor, but they aren't really competitors as the core of what Shopify does Amazon does not, but at the end of the day, they are e-commerce. CFO Amy Shapero had the following to say with regards to how the company is setting itself apart:With the move that Walmart is making to go more direct to consumer, it joins the list of many consumer packaged goods suppliers that are trying to make the move. A lot of companies are choosing Shopify to make this move simply due to the simplicity of it. They can launch quickly and experiment with their business in order to fine-tune it. Shopify is seeing brands across multiple sectors use them to become more direct to consumer and it's only going to continue to grow.One of the challenges besides competition which was addressed above is the limitation of a unique storefront. This is where Amazon and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) set themselves apart. These sites utilize a central website where users can just search for what they need. Shopify's customers all use their own websites to generate traffic. Shopify helps drive the traffic, but its traffic is spread out amongst 1.5 million different stores. Shopify leans heavily on users searching for its merchants' products, or seeing them on social media and other advertisements. If its merchants' websites do not show up on product searches, the merchant and Shopify would suffer drastically.(Source: Simplywall.st)Living up to the current valuation might be its largest hurdle to overcome. All you have to do is take a look at the recent articles all published on Seeking Alpha to see what contributors think of the stock. While I remain neutral (I know fence-sitting), 6 of the last 10 articles are bearish or very bearish. One neutral, and one bullish that suggests taking profits. So call it 7/10 are suggesting you sell the stock. Looking above, we can probably see why. There is no doubt the stock is overvalued on a free cash flow basis, but that's not how this stock has ever traded. Is 160% a little much? Yes. There needs to be some catch up at some point. But there's no need to hate on the valuation while the stock is trending higher in beast mode. Much like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Shorts continue to get crushed. I don't doubt they will have their day in both names, but right now the market is still pushing these names higher. There is no question that their fundamentals need to catch up or the stock price needs to consolidate at some point. For now, ride the trend for it is your friend.Shopify has been a stock I have asked to see pullbacks from multiple times. Most recently on May 10th, I wrote how it needed to consolidate. Which it did for about a month before ramping up again on its quest for the $1,000 mark. I also said a correction back to the February highs of about $530 would be ideal, and we are nowhere near that now. So call it 50% right?Since bottoming in March, the stock is now up over 245%. The stock ran into some headwinds around the $1,000 mark (naturally) and corrected back about 15% throughout most of July bottoming out on July 24th at $883. Since then, the stock has blasted back to all-time highs on the positive earnings news discussed above.(Source: TC2000.com)There is no better buy signal than a break out to new highs. The fact that we broke out Wednesday morning up almost 12% and closed the day only up 7% is a slight red flag. Continuation/confirmation tomorrow is crucial.If you are looking for longer-term support at these levels, it is often hard to use horizontal support because there isn't much history. Looking below we can see the 50-day moving average and how well the stock has reacted off of it, or at least near it. Looking back all through 2019 we can see that it served as great support. This holds true through 2020 where we can see the two most recent dips have taken us pretty well back to the moving average before rocketing off from there. Buying the dips on Shopify has worked well as long as you use the 50-day moving average as one of your must-watch levels.(Source: TC2000.com)Zooming into an hourly chart below, we can see that there is some decent support around the $1,050 mark. This is essentially where the stock topped out in early July and where the stock came to rest on Wednesday. A bounce off this mark tomorrow is very important to the long thesis on Shopify. If you are long and believe in stops, you essentially have to have a stop down around $908. This is the red line on the chart below which serves as the support during the correction we saw in July. The stock has moved too quickly the last week to place one any higher without being shaken out on a quick move down. This only holds true if you are a long-term believer in the name.(Source: TC2000.com)As you can see, there is a lot to like about Shopify after its very positive Q2. If the company can continue to grow revenue at these incredible levels, then the stock is going to do just fine. As soon as that train stops, the stock will likely slow as well. But I do not see that coming anytime soon. The valuation is very high, but the market does not appear to care as the stock continues to get bought up. At the end of the day, the trend is your friend, especially when there is solid support in place. The party goes on for now! Stay safe out there!"
4362599,104941,2020-07-30T18:32:36-04:00,"Yesterday, Shopify reported a fantastic quarter, with revenues going up by 97% y/y. Such results have further solidified my belief in the business and its future prospects.After discussing the recent quarter and its long-term implications on Shopify's future, I provide an updated valuation and price target.For the long term, my stance on Shopify is bullish. However, I still think it could consolidate at ~$1,000 for at least a couple of years.In the case of a significant dip, I would be an aggressive buyer in the ~$700 and below (though I doubt we will see sub $700 ever again).","Source: Style FactoryRecently, I published a modest buy rating on Shopify (SHOP), and my detailed investment thesis can be found here and from a little earlier in the year here. In today's article, I discuss Shopify's Q2 earnings (reported on 07/29/2020) and their long-term implications for Shopify's future.But before I dive into the numbers, allow me to share a little recap behind my thinking regarding Shopify.In a nutshell, my bullish investment thesis on Shopify remains based on the inexorable secular growth trends in e-commerce and enterprise digital transformation. As we all know, the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the generational shift in consumer spending patterns from physical to online stores.Source: www.criteo.comIn the last few months, e-commerce penetration of the total US retail market has blasted up from ~16% to 25%, and thus Shopify's exceptional Q2 performance should come as no surprise to anyone.Source: www.businessinsider.comThough I don't believe traditionally brick and mortar pizza sellers will continue slinging pizzas primarily online, COVID-19 certainly did pull forward a great deal of transition to not just an online strategy, but an omnichannel strategy, at which Shopify excels more so than any of its peers.Additionally, consumer spending patterns have been shifting towards online stores for several years. Thus, I expect the boost in e-commerce to remain rather permanent, as we march inexorably toward a reality where e-commerce accounts for over half of all retail spend.Shopify is continuously expanding the capabilities of its platform, and, in my opinion, the addition of a fulfillment network and its recent release of its Shop app could result in Shopify, meaningfully, competing with retail giants such as Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT). Several growth avenues like international expansion, additional lines of business (e.g., fintech, logistics, advertising), and machine learning serve as a solid basis for a long, long growth runway for Shopify.Here's an outline for the rest of this research note:Let's get into it.Surpassing all estimates, Shopify recorded Q2 revenues of $714.3 million (up +97%). After years of growth rate deceleration, Shopify recorded the highest revenue growth rate since its IPO on the back of a significant boost in merchant count over the last few months. The COVID-19 pandemic hurt retail businesses and forced them to go online for survival, and it looks like this transition played directly into the hands of Shopify.Source: Shopify Q2 Earnings SlidesThe reason I like Shopify's business model a lot is its ability to benefit from the success of the sellers/merchants on its platform. As you may know, Shopify charges a fixed subscription fee for its platform. These subscription revenues grew by a healthy ~28% y/y based on new merchant additions to Shopify's platform in Q2.However, the highlight of Shopify's report is the ~148% y/y growth in Merchant Solutions segment revenue. I agree that the Merchant Solutions segment commands a lower gross margin profile of ~40-45% as compared to the Subscription Solutions segment (gross margin profile: ~75-80%), but the growth in Merchant Solutions is evidence of Shopify's ability to provide services that could yield higher revenues from existing merchant base on its platform.The success of Shopify's sellers (as a collective) can be measured by the gross merchandise value (GMV) processed through Shopify's platform. Furthermore, Shopify's Merchant Solutions segment revenues are positively correlated to GMV. In Q2, the GMV processed through Shopify's platform went up to $30.1 billion from the previous year figure of $13.8 billion, i.e., a rise of +119% y/y.Source: Shopify Q2 Earnings SlidesSource: Shopify Q2 Earnings SlidesIn 2020, Shopify's flywheel is rotating rapidly, which is driving the company's revenues higher and simultaneously strengthening Shopify's ecosystem and by extension moat. The influx of merchants on the Shopify platform due to COVID-19 in combination with the shift in consumer spending trends to online channels is driving Shopify's GMV higher. On top of that, Shopify continues to add channel partners (e.g., Facebook (FB), Walmart, Shop App, etc.) and capabilities (e.g., Shop Pay, Shop Balance, etc.) in order to enhance merchant (and consumer) experience on its platform.As Shopify's flywheel motors on with immense power supplied by secular tailwinds like the rise in self-employment, e-commerce penetration, and digitalization of traditional brick and mortar, mono-channel enterprises, I expect Shopify to experience spectacular long-term growth over the next decade.For the rest of this year, Shopify's management refrained from providing any guidance due to uncertainty related to COVID-19. However, with unemployment numbers on the rise, I expect the merchant numbers to continue to grow as more people (first-time entrepreneurs) open up brand new online businesses. Also, the shift in consumer spending trends will most likely become permanent.With that being said, I have a feeling that even Shopify acknowledges that some of this online frenzy might abate in the event the virus vanishes faster than expected and/or a vaccine is approved faster than expected.Source: Shopify Press ReleaseAt the time of this writing, Shopify's stock is at $1,075 (up ~9% intraday). Clearly, the market has reacted positively to the earnings report. With that being said, the market will often price assets excessively in both directions, positive and negative. So, we must ascertain based on sober assumptions the upper and lower bounds of intrinsic value so as to determine what we should pay for a company.To determine Shopify's intrinsic value, I will be utilizing the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model. Here's what it entails:So, let's check out the results.Assumptions:Here's a little graphical depiction of how I determine free cash flow per share, which is the foundation of any valuation I perform on a company.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs can be seen above, Shopify's intrinsic value is ~$700, i.e., it is currently overvalued by ~54%.With this being said, a DCF will often tell us one answer, and a projection of free cash flow per share into the future might also tell us another answer, hence I coded both perspectives into the LASV Model. This multi-perspective approach is what makes the model worthy of being called anything other than a DCF model!To determine the total expected returns, the model grows our initial TTM free cash flow per share at the assumed FCF growth rate. The resulting figure is then multiplied by a conservative Price to FCF ratio of 35x to obtain the share price at the end of ten years. By doing this, we arrive at the following result:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelTherefore, if one were to buy Shopify at today's price of $1,075 and hold for ten years, they could expect a return of approximately ~11%. This implies a 2030 share price target of ~$3100.The returns are only slightly above my hurdle rate of 9.8%. Thus, Shopify is only a weak buy at this price. However, I would be adding to my long position if the stock dips to ~$700s over the next couple of years.Now, I know some of the ""linear bulls"" (those that believe stocks go up linearly) out there might think Shopify will never return to $700.Well, here's a scenario for you. Let's say the market now believes e-commerce's 25% or so penetration will persist in perpetuity. The market believes that the tens of thousands of new sellers will continue devoting all of their attention to their online sales, as they did during the lockdowns.In 3 months, Shopify finds that a reversion to the mean has occurred instead (this is what they suspect might happen, hence no guidance).Unequivocally, the near-term-thinking segment of Wall Street will punish Shopify dramatically. I believe this scenario to be the most likely scenario to play out over the next 6 months, hence I am sitting on my hands, content with the returns Shopify has generated for me and my family heretofore.In Q2 2020, Shopify's growth accelerated to pre-IPO levels as a flurry of merchants flocked to its platform, and consumer spending trends leaned towards e-commerce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I expect this transition to become rather permanent long term (albeit with some level of reversion to the mean in the near term). Shopify is well-positioned to ride the next wave of e-commerce adoption (especially in international markets).In the long-term, Shopify's fulfillment network (5-year plan in progress) and partnerships with marketplaces like Facebook, Walmart, and Google (GOOG), could propel Shopify closer to rivaling the retail Goliaths (Shopify might be considered a now larger David) of the world. Hence, I retain a long-term bullish view on Shopify.Key Takeaway: I rate Shopify a modest buy at $1,075.Please provide your feedback in the comments below.Thanks for reading; remember to follow to get more stock ideas; and happy investing."
4360113,103644,2020-07-23T04:05:57-04:00,"Shopify is a fantastic company that benefits from this stay-at-home movement, but will grow fast regardless of how long that lasts.However, Shopify trades at valuations I've never seen before.I offer up Salesforce as a similar, more mature, high-growth alternative.","Are we entering another tech bubble? Obviously, this debate has been back and forth for years. People have been calling for stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Tesla (TSLA) to fall for the last decade. Typically, the arguments were rudimentary and would say they aren't worth their current P/E ratios. The problem with those bearish arguments was that these companies still had high growth runways of decades, not years, so the valuations made sense. To me, some tech stocks have gotten too high, while others still have plenty of room to run.Valuations still matter at some point and the most ridiculous one to me is Shopify (SHOP). They are a fantastic company and have a great setup for growth for the next decade or two and the stay-at-home mindset is certainly fantastic for them. It will certainly help them expand customers to new small and large businesses alike. However, their valuation has gotten ahead of itself as they now have a higher EV/Sales ratio than Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, or any other high-growth name I could think of had at any point in those companies' histories!Data by YChartsSo even with such high valuations, I expect SHOP to eventually grow into those valuations. It's just a matter of how far ahead do you want to pay for it. Even if SHOP averages 50% growth for the next 5 years, they still will have to trade at ~9x EV/Sales at that point to be the exact same market cap as now. As you can see below, current estimates don't even have them growing at 50% a year, but closer to 40% per year.Data by YChartsNow perhaps if you're willing to hold for at least the next decade, you can justify these valuations; but I'd still just call them a Hold at these levels even so, not a Buy. They'd have to grow revenues at a CAGR of 30% for the next decade for the stock to see any sort of returns. The reason valuation matters so much is because stocks like AMZN and NFLX had the advantage of high growth with people not respecting that they'd ever be profitable, so they traded at much lower multiples. They were able to experience both the fantastic revenue growth as well as multiple expansion, with both companies trading at higher multiples now than most times in their past. Here is how much their multiples have expanded in the last 10 years, with markets finally giving them their due on just how long their growth runways are.Data by YChartsThe problem with SHOP is that I can guarantee you they won't see multiple expansion from their current 64x EV/S in 10 years. Even if they still trade at 10x EV/S (more than most tech companies currently) in 10 years, they will have to keep up 30% annual revenue growth for an entire decade to even see 8% annual return on shares. 30% revenue growth is possible during the first few years of a company, but extremely tough as the revenue base gets bigger. Some companies have seen that sort of growth over a decade span, but even Amazon growing from $25B at the start of 2010 to $280B at the start of 2020, means a CAGR of ~27%.Granted Amazon was already further along a decade ago than SHOP is now, so perhaps they weren't able to grow revenues as quickly from the larger base. I personally think the best comparison to look at for SHOP is Salesforce (CRM). Unlike Amazon, Shopify won't be stealing market share from the entire American consumer market. Both CRM and SHOP help businesses move to an online format and benefit greatly as more and more do, but they won't be selling directly to the American consumer. The business models of Salesforce and Shopify seem very similar to me as they help small and large businesses alike update their ways to do business.The Salesforce comparison also works out well to see where Shopify could be in a decade, as CRM also had between $1B and $2B in revenue a decade ago (similar to SHOP's $1.58B at the end of 2019). Salesforce managed to grow their revenue from $1.3B at the start of 2010 to $17.1B at the start of 2020 for a CAGR of 29.5%.Data by YChartsNow certainly I would expect Shopify bulls to see Salesforce as an excellent company to be in when making comparisons. Salesforce has been truly groundbreaking in bringing about new ways to do business and their CEO Marc Benioff will surely go down as one of the greatest CEOs of all time, revolutionizing the sales business the way Jeff Bezos has consumerism in America. Salesforce has decimated the returns of almost all companies not in FANG over the last decade.Data by YChartsSo while it is great for Shopify to be compared to Salesforce from a probable growth perspective, they are definitely not in the same starting place from a valuation perspective. Back a decade ago, Salesforce was only trading near 10x EV/Sales, so with SHOP trading at more than 6x higher, it means 1/6th of the returns if they grow at a similar rate, but eventually come down to in-line valuations with peers. 1/6th of CRM's 720% returns comes out to 120% returns over the next decade.Data by YChartsNow it's not saying investing in SHOP at these levels is terrible. If you do think it's inevitable that SHOP grows at 30% for the next decade, then getting 120% return or a CAGR of ~8% is not terrible. And if you think they can grow at a CAGR of 40%+ for an entire decade, then they are truly a Buy. However, I think there are much better options for total returns, such as Salesforce themselves. CRM is still expected to grow revenues at 15-20% the next few years.Data by YChartsSo if both SHOP and CRM hit current estimates, and valuation metrics eventually even out for both (say in 5 years), I expect CRM to return 15% a year and SHOP to return 8% per year. I also think CRM offers less risk as they've already proven themselves over a long time period. For SHOP to hit the same sort of growth that CRM has done for the last decade is no certainty and I posit a lot would have to go right, even with their excellent business and positioning.Shown another way, even with Salesforce being a truly groundbreaking company with a revolutionary CEO for more than a decade, they still barely trade at a higher market cap today than Shopify, who is still in their early days revenue-wise.Data by YChartsData by YChartsWhile I think Shopify trades at reasonable multiples if you're willing to hold for the next decade or more, the upside is minimal at this point and plenty of things can go wrong. If you own SHOP and are looking for an alternative if you were to sell, I would recommend CRM as a fantastic stock to park your money in. Perhaps if SHOP traded at half of where they do now or about what CRM traded 2 years ago, I would consider them a Buy."
4360720,105593,2020-07-27T09:30:00-04:00,"Total of 7,583,817 retail e-commerce websites, with Shopify averaging $160 per store in subscription solutions revenue.Estimated FY20 retail e-commerce sales of $4.2 trillion, with Shopify generating roughly 1.55% of GMV in revenue.With a 100% market share in both, Shopify would generate roughly $5 billion in subscription solutions and $65 billion in merchant solutions.After accounting for gross margins, revenue falls to $4 billion (80%) and $25 billion (38%) respectively.Market capitalization of $118 billion, representing 68x sales, 1.7x higher than TAM, and 4x higher than gross profit from TAM.","Founded by German-born Canadian entrepreneur Tobias Lütke in 2004, Shopify (SHOP) is an e-commerce platform that enables merchants of nearly any size to quickly and easily setup an online store and begin selling their products. They generate revenue through two separate segments -- high margin subscription solutions and low margin merchant solutions. Both of these are described in deeper detail later in the article, but here is a brief overview of what each of these two segments are.Source: SEC FilingSubscription solutions is their recurring subscription component with revenue generated from variable platform fees, typically as a monthly subscription, theme and app store purchases, and domain registrations. This is their most profitable segment with a phenomenal 80% gross margin.Merchant solutions is their success-based component with revenue generated principally through payment processing fees from Shopify Payments. In addition to Shopify Payments, revenue in this segment is also collected from transaction services, referral fees, Point-Of-Sale (""POS"") hardware, Shopify Capital, Shopify Fulfillment Network, and collaborative warehouse fulfillment solutions. The collective revenue in this segment is directionally correlated with the level of Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV"") processed through the Shopify platform.It's likely no secret, given my previous two articles Shopify's Road To $200 and Shopify's Hyper Bubble Put In Perspective, that I'm not super bullish on the company. Granted, with a $118 billion market cap in conjunction with trailing revenue of $1.73 billion and a $135 million net loss, it's a bit difficult to argue otherwise. However, I have already gone over the valuation concerns to the point of exhaustion, and this article will focus entirely on fundamentals.As noted in the previous section, Shopify's revenue is broken into two separate segments, and my goal is for every reader to have a solid fundamental understanding of both by the end. Here I will not only break down where the revenue comes from for each, along with a variety of other financial metrics, but also attempt to estimate the total addressable market for each along with some reasonable projections.Ordered SectionsDue to the fact that the overwhelming majority of Shopify's revenue comes from its online stores, whether directly through subscription solutions or relative to sales through merchant solutions, a great starting point would be to determine just how large this market is. Using data compiled by BuiltWith we can not only determine its total size but more specifically narrowed by cohort.Their market control among the top ranked cohorts is significantly more beneficial to merchant solutions, while their global market share is significantly more beneficial to subscription solutions. The reason for this is a confirmed connection between a websites Alexa rank and its sales, which will be explained in further detail later in the article.As a final reminder, subscription solutions are linearly correlated with the quantity of stores on the Shopify ecosystem while merchant solutions are directionally correlated with the GMV of those stores, specifically any GMV processed directly through Shopify.Source: BuiltWith [Top 10k]Source: BuiltWith [Top 100k]Source: BuiltWith [Top Million]Source: BuiltWith [Entire Internet]There's a fantastic article by Robert J. Moore that tries to answer an important question -- How Many E-Commerce Companies Are There? Unfortunately the article is about six years old, completely ancient by tech standards, but it's still incredibly relevant in many respects and takes advantage of proprietary data to give us a unique look into the relationship between Alexa Rank and GMV. For example he uses anonymized statistics taken directly from many of these stores in conjunction with Alexa to generate a rough translation between site ranking and revenue generated while confirming the results. Here are two of the charts generated from said analysis, along with its conclusions. Source: RJmetrics Source: RJMetrics Source: RJMetricsThis shows that using the top million websites is a fantastic metric to predict a companies revenue given its correlation with Alexa ranking. Moreover it's clear that the vast majority of meaningful sales is going to come from this cohort. While there are certainly a number of businesses generating six figures outside of this range, you can see how rapid the exponential decrease is and anything further out is extremely unlikely to be generating anything meaningful, with the top 10k e-commerce websites making up roughly 34% of total revenue. What does this mean for Shopify in particular? This is where their merchant solutions shine given it's a direct reflection of how successful the businesses on their platform are, the better Shopify does in the top million (and above) the greater their merchant solutions revenue will be.When looking at the previously shown market distribution images, shown in section three, you'll likely notice there are two separate usage distributions given; one in the pie chart and another listed below that. While BuiltWith does explain where these numbers come from, it unfortunately appears to be outdated as the numbers don't match up as they describe. However, while waiting on an official response, I ended up just working out how the numbers are determined myself.Determining Total Sites & DetectionsDetermining Market ShareGiven the previously described data, we can now build a table describing what the market looks like for any given cohort. Note that due to each subsequent cohort including all previous ones, we will be discarding total sites from all previous cohorts. For example, the top 100k category shows 5,547 Shopify sites detected but this includes the 529 from the top 10k cohort, so it should be 5,018. This will keep each cohort separately contained rather than building on top of one another, providing a much more accurate picture of each.Everything shown below uses data from BuiltWith along with a lightweight program to separate each cohort into its own container, as described earlier. You can find both the data used and source code here for reference.Source: Shopify 19Q1Source: Shopify 19Q4Source: Shopify 20Q1Here we can see that total subscription solutions revenue grew to $187.6 million in 20Q1, up 33.5% YoY and 2.4% QoQ. You may also have noticed that total revenue declined 6.9% QoQ and the reason for this becomes clear looking at 20Q1, it's related to merchant solutions. While they note in 20Q1 that merchant solutions revenue accelerated by 57% for the second consecutive quarter, you can clearly see that this increase is YoY and they actually declined 12.30% QoQ. Merchant solutions revenue if you remember is directionally correlated to GMV and you can similarly see its decline of 15.53% from the previous quarter.OverviewSource: TSX FilingSource: Market Place PulseTotal Addressable MarketAccording to BuiltWith, there are a total of 15,563,779 platforms detected across 7,583,817 unique sites. As of July 23 Shopify controls 1,422,815 of these unique sites, meaning that Shopify's growth potential in this area is limited to roughly 5.3x their current share, plus industry growth. Remember that Shopify's revenue in this segment is linearly correlated to the quantity of stores on its platform.Considering that Shopify generated $187.6 million revenue from this segment 20Q1, we can extrapolate to roughly $994.28 million in potential quarterly revenue, or $3.98 billion annually. Further applying a 20% industry growth rate we can determine that the maximum upper limit for subscription solutions revenue FY20 is ~$4.78 billion. This is obviously incredibly small for a total monopoly, it's only 122.32% above their projected FY20 revenue of $2.15 billion and just over 4% of their $118 billion market cap.Now of course I'm not suggesting that Shopify is incapable of generating more than this upper limit because, as we have discussed, merchant solutions generates the majority of their revenue. This is despite subscription solutions making up the majority of their gross profit due to margins being twice as high. Rather I am only pointing out that this data suggests they have very little upside in subscription solutions.Quarterly Store EstimatesRemember that revenue from subscription solutions grows linearly as they increase their quantity of stores, regardless of what its GMV is, so let's use the previously shown financial highlights along with merchant data to see if we can find a connection. Unfortunately, for the first time since IPO, for whatever reason, they did not include the number of merchants last quarter. In any case we can look to historical data to try and find a pattern.Source: Marketplace PulseBecause we don't have an official merchant count for 20Q1, we'll have to estimate what it was, and we can't use the current number of 1,422,815 stores due to the quarter ending March 31st, so we'll have to apply a reasonable amount of guesswork. It has been a total of 267 days since they passed one million, adding 422,815 stores since, coming to an average of roughly 1,583 new stores per day. It has also been 114 days since 20Q1 ended so we can simply subtract 180,462 stores from the current count for an estimated total of 1,242,353. However, due to an acceleration of new stores beginning towards the end of 20Q1 it makes sense to revise that number slightly down to 1.15 million.2019 Q12020 Q1Next Quarter ProjectionsDue to the relatively stable nature of average store contributions, we can use the previously established data to provide projections for 20Q2 as well. In this case, because the fiscal quarter ended 24 days ago, I've revised the total number of stores down from 1.42 million to 1.35 million.2020 Q2 (Projections)OverviewSource: Market Place PulseSource: TSX FilingThis segment isn't as simple as subscription solutions because it's not linearly tied to the quantity of new stores, but rather their sales volume. Moreover the revenue is split between many more areas and, like subscription solutions, the company provides little breakdown within the segment. However, we do know from company statements, highlighted in the TSX filing image above, that merchant solutions revenue is directionally correlated to GMV so let's see if we can find a pattern.Perfect! Every single quarter from 19Q1 to 20Q1 is almost entirely within a tenth of a percent, with 1-2 very minor exceptions, and for both GMV and GPV. You would typically expect GMV to be far less important, but note that Shopify charges a flat 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% fee, depending on the subscription plan, for all third party payment processors, which is in addition to whatever fees the third party charges. Using Shopify Payments has a flat charge of $0.30 per transaction and a processing fee of 2.9%, 2.7%, or 2.4%, again depending on the subscription plan.Total Addressable MarketThis is something that can both be easily determined while being simultaneously useless without context. The simplest starting point is of course the projected retail e-commerce GMV across the globe in FY20. In order to get this we can look to Statista, also referenced by Shopify.Whoa! No denying that $4.2 trillion is one big number. Don't get too excited just yet though, remember that we've previously established Shopify generated roughly 1.55% of GMV in revenue. While still an incredibly large number, it drops all the way down to $65.20 billion. This is of course a phenomenal improvement over FY19 merchant solutions revenue of $935.9 million, but it's still only 55.2% of their current market cap and still requires a 100% monopoly on all retail e-commerce sales, which is obviously not even a remote possibility.Shopify included internal TAM estimates in their 19Q3 investor deck, but it unfortunately does not separate between subscription solutions and merchant solutions and only gives a specific number for SMB's -- $70 billion.Source: Investor Deck 19Q32020 Q2 (Projections)Shopify Payments Runs On StripeWhile this is typically presented as a Shopify product, they don't actually process payments themselves, they use financial services company Stripe for this. The license can be found here, as filed with the SEC, albeit with some important redactions. Interestingly enough Stripe itself is valued at $35 billion as of late last year. Stripe processes payments for many other big names like Lyft and AirBnb, as well as Shopify, and sees hundreds of billions per year in GPV as of late 2019.Limitations Of Unique StoresUnlike Amazon or eBay, Shopify is not a centralized storefront, which is by design, allowing merchants to ""maintain their brand"". However it also means that each store will need to generate its own traffic, and Shopify contributes to this effort. Selling on Amazon has the advantage of nearly a quarter billion unique visitors per month. Obviously Shopify is not only nowhere near this, but more importantly its traffic is spread between nearly 1.5 million separate stores. There will always be an incredibly large percentage of e-commerce sales processed through these central storefronts, further limiting how much of the market Shopify can penetrate.Source: TSX Annual Information FY20We have established that, with a 100% market share, the upper limit for subscription solutions revenue FY20 is $4.78 billion. We then also established the upper limit for merchant solutions revenue FY20 is $65.20 billion with an impossible 100% market share on a projected $4.2 trillion in global retail e-commerce. Add these two together and you get a total addressable market of just under $70 billion, which represents just 59.3% of Shopify's current market capitalization of $118 billion.Due to Shopify's already very high market share in hosted e-commerce, in particular their lead in the highest GMV cohorts, subscription solutions has far less potential than merchant solutions. The issue is of course valuation, how can one justify spending $118 billion now for a total addressable market that's only 59.3% as large?I still maintain my price target of $118 which would give them a market capitalization of $13.83 billion. This represents 8x trailing sales and 6.4x forward sales, which is still twice as high as Amazon has been in the last two decades. Anything above $186 is completely uninvestable, as this would not only represent more than 10x sales but more importantly represents one third of their estimated TAM across both revenue segments FY20.20Q2 ProjectionsI've already shared projections for both subscription solutions and merchant solutions, but I've combined the two for convenience below.Further ThoughtsThere are many other areas I would have liked to include but, given both time constraints and the current article size, were not included. Many of these are gone over in more detail in my previous articles, and I may edit this article in the future to include some of them."
4357812,105617,2020-07-10T09:18:57-04:00,"Shopify's fundamental valuations put it as one of the most overvalued stocks in the current market.Exponential revenue growth is still in its beginning phases, and valuations in metrics like P/S resemble that of Tesla in 2013.Although the fundamentals and financials don't necessarily back the strength of the current rally, those don't need to, as Shopify's potentials remain sky-high.Valuations don't always show the full story behind a company's current picture and potential, and long-term vision would see lofty valuations fall in stride over time.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) soared through Q2 as one of the top performers across the broader market, with shares topping the $1,000 threshold just months after bouncing around the $300s. At current prices, Shopify's market cap sits near $120 billion. To put that in perspective, that's double that of Square's (NYSE:SQ) and one-third that of recently partnered Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Yet Shopify is still unprofitable and is probably one of the most (if not the most) overvalued stocks based on fundamentals, but shares are still cruising higher. And shares could continue to cruise higher even as fundamental metrics and financials don't necessarily back that growth.Even though Shopify has powered higher on the back of a strong Q1, with solid growth in revenue, total GMV and new stores, annual incomes are still down in a rut. Operating and net loss for Q1 were worse YoY: operating loss increased to 16% of revenue as opposed to 11% a year ago, and net loss widened by ~$7 million (~30%). That might not sound too shocking, as the first quarter did boast unprecedented challenges, but Shopify's annual incomes are a bit more shocking.Revenues for Shopify are starting to trend exponentially, crossing the half-billion-dollar threshold in 2017, and triple that already by 2020. Revenues are expected to continue growing at a similar, high-30% rate as the adoption of e-commerce continues to rise as opposed to traditional retail in the upcoming years.Yet Shopify's net losses are only becoming worse and still show signs of increasing again for this fiscal year, based on Q1 net loss and operating loss widening YoY. Annual net loss has doubled since 2018 and is six times that of 2015's loss of $18.8 million; that's moving at nearly the same rate as revenues, but in the opposite direction.Data by YChartsBut Q1 historically is Shopify's ""best"" quarter aside from Q4; revenues have shown quarterly growth in Q2 and Q3, but also wider net losses in each of the two quarters compared to Q1. If this trend continues, albeit under different circumstances potentially for much of the remainder for the fiscal year, Shopify could easily continue its trend of deteriorating net losses.Source: Shopify Quarterly Income StatementShopify suspended its annual guidance based on unknowns within consumer spending habits, rate of adoption of such spending habits to e-commerce, and rate of transition of brick-and-mortar retailers to e-commerce. All three of these could adversely impact Shopify's bottom-line results - less consumer spending per person could mean less revenue unless the volume of consumers shopping offsets that, and reopening could have channeled more traffic in brick-and-mortar locations during Q2 as some groups were eager to return to a more normal lifestyle.Shopify could also benefit from those three if the pandemic has accelerated consumer spending online only and if more consumers choose to spend online (as well as more merchants from brick-and-mortar locations choosing to sell online). No matter which way, Shopify sees a benefit from those three factors it has already outlined; rising costs within general operating expenses as well as R&D will continue to cut into revenue growth. Total operating expenses are on a consistent upward trajectory and have shown no signs of plateauing. Understandably so. As the platform continues to grow, general operating expenses should also grow, as has been the case. R&D costs are focused on expansion and innovation, and with a highly competitive e-commerce environment, costs in R&D are unlikely to reduce anytime soon.Assuming costs won't plateau as Shopify aims to continue innovating and expanding in conjunction with revenue growth, it could find it difficult in reversing its widening net losses. Especially as merchants for Q1 (and potentially for the fiscal year) transitioned to lower-priced plans. If merchants are resorting to cost cutting by downgrading their plan on Shopify, yet are still seeing benefits from increased adoption of e-commerce, those merchants would most likely be more hesitant to re-upgrade and spend more in the future.Aside from Shopify's financials, its fundamental valuations, namely forward EV/EBITDA, forward P/S and forward P/E, have it as one of the most overvalued stocks on the market today. It's not just the fact that Shopify's market cap has tripled since March - it's more so that these already somewhat sky-high valuations have now went into outer space.Data by YChartsBefore the pandemic, Shopify's EV/EBITDA sat around a whopping 500 multiple, a seemingly ridiculous figure for a company generating a negative $100 million annual EBITDA (still ridiculous even if that's positive). Yet that valuation now sits at an over 2,000 time multiple, based off a forward annual EBITDA of about $50 million. But here's the kicker. Shopify might not even get close to that annual EBITDA target, causing a much further overvaluation here, as Q1 already posted a negative $44.8 million EBITDA.Data by YChartsShopify's forward P/S is still quite shocking, trading at over 56 times sales. During the March selloff, forward P/S was a much more ""reasonable"" ~18, which is still severely overvalued. P/S, forward or trailing, is still a basic ratio and doesn't necessarily account for Shopify's rapid revenue growth rate. Piper Sandler believes that revenues could quadruple to $12 billion in five years' time. Even with that revenue growth in mind, Shopify's forward P/S still looks grossly exaggerated.Data by YChartsP/E is probably the most widely looked-at ratio. From a forward P/E standpoint, Shopify trades at just under 2,000 times forward earnings, back to where it had been in January, when shares were just above half of today's level. So forward earnings estimates are half of what they had been in January, after being sliced as the pandemic hit. Yet that's what makes it particularly troublesome. Shopify is trading much closer to that January multiple even as revisions were dropped significantly. With no guidance and uncertain circumstances for the remainder of the year, dropping earnings estimates again would only push forward P/E far past 2000.At this point, it's quite obvious that Shopify doesn't fall within ""normal"" valuations and shouldn't be traded as such. When looking at Shopify's fundamental metrics, none of them are anywhere close to resembling a ""normal"" range.Shopify has near exponential annual revenue streams, but nearly a mirror picture within its net losses. That hasn't affected the performance of the shares at all, and neither have any of the aforementioned bloated multiples.Sure, I might have just spent nearly a thousand works talking about Shopify's financials and fundamentals, but, honestly, they're quite meaningless. Regardless of the ""bubble"" or outrageous valuations, this is not the first time a company has traded on wild valuations, and kept rallying. Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) P/S looked very similar back in 2013, when its exponential growth was just beginning, and shares were trading at nearly one-tenth then of what they are today.Data by YChartsSo how does the 2013 Tesla compare to 2020 Tesla? Well, annual revenues for 2013 shot up to $2 billion from $400 million in 2012, and now revenues are over 13 times 2013's figure. And Tesla is still yet to show a net profit, even with that rapid revenue growth; shares have still soared since then. Valuations with P/S have settled, but it didn't take shares falling off a cliff to do so. Once Tesla's revenue growth went exponential, valuations came back to Earth, but still remained much higher than that of peers, typical for a growth stock.Shopify's revenues didn't see such a boost as Tesla's did back in 2013, but Shopify is already on that exponential trajectory with its revenues. Sure, its valuations might look far out of line, but it's just the beginning. Growth stocks are always valued differently, and so are exponential growth stocks, especially during the beginning phase.Shopify also is surrounded by a flurry of good news - partnerships with Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS), and Walmart (WMT), raised price targets, and outperform ratings. Continued positivity is unlikely to cause shares to cave in in the near term, while long-term exponential growth is still the foremost figure behind the name. While there could be some consolidation in shares in the near term due to profit taking or eventual shorting due to some investors believing in a ""bubble"", the long-term growth story of Shopify looks to only have just begun. Think of Tesla in 2013 - how many people would have seen shares at $1,000 in seven years? So the question here is where is Shopify in seven years? $2,000? $3,000? Seven years is a massive stretch of time when many are playing the game day by day.The pandemic has transferred Shopify's GMV from a PoS to an e-commerce setting, a trend that SHOP should continue to capitalize on in the future, as e-commerce adoption is only expected to grow. Shopify's financials aren't the best, with net loss growing opposite revenues, and fundamentals are quite honestly shocking. But none of that matters.Shopify is just breaking into stride in its exponential growth, and valuations aren't going to show just where this stock will be in the long-term picture. Shopify's valuations, especially that in the P/S realm, are very reminiscent of a budding Tesla in 2013, and seven years later, Tesla has outshone nearly everything and paved its way into becoming a fan-favorite, ""cult""-style name.So although Shopify's valuations place it as one of the most overvalued stocks based on that and that alone, shares still have room to run. But that's on a long-term picture, a three-, or five-, or seven-year, or even longer picture. Those playing this name day by day could be calling for shorts and overvaluation like the boy who cried wolf, but in a long-term game, Shopify could be on the cusp of breaking into its full potential."
4369554,105617,2020-08-18T15:08:48-04:00,"Shopify has posted outstanding growth in GMV for the BFCM 4-day shopping period, with $2.9 billion+ in 2019 and $1.5 billion+ in 2018.New merchants and new stores created have accelerated due to the pandemic, further adding to potential growth in GMV.E-commerce is estimated to account for up to 30% of total sales this holiday season, doubling from last year due to changes in shopping trends.Rising ad spend could be one area of weakness, although it should not affect Shopify in terms of GMV.","The Black Friday/Cyber Monday shopping season is still quite some time away, but marketing and advertising campaigns will start to pick up in a few weeks' time, marking the beginning of a very important holiday shopping season for both traditional stores and e-commerce players. E-commerce holiday sales were $137.6 billion for 2019, representing ~14% of total sales; however, it is estimated that up to 30% of holiday sales this season could be driven by e-commerce, leaving significant room for e-commerce players to benefit. With that, Shopify (SHOP) could be on track to see another stellar holiday season, but ad spending is likely to be its biggest headwind going into the holidays.The company has shown strong holiday season sales the past two years, which will definitely continue into the upcoming holiday season. In 2018, Shopify noted that it saw over $1.5 billion in GMV over the four day period from Black Friday to Cyber Monday, with nearly 11,000 orders per minute at the peak; 2019 saw over $2.9 billion in GMV for the four days.As digitization trends increased during the pandemic, the company expanded its merchant base quite rapidly. On a sequential basis, ""new stores created on the Shopify platform grew 71% in Q2 2020"" due to the extension of the free trial period from 14 days to 90 days. More large sellers transitioned to the platform, ""resulting in a record quarter for new merchant adds to Shopify Plus."" With over 1 million merchants on the platform before the holiday season in 2019, the strong growth in new merchants and stores should drive holiday GMV much higher alongside an uptick in e-commerce sales as a percentage of total sales for the period.Shopify did note that conversion could be an issue with the extended trial period, as new stores were ""converting into paid subscribers at a slightly lower rate"" than pre-pandemic stores. However, this should not have much of an impact on holiday sales, as the overall growth to stores and merchants added will offset that lower conversion.But as the summer winds to an end, Shopify's new merchants and new stores are heading into the busiest periods to start marketing campaigns for the holiday season. September is the top month to start planning, with 25.5% of brands doing so then; October follows in close second, with 19.6%. June, July and August complete the top five, as the three combined see 33.3%.(Source: Shopify)As marketing picks up, those brands have concerns that need to be addressed as well, with the top concern being rising ad spend. The holiday season is highly competitive not only in the sense that customers are searching for the best deals for limited inventory (another concern for brands), but the brands are spending more to capture what really is a marginal change in order volume.The numbers below are from 2019's holiday season - whereas US average order value rose 1.45%, global average order value barely changed, rising just 0.24% above the mean. Yet, ad spending on Facebook (FB) on a cost-per-click basis more than doubled from the $0.70 norm.(Source: Shopify)While new stores are growing on Shopify, the conversion rate slowing does indicate that some new stores are only interested in utilizing the platform for the free 90-day trial; this could mean that smaller merchants are more worried about overall expenditures, and looking at methods of cutting costs while maintaining exposure to e-commerce. If that is the case, rising ad spend through platforms like Facebook could push more smaller merchants away from large ad campaigns, which could impact the bottom line GMV gained from small merchants.But GMV still will benefit from another concern of brands - shipping and fulfillment. ""GMV associated with 'buy online, pickup in store' in [English-speaking] geographies more than doubled"" during Q2 as more stores began offering curbside and in-store pickup, and more customers began to prefer contactless methods of shopping. If stores continue to offer in-store and curbside pickup methods, GMV could see a boost there.Another pocket where Shopify can capitalize on comes with its recent partnership with Affirm, offering layaway options for payment. Any purchase made under the new ""Shop Pay Installments"" will be ""four equal, bi-weekly payments,"" which will allow customers to purchase items that normally might be too expensive for a single payment and spread that payment over two months to lessen the overall financial impact, as wallets have been hit hard since March.It's unclear whether the new partnership will be fully rolled out by the holiday season, as it looks to be ""available to eligible U.S. merchants later this year;"" Affirm's CEO said that it ""has seen 'unbelievable traction on Shopify already' in terms of user adoption."" Even if the payment plan doesn't make it out in time for this holiday season, it will definitely play a beneficial role in the following holiday season as well as in normal purchasing.Shopify has seen some exceptional growth numbers as digitization trends ramp up alongside the pandemic. Strong revenue and GMV growth should continue, especially as the holiday season nears, and e-commerce growth for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas-related sales is expected to soar. Shopify most recently did just under $3 billion in GMV for 2019, but with the growth to new stores and merchants, could easily do $4.5 billion in GMV this holiday season. If the partnership with Affirm can be rolled out by then, it could provide a boost to GMV with layaway options, but it might not be available in time. One area that the company could see weakness is within ad spending within smaller merchants, as September and October account for the beginning of nearly half of all marketing campaigns for brands with $10 million+ annual revenue. Shopify looks set to have a strong holiday season in 2020, and as shares are ~9% off highs, it could be an attractive entry price for further growth by December."
4369459,104941,2020-08-18T10:00:35-04:00,"Followers of mine, specifically Beating The Market subscribers, understand that I am focused like a laser on technology and industries that are radically altering the world around us.With that being said, followers of mine also understand that I approach investing with sobriety and focus on two primary tools: discounted cash flow models and projecting free cash flow.One cannot simply throw money at the latest hot stocks in the hopes thereby of beating the market.There must be nuanced understanding of 1) what the market is projecting in the way of growth, 2) the opportunity that lies ahead for the company, and 3) what management believes it can achieve.Today, I will walk us through my philosophies around projecting intrinsic value and using that projection to generate alpha. To highlight my methods, I will value Shopify.","Source: www.dreamstime.comA wonderful business can be a bad investment when priced with excessive exuberance. That is, one can buy even the best company on earth and still underperform broader indices if they do not exercise discretion in their evaluation of the underlying intrinsic value of the company.I have been witnessing this trend quite a bit within the comments sections of a few of my recent articles on hot issues, such as Shopify (SHOP), Fastly (FSLY), and Apple (AAPL). Specifically, while Fastly traded in the stratosphere, commenters were replying with their purchases of it in the $90s and $100s. I, of course, was less convinced.To be sure, I have been an ardent believer in all three of these companies and have been a shareholder in Shopify and Apple for years. In June of this year, I opened my first position in Fastly and plan to hold indefinitely.But as of writing this, the valuations on these stocks have trended well above the upper bounds of their intrinsic value, if we are looking at such a projection with any level of sobriety. Furthermore, a handful (possibly more than a handful) of Wall Street darlings are priced to absolute perfection. Great stocks don't have to experience apocalyptic declines (the likes of which we saw in 1999-2000) to still be bad investments. They might just consolidate for 5 years, while companies, such as Zillow (ZG) (Z), with much less exuberance priced into its shares, may double and triple over the same time period.Today, I will unpack these ideas in further depth, and I will illustrate this all via a valuation of Shopify using both a discounted cash flow model and a projection of intrinsic value by way of the growth of free cash flow per share.That is, there are two primary objectives of this note:Creating Projections Of Intrinsic ValueIntrinsic value has a few different shades, but it's a rather indisputable fact that free cash flow drives the value of companies higher. If one is planning a corporate project, they don't ask, ""Hey Ed, what do you think the GAAP earnings on this new building will be?"" Instead, they discount the cash flows that the project will generate to their present value so as to ascertain whether they should go forward with the new project. It is no different with any cash flow generating asset in which we might invest.With that in mind, I project intrinsic value in two primary ways:These two methods are straightforward, and they are coded into my proprietary valuation tool, the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model. Of course, there are a few additions to the valuation model aside from just those two components, i.e., it accounts for the additional return created by dividends and it accounts for the additional return created by share buybacks. But other than those additional components, the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model is very straightforward and is predicated on the two aforementioned ways of projecting intrinsic value.Let's dig into both of these primary ways of projecting intrinsic value before we begin using them to ascertain intrinsic value for Shopify.Understanding Discounted Cash Flow ModelsAs I typed that title, I realized that to contain the rather expansive universe of theory housed within just four words, discounted cash flow model, into a digestible article that's actually focused on executing a valuation of Shopify is a bit foolhardy.It would take many thousands of words to unpack my issues with the various methods of achieving a discount rate, e.g., the idea that beta is hogwash and entirely dilutes the value of a WACC as a discount rate (this, of course, is my personal opinion).So I will stray away from digging too deeply into the theoretical underpinnings of a discounted cash flow model, and I will just focus on what one needs to understand from 50,000 feet.It's the idea that the fair value of a company is the present value of all the cash flows it will generate over its lifetime.While this sounds nice, it's incredibly challenging (if you don't know a few tricks, which I will share later in this note) to execute in a way that's valuable to the operator of the model. Companies do not grow linearly. There are vagaries in companies' revenue growth rates, free cash flow growth rates, and the like. So to identify the precise cash flows that the company will generate over its lifetime and the precise growth rates thereof creates a great deal of... shall we say... uncertainty and room for error.With that being said, there's actually a very easy way to address this issue of uncertainty, and I will share it (spoiler alert: conservative assumptions) following my discussion of the second primary method by which I project intrinsic value.Projecting Free Cash Flow Per Share To Identify Intrinsic ValueThe second primary method by which I project intrinsic value is through the growth of free cash flow per share. The sustainable growth in free cash flow per share is the true driver of the share price of stocks, so it makes sense to project the growth of free cash flow per share so as to identify target share prices in the future.I actually prefer this method over a discounted cash flow model, because it not only tells me the degree of under or overvaluation, but also it tells me what I should expect in the way of annualized returns. Conversely, a discounted cash flow model only illustrates the degree of under or overvaluation, sans projected annualized returns.So some of you might be thinking, ""Alright, Louis, this sounds nice, but no one can predict the future. The future is inherently uncertain. Do you have a crystal ball?""I think it's a perfectly valid stance to take and comment to make, and I have thought at length about these issues. Here's how I address them:Our objective is to create an ""intrinsic value band"". For my own personal portfolio operations, I generally select companies trading at the lower edge of that band. I do this so as to implement a margin of safety, whereby I can be very, very wrong about the future, especially with respect to the macroenvironment, and still generate the returns I project.In today's very frothy markets, it's much more challenging to identify those companies trading on the lower band edges (simply because there seem to be fewer of them in my neck of the woods), though it's certainly not impossible, and I firmly believe there's always great stocks to buy regardless of broader market conditions.As they say,Just ask my Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) buys at market all-time highs in February.With that being said, next, I will run through an example via an exhaustive valuation of a Wall Street Darling, a beloved story, a hot issue if you will, which highlights this intrinsic value band creation process in action.Ultimately, I will provide a forward-looking, actionable investment thesis for Shopify.Let's do it!To create an upper and lower band of intrinsic value for Shopify I will use the following assumptions:Upper BandLower BandShopify DiscussionSo let's dig into each assumption, one by one:Presently, Shopify's free cash flow margin is nowhere near 25% (it did $8M in free cash flow in 2019 on $1.57B of revenue); however, the way that I work with free cash flow margin includes two nuances:This addresses the issues I cited previously in the note, i.e., ""how do we forecast the vagaries of growth in free cash flow and revenues?""So in the case of Shopify, I see that they are generating about 53% gross margins, and as a result, I believe that they will, once they've matured a bit more, be able to expand their free cash flow margin to 25%.Keep in mind that this is the upper band. That is, a 25% free cash flow margin on a 53% gross margin is pretty optimistic if we compare that to mature software peers, who routinely generate about half, and below, of their gross margin in free cash flow.The reality may be that the free cash flow margin will land a bit closer to 20% by 2030 and beyond, hence our lower band reflects this reality.Free cash flow per share is simply .25 * TTM revenues (which include Shopify's recent blockbuster, pandemic fueled quarter) divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding communicated in the company's last quarterly report.35% is incredibly, incredibly generous for Shopify, considering Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has never grown at an annualized rate greater than 27% during a ten year period for the last two decades. (!!)So while it may very well come to be the case that Shopify grows at 35% over the next ten years, we're investing with literally zero margin of safety.Throughout my investing career, I have witnessed the incredible extent to which the change in shares outstanding can impact the value of a company's shares. Whether through buybacks or dilutions, there's a reason the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model accounts for fluctuations in shares outstanding: they materially alter the rate at which free cash flow per share grows, which in turn, alters the rate at which the value of a company grows.And the saying goes,So if free cash flow per share drives share prices, and dilution slows the rate of growth, then dilution, or conversely, repurchase, will accordingly impact the change in share price.In the case of Shopify, if the company only diluted 10%, investors would be lucky. The reality is they will likely dilute closer to 20% at least, so as to fuel the incredible infrastructure growth that's on the horizon for the company.Now, you may be thinking, ""35x is conservative for such a robustly growing company! Amazon's price to free cash flow is 60x.""But you must consider that we normalized the free cash flow Shopify produces to account for the rapid increase in free cash flow per share (to the tune of hundreds if not thousands of percent) that will take place once the company matures to a greater extent over the next 10 to 20 years.I have always valued Amazon based on its normalized free cash flow, and hence, I've always concluded that it's worth buying, despite the relentless chorus of P/E'rs claiming its valuation is inflated.So 35x is much more than fair for Shopify by the year 2030. In fact, it's the best-case scenario, hence it serves as the upper band of intrinsic value.Let's turn our attention back to the graph I shared previously in this article:As can be seen above, the upper band of intrinsic value portrays Shopify reaching a share price of approximately $2800 by 2030. It would do this by growing at the follow rate with the following margins:While I believe it to be possible, I implore you to consider that even the mighty Amazon, with its AWS, ads, and various other business segments, was never able to achieve above 27% annualized growth during a ten year period following it reaching $2B in annual revenue.Again, this is not to say that Shopify won't grow at 35% annualized, but currently, even if it did, it would only generate approximately 11% annualized returns from a share price of $1000, as can be seen below.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelIn closing, I have gotten many, many questions regarding my process over my time as a public writer. I hope that this note to my followers and the general public yielded some insights into the method by which I ascertain intrinsic value, which I, in turn, use to generate alpha.Let me know what you think in the comments.As always, thanks for reading, remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4356514,104302,2020-07-01T05:07:48-04:00,"Intuit and Shopify are the leaders in their corresponding target markets: Intuit caters to SMBs and Shopify caters mostly to Manufacturers/Producers, small brick-and-mortar stores and small e-commerce retailers.The overlap between these segments is remarkable, and this positions Intuit to start competing in the e-commerce software platform arena.This competition can happen through an acquisition of an existing e-commerce software platform provider and integrating the acquired product with Quickbooks Online.In addition to the financial benefits of investing in one of the fastest growing industries, Intuit would also have huge benefits resulting from the synergies with the acquired company.The success of this venture will depend on both Intuit’s efficiency in integrating the operation with Quickbooks Online and Shopify’s retaliation against this new competitor.","Over the last four years, I have been quite actively following the stocks of both Intuit (INTU) and Shopify (SHOP), and trading on both of these companies. I am very bullish on Intuit for various reasons that I will talk about later. As for Shopify, I am bearish on the key segment of its client base, the smaller e-commerce retailers; while I am bearish on a key component Shopify’s target market and believe that it has an abnormally high valuation, I am trying to ride the momentum for the Shopify stock by writing out of the money put options on it.Recently, I have been reading comments on Seeking Alpha that talk about how there are “no competitors to Shopify”. While there are some competitors like BigCommerce, Magento (ADBE), WiX (WIX) and WooCommerce, I found that these competitors, maybe with the exception of BigCommerce, are lacking a lot in their competitiveness. In addition, the omnichannel distribution network of Shopify puts it at a distinct competitive advantage compared to its competitors. In simple terms, Shopify is leading the market for e-commerce software platforms.Last week, the weather was wonderful in Toronto (it still is), and I decided to take a siesta in my backyard. Before taking the siesta, I was reading about Shopify’s competition, and during the siesta I dreamt about Intuit being a Shopify competitor. I am blessed that I am able to remember my dreams very vividly, so I put a comment about my dream on Seeking Alpha. This comment drew its share of sarcasm and ridicule, but the more I thought about the potential of Intuit entering into the e-commerce software platform business space, the more it made sense.This article explains the logic for Intuit to enter into the space of being an e-commerce platform provider and potentially being Shopify’s biggest competitor.This article looks at the potential for Intuit throwing its hat into the e-commerce software platform arena. It also looks at the impact of this new competition on the market leader, Shopify.The article first dissects the e-commerce platform market place into five segments:The article looks at which of these five segments are target markets for both Intuit and Shopify.The article then looks at the competitive position of Shopify and the difficulty that a new entrant would have in competing with them. At the same time, the articles presents the characteristics that would make a new competitor successful in this space, and how Intuit has all the characteristics of a successful competitor. The blueprint for how Intuit can enter into this market through an acquisition of an existing provider is then presented.The article does not provide any numeric calculations as these calculations would be dependent on many internal factors associated with the acquisition that are not currently available. However, a brief review of Intuit’s balance sheet shows that such an acquisition is within its means without having to raise any additional capital.Before we address the main thesis of this article, we need to first understand the competitive landscape. Understanding the different e-commerce segments will position us to appreciate the vulnerabilities and strengths of both companies and why the entry into the business of e-commerce software platforms is an attractive option for Intuit.There are five key segments for e-commerce, that is, the users of the e-commerce software platforms. Shopify currently caters to the first three of these segments and is trying to make inroads into the other two with limited success. Following is the detailed description of these five segments.Description and Characteristics:These are the companies that own, for example, factories, food processing plants and assembly establishments whose products are mostly sold through retailers. The product line for these companies rarely changes, and except for white-label manufacturers, they have well-established brands. Traditionally, these manufacturers and producers have been selling their products through their distribution channels rather than directly to consumers.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:The number of these manufacturers and distributors is expected to remain the same. However most of these manufacturers, especially the very small ones, do not yet have a viable e-commerce presence. Many analysts consider them, especially the ones with successful recognized brands, as the largest growth segment for e-commerce.Platform RequirementsThe e-commerce software platform requirements for manufacturers and producers are fairly limited. They do not normally resort to “pressure tactics” and do not normally need the “bells and whistles” that we sometimes find with smaller e-commerce retailers. The e-commerce platform for these manufacturers is mostly a complementary distribution channel, as most of them would rely on other distribution channels for selling their products.Manufacturers utilize third-party software providers for their e-commerce platforms. E-commerce is not an integral component of their businesses and building their own e-commerce software platform from scratch is not a viable option in most situations. These manufacturers are seasoned business professionals and, as a result, they would be price sensitive; using a product like Shopify would make better business sense for them than building their own e-commerce software platform.Of course, there are always exceptions. These exceptions would be giant manufacturers, and manufacturers who produce high cost items priced at tens of thousands of dollars or higher, like cars, heavy machinery and airplanes. Because of the long sales cycle associated with these products, together with the relatively high transaction costs, these manufacturers may not even need an e-commerce software platform, and if they need it (e.g. Tesla, (TSLA)), they would build their own.Description and Characteristics:These retailers usually have a limited number of retail outlets in malls and shopping centres, and usually specialize in selling niche products. Many of these companies did not have an e-commerce retail presence prior to COVID-19, and only had static web sites. These stores have started to realize the importance of e-commerce after the pandemic hit us, and started creating e-commerce retail stores. Shopify's share of these brick-and-mortar e-commerce stores was higher than other providers because of both its reputation and because of extending the Shopify trial period from 14 days to 90 days (now back to 14 days).Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:While the number of smaller brick-and-mortar stores is expected to drop with the pending bankruptcies resulting in COVID-19, it can still be considered a growth potential from an e-commerce perspective. Most of these smaller brick-and-mortar stores always had an Internet presence at least via static sites, and with COVID-19, they are now realizing the importance of e-commerce, and are creating new Internet outlets.What would happen with these stores as we defeat COVID-19 is anyone’s guess. If these companies survive, they would retain their e-commerce retail outlets, as their cost is insignificant compared to that of the physical stores. These stores may completely go out of business, and abandon the retail business altogether. Also, these companies may choose to close their physical stores and turn to be small e-commerce retailers.Platform RequirementsSimilar to manufacturers, these smaller brick-and-mortar merchants would not consider their e-commerce outlets as their primary distribution channel, unless they close their physical locations as described above. As a result, they would not have highly sophisticated needs. They are, however, still a retail store with requirements that are higher than those of the manufacturers; their platform provider needs to have strong capabilities to handle their needs.Because of their size, these merchants would utilize third-party providers for their e-commerce software platforms; Their size would not allow them to put in the investments to build or customize their e-commerce retail solution. These merchants are also seasoned business professionals and are price sensitive; using a product like Shopify would make better business sense for them than building their own e-commerce software platform.Description and Characteristics:These are retailers who do not have a physical retail outlet. Many of these retailers do not even have a warehouse for the products they sell and rely on the drop-shipping business model. Some of these retailers are multi-employee companies, but most of them are a one or two person shop operating from their own home using drop-shipping as the core of their operation. Some of them may even be conducting their business on a part-time basis. Many of these retailers have a very limited number of products on their site, sometimes even a single product. With a single product, once it goes out of fashion, they close the e-commerce store and start a new one focusing on a different product. Many of these retailers have multiple stores running concurrently.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:I expect that this segment of the market will be declining over time for two reasons:I believe that the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated this trend: the e-commerce increased with clients being locked down with lots of time on their hands to buy products online. However, they also now have the time to research products before buying them. So, the question is “where is this smaller e-commerce retailers revenue going to?” It would go either to the manufacturers who can afford dropping their prices as they cut out the middle-man (the retailer) or to the larger e-commerce providers like BestBuy, Amazon and Walmart who possess the proper economies of scale.Platform RequirementsThe key need for smaller e-commerce retailers from an e-commerce platform is the bells and whistles that can attract the buyers and get them to buy the products on an impulsive basis. They also need the omnichannel capabilities that would allow them to sell their product concurrently through multiple advertising venues. Because of their size, they would not build their own platform.So far, these merchants are not price sensitive, as their margins are relatively large considering the very low startup costs that they have. I expect this to change over time as price wars hit these merchants and as their margins drop.Because of its superior omnichannel capabilities combined with its affiliate marketing strategies, Shopify has practically owned the lion’s share of this segment.Description and Characteristics:These are the larger brick-and-mortar chains (e.g. Walmart (WMT) and Target(TGT)) together with the giant e-commerce retailers (e.g. JD.com (JD) and Amazon (AMZN)). These companies have massive supply chain management systems and sophisticated IT departments.These companies have the economies of scale to keep the prices relatively low compared to smaller retailers. Most of these companies own their own fulfillment centres, which would allow them to have fast and efficient delivery. Moreover, because of their physical locations, they can afford having very friendly return policies that would be attractive to the buyers.Because of the dynamics of e-commerce and the shift towards economies of scale and higher education for customers as described above, e-commerce products will be commoditized and these larger retailers would be the winners from this commoditization.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:I expect this segment to consistently grow as they take on the business from the smaller e-commerce retailers, amplified by the e-commerce market increases. As a result, I expect that their growth rate would be faster than the general e-commerce growth rate.Platform RequirementsThese companies require very sophisticated e-commerce platforms that are directly linked to their supply chain management systems. Most of these companies have deployed major customization to their supply chain management systems, and as a result cannot use off-the-shelf e-commerce platforms for their operations.In addition, their sophisticated IT departments would be able to build the e-commerce systems needed for the company operations. Of course, if they can avoid building the e-commerce software platform from scratch and use some open-source software instead, it would be a good thing to save costs and expedite the development process.The key point here is that these companies would consider the e-commerce software platform as one of their core competencies, and the possibility of outsourcing it is very remote.Description and Characteristics:These are companies that do not buy and sell products, but provide a marketplace for other manufacturers and retailers to sell through. Some of these marketplaces (e.g. Amazon and Walmart) are also direct retailers, while some are strictly marketplaces (e.g. Alibaba (BABA) and Etsy (ETSY)). Many of these marketplaces provide their retailers and manufacturers with fulfillment services that are directly integrated with their e-commerce software platforms. The number of these marketplaces is fairly limited compared to the other segments, but their Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) is massive. Their clients are either manufacturers (segment-1) or small retailers (segment-2 and segment-3).Personal Opinion: I personally believe that Shopify has the long-term vision to operate in the e-commerce marketplace segment, and this is why they ventured into the fulfillment centre business. These centres would not only increase the revenue for Shopify but may also circumvent the slow down or death of the smaller e-commerce retailers.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:The decline in the small e-commerce retailers segment should be balanced with both the growth of manufacturers/producers segment and the overall growth in e-commerce. As a result, I expect the e-commerce marketplace provider segment to have a relatively slow growth. However, because of the economies of scale that this segment possesses, most of the growth would go directly to the bottom line.Platform RequirementsThe software for this segment is its core competency, and its requirements are fairly sophisticated. They need to keep it connected to the different e-commerce store providers to allow the users of these platforms to list their products with them. In addition, most of these companies have strong IT departments, and they would create their own e-commerce software platform to allow it to be integrated with their operations and fulfillment systems.The following table summarizes the differences among the five retail segments:Before looking at the accounting software category used by the five segments, we need to understand the market that Intuit caters to.Intuit is the market leader in accounting software for small and medium size companies. It currently holds over 55% of accounting software installations through its corporate accounting software products QuickBooks, QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop as per ZoomInfo (ZI).Source: Datanyze, A Zoominfo CompanyThe first segment (the manufacturers/producers) would fit into Intuit's target market if they are smaller in size. Large manufacturers most likely would not fit as they use sophisticated ERP systems that integrate their production environment with their accounting systems, and QuickBooks does not normally provide this automation level. On the other hand, smaller manufacturers fit perfectly into Intuit’s target market, and there is a high likelihood that they would be using Quickbooks.The second and third segments (the small brick-and-mortar retailers and the small e-commerce retailers) fit perfectly into Intuit’s target market. They are small and medium size companies, and the majority of small and medium size companies use Intuit’s Quickbooks.The fourth and fifth segments (the larger e-commerce retailers and the e-commerce marketplaces) similar to the larger manufacturers will most likely use sophisticated ERP systems and would need an integration level that Quickbooks does not provide.The following table summarizes the five segments, whether they are part of the target market for Intuit’s Quickbooks, and the justification for this assessment.Shopify is currently the world leader in e-commerce platform software. Their target market is the first three segments, the manufacturers/producers, the small brick-and-mortar retailers and the small e-commerce retailers.Shopify’s fastest growing segment is potentially the first segment, the manufacturers and producers. With Shopify’s reputation, with its omnichannel capabilities and with its affiliate marketing sales force, many manufacturers and producers who did not have an e-commerce retail presence before, are now moving to the direct-to-consumer distribution channel.As a result of COVID-19, Shopify’s market grew significantly within the second segment, the brick-and-mortar retailers especially the smaller ones. I expect this to be a short-lived growth: If COVID-19 lock-down continues, many of these retail stores would go bankrupt. If COVID-19 is defeated, these stores would most likely return to their brick-and-mortar sales; most would have lower sales and some might still go bankrupt. There is also the possibility that they would abandon their physical stores and have a business model similar to the third segment, the small e-commerce retailers.Because of its affiliate marketing strategies (which I believe they have executed to perfection), Shopify has a stronghold on the third segment, the small e-commerce retailers & drop-shippers.The Shopify omnichannel capabilities far surpass most of its competitors, and this is one of the reasons for its dominance. However, these omnichannel capabilities, while impressive, do not provide Shopify with a defensible position; they are relatively easily replicated. In addition many of these channels are not significant, and adding them may be counter-productive in certain situations.Similar to Intuit, Shopify does not cater to the fourth and fifth segments, the large e-commerce retailers and the e-commerce marketplace providers; these companies, primarily based on their size, usually build their own e-commerce software platforms in-house and consider these platforms as part of their core competencies.Let’s first take a look at Shopify’s position in the e-commerce software platform space.Shopify is the fastest growing e-commerce software platform provider enjoying a revenue CAGR of 71.9% over the last five years. While the growth rate has been declining, this is normal and expected with the growth of the business. Despite this growth, according to Statista and ZoomInfo (ZI) Shopify is still the third in market share with 10.98% of the overall market as of April 2020.Source: StatistaThese numbers are not consistent with the numbers presented by Oberlo, a Shopify company, which claims that Shopify holds 31% of the market.Source: OberloLooking at another source like BuiltWith, we see that Shopify is the world leader with a 1.4 million web sites currently using Shopify (1.8 million web sites that stopped using Shopify, most likely resulting from their customer churn). According to BuiltWith, the runner up is WiX Stores (WIX) with about one million web sites. The growth graph of the web sites using Shopify is nothing sort of impressive as shown below.Source: BuiltWithNow, for the capitalization. Shopify is currently priced with a capitalization of $108B, more than 8 times the capitalization of its runner up in terms of web sites, (WIX). Remember that Shopify has about 1.4 million sites and WiX has about one million sites. From a revenue perspective, WiX has about half the revenue of Shopify.Personal Opinion: The abnormally high capitalization for Shopify can mean either that the Shopify stock is a bubble that would eventually burst or that its growth rate will accelerate beyond the 71% CAGR. I personally believe it is a bubble, and I justified that in an earlier article, Shopify, A Reality Check, when the stock price was much less than its current price.Shopify is clearly one of the world leaders among the e-commerce platform software providers, and some may argue that it is the undisputed world leader. So, the question now is: Why would a company compete with such a strong company that has a capitalization higher than Lockheed Martin (LMT), and that has not yet earned a profit after 16 years of operations?Before answering this question, we have to realize the types of expenses Shopify has.Looking at its financial statements, Shopify currently spends about 50% of its operating expenses on its sales and marketing expenses. Reviewing the details of this section of the financials, we will find that this is mostly spent for its affiliate marketing expenses. Shopify needs the affiliate marketing to maintain its subscription level because of its relatively high churn.Another significant expense, which is disclosed in the annual report, is the stock-based compensation. Shopify spends over $150M annually in stock-based compensation. This is another expense (a non-cash expense this time) that can be adjusted when considering entering into this business.Once we adjust the financial statements by taking out the affiliate marketing expenses and the stock-based compensation, Shopify would turn out to be a highly successful and profitable business. The old adage tell us that successful businesses invite competitors, especially when the barriers to entry or moat is limited for the business model; this applies for Shopify.History has shown us that software is rarely a valid moat for a business. History has also shown us that the market share is not a valid moat either. I believe that Shopify’s biggest moat is its execution of its affiliate marketing scheme which, IMHO, is a text-book prefect execution. Whoever looks at competing with Shopify needs to look at establishing a solid affiliate marketing program, already has a strong affiliate marketing program or has other complementary assets that would compensate for the affiliate marketing program.To be able to compete with Shopify, a new entrant needs to have the following characteristics:Looking at the above criteria, I found it hard to identify a company that is more suited to enter into this business than Intuit.To answer this question, we need to look at the criteria stated in the prior section and assess how they apply to Intuit:Intuit targets the same market segments as Shopify with another product and the company possesses a dominant position with its own product lines in these market segments.Most of Intuit’s corporate clients (via its Quickbooks suite of products) are small and medium size businesses. Intuit has over 55% market share of this accounting software as per the chart shown earlier. If we look at the first three e-commerce segments (manufacturers/producers, small brick and mortar retailers and small e-commerce retailers), we would find that the vast majority of them are small and medium size businesses as well; this is hugely overlapping with Intuit’s customers. We have established earlier that Shopify primarily caters to the first three segments as well.Intuit has deep pockets to make an acquisition of an existing e-commerce software platform provider.Intuit has about $4B of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. This cash balance, which is cyclical in nature as shown in the next chart, has been growing at a good rate over the last few years. With the conversion towards the more profitable Quickbooks Online product, the cash balance is expected to continue to grow and to become less cyclical.Source: Compiled by author from Intuit financial statementsThe Intuit liabilities are very low compared to its assets, and it is mostly composed of deferred revenue and deposits from customers. The following chart shows the strength of Intuit balance sheet as it relates to historical debt:Source: Simply Wall St, We Think Intuit Can Manage Its Debt With EaseWe can conclude from this that Intuit can use a part of its cash balance for the acquisition of an e-commerce software platform that can be integrated within its products.Intuit would be able to recognize significant synergies between its existing products and a new e-commerce software platform, including seamless technical integration.The existing accounting systems invariably have an inventory control subledger that keeps track of the inventory items. At the same time, e-commerce software platforms are mostly an inventory system with a few layers on top of it. E-commerce software platforms need to interface to accounting systems and feed data to it to ensure the proper controls are in place. Frequently, the interface is not done through a direct interface, but rather through a manual journal entry into the accounting system.Assume that Quickbooks would have a “Quickbooks Shops” feature which would allow customers to have an e-commerce software platform that is fully integrated with Quickbooks. This would result in synergies on the following fronts:Intuit would benefit by reducing the churn on both its products and the new e-commerce software platform.The more integrated components that a company uses with the same provider, the less likely that the customer will seek moving to another provider. This basic principle will help Intuit on two fronts related to the churn:Intuit has a strong affiliate marketing program and Intuit has enough complementary assets that would allow it to run its e-commerce software platform operations without the need for affiliate marketing.Intuit has one of the most elaborate affiliate marketing programs in the corporate world with its Intuit Partnerships programs. These programs not only address sales and marketing, but also extend to consulting, education and app integration. Intuit can easily extend these partnership programs to provide an affiliate marketing programs that rival and even better the Shopify affiliate marketing programs.At the same time, Intuit has many complementary assets in its existing products that would compensate for the need to have an elaborate affiliate marketing program for the sale of the e-commerce software platform product. The discussion of Intuit complementary assets requires an article on its own and is beyond the scope of this article.Intuit can have a presence in the e-commerce software platform market in one of two ways:The “build” solution would be time consuming, which would not capitalize on the existing growth of the e-commerce market. In addition, building software products always involves a significant risk from multiple perspective, the least of which is the inflated actual costs compared to the budget. Finally, the marketing campaign associated with the launch of a new e-commerce software platform of Quickbooks would be very long and overly expensive campaign.The “buy” solution does not present the problems found in the “build” solution. The main drawback of the “buy” solution is the cost factor, and the amount of cash that needs to be put upfront. Except for this cost/cash drawback, the “buy” solution provides the following benefits to Intuit:Based on the above analysis, acquiring a company would be far more advantageous to building a product from scratch. The question now is “How much should Intuit pay for this e-commerce software provider?”On June 22nd, Bloomberg reported that “BigCommerce could IPO”, and that the company would be valued at around $1B (remember, Shopify is valued at $108B). BigCommerce is considered one of the most viable competitors from a functionality perspective especially for higher-end customers. Style Factory provides a comprehensive overview between BigCommerce and Shopify: BigCommerce vs Shopify (2020) — Which is Best?, and I would suggest that you read it to assess whether the valuations of BigCommerce and Shopify are in line with each other.While a possibility, I am not suggesting that Intuit buys BigCommerce (although they can easily afford it via a cash and share deal) unless the technology and culture between both companies are highly compatible. Rather, Intuit can look at the other providers in the market that are most compatible with Intuit from an acquisition perspective, and offer to buy them. Most of these providers are private companies, which would allow Intuit to benefit from the private company discount.Assuming that the offer for the e-commerce software platform company is no more than $500M (half the valuation of BigCommerce), Intuit would be able to afford without raising any additional funding. With the growth in e-commerce, the direct financial benefits for this acquisition will far exceed the $500M.More importantly, the indirect benefits like the reduction of the churn, the reputational benefits and the increased market capitalization (resulting from moving into, potentially, one of the fastest growing businesses) would far exceed the direct benefits addressed earlier.In any business, incumbents are always negatively impacted when a new competitor throws their hat in the ring, regardless of the strength of this competitor. Intuit being the new competitor would have a double whammy on Shopify. Not only is it a powerful new competitor with deep pockets, it is also a market leader with almost 100% overlap with Shopify’s target market; both companies target the first three segments of the e-commerce software platform market.On the other hand, Intuit is not coming as a brand new competitor as it is acquiring an existing provider. If this acquisition is not properly executed, it might be a beneficial thing for Shopify, as it would be eliminating or reducing the power of an existing competitor. We have seen that happening in many cases, and an example is provided in the next section.How much market share would Shopify lose or gain from this competition is anyone’s guess, and will depend on the execution of Intuit on the acquisition more than Shopify’s reaction to the new competition. Acquisitions are always tricky matters and no one can predict what would come out of them.A recent example of a company trying to enter into the e-commerce software platform market through acquisitions is Adobe through its acquisition of Magento in May 2018 for $1.68B. This acquisition resulted in a significant loss of market share for Magento from over 10% of the total market to around 4% in just a few years. The reasons for this drop and potentially acquisition failure can be the subject of another paper.Following is how I think Intuit should/would be different from Adobe:Now, what actions would Shopify take if/when such an acquisition happens, and Intuit becomes a competitor in the e-commerce software platform space is anyone’s guess. My guess is that they would try to come up with something innovative and creative as they have done in the past. There is a possibility that they would create an accounting software extension to Shopify; this venture would have some interesting challenges and should be the subject of another paper.There are five segments of e-commerce, and Shopify caters to three of them: the manufacturers/producers, the small brick-and-mortar stores and the small e-commerce retailers. Intuit caters to small and medium size businesses (SMBs) and the three e-commerce segments that Shopify caters to, with the exception of a few large manufacturers, are almost all small and medium size companies, fitting perfectly in Intuit's target market.Shopify and Intuit are both the leaders in their corresponding markets. Interestingly, these markets have a huge amount of overlap as shown earlier in the article. This overlap, in addition to other factors presented in the article, would render Intuit as an ideal candidate to venture into the e-commerce software platform space.This article suggests that Intuit, through its deep pockets, would buy an existing e-commerce software provider at a price tag that does not exceed $500M. This acquisition would allow Intuit to hit the ground running and become a viable serious competitor to the existing players, with Shopify, the market leader, having the most to lose.If/when this acquisition happens, and Intuit enters into the e-commerce software platform business, its success would depend on how efficiently the company integrates this acquisition into its operations and get it to be an extension of Quickbooks Online. Its success would also depend on how Shopify reacts to this acquisition and what retaliatory actions it might take."
4357251,104941,2020-07-07T05:03:46-04:00,"Shopify is transforming e-commerce via its incredibly powerful platform (read: operating system) that empowers entrepreneurs and businesses to easily set up and run online stores on multiple channels.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation for businesses, thereby creating a significant influx of new merchants on Shopify's platform.Low e-commerce penetration of merely ~12% of total retail translates into an incredible growth opportunity for Shopify. A rise in self-employment could serve as an additional booster too.Shopify's omnichannel offering with an emphasis on physical product sales has constructed a moat for the company that will be difficult for competitors to surmount.I am, as I have always been, long-term bullish on Shopify, though I believe it will consolidate for at least a couple years at ~$1,000.","Source: seosydney.comI am finally providing a follow-up article to my last Shopify article, entitled ""Shopify Vs. Square Part II: The Anti-Amazon Awakens"". I recommend all readers of this article to first read that article. To that end, the company's share price fell and rose as I wanted, though I did not have the time nor focus to further alert people to Shopify's undervaluation during March, as I was focused on writing about other market-beating companies. To that end, let's explore an updated view of the rapidly evolving enterprise of Shopify; after which, I will provide a valuation of the company using the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model.Let's get into it!A permanent shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar to online stores has been going on for several years/decades with the rise of big marketplaces like Amazon (AMZN). However, budding entrepreneurs and small retailers were being largely left behind.With this landscape as our backdrop, Shopify (SHOP) was quietly developing what would become the most valuable small-business-oriented online store builder. As I related in my ""The Anti-Amazon Awakens"" article (linked above), Shopify offers an incredibly powerful platform (read: operating system on which users employ low code to create stores) that empowers these entrepreneurs and SMBs to set up and run online stores quickly; on top of which, Shopify provides merchant solutions that help its stores with backend services like order management, shipping, payments, inventory management, etc.An individual could set up his/her online store within hours and run it effectively across multiple channels directly through Shopify's platform. In short, Shopify is helping the ""Davids"" out there combat ""Goliath"", i.e., Amazon.Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has only served to hasten the steady transition from brick-and-mortar retail to online shopping. And as technology continues to evolve, it's extremely imaginable to see a world where malls become virtually obsolete (with the advent of virtual reality and the benefits thereof in terms of experiencing products and trying on clothing).In the near term, however, small businesses have been forced to adapt their operations into an online format so as to survive through the shutdowns. As consumer spending continues to move towards online stores, every retail business will need to have an online sales channel (specifically omnichannel, at which Shopify specializes) if they wish to survive and thrive.Before the pandemic, e-commerce sales contributed to just 12% of total retail sales, which highlights the extent to which e-commerce can further penetrate. According to Shopify's COO, this figure has increased to ~25% due to the pandemic, which should translate in much higher Gross Merchandise Value [GMV] processed through Shopify's platform. From my perspective, the change in consumption patterns will be largely permanent.To these ends, my investment thesis for Shopify revolves around the following points:By now, you all are aware of Shopify's core business strategy; however, in this section, I will further elaborate it. If you know about Shopify's business, feel free to skip over to the next section.Shopify offers an easy-to-use platform that can be employed to create online stores for, generally speaking, the primary purpose of selling physical products (they shy away from service-oriented businesses, on which other companies, such as Wix (WIX) specialize). Using this single platform, an individual or a business could set up and manage their store and its inventory, while deploying their offerings across every selling channel available, i.e., Instagram, Facebook, and others; a depiction of which can be seen below.Source: Shopify Investor Deck Q1 2020Additionally, Shopify offers several back-office solutions to the merchants on its platform. These solutions include essential business functions like payments, marketing, inventory management, order management, shipping, and even capital (short-term business loans).Source: Shopify Investor Deck Q1 2020The rise of e-commerce has materialized over the last two decades with the emergence of marketplaces like Amazon. However, small retailers have found themselves at a disadvantage as such big marketplaces possess an incredible advantage through superior technology and economies of scale. For the merchants that do sell on Amazon's marketplace, they often find their products being undercut on price by Amazon's ""generic brands"". And since Amazon delivers all the packages with its own logo, businesses are not able to optimally build brand recognition while selling through such marketplaces.Shopify is disrupting such marketplaces by empowering entrepreneurs via its merchant-first platform. Entrepreneurs get to create their own websites, applications, and custom product packages, which enables them to form a brand association within their consumers' minds. However, Shopify sellers are not limited to their own websites because the platform offers them capabilities to set up sales channels on multiple marketplaces.Thus, Shopify offers its merchants a unique platform that can be used to build and grow an e-commerce business across many sales channels, whilst also offering essential back-office support services to run online retail businesses efficaciously.The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe implications on human life, but Shopify has been at the forefront of the battle, helping many small businesses (merchants) stay afloat during these tough times. Small retailers were, in a way, forced to go online, and that has led to a surge in new stores on Shopify's platform. Here's an excerpt from Shopify's Q1 press release:Source: Shopify Press ReleaseLet's hear directly from Shopify's COO about their response to the changing business environment in a COVID-19 altered world.Source: How e-commerce is changing retail trends during the pandemic: Shopify COOWell, now we know that Shopify could come out of the current crisis as a stronger company due to new merchant acquisition (via existing retailers going online, self-employment, etc.). However, even before the coronavirus pandemic came around, Shopify was a company in hypergrowth mode.In Q1 2020, Shopify registered its platform's GMV as $17.4 billion (up 46% y/y), a figure which was attributable to higher e-commerce sales (by extension, the forced shutdown of retail outlets in several locations across the US).Source: Shopify Investor Deck Q1 2020For the year 2019, Shopify's GMV was ~$61 billion, which made it the second-largest e-commerce platform in the United States based on market share. The US e-commerce market is still dominated by Amazon (market share of 38%); however, things could change with Shopify's own marketplace version - Shop App coming to market.Source: Shopify Investor Deck Q1 2020As you can see below, e-commerce contributed just ~12% of total retail sales in the United States. Thus, the potential for e-commerce companies to further penetrate the retail industry remains enormous. As consumers shift their spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I expect this figure to rise significantly in Q2 of 2020 and remain elevated in the future.Source: census.govAccording to the National Retail Federation, total retail sales are expected to rise by 3.5% to 4.1% to a range of $3.93 to $3.95 trillion in 2020. This estimate stands despite the COVID-19 outbreak, uncertainty surrounding the trade war, and the US presidential election. E-commerce sales are projected to increase by 12-15% to between $870.6 billion and $893.9 billion. (Data Source: NRF). Thus, Shopify's GMV (and by extension, revenue) should continue to rise substantially in the future.Shopify has several levers of growth, including the Shop App, fulfillment network business, more channel partnerships, international expansion, etc.One of those growth levers that Shopify is actively pursuing is the fulfillment network business. Shopify launched its fulfillment network last year with ambitions to achieve affordable 2-day delivery for its merchants within five years. The company acquired 6-River Systems to accelerate its objectives in this space and has already revealed plans to leverage machine learning to optimize the fulfillment network. Such a delivery system would make Shopify's merchants much more competitive against Amazon.Source: news.shopify.comShopify has been in partnership with platforms like Facebook for several years. When Facebook Shops was launched, Shopify's merchants were able to create their self-branded digital storefronts on Facebook's Shops. This deal was announced back in May 2020.Source: corporate.walmart.comMore recently, a channel partnership between Walmart and Shopify was revealed. This deal provides Shopify's merchants an additional sales channel in the form of Walmart marketplace (website & app). Shopify expects 1,200 merchants to be on Walmart's marketplace by the end of this year.Shopify truly offers its merchants the ability to be everywhere a potential customer could be. Thus, Shopify is poised to become a herculean e-commerce force that could certainly rival Amazon one day. If you are interested in an article on Shop App and its potential, let me know through the comments. For now, let's get into the financial statement analysis, which will help us determine if Shopify's numbers back up its impressive storyline.In this section, we will take a closer look at the financials underlying Shopify's explosive growth since its IPO in 2015. Now, we will analyze some of the critical aspects of the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.Income Statement AnalysisSource: YChartsAs you can see, Shopify's revenues grew at ~75% CAGR over the last five years, rising from ~$105 million to ~$1.728 billion. In the same time frame, Shopify's gross margins have declined from ~59% to ~54.5%.In terms of revenue mix, Shopify's merchant solutions segment is garnering a more substantial chunk of total revenues. A look at the chart below shows that Shopify's revenue growth is somewhat slowing down.Source: Shopify Investor Deck Q1 2020According to YCharts, Shopify is expected to grow revenues at ~40% CAGR for the next three years. This means that Shopify could register revenues of ~$4+ billion in 2022.Additionally, this growth projection will inform our ""projected growth"" assumption in our L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, which you will find below.Balance Sheet AnalysisNow, let's take a look at Shopify's balance sheet to gauge its financial health.Source: YChartsShopify's balance sheet has never been stronger than it is today. With $2.36 billion in cash and short-term investment and almost no debt, Shopify is well-capitalized.Cash Flow Statement AnalysisSource: YChartsAs you can see in the chart above, Shopify still has negative free cash flow almost five years after its IPO, and ~15 years since its founding. However, the cash flow from operations was positive up until 2020. In the unique business environment created due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify has come to the forefront, helping its SMB seller base with loans and redirecting its capital to aid merchants (e.g., fulfillment network).Shopify's management withdrew its full-year guidance during the Q1 earnings presentation due to uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. I expect the company to burn more cash for the remainder of this year, but acquiring more merchants is good for Shopify's business in the long run. Now, let's explore Shopify's valuation and expected return to understand why it is not too late to buy the stock.To determine Shopify's fair-value, we will employ my proprietary valuation model, with which many of you are already familiar. For those of you who have not yet seen it, here's what it entails:Now, let's check out Shopify's valuation:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs you can see above, Shopify's intrinsic value is somewhere around $700, i.e., the stock is currently overvalued from a DCF perspective.Now, we know that a traditional DCF model illustrates whether a stock is over- or under-valued; however, it does nothing in terms of demonstrating what one can expect in the way of future expected returns.Let's check out step 3 of the L.A.S.V model to determine if we have a high probability of outperforming the market via long-term investment in Shopify.In step 3, we use a simple process of projecting intrinsic value via the growth of free cash flow per share. In essence, we simply grow the initial free cash flow per share ($5 in this case; 30% long term free cash flow margin) by the assumed growth rate for ten years; at the end of which, we apply an assumed price to FCF multiple. Thereby, we create a 2030 target price, by which we can generate CAGR or annualized return projection.Here's what Shopify could offer us in the way of future returns:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelTherefore, if one were to buy Shopify at today's price of $1,030 and hold for ten years, they could expect a return of approximately 10%.Every business faces several risks, and Shopify is no different. Here are the primary risks that could result in our investment expectations being unmet:Regardless of these business risks, I expect Shopify to lead the e-commerce revolution over the next decade via its multi-channel platform that enables first-time entrepreneurs, SMBs, and large businesses to set up an online store within minutes using the company's unique low code operating system specifically designed for physical products.In fact, Shopify's platform could become the go-to solution for nearly all businesses (smaller than mega-corporations) as it allows them to sell ubiquitously on an array of channels, including but not limited to their own website and app (created via Shopify), Walmart, Amazon, Facebook, and Instagram. Further, Shopify's merchant solutions help businesses with backend activities like shipping, order tracking, inventory management, etc. Shopify's fulfillment network (2-day affordable shipping) could level the playing field for small retailers going up against big online marketplaces like Amazon.In closing, Shopify's Fulfillment Network and Shop App (Shopify's version of Amazon's marketplace) are exciting initiatives that could catapult Shopify to a place of parity with Amazon in the next 10-20 years.Key Takeaway: I am currently neutral on Shopify, though long term, I am bullish. I will, as I've always done, aggressively add on any dips.Thanks for reading. Remember to follow to receive more stock ideas, and happy investing!And let me know what you think in the comments."
4355230,102646,2020-06-23T15:13:37-04:00,Shopify shares have more than doubled since my last bullish call.I expect the company to report a strong quarter since retail sales are rising.I also expect the company's share price to have a pullback - as it has always done.,"Shopify (SHOP) stock is up by more than 120% this year, and the shares are hitting an all-time high almost every day. In the same period, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have had a total return of -3.19% and 16% respectively.Regular readers know of my ""love-hate"" relationship with Shopify. It is a company whose shares I buy and sell regularly. I made a case for investing in the firm in my March article - spotting opportunities amidst the chaos.I cited three main catalysts for the company. First, I argued that the stay-at-home orders would lead to a surge in online orders. This argument was given a boost by Amazon (AMZN), which started to prioritize essential orders.Second, I theorized that the mass layoffs would lead to a rise in entrepreneurship in the United States and around the world. I expected these people to turn to Shopify, which has built a world-class e-commerce platform.Third, I wrote that many local businesses would start embracing e-commerce now that most of their services were deemed non-essential.Most of what I predicted has happened. In May, the company announced that new stores created between March 13 and April 24 rose by 62%. Also, the firm's gross merchant volume (GMV) accelerated in April as more people shopped online.As a result, SHOP's stock has risen by 133% since I published the article. In the same period, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have gained by ~25% and ~37% respectively.In all fairness, the upward trend has also been helped by the company's initiatives and bullish analyst forecasts. For example, investors believe that the product announced in the (re)unite event will help boost sales and grow its market share. These products include more delivery options, Shopify email, Shopify Balance, and Shop Pay Installments, among others. It has also partnered with Walmart (WMT) and Facebook (FB).Analysts have also helped push the price higher, with RBC upping its target to $1,000. Other analysts bullish on the firm are from KeyCorp, Piper Sandler, Rosenblatt, DA Davidson, and Credit Suisse.Regular readers know that I love Shopify. I have written about how my wife has managed to grow her small e-commerce company using the company. Just last week, I wrote that she had started another company during the pandemic.I love the company's strong moat in e-commerce, strong recurring revenue, the healthy balance sheet, and its revenue growth. The ""hate"" part comes in its valuation. You can read my previous pieces criticizing its valuation here and here.The valuation part has become worse. At the current price of $881, the company has a market capitalization of ~$105 billion. In other words, SHOP is now bigger than CVS (CVS) and Kroger (KR) combined. In 2019, the firm had $1.57 billion while CVS and KR had combined revenue of ~378 billion in 2019.And according to analysts, Shopify's revenue will grow from $1.57 billion in 2019 to about $22 billion in 2029. This is a reasonable estimate for a company that had a revenue of about $23 million in 2012 and one that is a clear market leader in e-commerce software.Therefore, at the current valuation, the company is trading at 4.7x FY 2029 sales, which is relatively pricey. Revenue is just one part. If we assume that the company will have a net profit margin of 22.5%, it means that it will have a profit of about $4 billion. This margin estimate is a bit generous considering that its current margin is about -6.70% and the fact that it is also investing in its fulfilment network.But the thing is, Shopify - and other fast-growing companies - has always been expensive. I can look at some old articles - like this - that were talking about valuation three years ago.Therefore, I believe that it is wrong to short momentum stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe (ADBE), and Salesforce (CRM) from just a valuation standpoint. Highly intelligent investors like David Einhorn and Jim Chanos have lost a fortune shorting Tesla, which is obviously overvalued by all traditional valuation metrics.There are three main reasons why I am unwinding my current long position in the company. First, SHOP has been among my best-performing stocks this year and, therefore, it makes sense to take some profits ahead of the upcoming earnings season. Ironically, I expect the company's revenue to be better than what most analysts are expecting because of the US stimulus packages that went into effect this quarter, improving consumer confidence, the upbeat retail sales, and nonfarm payrolls.Second, while I expect the company to beat on sales and user growth, I believe there will be some disappointment on user retention. That is because, while most local sellers rushed to open their e-commerce stores, very few of them will succeed in selling online. The same is true with most new entrepreneurs who used SHOP to create their new stores. In fact, SHOP warned about this in its report in May saying:Finally, I always apply some technical analysis to some of the companies in my speculative basket. As you can see below, Shopify tends to make some pullbacks that go on for a few months. With the stock nearing the upper side of the ascending channel, I expect a minor pullback as we move into the earning season. If this happens, I expect the stock to retest the February high of $600.Shopify is an excellent company, and I believe that coronavirus will have a positive impact on its business in the long term. Also, I expect the company to report a great quarter boosted by low-interest rates, a surge in online shopping, and more account openings. At the same time, I believe that the current enthusiasm will work against the company's share price in the near term. As such, I will stay in the sidelines for now awaiting the next pullback."
4355196,25047,2020-06-23T12:45:15-04:00,Shopify is one of today's market darlings.I take a look at a market darling from the past and see how it compared.The implications are obvious.,"The year is 2000. Cisco (CSCO) is set to report an extraordinary year. Here's what it reported:The stock had been celebrating, and celebrated, this outcome. During Q3 FY2000, Cisco:Fast forward to FY2019. 19 years later, we could argue that Cisco has enjoyed a visible measure of additional fundamental success. Cisco now has:So, given this huge success, what happened to Cisco stock? Well, currently, Cisco commands a fully diluted market cap of $201 billion. That's down 2/3rds (66%) from its peak Q3 FY2000 valuation.Why? Simply because valuation normalized as Cisco, a very profitable company with even higher margins now, matured. Businesses maturing is an inevitability. Cisco sold and sells into a very large market, but even a very large market both gets dividends between several players and matures.Here's where Shopify (SHOP) stands today:Although, superficially, a much worse business than Cisco, the market has also been celebrating its success. The celebration has produced the following metrics:Putting it all together, SHOP:So, the question is, what do you think is going to happen here? When we look back, years from the future, what will Shopify's share performance have been?Sure, there's a vast array of possible outcomes. But to not be an incredible disgrace for investors, nearly all of the possible outcomes require Shopify to find a new business instead of just developing the one it's already in. This is so because the business Shopify is already in is slowing down and is much less profitable than Cisco's, to begin with.Were Shopify to simply follow Cisco's trajectory in terms of business development and the outcome would necessarily be much worse than Cisco's. This is so because the business is both worse (less profitable), growing slower, and trading at an initial valuation that's much higher.It's highly likely that when we look back from the future, we'll see that Shopify has lost more than 2/3rds of the value it carries today (likely much more). This will happen even if Shopify continues growing quickly and increases margins meaningfully (for instance, if adjusted margins go from 2.1% to 10% of sales, the stock would still drop by more than 2/3rds)."
4356195,71685,2020-06-29T12:55:46-04:00,"Shopify, like other stay at home stocks, has soared since April.However, its current valuation is beyond overvalued.The technical chart is issuing a warning sign.","Zoom (ZM) isn't the only stock that has seen an incredible run that has reached bubble-like levels. Shopify (SHOP) is in that same camp too. Now, like Zoom, the Shopify bubble may finally be about to pop. Shopify's valuation is at astronomical levels, trading for 42 times its next 12-month sales estimates. While investors often like to compare to Shopify's opportunities to that of Amazon (AMZN), Amazon never traded at such lofty levels, even in its early days. You can now track all of my free stories on Seeking Alpha on this Google spreadsheet.While it's nice to believe that Shopify will have a bright future, one has to wonder if it will ever be bright enough to justify its current valuation.Analysts do see a bright future for the company, just likely not bright enough to justify the company's massive market capitalization of nearly $107 billion. Currently, analysts see revenue for the company rising by more than double, or 150%, by the year 2022, to $4 billion from $1.6 billion in 2019, or nearly 26.3 times those sales estimates. That's almost 10 times greater than Amazon's multiple of 2.8 times its sales of $473 billion vs. its market cap of $1.35 trillion. Amazon's revenue is forecast to rise by nearly 69% to $473.6 billion from $280.5 billion over that same period.If one were to adjust those sales multiples for the revenue growth rates, one would find that Amazon is still more favorably valued to Shopify, much like a PEG ratio, with Amazon trading at 0.04, while Shopify trades for nearly 0.175. So while Shopify has a faster revenue growth rate than Amazon, it's still trading at a much higher valuation when compared to Amazon, even when adjusting for that revenue growth. Even stranger is that analysts have not raised their revenue estimates for the company in a meaningful way despite the stocks big jump. Sales estimates for next year have risen from $2.6 billion in June of 2019 to $2.9 billion in June of 2020. The technical chart for Shopify is flashing just as many warning signs as the valuation. The stock ran up dramatically since breaking out in April when the shares were trading for only $450. Since that time, the stock has run up by 110%, a massive move higher in such a short period. Now it's showing many signs that are indicative of a reversal of trend. The first being the relative strength index that has failed to make new highs despite the stock price soaring to record levels. The RSI has consistently been unable to rise to new highs on four occasions. This type of action is known as a bearish divergence and is indicative of a stock that is topping out, and in this case, moving lower. Additionally, the stock has been rising on falling levels of volume, another bearish indication. This pattern is typically indicative of an equity that has a waning number of buyers.Should the stock drop below support at $850, then it seems likely that it should fall to around $740. That's its next level of technical support. That's also where there is a giant technical gap created after the stock broke out rising above a downtrend on June 12. Should it fall back that gap, it would amount to a drop of roughly 18% from its price of $900 on June 29. There are risks to my assumptions because the market has not been acting rationally since the coronavirus pandemic has started, first falling sharply, and then recouping nearly all of its all losses on the S&P 500. This price action has come despite a severe contraction in the economy and has resulted in valuation in the stock market to become very stretched and overvalued. While Shopify may undoubtedly have a bright and prosperous future in the e-commerce space, its current valuation seems detached from reality."
4354696,24634,2020-06-19T12:19:29-04:00,"You need to be good, really good, to even be mentioned in the same breath as the FAANG stocks.Stocks included in acronyms like FAANG come along very seldom, but when they do, they disrupt entire industries.It's better to invest in the disruptors as opposed to the disrupted.Do you want to make an investment in the company left holding the carcass, or in the beast that just created the carcass after lunch?","Back on Aug. 2, 2019, the title of my article about a stock that begins with ""S"" was Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Is One Of The Best Growth Stories In The Market Today."" Now that I have disclosed the name of the stock that begins with ""S,"" let's see how it has done since I made that bold claim last fall.Shopify was trading at what seemed like a very high price of $327.41 at the time. Consider that Shopify now trades at over $860 today. That price of $327.41 back then seems cheap now. Will today's price of $860 seem cheap at some time in the future? More on that later in this article.The stock is now up 162% since that article that I wrote just over 10 months ago. During that same period of time, the S&P 500 is up a meager 8.7%. The difference between those two returns is called alpha. Isn't that what we are seeking here on this site called Seeking Alpha?Alpha is sought by investors from all walks of life, but it's an elusive target to chase. Some seek it in beaten-down stocks that seemingly have nowhere to go but up. Some recent examples of this bottom-fishing quest for alpha could be found in the cruise ship, airline, or hotel stocks. These stocks have been beaten up so badly by the COVID-19 pandemic, they seemingly have nowhere to go but up.I see this kind of investing as a temporary ""sugar high,"" however, as investors pick through the road kill left behind by an unpredictable pandemic that changed certain sectors for a long, long time. I don't see this style of investing as a sustainable source of alpha.Others look for alpha among stocks trading for pennies. Their mantra is: If this stock can just go from three cents to thirty cents, I will have a 10-bagger on my hands. In addition to this, they claim that they have a shot at turning a few hundred dollars into a few thousand dollars. Unfortunately, they are much more likely to turn a few hundred dollars into just a few dollars as they sift through the pink-sheet garbage pile of publicly-traded companies.Others seek alpha by buying stocks that are trading at an intrinsic value that is, according to their calculations, much higher than where the stocks trade at currently. These are very patient value investors that invest in quality companies that for some reason or another are currently out of favor. This process takes much patience as you wait for the stock to catch up to your numbers. Hopefully, your numbers are right.I grew up on the West Coast where the so-called ""momentum"" style of investing was practiced by the chart-reading, relative strength crowd. They looked for explosive growth coming from new disruptive products that had very fast-growing sales and earnings. In fact, the faster the better. And even though valuations were swelling to nosebleed levels, this crowd did not seem to care much.In fact, the letter ""V' was not even in their acronym called CANSLIM. Price to earnings, price to sales, price to book value, and price to cash flow were way down the line in their order of criteria for picking their stocks.The funny thing about these two very different and distinct styles of investing is like the Republicans and Democrats of today, either side rarely crosses over to the other side of the aisle. A value investor would almost never be caught with a high PE stock while a momentum investor would rarely hold a low PE stock, as there must be something wrong with a stock trading at such a low multiple.I have to admit, in the early days of my now 23-year career in the industry as a professional money manager and analyst, I leaned heavily toward the so-called fast lane of the market. As an analyst, I called on the growth funds, not the value funds. The names that I wrote about were from the high relative strength side of the aisle, not the low PE side.But during the bursting of the dot-com bubble during 2000-2001, we learned that at the end of the day valuation really does matter. After the crash of the Nasdaq during this same period of time, momentum investors were either out of a job or took a crash course on value investing. Unfortunately, we learned that value investing had its drawbacks also: Many so-called value stocks were cheap for a reason, they were not growing anymore.Many of the value investors were left holding the bag after the financial crisis and the great recession of 2008-2009. Stocks that they thought were dirt cheap at the time suddenly got a whole lot cheaper. It was during this period of time that I combined these two disciplines into a methodology that I call Best Stocks Now.I recognized the extreme value of a high relative strength stock with a disruptive product, but I also realized that valuation also matters. I decided to join the two very disparate methodologies in holy matrimony, and hopefully, they can live happily ever after.So, let's once again apply my Best Stocks Now Methodology that combines momentum with valuation to a stock that I boldly claim could join the very elite ranks of FAANG someday.We did an updated article on Shopify back on May 7, but there have been two major news items on the stock since then that make the story look even better. In the May 7 article, we wrote that the COVID-19 pandemic would rapidly increase the speed of virtual storefront adoption away from the declining bricks and mortar model.In that article, we also had the audacity to raise our five-year target price to a whopping $1,250 per share. Just a little over two months later we already are about one fourth of the way there. We also pointed out in that article that Shopify is No. 2 now behind only Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the e-commerce space. That statistic in and of itself ought to cause the reader to sit up and take notice. Also, consider that Shopify has only been a publicly-traded company since early 2015. That is one meteoric rise by a company in one of the fastest-growing sectors in the economy today.Shopify was a $94.5B market-cap company when I began this article. It hit $100B on Thursday as I finish up the article. It received a street-high $1,000 target price from RBC Capital on Thursday. The shares ended up 5.7% for the day. In addition to this, Walmart (WMT) announced a partnership with Shopify to open the Walmart marketplace. Walmart intends to onboard 1,200 Shopify sellers this year.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseWith just $1.73B in annual revenue, Shopify now trades at a price/sales ratio of 28.47. But stocks trade on future expectations, and those projections are extremely lofty. When I wrote my article on the shares back on Aug. 2 of last year, I published a five-year target price of $636 per share. That seemed like the impossible dream with the stock trading at just $318 at the time.I was not dreaming however. I was using my proprietary five-year valuation formula that's at the center of the valuation aisle of my value/momentum equation. The stock already has crashed through that target price in less than one year. So, what's my current five-year target price?If you think I was crazy when I wrote my August 2019 article, wait until you see my latest five-year target price.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseI like stocks that currently have 80% or more upside potential over the next five years. Believe it or not, Shopify still meets my valuation criteria. But, don't forget, the stock also has to meet my performance criteria so that we can still be happily married for the time being.Data from Best Stocks Now DatabaseWhen I compare Shopify's one-, three- and five-year returns against the rest of the securities in my database, it does not get much better than this. The shares have delivered more than enough alpha for even the greediest investor.As you can see from the graph below, the relative comparison of Shopify vs. the S&P 500 is almost off the charts.When I use my proprietary Best Stocks Now formula to rank the shares of Shopify to the other 5,223 stocks in my database, it currently comes in at number 148 overall. My affection for SHOP continues, and I continue to own the shares in my Ultra Growth portfolios."
4355513,105593,2020-06-24T22:08:24-04:00,"In the last eight trading days, on no meaningful news, Shopify's market cap has increased by 22.7%, or roughly $20 billion. This is 12.7x their FY19 revenue, 11.5x TTM.Net loss of $125 million in FY19 from $1.58 billion in revenue with losses increasing since IPO at an average of 66% per year.Growth of 45% is nothing to balk at, but it's far lower than the 100% FY15 or the 72% FY17, declining an average 17.2% per year since IPO.Eighth highest sales multiple of any large cap in the market, easily taking the number one spot for those making $1 billion or more in revenue.No FAANG stock has ever exceeded 43x, which is where Amazon peaked for a single day on January 11, 1999, before the dot-com bubble burst.","Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) is undoubtedly in a bubble, a massive one that far exceeds a good number of those from the dot-com era. Since my last article, Shopify's Road To $200, the stock has risen an incredible 22.3% and added more than $100 to its share price. What makes this so incredible is that it was published just over a week ago and there's been no fundamental news during that time. They have been fairly consistently adding many times their FY19 revenue to their market cap, on a daily basis, since. With this article I hope to provide some context on just how unprecedented a bubble this is.While these are all very different companies and in very different situations, it's not uncommon for bulls to suggest Shopify belongs in FAANG and I've lost count how many times I've been told it's the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). My last article got into more detail about why this isn't the case, namely that Shopify isn't even a retailer to start with, but it's pretty widely acknowledged that FAANG has some of the best growth and returns in the market. So, with that said, let's look at a few different metrics.Data by YChartsData by YChartsData by YChartsIt's fairly clear that Shopify is on another planet in terms of valuation, and also that it hardly seems justified. They're currently second place in terms of long-term projected EPS growth, still 1.83% behind Amazon while being 12.8x more expensive. You want the lowest number possible for EV/EBITDA and Shopify is completely off the charts, 40x higher than Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in second place. Looking at P/S not a single FAANG stock has ever been anywhere near the level of Shopify. Amazon came the closest at 43x, but this was during the dot-com bubble and quite literally only lasted a single day. Between IPO and the bubble bursting, that was the only day they reached 40x P/S or higher. Apple, even in 2008 with the massive hype surrounding the initial release of the iPhone, never even reached 6x, roughly 10% of what Shopify is today.Amazon is just about the best imaginable company to benefit from the dot-com bubble. Not only did they have a website with lots of traffic (clicks drove value more than earnings) but they were going to take over retail! The euphoria during this period in general cannot be overstated, and Amazon had a far better story than most to benefit from the said euphoria. Even with all that, and during the most well-known tech bubble in history, one in which we can all universally agree was a bubble, Amazon still only managed to break 40x sales for a single day while Shopify has been comfortably sitting above 60x. Now let's take a look at revenue growth for Amazon from IPO in '97 to after the bubble had burst in '01, as compared to Shopify's growth since IPO below it.Data by YChartsData by YChartsAs you can see here, Amazon was growing more than 26x the rate of Shopify in their respective 5 years after IPO. Despite this significantly better growth and during one of the most well-known tech bubbles in modern history, Amazon still only managed to reach 70% of the sales multiple given to Shopify. Within one year of the bubble bursting, the P/S fell below 1x and has remained between ~2x and ~5x for the two decades since. Below you can see both Amazon and Shopify P/S since IPO, their respective bubbles are very easy to spot.Data by YChartsData by YChartsWhile Shopify continues to have a phenomenal growth rate of ~45%, it's significantly lower than the ~100% rate they had in FY15 or the ~70% they had in FY17. Growth has been declining fairly consistently by an average of 17.2% per year, and guidance had initially called for an even larger drop in revenue growth this year before they pulled it in 20Q1. Guidance was initially $2.13 billion to $2.16 billion, which represents a ~36% increase YoY or ~23% lower than the 46.8% growth FY19.Similar to their declining growth numbers, losses have been increasing at a fairly consistent rate since IPO. Unfortunately, the losses are increasing significantly faster than growth is declining or revenue is growing, averaging 66% per year.In my last article, sourced earlier, I extrapolated Shopify's projected revenue out to FY25. The first extrapolation was based on their 17.2% decline in growth, the second one was a ""bullish"" extrapolation which lowered the decline all the way to 10%. The last one is exclusive to this article and assumes a CAGR of 35% indefinitely, which is of course completely unsustainable and far better than their historical results.The final extrapolation, using a 35% constant growth rate indefinitely, will still only achieve $9.49 billion by FY25. Assuming both outstanding shares and share price remain the same by FY25 it would still be trading at 11.3x sales by then. This is still 15% higher than Netflix, the most expensive FAANG stock by sales today. Taking it even further, an indefinite 35% CAGR would not achieve the first $100 billion until FY34, finally putting it at ~1x sales after more than 14 years.Of course, this extrapolation is extraordinarily unlikely as it would require them to not only end their consistently declining growth but then maintain that growth rate for another five years out. Given that guidance had already called for a 23% decline in growth FY20, down to 36%, more than their 17.2% historical average, it's incredibly unrealistic and overly optimistic to expect them to maintain a long-term growth rate of 35%.As previously mentioned, Shopify has flown off the charts in just the last week, adding roughly 13x more to their market cap than their entire FY19 revenue. What's stranger is that there wasn't any fundamentally meaningful news to support it. So what were the catalysts that led to this bubble growing even larger?Does any of this news justify adding ~13x FY19 revenue to their market cap in just a week? On a near daily basis Shopify is adding 1-2x FY19 revenue almost without exception. Of course, to be fair, they are in such a bubble at this point that a minute ~1.5% move represents more than their FY19 revenue.Shopify is beyond a hyper bubble, there are few other stocks that have ever reached anywhere near it, including anything in FAANG. Any long-term holders should be very cautious at these prices, it will very likely drop between 50% and 80% within the next six months just as Amazon did after the dot-com bubble burst. They are trading at more than 60 years of trailing revenue, have only seen one (barely) profitable quarter, growth declining and losses increasing since IPO. On Friday alone, in a single day, they added more to their market capitalization than they generated in total revenue in FY19. In the last week alone they've added ~13x their FY19 revenue, more than $20 billion in value added with $1.58 billion in revenue."
4353652,105593,2020-06-13T02:03:59-04:00,"While Shopify is a well-run company with a strong balance sheet and respectable growth, its valuation makes the hyper bubbles of the Dot Com era look cheap.Lost $125 million on $1.578 billion revenue in FY19.

This is largely a reason for the pulled guidance.Price target of $117.57 with an upside of $185.96.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is often compared to the e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), typically as justification for its inflated and completely unsustainable valuation. It's not a very good comparison though, and Shopify isn't even in the retail business. Furthermore, Shopify sells store management software which is deployed on countless separate domains, all with their own unique design. There's no central outlet like Amazon - you have to know where each store is.What it does is offer a hosted solution for e-commerce, meaning it provides the software to run a branded store as well as managing the server it's hosted on. The software itself includes a suite of services to both manage and run an online business, from branding and design to shopping cart and payment processor, along with an app store to enhance functionality or find new themes.Shopify has two separate revenue streams. The first of these is known as subscription solutions and is what makes up its core offerings. Primarily consisting of monthly fees collected for providing an online storefront in the Shopify ecosystem, but also includes other digital sales such as themes, apps, and domain names.The company's second revenue stream is known as merchant solutions and provides supplementary services on top of its core offerings. This includes things such as shipping services, transaction fees, and point-of-sale hardware sales. Unlike subscription solutions, margins here are much lower as well as more reliant on the success of businesses in its ecosystem.You may notice that merchant solutions is growing 72% faster than subscription solutions while also having 47.5% the margins. In fact it now makes up over 60% of total revenue and climbing, which of course means lower margins moving forward. The software sector has some of the best margins in any industry, in fact averaging at over 77%. Even the $1.5 trillion behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a 68.17% gross margin, 25% higher than Shopify at 54.54%. As noted earlier, this margin is going to continue moving in the wrong direction as its fastest-growing operations have a significantly lower margin of 38%.Shopify is arguably one of the best choices for any business wanting an online storefront, but most of its core services highly leverage Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and it's far from the only option. Competitor Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) provides nearly all the same services, including drop shipping, and is growing at half the rate but with 33% better margins and only 27% as expensive. There are plenty of other alternatives, some of which are entirely free. There are also many open source solutions to create an online store at zero cost outside of hosting and domain fees, but of course the tech barrier makes solutions like Shopify a lot more attractive.At its core, Shopify is primarily a website builder with a content and store management system as well as built-in payment solutions and seamless scaling. I have heard it said before that Wix is like WordPress while Shopify is like Amazon, but it's more accurate to say that Shopify is like WordPress specially designed for business. None of this should take away from all the technology it developed (and contributed) to tie everything together into such a well-functioning, stable, and scalable ecosystem. Rather it should only serve as a reminder that it primarily sells hosted software to manage an online catalogue, nearly everything else is a variety of partnerships, third-party integrations, and FOSS.Shopify is a phenomenally well-run business, has very little debt, strong cash position, a fantastic product, and solid growth. So what's the problem? As of today, it is trading at more than 55 years of FY19 revenue with decreasing growth and increasing losses. That is simply mind blowing on its own, but let's take a deeper look at the numbers. Note that the bullet points below are using trailing 12 months as of 20Q1 while the table compares full fiscal year up to 19Q4.This is clearly unsustainable; its growth is decreasing by an average of 17.2% per year while the losses are increasing by an average of 63.3%. Management made a smart move to do a secondary at $700, it raised $1.3 billion which more than doubled the cash on hand and isn't much less than it made in total sales in FY19. This puts the company in a comfortable position to continue eating losses, but the massive growth in losses will need to come down substantially or it will only have a few years of solvency.Like so many other companies that have reported since the rise of Covid-19, there are really two separate stories. Growth was solid, seeing a 47% increase in revenue YoY and 62% increase in stores between Mar 13 and Apr 24 as compared to the prior six weeks. With everybody desperate to find companies that may potentially thrive in a post Covid-19 world, it makes sense it's exploded in value, gaining 97% YTD and 125% since March. Everything sounds good, so what's the other story? Let's look at a few remarks made by management in the Q1 report (emphasis added).Guidance was pulled but that's not unexpected; every other company did as well due to the uncertainty. What's more important is the directional changes being made and the reasons given. The company is already seeing subscription cancellations, downgrades, fewer app purchases, etc. All of this data suggests what we already know from the current economic climate - small- and medium-sized businesses are being disproportionately affected.As a response management has decided to redirect resources away from growth into maintaining its existing clients, which is likely to further decelerate growth in the medium term. I do believe this is the correct, long-term approach, and management is directing resources exactly where it should be - maintaining clients and providing assistance during a period of significant economic turmoil. However, as an investor, this means a one two punch of decreased growth with lower margins.Shopify is a well-run company that provides a top tier service, but it's certainly not the next Amazon, which oddly seems to be a very common misconception in the market. I like the company about as much as I dislike the valuation. It's just priced beyond perfection, even several years in the future. Using the previously determined 17.2% decline in growth, we can extrapolate several years out for a rough estimate.Note that its original guidance, before being pulled, was actually for between $2.13 and $2.16 billion in revenue FY20, so my own projections are actually slightly higher than management. I've also laid out another extrapolated chart below that significantly reduces the historical growth decline of 17.2% by using 10% instead. This is beyond any hope of expectation, particularly given the redirected resources away from growth activities, but I'm including it anyway just to get the most unrealistically bullish outcome.Assuming the company maintains its fairly consistent growth trajectory since IPO, it will be generating just over $5.6 billion in total revenue by FY25, while the market cap is already near $90 billion. I expect growth to more or less stabilize closer to 30% with slower declines, but even using the bullish extrapolation which uses a flat 10% reduction YoY rather than the 17.2% 5Y average, it would still be trading at over 10x sales using FY25 numbers. This is madness!Shopify is far too expensive to buy anywhere near these levels. In fact, it's the ninth most expensive large cap in the entire market and number one for NYSE. Growth has also been consistently declining at a 5Y average of 17.2% with losses increasing at a 5Y average of 63.3%. While it provides a top-tier service, the subscription solutions side of the operations has an incredibly low barrier to entry with plenty of competition and open source alternatives. One of these open source alternatives, PrestaShop, has over 300,000 merchants with 5,000+ modules, themes, and services from its app store. Interestingly one of its clients is Stripe, who, if you remember, powers Shopify Pay.The absolute most expensive valuation I can give to Shopify is $185.96. This represents 10x FY20 projected revenue and, if you remember, my projections are actually slightly higher than the guidance was prior to being pulled. A more reasonable figure, albeit still expensive, would be $117.57 which represents 8x trailing 12-month sales as of Q120. Anything above $200 is nearly impossible to justify, and the downside risks are significant with the upside being priced for years of growth beyond any reasonable expectation. With growth decelerating, losses accelerating, diverting resources from growth, and priced at more than 55 years FY19 revenue, I can't rate Shopify as anything short of a strong sell at this price."

(SHOP) have soared 85% in 2020, making them one of the best performing stocks of the year. This is coming off a year in which SHOP saw the stock increase 187% in 2019. To say the stock is firing on all cylinders is an understatement.The company continued solid growth through the first two months of 2020, with SHOP shares up 16%, but since the time the market bottomed on March 23rd, shares of SHOP have rocketed 112% in a little over two months.E-commerce continues to grow at a healthy clip, but the current pandemic should push the timeline to enhance their online presence up, making for a growth catalyst for Shopify. With shares up nearly 400% in the past two years, is the near-term upside worth the risk?Photo CreditShopify has now nearly triple the market cap of eBay Inc. (EBAY), making them the second largest platform in the world in terms of sales volume behind Amazon (AMZN). Last month the company released Q1 earnings that showed revenue growth of 47% from prior year.The company’s Q1 ended March 31, which is around the time stay at home restrictions largely were put in place around the country. From March 13 to April 24, the company saw new store growth of 62% compared to the six weeks prior. This stat showed the strength of the platform and the priority companies are making to enhance e-commerce.Many companies have planned to enhance their online offerings, but the COVID-19 pandemic further pushed up those plans. It is no doubt that e-commerce is largely part of many businesses' future plans, but with the majority of businesses forced to work from home, business owners were forced to bring those future e-commerce plans into fruition more quickly than planned. This greatly boosted Shopify and will become evident in the Q2 earnings release.In late May, the company announced a partnership with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) called Shops, which is FB’s biggest push yet into e-commerce. Shops is intended to help small businesses set up online stores on the platform and utilize Shopify as the back-end technology platform. This is a huge growth driver for both FB and SHOP in a time with many businesses needing the ability to work remotely and enhance online offerings.This partnership with FB can be a major catalyst for the company moving forward. Revenue growth has slowed over the years, but this could keep things growing at an impeccable clip for longer than expected.SourceE-commerce sales continue to grow at a strong clip, growing 15% from prior year in 2019. E-commerce sales in 2019 “accounted or 56.9% of all gains in the retail market last year, which was the largest share of growth for online spending since 2008.” In terms of total sales, e-commerce still only represents a small fraction, 16%, which still poses a large opportunity, one that should increase due to the ongoing pandemic.As I have mentioned, shares of Shopify have been on quite the tear in the past few years, which was put in overdrive the past few months as they have been identified as a major winner during the stay at home restrictions. As more and more businesses have been moved remotely, Shopify clearly has much to gain.As it currently sits, shares of SHOP trade at a P/E of 1,500, which during these growth stages this early is not a very useful metric. As such, let’s take a look at Price to Sales. The company currently trades at a P/S of 49x, which has traded close to an average of 20x the past four years. In 2018, a year that saw revenue growth near 50% and shares increase close to 200%, the company traded at a P/S of 31x.As e-commerce continues to grow, so does the company. Investments are necessary to handle the increased customer base, but paying close to 50x P/S is very pricey in a market that is completely disconnected with the economy, which poses higher risk potential at current levels.Shopify has been firing on all cylinders the past few years and the current COVID-19 pandemic has continued to fuel those cylinders further. E-commerce continues to grow at a strong clip, but with more companies looking to enhance their online presence combined with the FB partnership, it is a huge growth catalyst for investors.Though the future prospects are bright for the company, current valuations of 49x P/S make it extremely difficult to initiate a position in the name at such frothy levels. Though I am extremely high on the name moving forward, I am happy to wait for a better entry point.Note: I hope you all enjoyed the article and found it informative.

Shopify is valued at a premium for the illusion that its platform is sticky and predictable. But its business model is less sticky than it first appears.To argue that Shopify is overvalued meets readers with glazed eyes and frustration, and suggestions that yet another analyst here ""just doesn't get it."" So, don't be a reader. Be a viewer:Shopify recently reported its Q1 2020 results. In that report it pulled its guidance. The message was resoundingly clear. Before the pandemic, there were no problems. Source: author's calculations, Q1 2020 Press StatementAs a reminder, Shopify has two reportable segments noted in the graph below:Source: author's calculations, Q1 2020 Press StatementAs you can see above, the bulk of Shopify's revenues, 60%, come from its Merchant Solutions. This segment's margins are not as attractive, as you can see below.Why is this a problem?Because at this moment and for quite some years ahead, the majority of Shopify's gross profits will not break even on the bottom line. How come?Because what's attractive about Shopify, or the illusion of its attraction, is its subscription service. This has high gross margins and customers being locked in.The problem though is that the majority of Shopify's revenues are derived from its Merchant Solutions.This segment includes charges for payment and shipping. Furthermore, the revenues associated with these credit cards have very little value as this revenue gets eaten up rapidly.Put another way, most of the increased payment is being offset by increased fees for processing merchant billings. What this means is that Shopify has to pay out more in terms of costs to third parties to process these fees.You can see for yourself below that the more Shopify grows, the more costs its platform has, because its attractive segment, Subscription Solutions, is relatively small. Meanwhile, its lower margin, Merchant Solutions, continues to increase at a rapid clip.Source: author's calculations; increasing costsI'll repeat myself now because this is important: What's attractive about Shopify is its subscription revenues, which are high margin. But these make up a small part of its total revenues.What truly matters is the percentage growth within its Monthly Recurring Revenue and this figure continues to fall over time (as has its revenue growth rates). During the latter parts of March and early April, there was a huge uptick on Shopify's free trials. These came from both new entrepreneurs and established businesses. These trials are not yet billed, and will not get billed until Q3 2020. There's the expectation that this recent 62% uptick in trials will end up as merchants once the trial expires and that this should result in Shopify's Month Recurring Revenues re-accelerating once again.Source: author's calculations, seekingalpha.comThe video together with this article shows why Shopify's is less attractive than its share price would lead one to believe."
4349904,105406,2020-05-25T13:13:36-04:00,"Lately, Shopify (SHOP) is firing on all cylinders. The company announced a series of new features on its May 20 Reunite event, together with a new partnership with Facebook.The e-commerce sector is growing, and Covid-19 accelerated this trend in an exponential way.Shopify has a unique opportunity to position themselves as a leader for the future of commerce.","“Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money.” Nat FriedmanLately, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is firing on all cylinders. The Company announced a series of new features for businesses on its May 20th Reunite event, a new partnership with Facebook (FB), and a new strategic partnership with CoinPayments. The stock price skyrocketed in response, reaching an intraday all-time high of $809 per share. If you look at the current state of the business, a $92 billion valuation may seem expensive. However, I believe that the following catalysts could set Shopify as the biggest winner in the post-pandemic e-commerce world. On May 20th Shopify announced a series of new features to help small businesses grow. These new and upcoming features are:Shopify Local Delivery app: Businesses have now the possibility to offer local delivery at checkout for customers nearby. This feature rides the Covid-19 trend, in which people need to spend locally to comply with restriction orders.Shop Pay: An App in which customers can track orders, access return policies, and find their receipts. An accelerated checkout lets customers save their email address, credit card, and shipping and billing information so they can complete their transaction faster the next time they are directed to the Shopify checkout. Shopify claims a 4x faster checkout and an 18% higher conversion rate for returning customers.Shopify Email: Free integration of an email direct extension of the online store. Includes smart templates that automatically use the store’s logo, colours, and products.Shopify Balance: Businesses get their own card, account, and other money-management tools.The key takeaway from these new and improved features is that the company is getting stickier, and this is happening both for businesses and for customers. Emails, card and account are fundamental features that a small business cannot live without. Ensuring that the pillars of the business are all within Shopify ecosystem will make it hard and inconvenient for businesses to switch to the competition. For customers, the Shop app will give better customer experience through an easy to use interface and faster checkouts, increasing the chances that they will stick around for subsequent purchases. Crypto payments probably deserve a whole article, but in short, Shopify completed the beta trial of CoinPayments, the world’s largest cryptocurrency payments processor. The two parties consequently renewed their partnership. Using this payment option offers a reduction in transaction fees and faster payments. Analysing the deal, this partnership is unlikely to move the needle for Shopify’s revenue. Transaction fees do not apply for Shopify payments users, manual payments or POS orders. Increased payment volumes due to this integration will be very low, and the positive relies mostly upon the expanded choice of payment options for cryptocurrency users.Lastly, the renewed partnership with Facebook created a bit of confusion. To make it clear, it is a great deal for Shopify and here is why. All the transactions happening on Facebook and Instagram will be handled by Shopify. Facebook will not receive any transaction fee or store management fee, and it is not competition for Shopify’s business. Facebook's business model will rely on ads, as businesses will increase their ad spending to push their product in the Facebook feed or Instagram’s soon-to-be-launched Shop tab. The success of this deal goes hand in hand with Facebook’s success, but it surely offers an extended reach for Shopify businesses and a big potential in transactions volume. As a reminder, Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.60 billion as of March 31, 2020, and increased by 10% year-over-year.Shopify competition will remain their current competition, or other back end stores management providers such as BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and Channel Advisor (NYSE:ECOM).Total revenue in the first quarter was $470 million, a 47% increase from the same quarter last year. Figure 1 shows the evolution of revenue and gross profit over the last 3 years.Figure 1 – Source: Shopify Financials – Figure created by AuthorIn percentage terms, revenue growth has been decreasing YoY, from 73% from 2016 to 2017 to 59% in 2017-2018 and ultimately 47% from 2018 to 2019. In fact, this growth rate is unsustainable and I expect it to decrease to the low 30s within a couple of years. That being said, this 30% growth rate could be sustained for much longer than expected. Here’s why.E-commerce still represents a fraction of total retail sales (Figure 2), and this trend will only increase.Figure 2 – Source: Internet RetailerSales statistics help understand the infancy and growth potential of this market. In 2007, e-commerce represented 5.6% of total retail purchases. Since 2007, e-commerce has tripled its share of retail sales. E-commerce penetration jumped from 13.2% in 2017 to 14.4% in 2018, and to 16% in 2019. In the US, consumers spent $602 billion online in 2019, a 14.9% increase from 2018. Figure 3 - Source: Digital Commerce 360, U.S. Commerce Dept.- Author calculationsA linear regression of this data would take the % of internet sales to around 30% by 2030. To put this in perspective, this amounts to an estimate of $533 billion increase in e-commerce sales by 2025, and $1.2 trillion by 2030, or a 193% increase from 2019 sales data (Figure 4).Figure 4 – Digital Commerce 360, U.S. Commerce Dept. - Author calculationsThe coronavirus pandemic in the last few months has changed customers behaviour, and online shopping is certainly part of the newly accelerated trends. In the UK (Figure 5) in April, already 30% of retail sales occurred online. The pandemic seems, therefore, to have shifted consumers behaviour 10 years ahead. While this 30% will probably be only temporary, it is also probable that these newly established behaviours will significantly raise the baseline percentage of online sales versus total retail sales.Figure 5 - Source: UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)Being at the centre of e-commerce, Shopify is expected to reap the fruits of this shift. The last available data show that this may as well be the case:Shopify is building the most advanced, robotics-driven warehouses to help businesses fulfil fast and affordably. They claim 99.5% order accuracy across the network with collaborative robotic support. As a result:Since one of the requirement to join the fulfilment network is a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 10,000 orders a day, volumes for the fulfilment network are expected the rise quickly, contributing to the growth in revenue.Shopify pointed out that it is not clear how many of the new online stores would generate sustainable sales. A good number of these new subscriptions were created by established merchants, but during these uncertain times, a good number of them could be forced to close. On the other hand, for those who survive, it is hard to imagine that the newly opened online store will be instantly closed.Moreover, Shopify is not playing alone. A big chunk of online sales will be collected by big players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which currently collect about 50% and 7% of the whole US e-commerce market respectively. Another professional online store creator like Weebly by Square (NYSE:SQ) could certainly compete with Shopify for market share and also benefit from the shift in trends. However, Amazon and eBay do not offer the same level of support as Shopify to small businesses and their brands. In the same way, although Square’s online store business is now growing fast, this segment remains a secondary part of the company’s business.On the other hand, Shopify’s whole business is focused on providing support for the small-medium sized online businesses. The Company extensive set of features are being constantly improved and in 2019 alone, the company has spent $355 million in Research and Development to make sure they stay at the forefront of the race.Considered that small businesses generate 44% of the US economy, Shopify has room to grow. In 2019, Shopify facilitated Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV"") of $61.1 billion, an increase of 48.7% from 2018. Excluding international merchant (29% at the end of 2019) we can estimate a GMV for the US market of about $45 billion, or 0.08% of the total US e-commerce market. Projecting Shopify’s annual GMV growth, decreasing accordingly over time until 2025, we get $197 billion in sales in the US and $75 billion internationally.Figure 6 – Source: Shopify financials - Author estimates and calculationsIn comparison, Amazon at the end of 2018 processed $233 billion in revenue. At the end of 2018, with a stock price of $1500, Amazon had a market cap of around $750 billion. Figure 7 – Amazon Stock Price – Source: Yahoo FinanceFigure 8 - Source: FinvizThis is the level Shopify could get at in 5 years. Considered that Shopify issues around 10M shares a year, a market cap of 750 billion in 2025 would result in a stock price of $ 4412.Given the recent acceleration in the shift of retail spending toward e-commerce, together with a newly-established partnership with Facebook and a growing fulfilment network, Shopify has a unique opportunity to position themselves as a leader for the future of commerce. The Company is growing fast in a sector that is growing even faster, and I believe that with the same level of execution as in the past Shopify has a very bright future ahead. I believe this company should be valued on its future potential, and therefore I rate Shopify a BUY with 1Y target price of $1000.If you found this article of value, please follow (near the title) and/or press ""Like this article"" just below."

It's not a thing at all.","The news today is that Shopify (SHOP) is partnering with Walmart (WMT) to allow Shopify customers to sell their products through Walmart.com.That must be huge news, right? After all, Walmart is a large competitor to Amazon.com’s (AMZN) marketplace (3P marketplace).It isn’t. This news today just highlights something negative about Shopify. It highlights that Shopify is no Walmart.com or Amazon.com. It highlights that Shopify is not a 3P (Third Party) marketplace, and thus does not enjoy the extremely high commissions, margins and profits that 3P marketplaces enjoy.Quite the contrary, the news shows that Shopify just rents cheap web stores and provides the tools for its customers to run these web stores – including the ability to list products in 3P marketplaces belonging to other companies. Shopify does not have a stake on the GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) sold through these stores (except in Merchant solutions, where it gets a very small stake at even lower gross margins than the rest of the business).Imagine you still had doubts about the thesis above. Remember one thing: Shopify customers could already sell through Walmart.com, there were (paid, to a third party developer) tools for that. This news just means that such will be made easier, more publicized and free. Shopify will now add Walmart.com to a long list of channels it already supported:Source: Shopify.comSo, for instance, the same integration already exists, today, for Shopify sellers to sell through Amazon.com.

It’s the same thing. But it just highlights that none of Amazon.com’s 3P economics flows to Shopify. Just like none of Walmart.com’s 3P economics will flow to Shopify…This partnership between Shopify and Walmart is a nothingburger. It just means:Of course, today, the stock might be speculated on this nothingburger, because people don’t really care to understand what the news means. They just see “Shopify”, “Partnership” and “Walmart”."

Shopify's slice of that pie will continue to grow as brands see the benefits of using Shopify versus rolling their own solution.Multiple billion dollar businesses already run on Shopify. Others will continue to come as functionality continues to develop.","While I tend to stick to the profitable businesses, the ones where the value is easy to see, now and again my mind ventures off into the speculation realm. Usually, I stick to my guns, but like all humans outside of Buffett, I am fallible. Fortunately, it has worked out for me this time, and I see no reason why the run will end with Shopify (SHOP), a company I firmly believe will be atop the retail landscape by the end of this decade.Image: Shopify marketing imageI wish I got in Shopify during its IPO, or even a couple of years afterward, but last year was my entry point. Having paid $248/share on average, I have personally seen my holdings gain significantly, but I am not ready to sell yet.Shopify is rapidly growing in the eCommerce space, a space that is projected to be bringing in close to $900B by 2022. I think the company will continue to take a larger slice of the pie over time, and I'll explore why in this article.Shopify is a firm based in Canada that helps small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) get their stores up and running online. The company has two distinct segments, Subscriptions (40.7% of 2019 revenues) and Merchant Solutions (59.3% of 2019 revenues), but almost all customers will partake in both segments.The best way to visualize Shopify's business model is to assume you want to sell, say, handmade cosmetics. Several people would choose to sell on Etsy (ETSY), some might even decide to sell on eBay (EBAY), but those that want to ""own"" their brand would choose Shopify.Shopify gives a store owner complete branding control and allows any small business, or individual with an idea, or an existing product, to reach a global audience. Along the way, subscribers to the platform can take advantage of Shopify's payments, Shopify Shipping, and an ever-growing app ecosystem.To build a store on the platform, a user (or company) must first subscribe. Plans start at $29/month for prospective merchants and work their way up from there, each offering more in turn. This revenue falls under subscription solutions.Merchant Solutions encompasses almost everything else, including accepting payments, shipping & fulfillment (Shopify Shipping), and securing working capital (Shopify Capital).I wanted to briefly take a look at some large brands that got to where they are today, thanks to Shopify. They also continue to use the platform despite, in two cases, selling hundreds of millions of dollars in product per year, and being valued in the billions.AllbirdsImage: Allbirds websiteThis $1.4B sneaker start-up that started with a $200,000 grant was built on the back of Shopify. It remains there today, despite having raised more than $75M from outside investors.ChubbiesImage: Chubbies websiteLike Allbirds, Chubbies is an apparel company that targets buyers through well-built Instagram (and other social media) ads. The firm, which generated more than $40M in revenue in 2018, runs on Shopify.Kylie CosmeticsImage: Kylie Cosmetics websiteHate them, or love them, the Jenner/Kardashian clan have built quiet the marketing machine. With an estimated $360 million in 2018 revenues, Kylie Cosmetics shows that Shopify can run in the big leagues. Coty (COTY) recently bought 51% of the company for $600M.One factor that will continue to play well for Shopify into the future is the Shopify App Store. Like tech trailblazers before them (Salesforce (CRM), for example), Shopify has realized they can't build everything a customer wants or needs, so they let others build it for them.Developers can build and deploy applications to the Shopify App Store that any store can subscribe to. Shopify takes 20% of each sale.Like Salesforce, this ecosystem ties developers in. New software businesses are being built daily on the back of Shopify, and that number will only continue to grow. With more than 3,700 apps available (per the 10-K), there's quite the army of developers working to build a better overall platform.These developers, as part of the partner ecosystem, have access to a robust referral system, allowing them to make extra money by driving stores to Shopify. More than 24,000 partners referred merchants to Shopify last year per the company's 10-K.Shopify doesn't leave everything to third-party developers, however. The firm is engaged in a relentless pursuit to ensure that its sellers can reach customers wherever they might be and accept payments in new and evolving ways.Image: Apple PayStore owners don't have to worry about hiring a development team to accept different forms of payments; they merely need to rely on Shopify. With support for Apple Pay, Google Pay, Amazon Pay, PayPal, and numerous other third-party providers, Shopify store owners are not losing anyone due to a lack of ways to pay.Image: Shopify & Facebook MessengerOn a ""reaching customers"" front, Shopify enables store owners to connect with customers via Facebook Messenger, or tie into Instagram's marketplace (to sell in-app).Newer partnerships such as Houzz allow Shopify store owners to easily get their product in Houzz listings too.I realize that this is starting to sound like a bit of a sales pitch here. I feel, however, that potential investors, or those wondering why Shopify has shot up so high should be aware of how much this company has done in a relatively short period. I think I would need a few more articles to genuinely articulate how much one can do with a store on Shopify versus attempting to roll an individual solution.Alas, we must discuss the negatives. Every company has them, and it's prudent of the investor to know and acknowledge them for any investment they might have. Shopify is, of course, no different.Losses will continue for the foreseeable future. Shopify has a lot of future work planned in the R&D space, as well as fulfillment that will impact margin expansion. This will likely continue for years to come. With no guarantee that the investment will pay off, investors may grow tired of a loss-making company choosing to spend cash in a manner that could be considered ""unwise.""Shopify will continue to dilute shareholders. Rather than taking on debt, Shopify has persistently chosen to issue new stock to raise capital. This is dilutive to existing shareholders in the near-term but is helping Shopify maintain a stellar balance sheet over the long-term.The company trades at a significant premium on almost every metric you can conjure up. I know that when this article is published, commenters will point out how expensive it is, and I believe that's with good reason. Shopify's potential reward is being at the helm of a $900B eCommerce industry, the risk today is, in my eyes, worth it.High-growth tech firms tend to carry with them a wide range of analyst expectations, and Shopify is no different. The average price across 22 analysts covering the stock is $603.97. On the low side, analysts have a $332 PT, while the top side sees an $860 target.Analysts have been doing a lot of updating recently, including seven updates over the last month. Here they are:Note that price fluctuations have Shopify trading for more than some analysts ""buy"" targets.Insiders haven't been selling, at all, which is quite an unusual sight to see. The last sale from an insider was in 2018, so we've gone almost a year and a half, with significant gains and no sales of note.Founder and CEO Tobias Lutke owns 8.2% of the company. This represents significant skin in the game and something I like to see when it comes to high-growth investing.I hadn't built the Hideaway Scores when I first invested in Shopify. I would also note that these scores were not built with high-growth investment in mind. With that, however, Shopify performs quite well on the composite grade thanks to 'A+' ratings in both momentum categories.Here are the ratings:High-Quality Hideaway is my new Seeking Alpha marketplace launching June 1st. As a subscriber, you will receive unfettered access to the Hideaway Scores for more than 4,000 actively traded companies. Highly rated Hideaway firms beat the market as a whole and help you rest easy at night, knowing your investments are well-positioned.Also, you'll get a more in-depth analysis of quality firms and access to more quantitative measures than you can shake a stick at (Piotroski, Altman, Ohlson, Beneish and more as I add them).If you'd like to learn more about the Hideaway Score, see this blog post.I generally dislike providing valuations for companies like Shopify as it's an optimistic bet, based on all available information, which outside of revenue growth rates, is entirely qualitative.Data by YChartsChart: 1yr PS ratioThe stock is currently trading at a P/S ratio of around 49x. That's quite significant, even for a company in the Technology Services sector. This P/S ratio is a little steep, but for several reasons, I believe we will see 40x as an average for the remainder of the year. COVID-19 has many retailers trying to figure out how to be ""online first,"" the fulfillment center that will make seller's lives easier, and further R&D into robotics (to help the fulfillment center excel) are some reasons I think the market will keep this stock held to a higher level.Data by YChartsChart: Shopify TTM RevenuesWith revenues growing more than 30% per year, I think we can conservatively assign 30% growth this year. Shopping has been moving online thanks to COVID-19 (and that's why we're looking at these prices, to begin with). At 30% growth, Shopify's top-line will come in at just under $2.1B in 2020 giving it a PT of $716 for the year.This is below where the firm is trading today, and likely a price we will see Shopify dip under at several points throughout the next year.Over the coming years, the ratios will fall back in line, much like we saw with retailers that have already reached the pinnacle, such as Alibaba (BABA). Alibaba entered 2015 with a P/S ratio hovering around 30x. Over time, the company grew into those boots and now trades at 9.1x after returning more than 100% to investors at those higher levels.Chart: BABA P/S 2015-2016Shopify is still very much in its infancy though. It has plenty of options looking forward, plenty of paths it can take, and a phenomenal leadership team that has brought the company to this stage so far. With the development of the fulfillment center, additional retailers will come aboard given the new ease of delivery to customers, thus adding to growth, and offering a new path for top-line growth.Conservatively, this company grows the top-line at 30% for the next two years with room still to run after that too. I believe revenues hit $3.55B in FY22 with ease. A 30x P/S, which would not be inconceivable (given a 30%+ rate of growth) would work out to a market cap of $106.5B. This represents just 16% growth over today, but again, I believe I am being conservative in my estimates.We area world that is rapidly moving online, and that's Shopify's bread-and-butter. This in itself will be a bump to any multiples for years to come.Shopify has what it takes to become the leader in eCommerce over the next decade by giving brand owners ownership and control of how they sell to and reach consumers. It has:I recognize the risks of such an investment and would recommend that anyone reading proceeds with immense caution. High-growth tech firms come and go, but I believe Shopify has developed a certain ""stickiness"" that will allow it to stay for the long-term.Near-term (0-12m), I am neutral. The price will fluctuate as news about COVID-19 continues to bounce around. Long-term (years) I am about as bullish as one could be."
4346967,100666,2020-05-13T05:05:07-04:00,"Shopify is an outstanding company and its Q1 2020 results crushed the estimates again.I have a cost base of $83 as I bought my first Shopify shares in May 2017.In 2017 and 2018, I argued that the stock was cheap, although everybody said that it was severely overvalued.But at $750, I think Shopify is severely overvalued. I see the fair price at somewhere between $275 and $350 and I show you how I get to that price.","Last Wednesday, Shopify (SHOP) reported its Q1 2020 earnings and those were terrific again, as we have come to expect of this premium company. As a long-term shareholder of the company (since May 2017, when I picked Shopify as the first Potential Multibagger) I was happy, of course. But its price starts to get me nervous. In this article, I look at what Shopify may be worth and if I should trim my position.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a value investor, I'm willing to pay premium prices for premium companies and I can handle a lot of volatility. I see price targets as a petty game because you never know what a stock or the general market will do and how investors are going to feel about it all. I think this recent rally amidst a severe crisis shows that again.Therefore, I never pay too much attention to 'fair price' estimates, except when they really make no sense at all, like with cannabis stocks in 2018 and 2019. And I'm a big fan of this great company and of its founder and CEO Tobi Lütke. I have already stated in previous articles that the future of tech is unscaling and Shopify provides an excellent platform for this trend. Small (and bigger) businesses can focus on their clients much better and brands can let their customers have an experience rather than that of Amazon (AMZN). Service becomes a competitive advantage again and Shopify is one of the ways brands can give that to their customers.After the earnings, the stock shot up to above $700 and at the moment of writing even just above $750. The Canadian company now has a market cap of $90B, which is enormous for a company with revenue expected to be just above $2B this year. Even if this great over-deliverer would do $2.25B in revenue this year, that is still a forward P/S of 40.I have a cost base of $83.57 and I already sold 80% of my position from the end of June to September 2019, at prices between $350 and $400. The reason was that I thought Shopify was overvalued then too. That move seemed a good move initially. From September to early November 2019, the stock price fell by 25%:But we all know what the stock price did since then. Don't worry about my returns, though. I invested the money in stocks like The Trade Desk (TTD) and some other Potential Multibaggers and they have done really well too. And I felt more relaxed with just 20% of my initial stake of the 'overvalued' stock.But now, after doubling again in just a few months, I start to wonder if the position should be trimmed again. This is a strange question for me, as I advocate buying and holding premium companies for very long periods. Normally, I don't advocate trimming and selling but if I can really see no upside at all, even with the most optimistic scenarios, I think I should break my own rules. Before we have a look at the valuation, I want to take you through the last earnings, of Q1 2020, which were released last week.As has become the tradition for Shopify, the earnings estimates were crushed again in Q1 2020. Revenue was up 46.7% YoY to $470M, crushing the consensus of $442.9M. Non-GAAP EPS came in at a surprising $0.19 versus the expected -$0.18, a beat by $0.36. The GAAP EPS even beat by more: $0.50, coming in at -$0.27. The Canadian company had already withdrawn its guidance for this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.GMV or gross merchandise volume (the dollar amount of everything that was sold on the platform) was up 46% YoY to $17.4B. GPV or gross payments volume came in at $7.3B, from penetration of 41% of GMV in Q1 2019 to 42% in Q1 2020. Of course, the GPV in dollars is up because the GMV was up 46% but I was a bit disappointed that Shopify couldn't speed up its payment solution to make it a part of more transactions as a percentage of the total GMV.Shopify, just as Square (SQ), also has a POS or point-of-sale solution. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the GMV there dropped by a whopping 71% from mid-March to the end of April but that was compensated for the most part by online sales. From the press release:There's more COVID-19 impact. Several Shopify Plus clients have downgraded their plans and GMV slowed down for certain merchants. Shopify's CFO Amy Shapero on the Q1 2020 conference call:Shopify keeps investing heavily in its Shopify Fulfillment Network. It has a 5-year plan there and it bought 6 River Systems for that reason in September 2019 for $450M.Also noticeable was the launch of the Shop app recently. It's an e-commerce mobile shopping app. It is seen as a competitor to Amazon by some media outlets but I don't agree with that. Maybe it could become a competitor to FBA (Fulfilled By Amazon) over time, but it's not meant to serve the bigger brands, but the small entrepreneurs that suffer now from the coronavirus impact.It's not that I don't like Shop, I do. But for now, the Shop app looks more like a way to encourage repeat purchases with the same merchants you bought from in the past and not a recommendation algorithm machine like Amazon's platform. Over time, this could be added, of course. This is not so simple and I have the feeling that investors are a bit too enthusiastic about Shop, based on the media coverage of the potential. There certainly is potential, but this is not comparable to Amazon, not by far. And there's no Prime-like feature, which could really boost the returns.There is no doubt that Shopify is an outstanding business and over the long term, I think Shopify shareholders will do well. Shopify's management, with CEO Toby Lütke, COO Harley Finkelstein and CFO Amy Shapero is top-notch and, probably as a consequence, the company's execution is world-class, leaving expectations in the dust quarter after quarter.(Tobi Lütke and Harley Finkelstein around the time of Shopify's IPO, source)But there is one big hurdle: valuation. Shopify has been called overvalued since it shot up 51% on the day of its IPO in May 2015, if we would believe the experts.If you look at the classic ratios, Shopify's stock price never made sense. But I have bought Shopify in May 2017, thinking it was actually cheap compared to its potential. I reiterated that view in November 2018, when the stock was at $140 and everybody believed it was severely overvalued. But this time, at $750, I think that it has become too expensive, even compared to its huge opportunities. I really hate to say that because I love this company. But closing my eyes for the reality won't make it go away.Let's look at the company from the perspective that Shopify has become a mature company. This may take a decade and probably more, but I always invest for the very long term and try to think along those lines for companies too. The numbers are not set in stone, of course, but it gives an impression. A bit of optimistic imagination goes a long way in growth investing.At this moment, the consensus projections for Shopify's revenue come in at $2.16B for 2020. Mostly Shopify beats expectations, so let's take $2.25B. There are 119.08M shares outstanding if you add the newly-issued shares. That is revenue of $18.90 per share. The gross profit margin of Shopify is 54.5%.Net margins are negative now, but once the company becomes more mature, net profit margins will rise too. Bigger SaaS companies like Adobe (ADBE) and Intuit (INTU) have net profit margins of 20% to 30%. Revenue growth for the next decade will inevitably decrease as the numbers grow, that's completely normal. But I didn't take the numbers of the analyst projections, as Shopify always beats them. I see the revenue growth slowing down less sharply. But please keep in mind that this is a really optimistic projection because of that.(compiled by the author)That projection is still consistent with the projection I did in November 2018, where I got to $23.57B.If Shopify has a profit margin of 22.5% by 2030, which is high and very optimistic considering the fulfillment network that it's building, this would add up to earnings of $5.5B. We don't know how many shares will be outstanding by then. But suppose the number of shares grows by 3% yearly, which doesn't seem unlikely because of the share offerings and the stock-based compensations. That would take us to roughly 160 million shares. Earnings of $5.5B and 160 million shares outstanding, that would add up to EPS of $34.38.With Shopify's stock price of $750 now, that is a 10-year forward PE of 21.81. For reference: stalwarts like Coca-Cola (KO) and McDonald's (MCD) trade at a 10-year forward P/E now of around 11, PepsiCo (PEP) even at more than 15. But less assumptions are built in there, because their revenue streams are more predictable.I would consider everything under a 10-year forward P/E of 10 (or PE10 for short) for Shopify cheap, which means $343.8 ($34.38x10). At $500, the PE10 would be around 15. Now, beware, this is with very optimistic earnings and a very high net profit margin.But let's take another method here too, with less assumptions. Let's take the final net profit margin of 22.5% and apply it to the revenue projection of 2020: $2.25B. That would add up to $506M in profits. With the current 119M shares, that would mean EPS of $4.25. With the current stock price of about $750, this would mean a P/E ratio of 176.5. With a growth of around 43%, the 'virtual PEG' is above 4. This 'virtual PEG' is very high, and I'd prefer it to be at 1.5 or lower. That would mean $274 (1.5*43*4.25). Again, this method shows, even with very optimistic net margins, that Shopify is severely overvalued. In November 2018, when I called Shopify cheap, the virtual PEG was just 1.Now I know that there are a lot of ifs and assumptions here, but if they are off the chart, it will be on the optimistic side, not the pessimistic one. I still love Shopify and I will keep my eyes on the stock price. But at this level, there's too much growth priced into the stock. The PE10 and the virtual PEG show that the stock is worth between $275 and $350 and that's with very optimistic numbers.I would really love to have more shares of Shopify, as it is one of the best companies of our time. But at a stock price of $750, I don't think there's upside that has not been priced into the stock. A very optimistic projection puts the stock price somewhere between $275 and $350.At more than double that price, I see more downside than upside for Shopify. That's why I will consider trimming my position by at least 50%. If you see holes in my reasoning, you can try to convince me of not doing that in the comment section.If you like this article, feel free to hit the follow button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4347407,101848,2020-05-14T02:47:56-04:00,"Shopify's soaring fortunes aptly demonstrate the key role investors think the company will play in the further development of e-commerce in the post-COVID-19 environment.To justify the company's lofty heights, Shopify's task is clear:  grow its platform merchant base and develop new service efficiencies to pull Shopify's profitability forward.Even with the likes of Amazon, e-commerce is a broad space with ample room for growth.","Long before COVID-19 washed up on American shores, a secular shift toward e-commerce was already well advanced. Convenience, cost, selection all weighted heavily against the proverbial road trip to the local mall or department store. With blinding speed, COVID-19 has added safety to the list. Social distancing will be commonplace for the foreseeable future, providing e-commerce an even bigger slice of market share moving forward.Now with new cases in the US largely plateauing and falling to the downside in many former COVID-19 hotspots, the many actors in the drama strain to be heard. State governors in Georgia, Texas, South Carolina and elsewhere are attempting to reopen their pummeled economies. Economists stress the need for additional fiscal assistance to help ravaged businesses bring back the army of workers furloughed over the past several weeks. Public health officials stress the medical solution to the crisis as biotech companies the world over scramble to bring a viable medical solution to market. And those confined under stay-at-home orders, lockdown freedom beckons - irrespective of smoldering pockets of viral outbreak that appear in their midst. Caution rang out from Seoul authorities, who were forced to shut down bars and clubs again in the face of 34 reported new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend. Germany saw three districts exceeding the government’s limit of no more than 50 new cases of COVID-19 per 10,000 people. And Wuhan, China, five cases were discovered over the weekend in a single residential community, the first confirmed cases since early April.This summer’s consumer traffic in restaurants, bars and malls -economic sectors that shed 7.7 million and 2.1 million jobs, respectively, through the end of April - will likely be painfully slow. In densely populated metropolises like New York City where the death toll now exceeds 19,000, the path to and time frame for economic normalcy is simply a known unknown. Short of a medical end to COVID-19, the fear element to the equation for most people remains all too real. Is it reasonable to assume COVID-19 lurks behind every cough and sneeze that occurs in public spaces? Meanwhile, the economic impact of COVID-19 remains fluid as both private and government surveys reported many of these worker furloughs are viewed as temporary in nature. This suggests a quick turnaround as fears of contagion wane. If true, the onus is on policymakers to fiscally keep the doors of impacted companies from closing permanently. Getting this crisis right is clearly paramount. Negotiating the waters of such disparate voices and interests bestows new meaning to political risk.Figure 1: Shopify against the S&P 500While necessity is the traditional mother of invention, adaptability runs a close second. Hardly by prescient design, the Ottawa-based Shopify (SHOP) found itself landing in the right place/right time positioning as the impact of the pandemic spread through the reach of its merchant community. By the beginning of April, COVID-19 had already seriously impeded global commerce with small- and medium-sized service businesses here in the US taking outsized economic hits. At the same time, demand for Shopify's shopping and delivery services by consumers confined by stay-at-home orders soared. Shopify Capital offered up $192 million or 28% more funding to merchants in the 1st quarter QOQ as a result, pushing the program past the $1 billion cumulative threshold during the quarter since launching the program in 2016. By happenstance, the company launched a free 90-day trial platform promotion introduced in early March. By last week's earnings call, the platform saw a 62% surge in online merchants for the period. The inability of its merchant clientele to meet the new demands placed on their retail operations found Shopify engineers setting up enhanced virtual links to lockdown customers, while coordinating local in-store curb-side pickup and delivery services to keep the flow of goods and services of platform merchants on track. New curbside credit card readers and sales tracking systems were provided to process payments were rolled out. Shopify kept a steady stream of bulletins flowing throughout the system on official assistance announcements from local, state and national governments. As a result of these efforts, local orders from consumers within a 10-mile radius of the registered online store address more than doubled during the period.With the aid of an unparalleled barrage of liquidity served up by the Federal Reserve timed almost perfectly by an equally unparalleled and bi-partisan fiscal response from Congress, the heretofore liquidity-starved S&P 500 index shook off its 15-day bear market stint on the 8th of April with aplomb. To date, the Fed has already purchased about $1.5 trillion in treasuries and an estimated $600 billion in mortgage backed securities since mid-March. On Tuesday (12th May), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started buying exchange traded funds with a broad exposure to corporate debt. It will begin to buy corporate debt directly, including non-investment grade issues, in the coming weeks. The Fed’s current purchase pace is now at the level of its second and third large-scale asset purchase programs combined over the course of 2010-12.Shopify clearly got caught in the sharp market updraft as liquidity issues in the buying and selling of bonds and equities on US exchanges quickly waned as the Fed’s backstop came into place. Shopify’s share price (red-green line) bottomed on the 16th of March at $322, only to reverse to the upside for a 16% gain on the 23rd of March precisely when the S&P hit its nadir for the year. A short-lived but unsustainable spurt to $446/share two days later gave way quickly to a 22% drop by the 2nd of April, which saw the stock crash through its 200-day exponential moving average (blue line). From there, Shopify has soared 105% through Friday’s market close to $709/share. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 31% from its 23rd March low, advancing 1.69% (see Figure 1, above). In a jarring juxtaposition, US unemployment hit a post-Depression high of 14.7% with a whopping 23.1 million workers furloughed, while the Nasdaq squeaked into positive territory YTD.The company delivered a mixed result for the quarter with revenues up 47% YOY at $470 million, but down almost 7% from the 4th quarter 2019. Since 2012, Shopify revenues have grown at an annualized rate of 69.2% through the end of 2019. Gross profit for the quarter came to $257 million, up 43% YOY but down 3% from the 4th quarter. Over the 8-year period, annualized growth in gross profits came to 61.29%. Total operating income for the quarter was negative at $59.2 million, down from a negative $31.4 million YOY with total operating expenses up 49% YOY. Operating expenses also increased 8% in the 1st quarter over the 4th quarter. Over the eight-year period, operating expenses grew at a 61.41% annualized rate. Much of this growth in the quarter stems from capital outlays and expenses associated with the purchase of 6 Rivers Systems last year. Six Rivers provides cloud-based software and mobile robots that will add measures of efficiency to Shopify’s fulfillment network rollout in the US. Earnings per share remained negative for the 1st quarter at ($0.27)/share, down almost 23% YOY and down from a positive $0.01/share in the 4th quarter. Shopify has yet to turn an annual profit.Unsurprisingly, non-GAAP growth measures figured heavily in the company’s 1st quarter report. Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) grew at 25% YOY to $55.4 million. The measure compiles three basic components: merchant monthly fees, variable fees collected from larger companies on the Shopify Plus platform, and the number of Shopify apps merchants use per month. Overall, MRR multiplies the number of merchants on the platform by the average monthly fee charged on the last day of the period. MRR is important as both a monthly account of cash flow as well as a monthly headcount of companies using the Shopify platform.Shopify Plus added two percentage points to MRR growth during the quarter, accounting for 28% of MRR revenue, or $15.3 million. Shopify Plus offers large volume, higher margin merchants the ability to move a portion or all their operations online quickly, cost efficiently and across multiple selling channels. The ability and facility of companies to offer merchandise online during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak were aptly demonstrated, in many instances providing the difference between meeting and not meeting demand for the period.Another non-GAAP measure is gross merchandise volume (GMV). The indicator compiles the total dollar value of goods and services processed by merchants on the Shopify platform, including shipping, handling, duties and applied sales taxes. GMV increased 46% YOY to $17.4 billion with $7.3 billion or about 42% of that dollar volume being processed through Shopify Payments during the quarter. Dollar volume through Shopify Payments increased 51% YOY with non-discretionary items like food and daily essentials seeing elevated demand during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Office equipment and exercise equipment were also high demand items as the shift from offline to online retail increased proportionally to the inability or unwillingness of consumers to venture outside for basic and nondiscretionary needs. GMV, an annual measure, increased by 49% YOY through the end of 2019.Is Shopify’s current stock price sustainable moving forward? This is likely the wrong question to ask. Stock prices are valued not by historical or current performance - but on the potential of future earnings. Shopify’s $87.98 billion market cap is 51 times trailing twelve-month revenues and 93.4 times TTM gross profits through the end of 2019. That is pricey by most standard measures. At its current valuation, the company is now the biggest publicly listed firm in Canada, having edged out the Royal Bank of Canada (RY) last week. That said, investors are collectively telling a different story. Shopify has become a major player in the e-commerce space which is fast becoming an essential utility. While its current market valuation is 13.6 times less than Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) $1.2 trillion market cap, comparisons of the two competitors in the same e-commerce space are hard to avoid. Investors clearly see in Shopify a formidable rival to Amazon’s current e-commerce market position. More importantly, investors see the e-commerce space as big enough for the likes of both Shopify and Amazon to expand and consolidate their respective operations. COVID-19 has accelerated the shift toward online shopping and Shopify’s (and Amazon's) current market valuation is a reflection of the fact.Shopify has gathered a very loyal base of some 1 million merchants, mostly small- and medium-sized companies (SME) to date. In order to maintain, let alone grow, its current market valuation, the task for Shopify moving forward is clear. First and foremost, the company needs to grow its merchant base. As we have seen, revenues have a current annualized growth rate of 69.2% back to 2012. The results of the company’s 90-day free trial netting a 62% increase in new business creation on the platform underscores demand among SMEs for Shopify’s growing basket of online services. Second, Shopify needs to continue the process of launching technology tools to add services to its platform, creating broad-based and recurring bottom-line income streams that will lift the company to profitability sooner rather than later. The continued breakout of its fulfillment network in the US with the aid of 6 Rivers System software and automation is a clear example. Shopify Capital was an unexpected godsend to many a struggling Shopify merchant in the heat of the COVID-19 outbreak by offering up loans and advances to merchants against future sales. Such support for its merchant community needs to both continue and expand moving forward.By and large, merchants do not really care where the sales are coming from - be it from websites, from brick-and-mortar stores, from Amazon's or Instagram’s Marketplace or from tablets, cell phones or laptop computers. Merchants care about the management of their inventory, their sales and the channels through which they move their goods and services. Shopify provides the unified command center to monitor the minutia of retail so that merchants can increase their marketing and service reach and ultimately their gross sales to their respective client base.An amazing statistic popped out of the company’s press release announcing its earnings call last week. Shopify’s point-of-sale (POS) merchants selling through brick-and-mortar storefronts saw revenues drop 71% in the first half of March. Those same merchants were able to turn around much of that deficit by shifting sales quickly online, recovering an estimated 94% of sales assumed to be lost forever in the first half of the month. Providing an almost seamless pivot from physical to virtual sales underscores the importance of Shopify in the e-commerce mix. This level of flexibility is but one of the many tailwinds behind Shopify's current market success.Figure 2: Shopify and Amazon against the S&P 500Shopify is among a handful of tech companies that clearly surged in value in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic has forced us all online to meet daily needs that could not be met under lockdown mandates that swept major population centers here in the US and around the world. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) have all pushed their market caps comfortably above the $1 trillion mark. Amazon (up 24%) and Microsoft (up 13%) lay claim to double-digit gains for the year. Zoom (ZM), a video-conferencing technology firm, is up 146% midday (13th May). With stay-at-home mandates, the company has seen exponential growth through the end of the 1st quarter. The broader S&P 500 is still down just under 12% for the year through yesterday’s (12th May) market close. Nearly 40% of the market value of the Nasdaq derives from these stocks with the addition of Alphabet (GOOG) and Facebook (FB). Similarly, these same companies comprise about one fifth of the S&P 500 by market capitalization. Both Shopify (green-red line) and Amazon (purple line) have furthered the relative value of e-commerce during the pandemic and investors have responded by advancing their shares in the marketplace well beyond the S&P 500 benchmark’s own breakout since the 23rd of March. Shopify broke through its 200-day exponential moving average in the early days of April and has largely not looked back. Ditto for Amazon (see Figure 2, above). And with the continued and determined market backstop provided by the Federal Reserve, both Shopify and Amazon will continue to provide millions with market access to myriad goods and services by click of a keyboard in the post-pandemic environment."

The Shopify ecosystem is expanding beyond just website hosting to financing, POS, logistics, and marketing, etc. As a result of the tragic pandemic and the lock-down measures adopted around the world, businesses are forced to turn to online platforms to sustain their operations. For Shopify, this means that its total addressable market just became a lot larger. While it is impossible to quantify the exact impact at this point, we believe there are reasons to be optimistic that a large number of customers have become Shopify customers due to the ongoing pandemic.On the recent 2020 Q1 earnings call last week, management provided additional color on the increasing demand from new industry verticals. It is not difficult to understand why merchants in all industries are trying to build their online platform as quickly as possible. There is no time to go through the traditional development cycle and merchants need to have their online presence up and running in days, not weeks or months. Shopify offers exactly what these merchants need with its wide range of product offerings and rapid deployment. We think Shopify will benefit immensely from the expanded universe of merchants as many of them will likely stay with Shopify even when the pandemic passed. It is difficult to switch your entire online platforms after the fact and it is even a harder decision when Shopify provides such a seamless, reliable, and convenient solution.(Source: IR Deck)Another positive development that will create lasting positive effects on Shopify's business is the onboarding of larger merchants. The company noted that many large retailers have used its Shopify Plus platform to launch their online platforms including Heinz (KHC) who launched only 7 days after signing on Shopify Plus. Chocolate maker Lindt also launched its online store in just 5 days which is a testament to Shopify's ability to help large multinational companies set up sophisticated e-commerce platforms in just days.(Source: IR Deck)We believe the influx of large corporations will significantly expand Shopify's penetration in the more profitable Shopify Plus category. While the mom-and-pop customers and SMBs have underpinned Shopify's previous growth, we think the next leg of growth will be driven by the extension of the Shopify ecosystem into more demanding and profitable customers. In Q1 2020, Shopify Plus accounted for 24% of the Monthly Recurring Revenue and we expect that percentage to expand gradually in the coming quarters. Shopify Plus costs $2000+ per month versus $29 for the most basic plan geared towards early-stage entrepreneurs, which means that Shopify could benefit from higher GMVs, more value-added services, and enhanced margins if it is able to capture more large customers.(Source: IR Deck)The third tailwind benefiting Shopify from the current environment is the deepening of relationships between its ecosystem and its merchants. One important solution that Shopify is offering to its customers is Shopify Capital which provides working capital loans and purchases receivables at a discount from merchants. Shopify Capital reached $1 billion in capital deployed during Q1 and the program has been expanded from U.S.-only to include UK and Canada during the pandemic. We think the ability to provide essential financing solutions to merchants when traditional financing options are unavailable will fortify Shopify's status among merchants.Shopify took other actions to build up goodwill and entice new customers during the quarter including making Shopify Email free to all users until October 1 and offering a three-month free trial on the Standard plans for all customers. We think these actions will help attract many potential customers to the Shopify platform and build long-term relationships via offerings such as capital and email marketing. While these investments might induce a short-term spike in investments, we think they will provide sustained growth for years to come.(Source: IR Deck)Shopify shares closed at $709 last Friday after dropping ~3% upon a $1.3 billion equity offering selling shares at $700 per share. The company has a market capitalization of $86.6 billion and an enterprise value of $84.3 billion. Thomson's consensus estimates show 2020 and 2021 revenue of $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion which implies an EV/Sales trading multiple of 39x and 29x, respectively. Shopify is certainly not cheap compared to other e-commerce plays as shown in the chart below.While Shopify has the highest '21/'20 revenue growth rate, the stock is also the most expensive at 29x off '21 revenue. Notably, Etsy (ETSY) is the second most expensive stock in the list below and its expected growth rate is only half of Shopify's. The more established and mature e-commerce businesses such as Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) are trading at lower multiples around 3x '21 revenue. Chewy (CHWY) is a specialty pet food online retailer that is trading at 2.0x '21 revenue.(Source: Public Filings and Bloomberg)While we think there is no doubt that investors have bid up Shopify's shares and valuation is rich at this point, we think long-term focused investors should stay put due to the tailwinds we outlined in this report. We believe Shopify's total addressable market has expanded significantly as more merchants, large and small, migrated to rely on Shopify for their online sales. It is difficult to capture the expanded TAM in traditional valuation multiples but investors should be confident that the growth outlook for Shopify has only strengthened in the last few weeks.We also think that a key differentiating factor that separates Shopify from its peers, including those listed above, is the versatility and ubiquity of its platform and services. Merchants from almost any industry and any size can trust Shopify as demonstrated by the recent rapid launch by global brands such as Heinz and Lindt. For this reason, the total market potential for Shopify is way bigger than players such as Chewy which only focuses on pet food or Etsy which only focuses on small businesses selling handmade and vintage items. As a result, we think Shopify's premium valuation is warranted due to larger TAM and a better growth outlook.(Source: TSX)While the tragic pandemic has brought unbearable health and economic damages to our society, Shopify will undoubtedly come out from this stronger due to the benefits we outlined in this article. We think its market potential just expanded significantly as more merchants launch e-commerce sites amid the shelter-in-place orders around the world. The pandemic has accelerated the transition and embracement of online capabilities for many merchants that could have taken them years to make the decision.For Shopify, it is doing all the right things by investing in supporting and enabling its customers to continue servicing consumers during this difficult period. When life returns to normal, we are confident that most of Shopify's new customers will continue embracing its platform and services as the omnichannel strategy will become the norm. Consumer habits will likely change permanently and merchants will have to remain capable in the online world in the post-COVID world.For long-term investors, despite the huge short-term runup in Shopify shares, we think the long-term prospect has never been stronger for the company. It is hard to quantify the exact impact of the secular tailwinds benefiting Shopify but we think the expanded opportunity set justifies the premium in its shares. We remain optimistic about Shopify's growth outlook and believe its platform is capable of serving merchants in almost all industries and of all sizes, which is unique among its peers."
4344388,24634,2020-05-07T18:46:31-04:00,"Shopify Inc. shines, getting a +6% boost after announcing Q1 2020 results on Wednesday.The lasting effects of COVID-19 on the retail sector will rapidly increase the speed of virtual storefront adoption, further accelerating the shift away from ""brick and mortar"".The SHOP ecosystem provides a unique competitive advantage for the company.I am raising my 5-year price target for SHOP to $1,250.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) continues to be one of those stocks that defies gravity. One camp points to price appreciation and the other points to P/E. One camp is bullish on the stock, while the other remains wary of paying up for growth. I think we can all agree that Shopify Inc. receives a minimal amount of fanfare for a company that finished behind only Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in U.S. eCommerce market share for 2019. SHOP's market share was 5.9% in 2019, beating out the likes of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).The ecosystem Shopify Inc. has in place has served both their merchants and shareholders well. SHOP has benefited greatly from the consumer behavior shift toward online purchases. This catalyst was a primary assumption in the investment thesis from my Seeking Alpha article on Shopify Inc. from 8/3/2019. Our 5-year price target at the time of my last article was $625. Well that was breached much faster than expected.In our view, the COVID-19 pandemic will speed up the demise of the ""brick and mortar"" only retail model. A large number of retailers, both big and small, will cease to reopen after the shutdown of the US economy. Shopify Inc.'s one-stop solution for building all aspects of an online marketplace, has already ""seen a notable increase in online store creation, some of which are established retailers"" (SHOP Q1 2020 Earnings Call, www.tikr.com).Consumer behavior and necessity are also being skewed toward online shopping during the pandemic, and these trends are likely to persist. Shopify Inc. gave some timely insight on Wednesday's earnings call, revealing that ""the number of consumers making a purchase for the first time from any Shopify merchant grew 8% between March 13th and April 24th compared with the previous 6 weeks"".With the long-term tailwinds accelerating for SHOP, coupled with our Best Stocks Now ranking of #17, I am raising my 5-year price target to $1,250. This represents a 70% increase from the record closing price of $733.53 on Wednesday (5/6/2020).SHOP has spent a vast majority of the last year and a half at the top of our rankings. The rankings blend Fundamental and Technical analysis, weighting factors across both disciplines. Incorporating both into our models allows us to better avoid ""value traps"" and ""high fliers"" with great charts, but no visible earnings in sight to back them up.At first glance the P/E metrics are eye popping, and admittedly higher than nine months ago. There is no question that you are paying up for growth at these levels. Current analyst estimates focused on the next quarter or two will have a high degree of variability to them and the possibility of choppiness in the near-term. Consumer discretionary spending estimates and results will also likely be all over the place. One of the benefits of setting 5-year price targets is our ability to take a longer-term view of the shares (versus the short-term focus of a majority of the street). The post-COVID-19 marketplace should accelerate the already growing share of online purchases, both in the U.S. and abroad. Shopify Inc. has the ecosystem and proven track record to add market share, on both the merchant and consumer side of the transaction.From the consumer side, Gross Merchandise Volumes (GMV) continue to rise, growing more than $5.5 billion or +46% over Q1 2019. As consumer demand grows, the increasing ""wallet share"" being captured by SHOP merchants will have a compounding effect on gross profit. GP grew 44% when compared to Q1 2020, rising by +$81 million.On the Q1 2020 earnings call, Shopify Inc.'s management highlighted the revenue growth seen in January and February. SHOP is also in a unique position to provide insight on what they are seeing in the post-COVID-19 economy. March turned out to be mostly a wash, but seeds are being planted to drive future growth.Shopify Inc. made a commitment (in the form of investment) to their merchants early on in this pandemic. For example, a fourth of all ""brick and mortar"" merchants with SHOP have now been set up for in-store pickup and delivery. Those merchants that have been lost because of the pandemic have been replaced with new merchants and/or by higher volumes experienced by existing merchants.Monthly Reoccurring Revenue (MRR) has grown at a 50% CAGR over the last five years. With the number of merchants online growing and a rapidly growing share of eCommerce revenues up for grabs, SHOP continues to grow revenues across all segments of the business in Q1 2020 (SHOP Q1 2020 Earnings Call, www.tikr.com).In light of what we consider to be low 2021 EPS consensus analyst estimates, we see our assumed 5-year growth rate as feasible. We are expecting upward revisions to analysts' expectations as 2020 progresses towards some sense of normalcy, in the post-COVID-19 economy. As this occurs, our 5-year growth rate assumption will be ratcheted down.For SHOP shares, the combination of gale force tailwinds fueling long-term sustainable revenue growth and improving profitability, should translate in accelerated future EPS growth.As mentioned earlier in the article, ""Momentum"" also plays heavily into our BSN rankings. Since going public, Shopify Inc. has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 in every year. The momentum has continued in 2020, as of Tuesday (5/5/2020) SHOP shares are up +72.6%, while the S&P 500 is understandably down -11.2%.The stellar results above translate into A+ grades on both our Momentum and Performance criteria:In addition to vastly outperforming the S&P 500 on an annual basis over the last 5 years, the short-term technical charts are glowing red hot. Technical analysis/charting is the primary tool we use when determining entry or exit points for an equity position that has successfully completed our stock selection process. Although Shopify Inc. is up over +158% in the last twelve months, a quick glance at the chart reveals plenty of entry points existed along the way.We currently own SHOP in the Gunderson Ultra Growth Portfolio and remain ""Very Bullish"" on the shares. In my opinion the material risk to the share price will be in the near-term, likely coming in the form of widely varying analyst estimates and/or poor discretionary spending data from the consumer. In my opinion, any weakness in the data should be viewed as transitory. We will be looking to treat any weakness as an opportunity to put additional capital to work.Shopify Inc. has a distinct competitive advantage in the eCommerce world. SHOP's ecosystem can't be easily duplicated, and the demand for businesses to build an online presence is happening now. There is no time like the present, when you are building the future storefronts of retail, today. Where can I buy one of those crystal balls? Just one.Note: All images, unless otherwise noted, show data from the Best Stocks Now database."

The remainder will be broke and unemployed.Pickup in small business sites will be short-lived as the 90-day free trials end. However, the increased interest will stress Shopify's infrastructure and increase costs.The stock price is extremely overvalued unless one assumes profitability going forward which is unlikely given the transaction-based business model and coming recession.","Readers that follow my work probably recognize that I like breakout stocks involved in the area of digital transformation. We are in the midst of a seismic shift towards the cloud and online retail, accelerated by the pandemic. Thus my interest in this area of investing.There is much to be said for investing in breakout stocks. Such stocks are recognized by the markets either due to specific events, changes in company fundamentals, or change in the macroenvironment. As a technical analyst, I relish such movers because stocks that aren't movers tend to suck up dead money, even if they are exceptional companies. You can wait a long time to see a return on investment or you may even be investing in a value trap.While I like breakout stocks, they are volatile and hence risky. It is important to separate the real deal from the head fakes.In my latest weekly list of breakouts, I added Shopify Inc. (SHOP), an e-commerce stock that has most certainly benefited from the pandemic with a recent breakout to an all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)And here is where I make my confession and beg for mercy from my followers. Back in September, I gave Shopify a bearish rating.(Source: Seeking Alpha)I believe that this may have been my worst call ever, as the price of Shopify stock is up 100% since the article was published. For me, this serves as a reminder that being bearish about a digital transformation stock is seldom a good idea. On that note, I am changing my rating to neutral. I still can't be bullish on this stock and the reason is that when the government sugar rush ends, and it will end, we will be in a global recession.When the music stops the government handouts will have been spent, many workers will return to work and not have time to surf the web, and the rest will be unemployed and broke. I don't expect the economy to rebound this year. In all likelihood, it will take two or three years to get back to 2019 levels of GDP. Shopify's business is substantially built around merchant transactions, more so than recurring revenue which is now less than 50% of revenue. This is a short to mid-term negative factor for Shopify if or when we enter a global recession.(Source: Shopify)When Shopify announced the acquisition of 6 River Systems, the stock price began a significant bull run, in spite of my warnings about its fulfillment strategy. I get it. Investors and analysts believe in the field of dreams. Build the network and customers will come. Shopify will follow in Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) footsteps.But the Q4 earnings results call should really have put an end to grandiose thoughts of Shopify's Fulfillment Network. By the way, as a tip for investors, ignore what the CEO has to say during earnings calls, and focus on what the CFO has to say. The CEO is the visionary, the CFO is the realist.Here is what the CEO said:And the CFO:While the CEO believes that the company is revolutionizing the fulfillment industry, the CFO has indicated that the company needs to proceed slowly, setting up an R&D facility and ""learn fulfillment first hand."" The company bought a toy called ""Chuck the robot"" for $450 million and now it is trying to figure out what it got itself into. As I explained in my last article on Shopify, fulfillment is a cost center, not a profit center.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher growth stocks are valued more than lower growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Shopify stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis. I have also highlighted Amazon.com for comparison purposes.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Shopify is situated well above the best-fit line. This suggests that the company is extremely overvalued on a relative basis.Critics will no doubt argue that Amazon.com is not in the same business as Shopify. But they are both e-commerce businesses and Shopify's recent foray into fulfillment turns Shopify into a ""future Amazon"" in the eyes of many investors.From the above scatter plot, you can see that only Zoom (ZM) is more valued than Shopify in terms of forward sales multiple. The Zoom stock price has benefited greatly from the work-from-home (WFH) directive that most companies are required to follow.Valuation gets more interesting when you factor in gross margin. Shopify has a gross margin of ~57%, a low figure for software companies. This is due to the low profit margin for its merchant solutions.(Source: Portfolio123)Now, when I generate a scatter plot using the forward gross profit multiple instead of forward sales multiple, Shopify becomes the most expensive valuation in my digital transformation stock universe. It is even more expensive than Zoom!(Source: Portfolio123/private software)While Shopify is extremely overvalued by its forward gross profit multiple, it is actually undervalued when you consider analysts' estimates for next year's earnings.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)But I consider this a problem as Shopify isn't profitable, not now or for the foreseeable future, especially given the likelihood of a global recession. Keep in mind that Shopify primarily caters to small and mid-sized businesses, many of which are likely to go bankrupt in the near term, especially those small businesses that don't qualify for handouts.(Source: Google Trends)Shopify is undoubtedly benefiting from the pandemic. Online activity is up and online purchases are likely up, at least for certain types of merchandise. But this is a short-term effect fueled by government-initiated lockdown combined with handouts. The result is an increase in web searches that may or may not result in an increase in purchasing.But the government handouts won't go on forever and when the music stops, consumers will feel the effects. Spending will stop. Some will get their jobs back but not all. We should expect a recession, and this will ultimately eat into Shopify's transaction-based business model. In addition, many of those that have been laid off will start a small internet business and take advantage of the 90-day free trial. Most of these new business customers have no experience, putting pressure and increasing the cost of Shopify's infrastructure. There will be a significant churn from these newbies.Shopify's valuation is extremely high, arguably the highest in my digital transformation stock universe, if you base valuation on gross profits. The stock price can only be justified based on the expectation of future earnings, which are unlikely for the foreseeable future. According to the CFO, 2020 is a year of heavy investment.And oh yeah... some time ago, the management indicated that the fulfillment network would be ""self-funded."" Surprise! Apart from the $450 million spent on 6 River Systems, the company has announced that it will now be spending $1 billion on the fulfillment network. And this is only just the beginning. Wait until it actually figures out what it is doing."
4345719,102465,2020-05-10T12:03:54-04:00,"While the world suffers, Shopify sets all-time highs.Shopify smashed Q1 earnings, increasing revenue by 46.7% year over year.Shopify has seen its stock increase 135% off the lows and large increases in new store creations through its products.","If there is a sector that is thriving during this global crisis, it is online retailers. Shopify (SHOP) is up 35% since the market began to crash on February 20th. Now, there has been a recovery off the bottom in the general market, but Shopify has outdone the market on the recovery by over 100% as the stock set new all-time highs on the back of earnings today. As you can see below, the stock has worked wonders for ""long-term"" shareholders. I do not anticipate that the stock can keep its current pace up, but I do believe the online surge we have seen is going to continue well beyond the end of COVID-19. Assuming all of that isn't already priced in, there will still be some money to be made, but I am cautious at these inflated levels.(Source: Simplywall.st)Wednesday morning, Shopify released that over Q1 the company saw revenue hit $470 million. Not only does this beat expectations by $27 million, but this is a 46.7% year-over-year growth which is pretty incredible. Hard to maintain that long term, but considering where the company is, it is very positive. The company also posted GAAP EPS of -$0.27. This also beats expectations by a whopping $0.50. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) was reported at $17.4 billion. This is a 46% increase year over year as well as a $0.57 billion beat. Over the quarter, the company observed Subscription Solutions revenue growth of 34% driven mostly by an increase in the number of merchants joining Shopify.As you can see below, strong revenue growth is not new to Shopify and no one (should at least) expects it to continue growing at 60%+ a year. Based on the stock climbing 7% today on the backs of earnings, I am going to assume investors are pleased with 46% year-over-year growth. What will be interesting to watch for is when the number no longer becomes acceptable. There are some predictions that annual growth will fall below 40% this year. We will have to wait and see how the market reacts to that as those numbers are closer to what is expected for Amazon (AMZN) as well.(Source: Company Presentation)Shopify observed new store creations growing 62% between March 13 and April 24 compared to the 6 weeks prior. This is occurring as entrepreneurs are looking at new ways to access consumers in these difficult times. With new merchants, come new shoppers. There was an uptick of 8% over the same period when it comes to shoppers making their first purchase on Shopify. The number of consumers purchasing from a Shopify merchant they've never shopped at before also grew by 45% over the 6 weeks leading up. Shopify has extended its free trial on standard plans to 90 days, providing a healthy balance of existing businesses and new entrepreneurs setting up shop. This will no doubt weigh on Q2 results, but the long-term reward could pay off in spades as long as the new stores find success on Shopify.The question that we do not have an answer to, is how sustainable is this growth. How much of this rapid growth is due to COVID-19? And how long will it last? The answers to these questions hide in market share. One of the ongoing challenges for the company is growing its market share. Shopify currently sits second to the giant Amazon but has risen above the likes of eBay (EBAY) and Walmart (WMT). The largest challenge for Shopify going forward is continuing to steal market share from these three giants. Amazon is not about to roll over and give up any of its, as it is after more and more.(Source: Company Presentation)CFO Amy Shapero had this to say regarding the rest of 2020:Because of the current state, Shopify did not provide any guidance with regards to the rest of 2020 or Q2. This falls in line with what we have seen across multiple industries. Shopify is focusing on what is going to make its merchants the most successful, which in turn will make Shopify successful.I was calling for a price correction as late as February 14th, and we got exactly that thanks to COVID-19. I did not anticipate the 50% dip that we observed, but it was a great buying opportunity. There were two levels I was watching very closely. One was $320 and the next being $282. After the stock crashed through $409, the next stop was likely around $320. We can see below that both of these levels played important roles in the stock's decline.(Source: TC2000.com)As you can see, the stock has become incredibly volatile since the collapse, and that has not slowed down. But we can see these crucial levels of support have helped shape where we are today. If you were feeling risky and really confident in Shopify as a company, there was a great opportunity to buy below $409. I was waiting for the $409 to get tested and have a successful retest before breaking out again, as I let the price make the final decision on any trades. Fundamentals are a great starting point, but if price cannot confirm what is happening, then there's no basis for an entry in my opinion. (Source: TC2000.com)If you nailed the bottom, you are currently sitting pretty with a 135% gain. It looks like the 50% decline shook out all the loose hands, as the stock has rebounded and then some to new all-time highs. I do not know how much more the price can run. I believe a lot will have to do with how long COVID-19 lasts, and what Q2 earnings look like. Looking below, we can see the short-term trendline that has been established. This is a very, very steep trend. Looking below, you can see that the stock has traded right along its established trend lines over the past 18 months. I would expect some consolidation around these levels as we wait for more news. But because this is a growth stock and there's some very clear momentum behind it, there is the possibility it continues to dart higher, and quickly. (Source: TC2000.com)In a perfect world, I would love to see this stock come back and consolidate around the February high while some of the fundamentals catch up a little bit before really lifting off and pushing for $1000. But as we have seen before, that is not always the case for these growth stocks. I would not personally buy the stock at these levels. I am giving Shopify a hold rating at this point. Given how much the stock has ramped up, there is a decent chance for another buying opportunity to show itself.As you can see, Shopify delivered outstanding results yet again. The company is seeing large increases in new merchants due to the COVID-19 situation. The true test will come in Q2 and Q3 data when we see how much follow-through there is as life begins to return to some sort of normal and retail stores open up to the public again. If all the merchants that are taking advantage of the free-trial stick around, the stock will continue to soar. If there is some drop off in growth, the stock will get hit hard. The stock remains a hold for me at these levels."
4340184,104905,2020-04-27T10:25:26-04:00,"CTO is saying that Shopify is handling Black Friday level traffic every day at the moment. Traffic could soon double.
        Website traffic is not revenue. Comments from merchants suggest that they are not turning increased traffic into more sales. The company pulled its full year 2020 guidance.
        At all-time-high share price and valuation, investors should be careful to buy into a company that will most likely see decelerating revenue growth in the short- to mid-term.
        However, Shopify is still a great business and a high conviction growth stock that should benefit from long-lasting secular growth trends.","Will Shopify (SHOP) profit from COVID-19? That is a question that many investors are probably asking themselves right now. Of course, this is a very unfortunate formulation. No one “profits” from the COVID-19 crisis – it’s a devastating crisis on many, many levels. But, only from a business perspective, some companies are indeed profiting from the forced quarantines around the world. One good example is Zoom (ZM).In Shopify's case, this question seems a bit harder to answer. The market has also struggled with it. [object HTMLElement]Amazon (AMZN), which is often compared to Shopify because it also operates in e-commerce, has seen much less drawdown in the (so far) hight of the market panic, but recently Shopify has made up all the lost ground.It made immediate sense that Shopify would trade down a bit more than Amazon in this environment: Shopify is a much smaller and more volatile company, it doesn't have the same financial strength, not as much market power, it is much more exposed to the likely weakness of small businesses, the products sold from its vendors are not ""essential"", and it has a lot of exposure to China's supply chain. The sharp surge in the share price since the beginning of April does not make as much sense, intuitively. Especially considering that right now, in the middle of one of the biggest world crises in the last 100 years, shares are trading around 14% higher than their last all-time-high reached earlier in February (at which point, by the way, the stock was almost 4 times higher than at the beginning of 2019).It's safe to say that at the moment, the market is giving investors a fair amount of FOMO when it comes to buying shares of Shopify. In times like these, investors are well served to keep a cool head despite all the positivity.If you were searching for an easy answer for why Shopify's shares have done so well lately, the above quote should do it for you. This quote comes from a tweet of the CTO of Shopify, Jean-Michel Lemieux. Source: Twitter.Black Friday traffic every day? Soon about to double?That's terrific news! But it is also a very logical consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. People are not allowed or simply not willing to go to physical stores, so naturally, they go online for their shopping. Or at the least, they go there for their browsing. The truth is traffic is not revenue. Yes, increasing traffic validates Shopify's platform and its long-term outlook. However, there is simply no way of telling how much money they will make from that increased attention. On April 1, Shopify provided a business update relating to COVID-19 for its shareholders.In this update, Shopify shared some positive-sounding data insights:At the same time, the company pulled its guidance for the full year 2020:""Shopify ended 2019 with momentum that continued into January and February of 2020. This will enable us to report revenue and adjusted operating income for the first quarter within or ahead of the range of expectations provided on February 12, 2020, despite the global economic disruption that emerged in March triggered by COVID-19. Given the uncertainty surrounding the duration and magnitude of COVID-19, Shopify is suspending the financial expectations provided for full year 2020.""Just to be clear, that's bad news. When things are running better than expected, companies don't pull their guidance. They usually keep quiet, blow-out the next earnings report, and then give prudent guidance (cautioning investors that it is tough to predict the future and that recent positive momentum should not be extrapolated). Just like Netflix (NFLX) did the other day.On top of the slashed guidance, comments made by merchants are, at least for now, not very reassuring. You can get a feel for the situation if you browse the Shopify community discussion board. Of course, the information there is very anecdotal. If your online store is booming right now, you won't have time to write on community boards. Thus, posts will most likely lean towards being negative. Still, you can see some valid concerns expressed on these boards that do represent a (possibly significant) part of Shopify's merchant base. These insights are also important to note for investors.For example, one Shopify Partner wrote: ""I know that dropshippers or merchants connected with China are hit pretty bad.""Another poster shared: ""I sell expensive clothing to people going to large gatherings (Oktoberfest or German clubs) that happen for a season every year. 15 years in business. I assume this year will be devastating.""Also: ""My sales have been down the past 2-3 weeks, though my traffic has gone up. According to shopify my store's traffic is in the top 7% of stores that launched the same week as I did, back in fall of 2018. I have had less new customers making purchases. Most orders have been from loyal customers.""In many comments, merchants were also complaining about long shipment times and their inability to ship products to customers effectively. Some merchants are even pausing their stores to reduce the monthly fee.However, there are also some success stories, like this one: ""Our sales have gone up, so much we had to put our store in catalog mode to stop the orders from climbing.""Clearly, it's all about being in the ""right"" industry right now for online merchants; and not relying on international supply chains. The right industries have to be selling hygiene products, respiratory masks, groceries, pharmacies; basically, the essential items that are needed in this crisis. It's well documented that Amazon had no trouble shifting their focus on these items while still being more than utilized to capacity. It's a bit less clear how Shopify merchants will be doing as a whole.My feeling is that in the short- to mid-term Shopify will see a bit more revenue deceleration than in the past. However, as I'm writing this, I'm still wrestling with my conclusion: On the one hand, e-commerce has undoubtedly gained more importance and people are using online-services more than ever. On the other hand, Shopify already pulled its guidance, merchants seem to be quite negative, and, quite frankly, logic dictates that there has been a broad pull-back in non-essential consumer spending.In one word, there is a lot of uncertainty. Usually Wall Street doesn't like this. Which makes the recent share price surge a bit puzzling. [object HTMLElement]Just look at some other platform businesses, that are heavily dependent on usage fees. The difference in the valuation premium is quite astounding at the moment. To be clear, however, in my opinion, Wix.com (WIX) doesn't even hold a candle to Shopify competitively. Also, Square (SQ) is obviously one of the most hard-hit companies as it relates to their POS-business and only holds up because of a potentially booming Cash App.Still, if you are buying Shopify right now, you are paying 45 times their trailing sales. If you are considering that Shopify's gross margins are ""only"" around 55%, which puts its trailing EV to gross margin ratio to 82, the shares look even more overvalued at the moment. Actually, according to this metric, Shopify's shares have a higher valuation than Zoom (ZM), which has an EV to gross margin ratio of 78 (EV/S of 63.45 divided by gross margin of 81.47%).And this is on the background of Shopify probably just reaching their Q1 revenue targets (only because of strong January and February) and complete uncertainty as to how high revenue will be for the full year. As a reminder, the company guided for revenue in the range of $2.130 billion to $2.160 billion (between 35% and 36.9% year-on-year growth) in its Q4 2019 earnings release. In 2019, Shopify grew revenues at 47%; in 2018 growth was 59%. In all likelihood, revenue growth for 2020 will be below 35%, which brings the forward EV/S to at least 33 or higher. This is a high multiple in any circumstance, but especially so, in this time of economic uncertainty.I have been on the record on this site saying that valuation doesn't really matter in the long-term, and I stand by that assessment. For full disclosure, Shopify makes up a sizable position of my portfolio (8-9% at the moment) and I intend to hold that position until I see the business deteriorating meaningfully – and I do not consider the current coronavirus crisis as a business deterioration, regardless of how big its impact on Shopify may be.If you are asking yourself, why I decided to hold the shares, despite all my cautions in this article, there are a couple of reasons:Nevertheless, the valuation of shares considering the current environment doesn't make it a compelling investment at the moment. I understand that investors are flocking into quality investments who might have (relatively) more upside from the coronavirus crisis. Also, the comments by the CTO about increased traffic are great news. But considering that the company will most likely see decelerating growth under very high uncertainty, while the stock price and valuation are rising to all-time-highs – it simply doesn't add up.Shopify is a great company and, all in all, still a great investment. I would just urge readers not to fall to their FOMO at the moment. Remember when Tesla (TSLA) was priced at $900 a share and you probably thought: ""Oh god, if I don't buy it now I will totally miss it – this is the future!"" At least for now, that didn't turn out so well. I have a feeling it could be a similar situation with Shopify at the moment.My strategy is simply to sit on my hands and do nothing (a strategy that generally has served me quite well over the years and, so far, also during the COVID-crisis). If you have a knack for these things (I don't), it's probably a good time to move some of your money out of Shopify to other positions. If you can't resist your FOMO, it could be smart to keep the size of a new position small at this time.Please Follow, Like, and join the discussion in the comment section. Stay safe and healthy!"
4340044,105417,2020-04-27T07:45:00-04:00,"We estimate 37% Y/Y GMV growth, which we believe is fairly conservative.Solid gross margins to stay the course, with the transition to the online channel a strong success.We see another 20% upside to the stock in 2020, despite the fact that valuation is getting a bit rich.","Shopify (SHOP) is a gift that keeps on giving, despite its (somewhat unreasonable) valuation and despite the coronavirus-induced economic slump. As we enter another quarter and as bears believe that there is time for a massive pullback, we strongly caution: now is not the time. The online storefront model should continue to blossom in the short run and may take a breather only when physical retail locations once again establish a solid footing in the post-corona environment. In the meantime, we believe that at least a 20% upside is possible in the next three-six months. Below, we briefly analyze the basic business, discuss immediate catalysts, and then address a delicate balance of valuation and momentum. Shopify is a multi-channel commerce platform that builds mobile-based software that enables merchants to set up online storefronts with retail functionality. SHOP enables merchants to manage products and inventory, build customer relationships, and leverage analytics. Merchants use SHOP’s software across various sales channels, such as web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, and social network marketplaces.Successful Psychology of Beats and Raises: Over the last several quarter reports, we have seen the company successfully navigate between conservative guidance and aggressive analyst expectations, which led to positive stock traction, if not within the first 24 hours after each report, then definitely in the next several weeks. We expect this psychology to hold true this time as well, since the stay-at-home tailwinds are going to dissipate lingering doubts, should some arise, about the next several months and even quarters. Estimate 37% Y/Y GMV Growth - and That's Conservative: We expect continued double-digit GMV growth, with even traction across all three months of the first quarter (in other words, we do not expect growth to be largely skewed to pre-COVID January and February). Further, we expect this setup to continue in the coming quarters, perhaps decelerating a few percentage points, perhaps accelerating. We do not see investors penalizing the company for that: it is all about maintaining consistent double-digit growth. Recall, in 1Q growth was at 48%. One of the Easiest Models to Transition: In our view, Shopify merchants have one of the easiest models to transition their traditional brick-and-mortar business to the online channel, in light of COVID-19. This is a key differentiator against retail stores that are significantly underperforming the S&P 500 index. Longer term, we see Shopify expanding its current online solutions in support of the online model, which may inevitably lead to lessened brick-and-mortar presence, even if we are back to the status quo ante. This means that longer term, Shopify stands to enhance and solidify share gains against traditional stores. In our view, this viewpoint is largely driving what is increasingly becoming a very rich multiple. Not Seeing Much U.S. Saturation: International copycats were one of our fears in the past, especially within emerging markets. However, as time goes by, we are not seeing the same competitive pressures, as feared before. While new Shopify-type websites are popping up in the U.S. and especially in Europe, some with exactly the same interface, very few can cross the threshold of 1 MM users and pose even a small challenge to the company. Solid Gross Margin to Stay the Course: While upper 50’s has become the standard for Shopify’s top line gross margin story, we estimate that for 1Q margin has moved into a 60%+ territory and has a very good chance of averaging 65% for the entire 2020, despite coronavirus fears. Need More Color on SFN and Other Revenue Segments: We believe that management should spend more time discussing Shopify Fulfillment Network and delineate expected revenues in 2021-22. In general, as more uncertainties arise around the top line for the coming quarters, we believe that executives should be as specific as possible in providing guidance ranges. Withdrawing guidance is understandable, but we do not see it as the best course of action; rather, we are strong believers in widening guidance ranges on a per segment basis, such as SFN, while leaving plenty of room for margin of error. Investors in those cases will be less forgiving than when guidance is withdrawn altogether.Word of Caution - Terminated Merchants: In the same release, where the company withdrew its annual guidance, it provided the following update: ""In March, we terminated thousands of merchants charging unfair prices or making false claims about COVID-19-related items such as face masks or hand sanitizers."" We see this step as the greatest financial impact to SHOP's top line in the near term and we definitely need more information about 1) the future of these merchant relationships; 2) in case they don't come back (we assume they don't) - can we learn their revenue contribution from 2019?We see EV/revenue as the best valuation multiple in Shopify’s case, given the company’s focus on net merchant and add-ons growth. When we apply the multiple of ~28.5x to the 2020 revenue base, we see an estimate of $742. We rarely say this, but valuation multiples are secondary to the stock's momentum at this point. At the end of the day, the stock may pull back at some point, because the valuation multiple may not be sustainable at this level, but not before SHOP shares have more upside amidst the coronavirus madness. We see the following risks as potentially damaging SHOP’s business."
4335640,104783,2020-04-02T10:21:52-04:00,"Bulls say the number of new Shopify subscribers will soar in the next few months and I agree.If things go according to the plan, Shopify might benefit from these net new additions in the long term but there are many uncertainties involved.An increase in regulatory scrutiny can be expected in the coming months.Aggressive inputs were used in my model to come up with a bull-case target price for Shopify but even this number does not justify the current market price.","SourceThe idea of doing online business has intrigued me for years, but never could I ever get my head around to actually do something. While you may conclude that writing for Seeking Alpha is the same thing, I beg to differ. For me, I'm still doing what I used to do - nothing new. My sheer curiosity led me to Shopify, Inc. (SHOP) the website first, and the stock the next. I ended up loving the former. The latter, not so much. There's no denying that Shopify is a great growth story. The numbers are compelling and the company, so far, has defied every odds and continued to grow at double-digit rates. Now it's time for investors and analysts to gauge a measure of how Shopify would be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two schools of thought have emerged so far.After carefully analyzing both these possibilities, I find Shopify shares to be still overvalued. However, I expect a surge in the number of new accounts opened in the first quarter of 2020, which is in line with the expectations of Shopify bulls.I've been following Shopify for quite some time now. To my surprise, bearish articles on Shopify attract a lot of criticism from readers. What is even more shocking is that most of these readers try to highlight that Shopify is a great business and that the company will eventually grow its revenue and earnings. This, in my opinion, is a no-brainer. But, differentiating between a good company and a good investment is critical to be a successful investor in the long run.Charlie Munger once said:My investment thesis on Shopify can be summarized by using this very statement. Even though there's no question about how Shopify has turned the tables in favor of small and medium business owners, the risk-reward profile is not attractive for investors.Let's address the elephant in the room first. There's a common belief among Shopify bulls that there would be a surge in new registrations resulting from two developments.I can hardly argue with any of these facts. Both these are reasonable assumptions given that there's a very real possibility of a nation-wide lockdown. However, new subscribers might not lead to a surge in revenue for Shopify.Today, I visited the official website of Shopify to gauge a measure of what they are doing to fight COVID-19. Not surprisingly, the company has extended its 14-day free trial period to 90 days, likely in a bid to attract new clients.Source: ShopifyThere's no doubt that most of the new sellers will secure this free-trial extension, adding no incremental revenue to Shopify. However, in the long term, the company will benefit from the net new additions if these companies can be successful in building an online business. The hype around the expected surge in new business starts, however, can lead to a formation of a bubble that would burst once Shopify files the next couple of interim financial statements.For Shopify, realizing the expected benefits of new client additions will still be a challenge even in the long run. As much as we can be enthusiastic about more professionals wanting to do their own online businesses during these trying times, one should never forget that even the leading companies in the world are feeling the heat of COVID-19 already. Whether a new business can survive the onslaught of the pandemic is a big question mark. According to data from The Business Journals, more than 170,000 small businesses were shut down between 2008 and 2010.Shopify is making it very easy for an individual to become an entrepreneur. It would hardly take more than an hour to start a dropshipping business on Shopify. But, growing this to a steady stream of income is easier said than done.Ask from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executives and they will confirm that increased regulatory scrutiny can lead to a significant decline in operating margins. A few factors lead to such a phenomenon. First, there's a possibility of authorities imposing fines that run into millions of dollars. These fines, understandably, are a direct hit for the profitability of a company. Second, a company under increased scrutiny will have to implement strict guidelines to avoid hefty fines and potential restrictions from concerned regulators. For an internet-based company like Shopify, these costs will include hiring cybersecurity experts, developing systems to monitor fraudulent sellers, and investing in Artificial Intelligence-based processes to optimize security measures.Why do I believe Shopify will be the subject of increased supervision in the future?The spread of COVID-19 has given birth to a score of fraudulent merchants who try to capitalize on this opportunity to sell fake products. These scams are carried out over the internet, and Shopify has already become the number one place on the internet to set up shop and scam unassuming consumers. On March 24, The New York Times reported a rise in Shopify's new registrations with the word ""corona"" or ""COVID"" in their web addresses.Source: The New York TimesAccording to this report by the Times, the products sold on these new stores include;It doesn't come as a surprise that none of these products have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The below images, courtesy of the Times, will give an indication of how scammers are trying to victimize consumers.Source: The New York TimesThe Shopify management is seemingly doing everything they can to tackle these fraudsters and more than 4,500 stores have already been suspended in a bid to ensure consumer protection.Price-gouging is another obstacle that Shopify is trying to mitigate, but according to a recent report by Quartz, the company has so far been incompetent in achieving this objective. The report went on to highlight that two U.S. Senators are already pushing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate companies who do not even take rudimentary steps to enforce policies against price-gouging and the sale of fake products.There's a possibility of a regulatory crackdown on Shopify as well, which would prompt the company to invest millions of dollars to heighten security measures. This, in return, will not only dampen the investor sentiment but will also lead to an operating margin contraction. Not to forget, Shopify is a loss-making business that is already struggling to expand margins meaningfully despite double-digit growth in annual revenue for the best part of the last decade.Data by YChartsMany investors do not factor in the possibility of a decline in margins, but the chances are very real. Things won't look good for Shopify if the company is pushed into a corner where the only way out is to incur the additional costs to meet the demands of regulators.Even though an investor can argue that this would never happen, as investors, it's all about establishing a margin of safety before betting on a high-growth company to deliver the goods. Regulatory crackdowns are not uncommon. Think about what happened with Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the last couple of years. It's important to incorporate this into an earnings model to come up with a realistic target price, in my opinion.In analyzing the expected benefit to Shopify resulting from job cuts and an increase in new business starts, an investor should not leave behind the impact of a recession on the discretionary spending of consumers. Empirical evidence suggests that consumer spending will take a massive hit during a recession.Source: Trading EconomicsThe decline seen during the financial crisis-era will most likely be repeated if the U.S. enters a recession this year. Some believe that we have already entered a recession. On March 27, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said:Many companies have already started laying-off their employees as well. Air Canada (OTCQX:ACDVF), Avis Car Rental (NASDAQ:CAR), Norwegian Air (OTCPK:NWARF), Scandinavian Airlines, ZipCar, 20th Century Fox, Alley Theatre, Cineplex, Carlyle (NASDAQ:CG), Plaza Hotels, Four Seasons, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), and General Electric (NYSE:GE) are some of the noteworthy companies that have already cut its workforce as a result of reduced business activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There's more reason to worry. A survey conducted by Challenger, Gray & Christmas between March 20 and March 26 found out that 49% of U.S. companies are considering layoffs. We are surely headed toward rough seas.Can layoffs and an eventual decline in consumer spending have an impact on Shopify earnings?The impact, in my opinion, would be massive. Shopify earns commissions on sales completed on its platform so the company naturally benefits from an uptick in sales. But, during a recession, consumers reduce their spending on non-essential goods and services. This is where Shopify would be hurt. According to data from OmniKick, the majority of Shopify stores operate in the fashion and apparel sector. Only 7% of stores had a focus on food & beverage. This is not a good sign for the company as a recession will prompt consumers to forego their spending on fashion, electronics, and recreation.There are many risks looming on the horizon for Shopify. As a company that benefits from the success of small businesses, Shopify might face significant challenges in the future to grow. However, Mr. Market remains oblivious to this fact. Shopify shares have outperformed the broad market by a healthy margin so far this year.Data by YChartsThis is a reflection of investor sentiment toward Shopify and the expectation that the company would provide better returns than most of the S&P 500 companies. However, I beg to differ. The next 12 months, as far as I see, would be difficult for the company, resulting from a significant decline in the share price. Even after factoring in 60% annual revenue growth for the next 5 years and an improvement in operating margins to 25% in the long run, my target price remains below $300, signaling a downside of more than 30%. I used aggressive revenue growth figures in my model to see where the company would go in the bull-case scenario. For instance, even though my estimate for annual revenue growth in the next 5 years is 60%, revenue growth has decelerated to 47% in 2019 from 95% in 2015.Shopify has changed the way how small businesses operate. More importantly, the platform has enabled small-scale entrepreneurs to reach for the stars by exposing their products and services to a much larger customer base than they could have ever thought possible. But, I can't seem to find a reason to rationalize a price/sales multiple of over 30 for a company that is still struggling to bring in positive earnings even after a massive surge in revenue over the last 8 years.I remain on the sidelines for a better opportunity to invest in Shopify.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4336739,98236,2020-04-08T16:53:22-04:00,"Last week, Shopify withdrew its guidance, and the shares plunged 10%.The shares are now down 35% from peak levels reached in the wake of a particularly strong Q4.The withdrawal of guidance is neither surprising or alarming - this company's revenue base is derived from e-commerce sales that have likely declined along with employment and payroll income.The shares are still not cheap using traditional valuation formulas such as EV/S and free cash flow margins.But many investors, and in particular institutions, find owning a category leader in an attractive category a worthwhile strategy because of elements in the investment picture that are difficult to quantify.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.I first heard about Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) back in early 2016. The company had first sold shares to the public the prior May, and the IPO was languishing. It was a new category for me, and one that seemed to make lots of sense. And it seemed a little odd-ball with a very passionate CEO who wore what I might describe as an engineer cap and enormous glasses at all times and who apparently began writing code before he was 12. The company was founded in a coffee shop in Ottawa and still maintains its headquarters in Canada's capital in a rather quirky building that suits the personality of the company, although much of its operations are in Waterloo, Ontario.At the time I first came to learn about the company, its revenue run rate was all of $300 million, and it was unprofitable and cash flow breakeven. And it was in hyper-growth mode with revenues expanding at around triple-digit rates. I bought my first shares that spring at a price just over $30/share, after the company launched its IPO at $17 and started trading at $28. It was a bit of a shot in the dark - I had no idea of just how large the category would become, and how much innovation the company would be able to pack into a few years.It is an old investing adage that one of the hardest parts of investing is holding on to a position. I confess, although I traded around my holding, by the end of 2018, after defending the company and the shares from the less than prescient comments of the wicked lemon man, I finally took my profits - just before the shares began their seminal spike. And since that time, while I have commented about the company, I haven't been quite tempted to reenter the name, always afraid of its lofty valuation that proceeded to get loftier more or less after each quarter, with one short-lived exception.Last week, after the end of the quarter, Shopify preannounced its results, to the extent of commenting that it anticipated that the momentum seen at the start of 2020 had been adequate to insure that the company would achieve results for its 1st quarter either within or ahead the range of expectations that the company provided when it released Q4 earnings on February 12th.One of the hall marks of the panic of 2020 is its lack of discrimination or perhaps better said, the unwillingness of investors to ""look through"" the current period and try to assess the likely outlook of different companies with the return to normalcy. To a certain extent, it is as though a scythe had been set to level just about all stock valuations. And almost all news from companies has been considered bad news, and that included the press release from Shopify last week in which it reaffirmed guidance for Q1 operations and withdrew full year guidance. That announcement, which could hardly have been unanticipated by any observer of SHOP or the state of the economy, hit the shares hard when it was made with a drop of 10% on Thursday, April 2nd. I am not too sure what the company might have said that would have had a more positive impact. With that pullback in mind, I have decided to revisit the case for buying or avoiding Shopify shares. To cut to the chase here - the shares will still not screen the way most people look at EV/S ratios and free cash flow margins. It is still expensive in looking at ""consensus"" numbers. No doubt, as well, the consensus will be dropping.One of the more puzzling aspects of this period is the inability of some analysts to evaluate what they hear and what they see. Recently, Raymond James pulled its purchase recommendation on SHOP shares because of the impact of the economy on demand trends. Really! Given that management pulled its guidance last week because of the uncertainties in the economy, I wonder just what kind of value add RJ is offering by talking about its street low estimates. Most reasonable analysts would not try to recalibrate expectations when the company itself cannot do so. Should analysts and investors evaluate companies on their performance during this period which probably is likely to come to an end in a few weeks. I personally find such analysis bizarre or something worse. Analysis like to be instrumental in creating transactions - that is how most of them are paid, after all - but they ought to be instrumental in creating potentially money making investment scenarios.I do expect that the current Q2 and Q3 consensus estimates which continue to show growth of 30% will need revision - but by how much I do not know. And even less clear for anyone thinking about such things is the potential cadence of a recovery. And if you aren't forward looking, I wonder what good you are for your clients.Again, I find it impossible to quantify something quite so indeterminate as the cadence of a recovery. SHOP shares were presumably punished once for withdrawing guidance - I find it to be exceptionally off putting for an analyst to base his recommendation on something that was press - released a week earlier and for him to pretend to know something he cannot. Did the man think that the guidance withdrawal was to be taken as anything other than an acknowledgement that today's business climate would lead to lower operating results?But valuation, particularly for a company with the attributes of Shopify, has components in evaluating the shares that go quite a ways beyond taking consensus numbers and laying them into some DPV formula. The inability, or lack of desire to try that exercise, on the part of many commentators has left them without a way to evaluate the likely future progress of the shares which have a rather mixed pattern of ratings for such a premier high-growth name. The purpose of this article is to attempt to make the case beyond standard quantitative measures as to why some investors will find Shopify an attractive investment at its currently reduced valuation.Shopify shares are still relatively expensive - the premium valuation compared to average hasn't changed much, if at all, because most names in the IT space are down something like the 34% loss which has hit SHOP shares. With an EV/S of about 17X, before adjustments (I will explain below), the company's shares are valued about 30% above average for its growth cohort in the low 40% range - although given recent volatility that percentage can change and has changed on an almost daily basis. The company did turn the corner with regards to free cash flow this past year, when that metric reached a 2% margin partially because of the significant growth in stock-based comp. and partially because of the exceptionally strong Q4 results. But that 2% margin is just average for the company's growth cohort, and I am not sure if it will be maintained - in fact, had the pandemic and the economic crisis not supervened, 2020 would have been a year of significant investment for SHOP that might have brought free cash flow margins to zero.The positive case for the shares, at least for me, is that the company continues to dominate its space both through technology/functionality advantages and through marketing, which has made the company the de-facto standard for new online shopping ventures. Most independent/3rd party developers are comfortable with the SHOP platform - in the latest conference call, the company had indicated that its population of 3rd party developers had expanded by one-third over the past year, and so, too, are most entrepreneurs these days. The company has self-evidently been able to monetize that positioning by offering a plethora of additional services such as shipping, payments, capital, and a POS capability. The success of these offerings was very visible last quarter and constitutes a major reason to anticipate that the company will achieve stronger growth than some have anticipated for years into the future.But a significant component of the positive case is the company's foray into fulfillment, both through its internally developed solution and through the opportunities that are being created through the acquisition of 6 River Systems. I do not want to suggest that I have some specific knowledge of what the cadence of revenue growth might be for Shopify fulfillment services. When the company announced the outline of its plan in this space last June, the announcement led to a noticeable appreciation in the shares in the following two months. I will simply note here that fulfillment is a very large potential market, and that Fulfillment by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key part of that business model. See this link to a 3rd party market research firm as to market size. That's the TAM for what Shopify intends in this space is perhaps larger as it includes more components, including robotics. No doubt this initiative will be retarded by the impact of the virus - but again, this is an article dealing with a recommendation based on what the author foresees after the end of the virus and its impacts on the world economy.Try as I might, I cannot make the numbers ""come out"" in terms of saying the shares are a must buy at current levels, both absolute and relative. But I am inclined to believe they will produce positive alpha once the impact on the economy of Covid-19 recedes. From a quantitative point of view that is, because the initiatives this company has invested in over some period of time are starting to bear fruit and are likely to lead to faster growth than the company had been forecasting and that analysts had been estimating before the impact of the economy upended all estimates. But beyond that, no one can readily know just how much Shopify's fulfillment network will contribute to growth. It is really far too soon to try to evaluate the value of the fulfillment capability to the overall franchise.It may seem heretical to say this, but this writer, after years of experience, might suggest to readers that in a situation like this, one is required to forsake simple quantitative valuation parameters in trying to establish a recommendation. Most institutions I have dealt with over the years will establish their portfolios with core positions in mind, and these core positions offer institutions some hard to quantify advantages as investments such as execution capability, a visionary management, business consistency, transparency, a sound strategy and leadership in their space. These factors simply can't be accurately translated into either a long-term growth rate forecast, or to a specific free cash flow margin expectation. That is why it is possible for two writers on SA to publish articles on the same subject, Slack (NYSE:WORK), on the same day with one finding the shares over-valued by 34% and the other believing the shares to have 54% upside. About the best I can do is to suggest that the aggressive reversion to mean estimates for SHOP's hyper-growth will prove to be inaccurate.With these qualitative factors in mind, the 30% premium that the SHOP shares currently command in terms of notional valuation in their space would seem likely justified. I do not own SHOP shares at this moment, and buying them will be an opportunistic exercise in my portfolio. Not all readers like trying to square circles or use qualitative measures to account for what might be conceived to be valuation anomalies. But my guess is that looking out over a reasonable time scale, SHOP shares are going to achieve positive alpha and return to what might seem to many to be hyper-elevated valuation.Needless to say, at this point, the forward calculation of EV/S will wind up being higher, and cash flow may be less than what I have projected. The company has preannounced that Q1 will see numbers that were within or above the guidance range, but the next 2 quarters will certainly see some sales impact compared to the still unchanged consensus revenue estimates (other than those of RJ at this point), and I have no better crystal ball with regards to the precise shape of the recovery in the economy which I hope will start before the end of Q3 than anyone else - and the economy has to be far more benign than its current position to reignite growth for Shopify.But I left my forecast numbers in place, simply because they present a guide to relative valuation. What has and will happen to Shopify in terms of its operational performance will happen to most other vendors besides a fortunate few whose focus is in the work-at-home, or cyber security areas. And when the recovery comes, the same phenomenon will lift all boats. As to my 3-year growth estimate of 42% - I think it remains as likely today as it was 2 months ago. The economic impact of the virus is a one time event and will not change the propensity of people to buy on the web or the other factors that animate SHOP's demand.Just to be clear, Shopify gets around 64% of its revenues from what it calls Merchant Solutions, and those revenues are mainly driven by the level of Gross Merchandise Volume transacted on the platform. No one imagines that Shopify's sellers have not been disrupted by the economic turmoil engendered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Just how much their volume has dropped is not knowable at this point - Shopify's terse notification last week was mum on any specifics. That said, it is worth noting that while GMV rose by 47% in the last quarter, Merchant Solutions revenue rose by 53%. It is that difference which represents the success of the SHOP strategy of selling more services to its base, including payments capital and shipping. There was a reason for the share price spike in the wake of the company's quarterly report - and it was seen by this set of statistics.The quarter that SHOP reported in mid-February was a blow-out regardless of how that overworked expression might be defined. Revenue growth reaccelerated, and the company substantially exceeded its prior forecast for profitability. Free cash flow was also strong.Regardless of how the specifics of Q1 have played out - and really regardless of any specific expectations for Q2 and perhaps Q3 as well, the quantitative component of the investment case for the shares is pretty solidly contained in the success of the strategy illustrated by the above results as well as the results detailed below in terms of Subscription Solutions growth. What investors are buying into with SHOP is not what many think of as a platform to support smaller new web sites from opportunistic micro-merchants. The hyper-growth of this company is coming because it is selling more solutions to its cohorts of larger merchants. And that is highly likely to return once the pandemic eases and the economy starts to return to a more normal state.Shopify gets the balance of its revenues from what are basically charges for its software which in turn drive Monthly Recurring Revenues. MRR grew 32% last quarter to $54 million while overall Subscription Solutions revenue grew by 37%. This difference is perhaps more significant than many commentators, particularly on the SA platform have apprehended in that it is driven by higher sales of software to existing users - perhaps the most profitable component of the overall SHOP offering. It is also part of SHOP's pivot to larger merchants who typically use the Plus platform, which has materially higher software charges than those incurred by what some people think of as the typical SHOP customer.As many readers will know, last summer, Shopify acquired 6 River Systems. This is one of the building blocks of the company's strategy to provide fulfillment for its merchants. When the 6 River deal was announced, and SHOP talked about its ambitions in fulfillment, the shares jumped - basically because of the track record this company has had in terms of execution and the size of the fulfillment opportunity. That was not a factor in revenues last quarter - it will not be a factor in revenues this quarter, and realistically, the economic turmoil engendered by the pandemic is going to set back the cadence of the progress on the fulfillment initiative by several quarters. There is no way around this - the pandemic will play hob with the expectations investors have built for this company with regards to at least the next 1-2 quarters. But equally, the pandemic does not change the strong momentum the company experienced in Q4 or in the first months of H1-2020. And the pandemic certainly will have no impact on the outlook for SHOP's growth or profitability over the coming years as the economic impact of the pandemic recedes.The negative case for SHOP relates to perceptions that the company is built to acquire lots of low end merchants who resell merchandise from the far east and who constantly churn. That just isn't the company's strategy these days - it never was, really. The company is focused on providing its merchants with a rather complex set of different components needed to operate a successful e-commerce business. And in particular, it has focused on national brands who spend large sums on the Plus platform. In fact, Plus is the foundation for e-commerce web sites of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Unilever (NYSE:UL), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) amongst a rather lengthy list of household brand icons. Much of the future of this company will be its success in working with additional brands, and in upselling its existing brands on new features.Yes, SHOP has a basic platform for merchants to create a site and offer products and services. And that alone is a substantial opportunity that the company continues to dominate. But that would not be nearly enough for me to recommend the shares. But by this point in time, the Basic Shopify offering is of less relevance in terms of the financial health of the company. Currently, Shopify is averaging $2200/year/user, which is both a function of the rising average GMV per user, coupled with users buying more services, and with users opting for the Plus offering where pricing starts at $2000/month and includes users spending $1 million/year on Shopify services.Shopify Payments, which is now about 5 years old as an offering, continues to grow at rates higher than average for this company. Payments processed rose 52% last quarter - but it is still only 43% of GMV so it has a long runway of opportunity.Shopify has been building a Capital capability that in some ways is similar to the Capital capability offered by Square (NYSE:SQ). At this stage, Capital is still a small venture relative to Square (less than 20% measured by loan originations), but it is growing at triple-digit rates. Last year, Capital advances rose to $430 million, which almost doubled the cumulative total of advances, which is now $885 million. The company now has a program that allows non-Shopify merchants to access the company's Capital offering. The Capital business, as it is for both SHOP and for SQ, is exceptionally profitable due to very high interest rates, modest loan loss exposure, and rapid repayment duration based mainly on Shopify payments. As the saying goes, ""nice work if you can get it.""Shopify offers its merchants a shipping capability. Last year, shipping solutions were adopted by 45% of the company's installed base, up from 40% the prior year. Basically, because of the company's scale, it shipping solutions offer its users a less costly alternative than would be the case if they contracted directly with transport firms. In addition, shipping comes with profile and insurance capabilities that have proven to be attractive for merchants.As mentioned above, Shopify Plus, has been, is, and will be one of the main strategic directions of this company. One of the key reasons why institutions own these shares relates to wanting to play the e-commerce revolution. If an investor wants that, Plus is perhaps the most important offering in that world these days.Shopify Plus is something I have written about several times in the past, and it continues to be a substantial growth driver. I think, by this time, it ought to fairly obvious that Plus is a major pivot for this company, and that its customers have markedly different characteristics when compared to those using the company's standard platform. Last quarter, new Plus brands included KitchenAid, Panama Jack and Cirque du Soleil as well as some stars who offer merchandise on their own web site. Plus continues to outgrow the rest of the company, and it now contributes 27% to MRR and a higher percentage to total Merchant Solutions revenues. Indeed, it was the premium platform fees that SHOP Plus customers pay that lead to subscription revenue rising at 37%, compared to the 32% growth for MRR in Q4. Plus had been scheduled to get a major refresh this year which would have added a significant additional layer of feature/functionality; that may be on hold in this environment. There are other enhancements to Plus which include capabilities called Flow (basically a library of templates that speed up the process of creating an e-commerce store), B2B, and Handshake, a recent acquisition which enhances the capability of Plus in the wholesale market.The company has also developed some significant ancillary services it offers to its merchants including digital marketing features such as E-mail, Chat and ad buying tools. None of these elements by themselves are needle moving, but providing them on a single platform along with the core Shopify functionality makes the overall platform more competitive and provides some additional points of revenue growth.Despite my own doubts on the matter, I have to mention the company's initiatives in the POS field. Shopify has offered a POS solution in the market since 2014 - many of its merchants have both an online store as well as a physical location. The company has now made some investment in a direct sales channel with some fairly promising results primarily expressed in terms of accelerating growth of GMV. The company had been preparing to launch an all-new internally developed POS product.Finally, international expansion has been another significant growth driver for this company, and there is every reason to believe that the company will continue to see its international revenues grow faster than the company average. Localization can be a tedious process - but one likely to yield outsize returns. Overall, the company increased its percentage of international based sellers from 24% to 29%, although the international revenue component is quite a bit less at this point.At this point, I am not going to try to develop a scenario or estimates based on SHOP's fulfillment initiative. It is going to be the company's most important initiative over the next 5 years, according to management. The company has committed a $1 billion investment to building a fulfillment capability. At this stage, it is in very nascent shape, with volumes barely exceeding 7 figures, and I am not at all sure just how specific plans may have been disrupted by reaction to the public health problems and the economic impact of the virus. But what happens these next several weeks will likely be made up over a multi-year span. I expect that fulfillment by Shopify will be mainly a cost sink for at least the next year - 18 months, before it starts to move the needle on the company's growth rate. When analysts or investors want to build models, some significant revenue expectations are probably in order to account for the fulfillment initiative. Trying to quantify something such as this for which there is no experience, and for which the ultimate offering has yet to emerge would not be a worthwhile undertaking. About as much as I can write at this point is that forecasting a growth rate contraction for this company, both because of fulfillment and all of the other growth drivers mentioned above, does not seem, at least to me, to be reasonable.There are have been very few places to hide in this market - the so-called safety stocks have had their issues, and most IT shares have seen crushing declines. Of course, there have been a couple of exceptions, but that is part of the issue. Investors have chosen to focus on names that are benefiting from the lock-downs and shelter-in-place regulations brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. They have also decided that cloud based cyber security companies constitute a fairly safe investment strategy. Everything else is seeing its valuation destroyed without much thought or discrimination - and that now includes Shopify.Shopify's competition hasn't changed all that much over the years - somewhat surprisingly, no one has made an attempt to mimic the company's strategy or feature/function set. The largest competitor to Shopify is probably Magneto which is owned by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). There have been some acquisition pains since that transaction closed. Magneto is not a hosted solution - and thus, while it may seem to be a SHOP competitor, in the realities of the world, it is not. For those interested in the latest comparison, I have linked here to a 3rd party evaluation (Shopify vs Magento Open Source (2019): Which Is the Absolute Best?). Square bought a competitor called Weebly some time ago - it has not since really reported in detail on the results of that acquisition. For a different look from a 3rd party evaluator, see this article.These articles are intended for small business users and start-ups. None of them consider Shopify Plus. The best of the competitors rated was a provider called BigCommerce. That said, it ranks far below Shopify in terms of user satisfaction and functionality (see ""BigCommerce vs Shopify | Which One Do 88% of Users Recommend?"").Competition has never really been at issue in evaluating Shopify's prospects, and that really remains the case. If investors want to own an investment that is best of breed in the e-commerce world and will provide them with exposure to the growth of that business segment, Shopify has been and remains the logical choice. That is one of the reasons why it has and, most likely, will continue to enjoy a premium multiple whose support cannot really be captured by some kind of EV/S ratio or a DCF price target.Although Shopify has a revenue run rate of over $2 billion, it is still in investment mode. If investors want and expect 40% top-line growth, then heavy investment in opex simply has to be the norm, and this is particularly true as this company embarks on its most ambitious investment project to date with regards to building a complete logistic offering.Given that Shopify is a vendor whose results are tied to e-commerce volumes, its results are quite seasonal with Q4 the high-point of the year, and Q1 the trough in terms of revenues. Since opex is not particularly seasonal in nature, this causes massive swings in quarterly opex ratios. This was particularly in evidence in Q4, where revenues exceeded expectations and drove an outsize increase in earnings. Even had the virus not supervened, I would have anticipated that the company would have stepped up opex spending to maintain levels of planned profitability and avoid the size of the upside that was generated in Q4.For the year as a whole, gross margins on a GAAP basis were essentially consistent at around 55%. There is a tendency for GMs to be constrained because the company is experiencing faster growth in merchant solutions than in subscription revenues, and subscription revenue gross margins are close to 80%, while merchant solution gross margins are 38%. This was offset last year by some noticeable leverage at scale, with subscription gross margins climbing 200 basis points.The company achieved some operating leverage as well - probably stronger than it planned for. In particular, while research and development expenses climbed by over 50% year on year on a GAAP basis, the sales and marketing expense ratio fell by more than 250 basis points to less than 30%. The general and administrative expense category for the year was 11%, somewhat worse than 10% ratio the prior year. Overall, GAAP operating expenses climbed 46%, while revenues rose by 47%. The year-to-year changes in expense ratios were essentially similar for GAAP and non-GAAP ratios. Q4 was a bit of an anomaly because of a one-time spike in general and administrative costs.The company had been forecast in its guidance that its adjusted operating income metric to fall from about 3% of revenues to around zero, due to a year of strong investments. For the most part, and aside from one-time anomalies, this company has consistently beaten its targets for operational performance. But regardless of how that would have gone before the impact of the economy and the virus, it is highly unlikely that this company will have positive operating income this year.As I mentioned at the outset, using traditional valuation measures will leave investors scratching their head on making a positive case for SHOP shares, even after their 30%+ pullback.The last time we looked at this name, it was the leading vendor in providing users with an e-commerce platform. That hasn't changed, and it gives no sign of changing. The company had actually seen a growth reacceleration, but that attainment was certainly baked into valuations at that point when the shares reached just short of $600/share. Now, more than 30% lower, and with an uncertain current outlook, the bet seems a bit better to us, and worse to others. We understand that any company whose revenues are based on commerce across its platform is likely to take a hit because of constrained retail sales during a period of widespread and rising unemployment. On the other hand, that hit is not unique or different for this company than other names in the IT space, and it is highly unlikely to be long term in nature.The company's institutional holders, who own 73% of the shares do so because Shopify is the premier company in the e-commerce space, and it has advantages in terms of consistent performance, visibility and a skilled management team with a record of making business investments that resonate with users. The foray into fulfillment is a further opportunity whose dimensions are not really readily known at this point.This company has a plethora of initiatives, and not all of them will be equally successful. At this time, I think the continued success of the Plus platform and international expansion are most likely to attain outsize success. With the shares down 35% from their 52-week high, based on a prudent withdrawal of forward guidance, I think this is an excellent entry level, and I expect to see positive alpha for this company going forward."
4338530,103501,2020-04-20T10:29:04-04:00,"Shopify has been on a tear over the past year and now trades at 43.4x sales.The valuation might be getting overdone at this point, in my opinion, as Shopify's valuation is starting to approach Microsoft or Amazon's bubbly valuations during the dot-com bubble.Even if Shopify had net income margins of 10% (which is well above Amazon's 3.4% 3-year average), Shopify would still be trading at 434x P/E.In order to grow sales 10x in 10 years and be priced more reasonably, Shopify would need amazing (but not impossible) compound growth of 25.9% per year. Amazon's average 10-year growth rate was 27.6%.Canada's TSX-60 index has a history of creating bubbles driven in part by momentum tilt in the relatively small market-cap weighted index.","Shopify (SHOP) has been on a tear over the past year which has launched it into being one of Canada's top three company's by market cap, trading above many century-old banks and railways, despite Shopify having yet to post a profitable year. The COVID-19 pandemic has helped feed the fire of Shopify's potential recently with more consumers shopping online and businesses needing to set up an online e-commerce presence to stay relevant. The market is caught up with Shopify's potential, giving the company a valuation of 43.4x price-to-sales (P/S). The valuation might be getting overdone at this point, in my opinion, as it is starting to approach Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) bubbly valuations seen during the dot-com bubble as this article will discuss. It might be time for investors to consider taking some profits at this level.Data by YChartsWith Shopify's P/S ratio now above 40x, its valuation is starting to resemble what was seen during the dot-com bubble. For comparison purposes, I have put the P/S ratio of Amazon and Microsoft below stretching back to this frothy period. This is not to say that Shopify is not a good company with great growth prospects ahead, but at these valuations, the implied growth rate is enormous and will be hard to live up to as this article will discuss. Investors also need to remember that just like a lot of tech companies back in the dot-com bubble, Shopify has yet to post an annual profit, so the ratio at which sales will convert into net income is still any analysts' best guess.Data by YChartsI have chosen to compare Shopify to Amazon and Microsoft throughout this article. Amazon represents the more direct competitor of the two operating in e-commerce and fulfillment with low margins while Microsoft represents the thick margin IT services business. In my opinion, Shopify's net income margin will probably settle closer to that of Amazon's given the company's mix of both IT services and more physical services such as fulfillment.As Shopify is unprofitable, we have to analyze the company in terms of price-to-sales. Most retailer investors are more familiar with price-to-earnings, so it is important to understand how the two ratios are intertwined. If a company's net income margin was unrealistically 100%, sales and net income would be equal. If a company's net income margin was a more normal 10% of sales, then that company's P/E ratio would mathematically be 10x the P/S ratio (100% of sales/10% net income margin).So, let's imagine for a moment that Shopify was profitable at last year's $1,578M sales level with 10% net income margins. What would Shopify's P/E ratio look like at this level? For comparison purposes, I will also show this same analysis with both Microsoft and Amazon's average net income margins over the past 3 years.Source data from MorningstarThe results are not too pretty indicating that Shopify would be trading at 434x P/E if the company was able to generate net income margins of 10%. Even at Microsoft's high average net income margins of 23.3%, Shopify would still trade at 186.7x P/E given the company's current sales. With more retailer-like margins of 3.4% in line with Amazon, Shopify would be trading at a very large 1,280.9x P/E.I will discuss growth more later in the article, but first, let's imagine for a moment that Shopify's revenues were 10x higher than the 2019 $1,578M amount at $15,780M and see what their P/E ratio would be at the same levels of profitability. As can be seen below, the results would still not be that great with an 18.7x P/E in the best-case version of Shopify being able to achieve Microsoft's net income margins and a still very high 128.1x with Amazon's lower retailer margins.Keep in mind that all of these comparisons would be assuming Shopify could instantly achieve this profitability today and do not take into account the present value factor that this profitability will be achieved years in the future. To grow sales 10x from $1,578M to $15,780M, in say 10 years, would imply amazing compound growth of 25.9% per year. While this type of growth is not impossible, as witnessed by Amazon's 27.6% growth over the past 10 years, it is certainly not easy to accomplish.Ideally, a company with a high P/S valuation will grow into that valuation as sales growth is achieved and the P/S valuation metric is naturally reduced. Unfortunately, in Spotify's case, this does not seem to be the case as sales are constantly being valued at higher and higher valuations as can be seen in the graph below. This trend is not sustainable and, at some point, will need to reverse itself.Data by YChartsNotably, growth rates are also slowing at Shopify. This is expected due to the law of large numbers which states that growth becomes harder to achieve as the actual dollar figures get larger and the market becomes more saturated. With growth rates of 46.9% in the most recent quarter over the prior-year quarter, Shopify is still growing at a nice clip. However, that growth is expected to continue to taper off with the company's management forecasting fiscal year 2020 revenues of $2.13B to $2.16B (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) for a growth rate of 35.9% at the mid-point. Keeping Shopify's recent growth rates in mind, the previously mentioned 25.9% compound average rate needed over the next 10 years to grow sales 10x should be viewed cautiously.Canada has a history of homegrown bubbles in new up-and-coming companies operating in sexy industries. From Nortel Networks to Valeant Pharmaceuticals (corporate rebrand to Bausch Health (BHC)), to Blackberry (NYSE:BB), Canada has seen its share of bubbles over the past couple of decades. For full disclosure, I am a Canadian, so there is no bias being said here from a foreigner. We are a small country and the Toronto Stock Exchange - TSX 60 can quickly be taken control of by momentum tilt which can present itself in market cap-weighted indices. The TSX 60 is normally, as it is currently, weighted heavily to financials (32.5%) and energy (14.1%), so when technology or other new exciting opportunity presents itself, the investing public tends to jump all over it. As 4.9%, Shopify represents the majority of Canada's main index exposure to Information Technology which is only 8.9%.Shopify's current valuation above 40x P/S is starting to look aggressive, in my opinion. The average growth rates that will need to be maintained over the next decade in order to bring valuations back to reality are suggesting the company is going to achieve Amazon-style growth. However, even if sales growth is achieved with Amazon's 3.4% net income margin, this will still leave a company trading at around 128x P/E in 10 years' time. With the P/S ratio rising and growth rates declining, investors might want to consider taking some profits at current levels.If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more of my work, click the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page to receive notifications when I post a new article!"
4334975,69905,2020-03-30T12:24:28-04:00,So far Shopify's shares have rapidly bounced back. But its underlying operations make this stock a dangerous investment.Dissecting its business model shows that its growth rate is about to start unraveling.Shopify's operating leverage cuts both ways.Why investors should look to lock in gains now.,"Shopify (SHOP) has rapidly soared these past several weeks as traders' fear for missing out on a market recovery has led them back towards popular names.Nonetheless, I contend that indiscriminately buying any stock will lead to a permanent loss of capital.I assert that Shopify is remarkably overvalued, and investors would do well to reconsider their investment. Here's why:For the sake of transparency, I've been shouting wolf for so long on Shopify, all the while the stock has continued to increase, irrespective of valuation.What's more, at the same time, my own portfolio (as you can see at the bottom), has dramatically sold off these past several weeks.So why should you listen to me? Because Shopify is not as well-positioned as many have been led to believe. What's more, its business model is particularly badly positioned to navigate a global recession.Meanwhile, companies are strong and will withstand the downturn significantly better than Shopify.Please observe Shopify's growth trajectory in the past few years:Source: author's workNarrative aside, looking at the facts, we can clearly see that growth was already rapidly tapering off. Furthermore, looking ahead to this year, we can see that Shopify's guidance was pointing towards its revenue growth rate finishing at close to 37% in 2020.Now, let's dissect this growth rate further. We know that Shopify commands a premium stock valuation based on two assumptions:1) It's a high growth business;2) It has substantial visibility into its revenues.Going back to the graph above, we can see that Shopify's high-end of its revenue guidance means that it is expected to finish 2020 with 37% growth.However, now note, it is expected to grow in Q1 2020 at north of 39 percent, which implies that towards the latter half of 2020, Shopify is expecting to grow at less than 37% so that its growth rate should average 37% for the year.Shareholders will declare that Shopify is guiding conservatively to all for sandbagging, but that's not the case here.Critically, Shopify's business model is very well positioned towards strong operating leverage. But its operating leverage cuts both ways.Source: Slide 18In simple terms, as long as merchants continue to seek out its platform, with growing numbers, Shopify sells these merchants mostly monthly subscription solutions as well as onboarding value-adding services.Can you see above how the amount of revenue from monthly recurring sources continues to fall as the quarters go by? How Shopify is increasingly reliant on other revenue sources to grow its revenue?Source: annual report, page 11As this graph demonstrates, the revenue growth comes from new merchants joining the platform. Indeed, we can see that pre-2017 merchants are not driving the revenue growth forward. Put another way, the pre-2017 merchants on the platform are plateauing (as the red arrows show).But what happens during a recession to the number of new merchants? Doesn't this directly impact Shopify's revenue growth rate?Investors were willing to pay a significant premium for Shopify's stock, based on the fact that its revenues growth rates had strong predictability. What investors were weighing in and thinking was that Shopify had a very resilient business model, however, that's not the case.It is in fact, just a very clever approach to growing its revenues by increasing the number of merchants adopting its platform and then aggressively selling them expensive value-added services. But this works well, until a global recession hits.Put another way, Shopify's steady and predictable growth rates, are an illusion. Merchants that stay on the platform for prolonged periods are seeing no significant benefit as depicted by their lackluster growth seen in the pre-2017 cohort.Furthermore, as more and more merchants join the platform, there is an increased likelihood of them cannibalizing each other's product offerings. After all, consumers will mostly shop for the same products on price!Shopify is a very interesting investment that symbolizes the animal spirits of the bull market of the last decade.Whereas value investors were playing it safe, by buying cheap companies with strong cash flows, investors become intoxicated with high growth rhetoric, without truly asking the difficult questions, such as how successful will Shopify be in monetizing its platform? And has that already been priced in?The risk-reward of staying invested in Shopify while it's priced with a $50 billion market cap, is rapidly turning negative. Shopify is one month away from reporting its Q1 2020 results -- stay tuned."

Just as a disclosure, I have always maintained that Shopify’s business model (catering mostly to small businesses that sell discretionary products based on impulsive buying) is bound to be impacted negatively as the buyers change their buying behaviours and become wiser in their online buying habits.Further research led me to believe that Shopify has a very interesting combination of both positives and negatives running for it. As a result, I decided to conduct further research and present my research in an article that addresses the questions I have been receiving.The article is primarily a set of questions and answers that address Shopify’s position as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. It starts with an explanation of why we are facing a serious economic depression for the foreseeable future, proceeds with the answers to the questions of what is going for or against Shopify and concludes with a summary of what Shopify’s prospects are.What we faced in the last couple of months with the COVID-19 pandemic is a black swan event that a very limited number of people expected. One of these people is Bill Gates in his Ted 2015 talk about The Next Outbreak. I do encourage you to see this short video and how Bill Gates was successful in predicting, in 2015, what we are currently facing.Every investor is now rushing to try to understand how to handle this situation and its impact on their investments. Provided that many of the investors in the current market were not active investors during the last downturn of 2008, confusion is prevailing and over-reaction is the name of the game now.Source: Wikipedia, as of 2020/03/09; Charts change regularlyThis event that we are now facing is potentially the biggest health calamity that the human race has faced since the middle ages plague. This virus is very unique because:The above characteristics of the virus would cause an unprecedented economic impact on the world. I believe that ending up with a global recession is an under-estimation and expect that the next two quarters will experience a cumulative drop in GDP that would put last century’s Great Depression to shame.In addition, I do not believe that the economic stimuli that governments around the world are adopting will be the permanent solution for this depression. The stimuli would help ease the pain for employed individuals and failed businesses, but the long-term ramifications would be seriously damaging to the world economy, and the recovery from this damage would not be fast. This may be the topic of another article that talks about the long-term economic impact of the economic stimuli on the world economy.To summarize, this paper assumes that we are heading into the most serious global depression that the modern world economy has ever experienced.The answers to the following questions are mostly speculation based on many years of experience and extensive research. Only time will tell if the answers below are correct or not. Unless specified otherwise, the answers pertain to the next three reporting periods.What do you expect will happen with Shopify's GMV and Merchant Solutions?I expect that the GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) for Shopify would decline considerably. The Shopify COVID-19 discussion board shows that most Shopify clients are seriously devastated as a result of the virus, and their sales are dropping anywhere from 25% to 100% (i.e. no sales). Of course, there is a small percentage of clients whose e-commerce business would thrive in this environment, and these are mostly brick-and-mortar stores. However, their number is very small compared to the overall number of Shopify clients.In addition, Shopify is doing the right thing and is suspending stores that are price gouging during this pandemic. I think that this is the proper ethical and moral decision that Shopify management should have taken, and they certainly did.My personal expectation is that the GMV for Shopify would drop by a minimum of 50% over the next two quarters. This would result in a significant drop in Merchant Solutions revenue. Please note that this variable component of Shopify Revenue constitutes over 60% of the total Shopify revenue.Source: Michael Wiggins De Oliveira, Seeking AlphaWould Shopify allow customers to pause their e-store for free?Based on Shopify’s response to COVID-19, Shopify is not giving the option to pause the site for free to its clients. The option available for clients who are experiencing an abnormal decline in their sales is to drop their subscription level and/or to pause the e-commerce store on their subscription. This pausing of the e-commerce store would drop the monthly fees to $14 instead of the minimum $29 basic fee.Source: Shopify Website as of 2020/03/23; Shopify has not yet updated its website to reflect the 90 days, and is not yet disclosing the $14 option that customers have.I do not expect that Shopify would provide a temporary freeze of the subscriber’s site even for a short period of time (e.g. two or three months). Clients have the option to freeze the e-commerce component of the store and reduce the subscription to $14, and this is what I expect clients will do. The reason why Shopify would not provide the option of freezing the account is two-fold: First, it would lose revenue, and second, the clients may not come back any time soon after they freeze their accounts.Would the brick-and-mortar stores flood to Shopify?With the closures and lock-downs happening, more brick-and-mortar stores will be flocking to create their stores online. The logistics would be quite challenging in terms of shipping the existing inventories to the customers, but eventually, the store owners would be nailing it. My expectation is that many of these stores will introduce ""pick-up from store"" delivery mechanisms, which would work well in the locations that are not locked down.The total Shopify number of customers would thus increase at a rate higher than that of its competitors, primarily because Shopify provides one of the easiest and most comprehensive solutions for e-commerce stores. I would consider this change associated with brick-and-mortar stores as one of the key benefits of the COVID-19 pandemic for Shopify.Would the number of clients/subscribers of Shopify increase or decrease?With the massive layoffs that are now happening, I expect that new customers would be rushing to open their own businesses and thereby open their online stores with Shopify. At the same time, most existing clients will not quit and remain with Shopify. A major part of their fees is based on sales commissions and fees (a variable cost) which would drop with the decline of their sales. In addition, most of the clients that are suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic would choose to pause the e-commerce component of their existing stores (the $14 per month option) rather than permanently closing their stores. Finally, Shopify has extended the free trial period from 14 days to 90 days, which would provide a further enticement for individuals to try opening their own stores. As a summary, I am expecting the number of Shopify subscribers to increase.I am also expecting that the mix between these subscribers will change with many of the existing customers (maybe with the exception of Shopify Plus customers) downgrading to a lower tier. In addition, the free features that Shopify is now providing (e.g. gift cards) may provide a further incentive for customers to downgrade.I don’t expect many of the Shopify Plus customers to downgrade to a lower tier. The Shopify Plus cost is mostly a variable cost which would automatically drop with the decline of sales and the fixed subscription cost is relatively low for these companies anyways.Source: Compiled by authorIf the number of subscribers increase, would the subscription revenue increase as well?The potential increase in the number of subscribers would not necessarily translate to a higher subscription revenue, and the overall subscription revenue will most likely decline rather than increase. There are two reasons for this decline:First, Shopify increased the period for the free trial from 14 days to 90 days. This means no revenue will come from the potential new clients until three months after starting to use Shopify. By that time, many of them would realize that competing with the big players is a futile exercise and may choose to quit the e-commerce business. In addition, some businesses may choose to close their existing stores and open new ones to capitalize on the 90-day free trial.Second, many Shopify clients would downgrade the subscription level to a lower tier, which would reduce the overall subscription revenue.Source: Thomas Smale, FE International, How to Sell a Shopify BusinessThe percentage decline in the subscription revenue, while potentially substantial, would be significantly less than the decline of the variable component of Shopify’s revenue (Merchant Solutions), which is mostly dependent on the GMV.What will happen with Shopify’s bottom line?A close study of Shopify’s income statement and its associated notes reveals that there are three major buckets of expenses: Labour cost (mostly spread across the different expense components), affiliate marketing costs (embedded in Sales and Marketing) and third party transfers (embedded in both Sales and Marketing, and G&A).I do not expect Shopify to be conducting any massive layoffs for the foreseeable future. I would expect them though to stop the hiring process for the foreseeable future.Shopify has a commitment to its partners for perpetual referral fees. While Shopify has the legal right to stop these fees, that would devastate Shopify’s affiliate marketing structure. Having said that, I expect that the affiliate marketing expense to be dropping marginally with the reduced subscription revenue. The above two components constitute the biggest components of Shopify’s expenses, and while they are expected to decline, the drop will not be significant.The other big component of Shopify’s expenses is the pass-through funds (like credit card and third party fees). Shopify records its pass-through funds as expenses rather than a contra-revenue (the more conservative approach), and these variable expenses would significantly decline with the drop of its customer sales.All the other fixed expenses (rent, hardware, hosting…) will generally remain as is, and their impact is minuscule anyways compared to the other big three expense buckets.Source: YChartsBecause of the expected significant drop in Merchant Solutions (over 50%) combined with the drop in the subscriber revenue resulting from customers downgrading their subscription tiers, I am expecting the net income to dive into the red at an unprecedented rate. How much will it actually be in the next few quarters is anyone’s guess.How would Shopify benefit from the growth of e-commerce resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic?With the lock-downs happening all over the world combined with the massive layoffs, people will have more time on their hand and will be forced to do as much as possible of their shopping on-line. This will result in a fundamental structural change in the e-commerce business. The hallmarks of this change can be summarized in the following structural changes:The above structural changes would be devastating for most Shopify store owners; most of the products sold on Shopify stores are discretionary and are sold based on impulsive buying. Actually looking at Shopify’s Market your business page would reveal that most of the techniques that are suggested to focus on how to get the customers to buy without researching other competitors, aka, impulsive buying.Source: eMarketer, Global Ecommerce 2019The growth that is expected in e-commerce will mostly be for essential products rather than discretionary products. Some Shopify sites would benefit from that, however, this will be short-lived as essential products are mostly commodities (e.g. groceries and toilet paper). With commodities, prices and speed of delivery are the main factors in the purchasing decision, and with the ease of search for the different availability and prices, larger retailers, that have large economies of scale and efficient operations, will always win.Small e-commerce stores are well-known for their poor return policies and drop-shippers are known for their slow delivery. The return policies and the delivery times are not expected to be any better with the disruption in the supply chain resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for smaller businesses. This would result in pushing the customers away from these small e-commerce sites into larger e-commerce sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).Unfortunately, for Shopify, their focus is small businesses (Shopify’s main page states that its mission is “Empowering independent business owners everywhere”), which would be suffering under COVID-19 with the price wars and the behavioural changes for the buyers. In other words, I do not believe that Shopify would benefit from the structural change that is happening in the e-commerce landscape as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.What will happen with Shopify Capital?I have always maintained that Shopify Capital is another form of a pay-day loan structure that charges an enormous amount of interest. A high interest usually comes with a significant risk, and I do not believe that this is the case for Shopify. Here is the definition of the business from Shopify’s annual report.The financial services industry all over the world is suffering as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary reason for this distress is the massive increase in the bad debt and loan default allowances. And, for financial institutions, we are not talking about loans that are guaranteed by future business (like Shopify Capital), but rather talking mostly about loans that have real estate and personal guarantees as collateral.As a result, we should expect that Shopify Capital's business would be devastated. However, Shopify management was astute in insuring (part of) the Shopify Capital business. I am impressed by this action and consider it as a remarkable positive action from the Shopify management team:Shopify did not disclose how much of the Shopify Capital loans were insured, and their disclosure indicates that only part of the loans are insured.Shopify indicated that they are planning to increase the loans for Shopify Capital by $200M in their COVID-19 response letter and that they are working with governments to make the capital offerings available in other countries. It is not very clear what they are planning to do regarding insuring these additional loans but I am fairly certain that the insurance carrier would increase the premium for insuring these new loans quite substantially.My expectation is that the impact of Shopify Capital on the company’s bottom line would be negative as a result of increasing the bad debt allowance, and that the insurance that Shopify bought will help weather this impact. Having said that, I believe that this additional expense will pale compared to the deterioration in the Merchant Solutions revenue.Do you expect any government involvement related to Shopify?Shopify has a very strong relationship with the Canadian political leadership. The head office is in Ottawa and Tobi Lütke seems to have a strong relation with the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. In addition, Shopify is considered one of the technology flagship companies of Canada. Based on this, Shopify is in a good position to get some sort of support from the Canadian government.Source: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participates in an armchair discussion with Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke in Toronto on Tuesday, May 8, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan DenetteChris MacDonald recently published a report on The Motley Fool indicating that “Should Shopify begin to see serious declines in the company’s stock price, I would not be surprised to see the government offer a major helping hand.”While an interesting concept, I think that the support from the government will be limited to providing funds to Shopify to distribute to its small business clients via Shopify Capital. I do not personally expect this to happen soon, but if/when it does, it would have a minimal impact on Shopify’s bottom line.Where is the Shopify stock price bottom, and will it recover?This is a question that is almost impossible to answer, and any answer will be mostly speculative. I am presenting my personal opinion here, and am trying my best to justify it.For the short term (next two quarters), Shopify’s top and bottom lines will drop at an unprecedented rate. I expect the stock price will continue dropping quite substantially as a result of that, and the main decline in the stock prices would coincide with the quarterly announcements.On the long term, after the COVID-19 is defeated, the position of Shopify will depend on one key factor, which is whether the structural changes in the customer behaviour will persist or not. If the customers remain vigilant in their online purchasing habits, it would spell trouble to most Shopify site owners who rely on impulsive buying of discretionary products. By association, the persistent change in behaviour would spell trouble to the Shopify stock price.If the customer behaviour returns to what it was before COVID-19, I would expect Shopify's growth to continue until the behavioural change eventually happens.The COVID-19 pandemic will impact all industries without exception either positively or negatively. Despite the hopes of some analysts, I believe that the world is currently facing a global depression, and we have not yet experienced the second leg of the virus falling. Most businesses in the world will be negatively impacted with the exception of a few limited number of industries.One of the industries that will be positively impacted is e-commerce. While Shopify is in this industry, it may not experience the same positive impact that the big giants (e.g. Amazon, Walmart and Alibaba) are expected to receive. The primary reason that Shopify would not benefit and would rather suffer is simply because most of its clients are relying on impulsive buying of discretionary products, and these sales practices and products do not sell well (if at all) during a recession, let alone a global depression.Reviewing the Shopify bulletin boards shows the extremely high level of suffering that the Shopify retailers are experiencing as a result of the drop in their sales. Shopify responded in an impressive way to its customers providing them with additional free services and extending the trial period from 14 to 90 days. I don’t believe there is anything else that can be done at this stage by Shopify for its customers, and they just have to try to ride the wave instead of fighting it."
4333311,102646,2020-03-20T14:18:37-04:00,Shopify stock has declined as investors fear the impacts of the coronavirus.I expect mass layoffs to reignite the entrepreneurial spirits of most people.I also expect GMV to increase as more people stay and work from home.,"Source: CNNShopify (SHOP) shares have dropped by 37% from their YTD highs as investors worry about the impacts of Covid-19. The shares have fallen by 14% this year, which is slightly better than other momentum stocks. The closely-watched USA momentum factor ETF (MTUM) has fallen by more than 20% this year. The company has also performed better than the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (COMP), which have fallen by more than 25%.Regular readers are aware that I am a close follower of Shopify. After staying in the sidelines for almost a year, I bought the company’s shares in September last year, as I explained in this article. I decided to exit my investment in February ahead of the company’s earnings report. I explained my reasoning in this piece. In this report, I will explain why I am seriously considering buying the stock once the situation in the market stabilizes.Source: YChartsWhen I wrote my previous article, I expected that Shopify would have a challenging quarter. I was wrong. The company’s revenue grew by 47% to $505.2 million, which was driven primarily by the Merchant solutions. The segment grew by 53% to $322 million mostly because of the acceleration of Shopify Capital. The subscription solutions grew by 37% to $182 million. The company attributed this growth to its international growth, the Shopify Fulfillment Network, and its acquisition of 6 River Systems.The macroeconomic environment has changed in the past few months. The Covid-19 illness has continued to spread around the world, leading to the shutdown of cities and countries. The impact of the illness will be dire. In an interview yesterday, Mohammed El Erian said that the current crisis could turn into a depression. Barron’s thinks so too. Meanwhile, analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS) see the economy contracting by 5% in the second half while those at Deutsche Bank (DB) expect a “severe recession” in the first half of the year.As with all companies, Shopify has been affected by the current crisis. The company has encouraged its employees to work from home and given them $1,000 to spend. Still, judging by history, I expect Shopify to weather this storm better than most companies.The primary reason for this is that I expect more global layoffs in the US and around the world. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has warned of a potential 20% unemployment rate unless Congress passes a large stimulus package. Even with stimulus, I expect many industries like airlines, cruise lines, and energy companies to lay off a substantial number of their employees.At the same time, I expect that most of these people will turn to entrepreneurship to substitute their income. Some will try drop shipping while others will start selling their creations online. This is an opportunity for Shopify, which has a complete suite of products to help them launch, run, and manage their businesses.Source: Seeking AlphaHistory is on Shopify’s side on this. History shows that the number of businesses started in the US tend to decline immediately after a recession. However, this tends to end reasonably faster as the economy starts to recover. As shown below, business applications declined during the great recession, and the number started to rise as the economy recovered.Source: CensusTo be clear. Most of the businesses that will be created during this time will not do well. According to the Census Bureau, there tends to be a recovery in the quantity of businesses that are started but not quality of business applications. Still, Shopify will benefit from the quantity because sellers will pay multiple subscriptions as they try to accelerate their businesses.Shopify will not only benefit from the new businesses that I expect to be launched, the company will benefit from already-existing local brick and mortar stores that had not embraced online shopping. Most of these companies are suffering as more people stay indoors. Consequently, I expect these companies to start embracing e-commerce as a measure of diversifying their businesses. Therefore, the company will continue adding more companies to its ecosystem. As of the last quarter, the company has 1,069,000 members, which is a bigger number than the 144k it had five years ago.Another catalyst I foresee is where the company’s gross merchandise volumes increase as more people stay and work from home. Just in the last quarter, the company’s GMV rose by 52% to more than $8.9 billion. I expect the GMV figures to continue rising as more people in the core markets embrace social distancing. A study by Coresight Research has found that more people are likely to avoid public spaces. Most malls and retail centres have also started to see less traffic, which I expect will be a catalyst for companies in the Shopify ecosystem.A common case made against Shopify is that of its valuation. I have made this case in the past. Just last year, I wrote that the company’s valuation made no sense. At the time, the company was valued at about $25 billion. Looking back, I believe that I was wrong for two reasons. First, at the time, I expected the company to add fewer members into its ecosystem. Second, I expected the company’s growth to stall as other companies like Wix (WIX) and SquareSpace moved into the space.After looking at the company carefully, I believe that its growth can help to justify its premium valuation. The company has become the second-biggest e-commerce company in the United States after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It has also continued to add more services like fulfillment that other smaller players cannot match. In other words, the company has created a large moat that will be difficult for other companies to match.This is reflecting on the company’s growth. In the fourth quarter, the company’s revenue grew by almost 50%, which is an incredible number for a company of its size. Most importantly, most of this growth was organic and not attributed to its 6 River Systems acquisition.In 2020, the company expects its revenue to grow to between $2.13 billion and $2.16 billion. This will be a growth rate of more than 37%. The company also expects to break-even this year. Even with the current pandemic and because of the growth factors I have mentioned above, I expect the company to do significantly better than that.Shopify stock has dropped by about 37% from its highest point of the year. This was an expected move as the coronavirus pandemic continues. I expect the pandemic to have many casualties, such as companies in the retail, energy, and cruise industries. At the same time, I expect the number of cases to start declining in the US as the government continues to promote social distancing. I also expect many companies to do better as the pandemic continues. Shopify is one of them. In the meantime, I expect the stock to retest the important support of $300 as the volatility continues before it starts to soar."
4326517,105256,2020-02-23T15:07:17-05:00,I have an operating theory and I am going to stick with it until new information changes it: We are in a corrective phase.I need to practice what I preach and look for the dips right now.I think the pattern of the indexes rising at the beginning of this week and selling at the end is holding -- for now.I make the case that Shopify will graduate to the FANG universe by the end of this year and into 2021. It is all about the leadership vision.,"A look at this week to get a handle on next, Also by 2021 Shopify will Join FANG, here’s whyThis Monday I once again stressed that we are in a corrective phaseIn that piece, I asked you to look for stocks that have dipped, instead of going long stocks near their highs. It is clear that this assertion is now confirmed. Let’s still take a look at where we are at on the chart and then draw a conclusion on where we might be headed next week. So let’s look at a one month chart of the SPY which is the S&P500 ETF.I am operating on the theory that the indexes are in a corrective phase that is going to be correcting over time going just above and then a percentage point or two below the high. If that is true then the S&P 500 has support at about 10 points below the close, and not by falling precipitously. Of course, if the news on the CoronaVirus is worse in China, and really picking up in Korea, and Japan then we don’t hold support. I think we do..So I think we will open down on Monday and then bounce, probably giving us 2 to 3 days of upward movement. I obviously missed my projection that this turn will happen on Friday, in my most recent note to you. In my defense, I didn’t fully recognize that the news out of Korea was that whip of the CoronaVirus tail that could pressure the indexes one last time. This was my assertion the Friday before last. The fact that we had two strong days of selling, I believe sets us up for a counter-trend at the beginning of this week. That doesn’t mean that we won’t sell at the end of next week. This has been a trend now for about a month. Patterns tend to propagate until everyone expects them. So traders, please don’t overcommit. Look to the bottom of this piece for My trading strategy for Monday. Let’s press on with the review.A bit more color on my selling Amazon (AMZN) a favorite of the ""hedgies""I want to address the part where I said that I let go of Amazon (AMZN), my reason was the conclusion that AMZN was no longer breaking to new highs for now. Even though I already wrote about not buying the rips I was guilty of doing the very same thing. In my defense, I was in a call spread which automatically shields to the downside. I did say that if you were still in a breakout type stock and in calls that you should spread that position. I got out of AMZN early Thursday morning when I was observing the price movement, looked at the chart and got the news that AMZN is now a “favorite” of the hedge funds. The “favorite” status is not always a good thing and my point was borne out on Friday. In this case, I believe, that a form of “signaling” occurred. A hedge fund, probably a big one, sold AMZN short at just below its previous closing high and that was signal for others to go short. Let me use the example of “economic signaling”: an airline company, let’s use Panam decides to float a price increase for a competitive route like NYC to Chicago. They publish a price hike of $20, if US Air (another defunct airline) raises, then EVERYONE raises. If no one bites, Panam is free to lower back the price and no one is the wiser. I won’t go into the legality of this maneuver, let’s just be grownups and know that it is what it is. The fact that we eliminated the uptick rule on shorting makes this type of tactic totally feasible in trading. Also, let’s agree that a “double-top” is equivalent to “Snake-Eyes” for traders. Everyone can look at a chart and ah ha! A double top, let’s short this sucker.I'm looking to get back in on AMZNNow, does that disqualify AMZN from being the number one trading vehicle in my universe? Absolutely Not! In fact, I am pretty sure that the hedgies are going to have one last go to the short side at AMZN on Monday. Then they are gonna go long on this name like their P&L depends on it, because it probably does. So AMZN bottoms Monday morning and then it’s going to break above that previous high going into 2200+. I will look to get back in off of this dip, which is practicing what I preach.Shopify Gunning For Square and Paypal, and a place on FANGShopify (SHOP) is making moves that belie much greater appetite for growth in SHOP that the market is not pricing in. Take the latest news below according to Reuters:Canadian e-commerce company Shopify Inc stated on Friday that it would join Libra Association, a group that manages Facebook Inc led efforts to launch a global digital currency, Libra. ""We will work collectively to build a payment network that makes money easier to access and supports merchants and consumers everywhere,"" Shopify said in a statement Shopify joins Libra Association. Meanwhile, companies including Vodafone Group PLC , Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL) and Mastercard Inc (MA) have exited the association in recent months. Facebook announced in June last year its plan to launch Libra in partnership with other members of the association, but the project soon ran into trouble with US politicians and skeptical regulators around the world.My Take: This item and prior news that Shopify is focusing on providing point of purchase technology to “brick and mortar” stores, tells me that SHOP is gunning for, Square (SQ), and with this piece of data that it is going after Paypal (PYPL) as well. That isn’t to say that I am backing away for my support for SQ and PYPL. There is room for each of these players, however, I am struck by the boldness of the vision and reach of CEO of SHOP Tobias Lutke. It was only a few months ago that he made a move into logistics and warehousing to go after 3rd party fulfillment business of Amazon (AMZN). Now with a succession of these announcements the outlines of his vision are being confirmed. I think it won’t be long that SHOP will be mentioned in the same breath as Alphabet (GOOGL) and AMZN, and perhaps becomes part of FANG by the end of this year, albeit as a name on the come. SHOP may double by the end of this year if it does execute on its ambitions. SHOP’s move to Libra is not only a shot across the bow to PYPL but it also comes at the right time to “save” Facebook’s (FB) Libra project. FB seemingly backed away communications-wise and also started to work on other payment schemes for WhatsApp and messenger. Along comes SHOP to swoop in and take the initiative.My trades: As I said, I think SHOP becomes synonymous with other leaders in the cloud. That means that it will get the type of focus and sponsorship that the other FANG names get. That also means that SHOP could get a lot of retail investors interested in this name. I, therefore, sold my AMZN CALLs and started a position in SHOP. Again, that doesn’t mean that I am abandoning AMZN as a trading vehicle. You can trade both. I want the 100+ points that I think the hedgies are going to create on the bounce from the 2060-2080 level. I am going to wait until I see AMZN in the black, so that means I am not going to try and buy the low. I want to wait for the “signal”, meaning that the hedge fund guys have taken it as low as it will go and the momentum is now the up.I didn’t spread SHOP right away, thinking that we would bounce on Friday. Again, I should practice what I preach. I write to enforce my own trading discipline so, so far this trade is underwater and I didn’t have to. Please don’t make the same mistake, SPREAD your calls, especially now. You can always roll-up. Yes, it does limit your upside, but if you do it right, in volatile times like today you can create more alpha not less. To make a long story short, I intend to go long on both names and spread them.I am also long Slack (WORK), I think it will keep breaking out. In this case, WORK is way below its all-time high. Trade to spread it at the close on Friday but didn’t get the price I wanted. In this case, since it was trading in the green all Friday on the news that UBER has gone all-in on Slack software. I think the worm has turned for WORK and it is going to new highs.Finally, please continue to keep an eye on the VIX. We need it to slowly recede. If it doesn’t it means we have more 1% swings on the indexes on a day to day basis."

The company recently announced its fourth-quarter results that shattered market expectations and sent the stock soaring to record high levels.Shopify's fourth-quarter revenues grew 47% to $505.2 million, significantly ahead of the market's forecast of $482.5 million. Net income was $771,000, or $0.01 per share, compared with net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.43, which was also significantly ahead of the Street's estimate of $0.23.By segment, subscription revenues grew 37% to $183.2 million, ahead of the estimates of $177.9 million. Merchant solutions revenue rose 53% to $322 million compared with the Street's forecast of $304 million.Among other metrics, gross merchandise volume (GMV) rose 47% to $20.6 billion in the quarter, ahead of the estimates of $20.03 billion. Gross Payments Volume grew 43% to a record $8.9 billion. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) at the end of the year grew 32% to $53.9 million. Shopify Plus contributed $14.6 million, or 27%, of MRR compared with 25% a year ago.It ended the year with revenues growing 47% to $1.578 billion. Net loss was $124.8 million, compared with $64.6 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, net income was $34.3 million, or $0.30 per share, compared with $44.1 million, or $0.43 per share a year ago.For the current quarter, Shopify expects revenues of $440-$446 million, compared with the market's forecast of $443.3 million. Shopify expects to end the current year with revenues of $2.13-$2.16 billion, compared with the Street's forecast of $2.11 billion.Over the last year, Shopify has been investing not only on expanding its fulfillment services but also on the development of other offerings. Recently, it released a number of new digital marketing features that are focused on helping brands connect directly with their customers to build relationships.To drive conversations amongst buyers and customers, it launched Shopify Email and Shopify Chat. To help the merchants market themselves better, it entered into more ad buying partnerships with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that now allow merchants to reach additional buyers without leaving the platform. Besides services and partnerships, Shopify is also delivering hardware to help the merchants. It recently released its new retail hardware collection including Tap & Chip Reader and Dock and Stand that offer a seamless online and offline shopping experience. It plans to continue to build on these point-of-sale offerings in the coming months.Shopify remains focused on building out its fulfillment network. The company is targeting a 5-year plan for the network. It is early days for the service, but it claims to have delivered a successful Black Friday Cyber Monday to its merchants to help them generate $3 billion in sales globally to reach more than 25 million consumers during the events.I have written earlier about how some PaaS companies have particular focus on the startup ecosystem to support entrepreneurs to build SaaS applications on their platforms and help them sell these apps through their app marketplaces. The PaaS strategy not only helps these players expand their product ecosystem but also get access to a developer ecosystem.Shopify is convinced about this opportunity as well. It continues to focus on its PaaS strategy to drive growth. It has opened its platform to third parties to let them build apps that offer niche services to its merchants. It claims that 87% of its entrepreneurs rely on apps to run their business. 11.6 million app installs were reported on their platform compared with 7 million reported in 2017. These apps not only support merchants but also help developers earn revenues. 84% of the apps on the Shopify App Store have earned revenues for the developers.Shopify claims that developers can earn an average of $272K per year based on the current average annual earnings for the top 25% of its app developers. Since opening its platform to developers, Shopify has provided a cumulative $280 million in payouts to its developers. These are impressive figures supporting my belief that the PaaS environment is an exciting one.The market is pleased with its performance. Its stock is trading at $531.22 with a market capitalization of $61.8 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $593.89 earlier this month. The stock was trading at a 52-week low of $177.04 almost a year ago.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

Again, no matter what the narrative shapes up to be: of rapid growth, or even that Shopify is better in 2020 than it has ever been, the facts plainly show a decelerating growth rate, now firmly below 40%.The graph that follows I've shown Shopify's GAAP operating loss over the years including its most recent 2020 guidance:Source: author's calculationsAgain, as in the first graph, I've taken Shopify's guidance for 2020 at the top of its range, to account for any potential improvement throughout 2020.Nevertheless, however we appraise this investment, without much in the way of clever mathematical acrobatics, I believe you should be able to agree that Shopify is investing more each year, while at the same time, its revenue growth rate is decelerating. Why is this important?A critical aspect worth considering:Shopify has often made it clear that the bulk of its merchants are only tied into its platform for one month at a time.Thus, the way that Shopify grows is through value-added services to new onboarding customers.Source: author's calculationsAs you can see above, the vast majority of its revenue in Q4 2019 is coming from Merchant Solutions. You may question, why does this matter?Because Merchant Solutions carry gross profit margins of just under 37%. Consequently, this is in no way aligned with the image of a high margin SaaS business now, is it?Experience has taught me that most readers have a thesis and struggle to understand the other side of the argument, so I'm going to try be very clear:Nobody questions whether or not Shopify has done well in the past. It has done incredibly well, and we can all use hindsight to see this. But what about looking ahead? How do we appraise its potential?Shopify's high margin segment Subscription Solutions is only growing at 37% year-over-year, while this is fast, it is in no way out of this earth. Furthermore, whenever investors value Shopify, they point to the fact that Shopify is trading at 39x trailing revenues.But not all of Shopify's revenues are worth the same:Thus, only a third of Shopify's revenue should be valued in the high 10x to low 20x trailing sales, its Subscription Solutions. Because the remainder of its revenues is one-time in nature, with unsatisfactory profit margins, reported under Merchant Solutions.Put another way, not only is Shopify shockingly valued at 39x trailing revenues, when only a third of revenues are recurring in nature, even though most other SaaS business are trading for less than 20x trailing sales, but most importantly, Shopify's revenue growth rates are now evidently starting to decelerate.When everyone is invested in a stock, and there are so many proud outspoken commentators, it is easy to be allured by the easy returns. But these easy returns are only a mirage.Because at some point, this exuberant valuation will hit a speed bump, and at that juncture, investors' gains will rapidly become losses. Shareholders will be hanging on in the hopes of soon breaking even, when the time to sidestep the investment is right now when it is still warm and fuzzy."
4328267,105419,2020-02-28T13:30:19-05:00,"Despite its high valuation as per traditional valuation metrics, Shopify has tremendous ongoing long-term price appreciation potential, and the recent sell off provides an additional small margin of safety.
        We provide an overview of the business (and its attractive qualities), then review four big risks the company faces (valuation is the biggest one in some investors minds).
        We conclude with our opinion on why the shares are still dramatically undervalued by shortsighted investors.","Shopify (SHOP) is a global e-commerce software company that is building an indispensable, one-stop-shop e-commerce platform for small and medium sized businesses (BATS:SMB). And it is an absolute revenue growth juggernaut. However, by traditional valuation metrics it seems obscenely overvalued to some investors. In this article, we provide an overview of the business (and its attractive qualities, including the large—and expanding—total addressable market, the stickiness of its customers, and its track record of innovation), we review four big risks the company faces (including valuation relative to history and its SaaS peers), and then conclude with our opinion on why the shares are still dramatically undervalued by shortsighted investors, especially after the recent indiscriminate market-wide sell off that has inappropriately dragged the share price lower.The company provides ‘e-commerce as a service’ primarily to small-to-medium sized businesses in over 175 countries. The company’s platform is used by customers to set up both the e-commerce front end (web, mobile and social media) as well as to set up back end infrastructure that helps customers manage inventory, orders, payment, shipment, working capital financing and data analytics. The company was founded in 2004 by Tobias Lütke and Scott Lake. Shopify raised $7M in series A round from Bessemer Venture Partners and FirstMark and went public in 2015.Shopify essentially has two revenue streams:Subscription Solutions: This segment includes revenue from company’s platform subscriptions as well as the sale of custom themes, apps and registration of domain names. It accounts for ~41% of revenue & has gross profit margin of 80%.Merchant Solutions: This segment includes revenue from additional services to merchants that are not offered with subscription plans such as payments processing, shipping and fulfillment and financing of working capital. It accounts for ~60% of revenue & has gross profit margin of 38%.(source: Shopify)The company follows a tiered pricing structure. Below are the key differences between various plans it offers its customers:The global secular share shift from offline to online retail is continuing at a scorching pace. E-commerce sales are expected to increase from $3.5T in 2019 to $6.5T in 2023, a CAGR of 16.7%. Conservatively assuming that the SMB/Small Enterprises segment accounts for 25% of the global e-commerce retail sales and applying Shopify’s current take rate (revenue % of GMV) to the SMB E-Commerce sales estimate, we get to a target addressable market of nearly $23B. Based on Shopify’s 2019 revenue, the company has reached just a 7% penetration rate as of now. Given the low penetration rate as well as growth in the broader ecommerce ecosystem, we expect the company to grow revenue at greater than 25-30% over the next five years.The company has created an intuitive, easy to use software-as-a-service platform for SMBs that provides its typically resource-constrained customers with an exhaustive suite of services in both website development as well as e-commerce specific retail management. The platform has been made keeping in mind the less tech savvy small to medium business demographic and that ease of use has particularly helped the company take a dominant position in the e-commerce platform market. As per BuiltWith, a business intelligence firm, Shopify has a 31% market share in the US e-commerce platform market, almost twice that of the nearest competitor WooCommerce.While the company has benefited from the surge in e-commerce activity globally, it has also taken a pro-active approach to expanding its opportunity set by continually introducing ancillary services to capture a bigger share of customer’s wallet. Not surprisingly, the company’s Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) has gone up nearly 700% since 2015. During this period, the company’s payment processing service has increased its penetration of GMV from 35% in 2015 to 43% in 2019. Merchant cash advances to customers increased 60% in 2019 to $437M. Shopify’s shipping penetration reached 45% of eligible merchants on the Shopify system as of Q4 2019 as compared to 40% same time last year. Finally, Shopify Plus, which is the premium plan in the company’s tiered offering, has increased its share of monthly recurring revenue from 21% in December 2017 to 27% in December 2019.Fulfillment Opportunity: Shopify is continuing to grow its addressable market by addressing additional pain points of its core SMB customer. The company launched Shopify Fulfilment, a ‘fulfilment as a service’ offering in June 2019. Between 2019-20, the company’s focus is on building the software backbone and using third-party logistics providers for the physical layer. From 2021, the company will start building its own warehouse capacity. Using Shopify fulfillment, the company’s customers will be able to link to a much more efficient, lower cost supply chain network as compared to managing these functions in-house at a small scale.The addition of fulfillment will in turn allow Shopify to offer a real alternative to Amazon (AMZN) that already offers fulfillment services to its sellers (for more perspective, check out our latest Amazon report here). Unlike Amazon, brands on Shopify will be able to create a separate identity, traffic flow, by having their own website but at the same time benefiting from a larger partner’s supply chain infrastructure. The company is looking to spend $1B over five years to build its fulfillment network. Additionally, the company recently acquired 6 River Systems in Q3 2019 for $450 million. 6 River System is a provider of warehouse solutions that are engineered by robots and AI.International Opportunity: Currently, the company derives 68% of its revenue from the US while UK, Canada and Australia account for 4-7% each. The rest (around 15% of revenue) is generated in countries excluding these core geographies. The ‘non-core’ markets hold immense potential longer term and the company is localizing its services on a significant scale. The Shopify platform is now available in 20 languages out of which 13 languages including Hindi, traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese were added in 2019. Not surprisingly, the international merchant base, which was just 21% of the total company wide merchant base in 2015, now accounts for 29%.The company is also gradually rolling out ancillary services on top of its core platform in international markets. For example, Shopify Payments is now available in 15 countries including Australia and Singapore. Expansion of the portfolio of services internationally will further improve the monetization rate abroad.1. Unusual Capital Allocation and ValuationGiven the company’s dominant position in the e-commerce platform segment, as well as strong growth in GMV over the years, coupled with solid drivers for growth in the future, valuation multiples have expanded significantly, especially since early 2019 as evident in the following chart.(source: Left Brain Investment Research)Current EV/sales, TTM of around 27 times is above the high end of company’s historical valuation band over the last five years. Further, the company also trades at a premium to public SaaS companies such as Workday (EV/Sales, TTM 11.6x), Paycom Software (22.5x) and ServiceNow (17.9x) (for more perspective, check out our latest update on ServiceNow here).Further still, the company has been diluting its equity via public issuances as well as ESOPs. Between 2015 and 2019, the company’s share count has gone up by nearly 45%. We are a bit perplexed why the company has been raising cash via public issuances despite its FCF being only marginally negative.In fact, the company’s cash and marketable securities balance has gone up from $190M in 2015 to $2.45B in 2019. While Shopify will need to invest money in building out its fulfillment infrastructure over the next few years, hoarding of billions from equity issuances years before the need to invest in the business is rather unconventional, to put it mildly.2. New Entrants to the MarketWhile Shopify admittedly has the most comprehensive solution in the e-commerce platform segment, it does compete with several large, established players when considering parts of its business in isolation. For example, GoDaddy (GDDY) and Wix (WIX) offer website development/hosting services, payment services are also offered by Paypal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) while Adobe (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL) own ecommerce software providers Magneto and ATG respectively. As such, the company will need to continually innovate and upgrade its suite of services to maintain its growth trajectory.3. SMBs Particularly Vulnerable to Economic SlowdownThe company’s core customers are small and medium sized businesses that are the first ones to see distress in difficult economic times. As a result, the company’s business may see an earlier and more pronounced slowdown than enterprise SaaS companies.4. Costs Associated with Aggressive Growth PlansThe company’s revenue has grown at nearly 60% CAGR between 2017-19. The significant level of growth has been enabled my massive increases in operating expenses and as a result, despite the rise in revenue, Shopify’s margins and operating cash flows have remained depressed (-9% 2019 Operating Margin and CFO % Sales at 4.5%). As the company continues to invest in the business both in the US and internationally, lack of operating leverage may disappoint investors.We believe one of the classic investor mistakes when analyzing a growth stock is shortsightedness. Specifically, because many investment analysts are extremely averse to near-term volatility, they forgo attractive long-term return opportunities. For perspective, the average price target and long-term growth rate of the 32 Wall Street analysts reporting to Factset is $556.97 and 50%, respectively.And while even these analysts believe the shares are undervalued, their models don’t generally look further into the future that the next few quarters (or couple years) as you can see in the following estimate table, as per Factset.However, given the very long runway for the continuing global secular shift to online retail (as described earlier), combined with the stickiness of the business (the platform is irreplaceable to many SMBs, as described earlier), and the company’s track record of innovation (and attractive opportunities ahead), we see Shopify’s long-term opportunity to be dramatically larger than its share price suggests. Certainly, there will be near-term price volatility and noise, but that is the price you pay as a disciplined long-term growth investor. We faced a lot of push back on our previous bullish article on Shopify back early November (when it traded 37% lower than it does now, and 46% lower than it did just a few weeks ago), and we expect we'll continue to face push back and price volatility going forward.However, despite the risks to the business (and particularly the high valuation as per traditional valuation metrics), in our opinion Shopify remains dramatically undervalued relative to its long-term growth potential, and this last week’s share price decline provides an additional small margin of safety (relative to the long-term growth potential) for investors to initiate, or add to, a position in Shopify."
4324326,102465,2020-02-14T13:02:21-05:00,"Shopify crushes Q4 earnings and pushes the stock up 8%.Shopify is still overvalued, especially after being up over 100% in 3.5 months.Shopify has to slow down at some-point, take more profits and protect your capital.","Shopify (SHOP) released earnings Wednesday morning, and the results sent the stock 8% higher on the day. Shopify has been on a tear ever since breaking into the market and does not appear like it wants to slow down. Back on January 17th, I wrote an article advising shareholders to take some profits, and the stock has run up another 30% since. This stance was based on portfolio management and a very high valuation. Fast forward a month, and the story remains the same. Shopify remains highly overvalued and I continue to recommend shareholders take some profits as the stock surges on Q4 earnings.(Source: TC2000.com)I noted in my previous article that I fully expected earnings to be very strong, and strong they were. Diving into the numbers:As you can see, it is very clear why the stock performed the way it did today. The company absolutely crushed earings and had posted some very impressive year over year numbers and investors reacted accordingly. Looking forward to 2020 Shopify expects revenues in the range of $2.13 - $2.16 Billion. This would mean a 35% increase in revenue year over year, which would be off the current pace. An adjusted operating loss in the range of $0 to $20 million, and capital expenditures of roughly $80 million largely related to new office space to accommodate the growing workforce.(Source: Simplywall.st)Yes, the growth rate is still impressive, but it is a shade lower than what investors have gotten used too, but it has shrunk rather substantially in the last few years as we were at 90% growth in 2016. That said, earnings growth is going to continue to explode. As you can see above, analysts are expecting the company to break into positive annual EPS numbers in 2022-2023, but are expecting a dip from 2020 to 2021. This may lead to some buying opportunities. Looking below, we can see how the company is doing in terms of market share. Shopify currently sits second to the giant Amazon (AMZN) but has risen above the likes of eBay (EBAY), and Walmart (WMT). The largest challenge for Shopify going forward is continuing to steal market share from these three giants. Amazon is not about to roll over and give any of theirs up as they are after more and more. (Source: Q4 2019 Investor Presentation)Yes, Shopify delivered killer earnings and the stock deserved to go up based on those earnings. But the stock is very clearly overvalued as we stand today. This does not mean investors need to panic sell all of their shares by any means. Simply selling a portion of the shares and taking some profits on this incredible run. Looking below, we can see the valuations of both Amazon and Shopify. We have settled with the fact that Amazon does not trade based on PE or PB ratios, and the same could be said for Shopify, but the current run is leaving us with an insane valuation. Figure 1 shows Amazon currently sitting at 22.6% overvalued. Figure 2 shows Shopify currently 135% overvalued. I would argue these kinds of growth companies always trade on the overvalued side, but 135% is a little egregious for me. Figure 1 (Source: Simplywall.st)Figure 2 (Source: Simplywall.st)Outside of a 30% correction, the stock is up about 300% since the start of 2019. For a stock that was already priced at $140, that is the next level when it comes to capital gains. Looking below, we can see exactly how 2019 went. That ""small"" 30% correction (relative when the stock was up 227% over 8 months) has been the only bump in the road. After bottoming out, the stock ramped back up and is now up over 100% since mid-November 2019.(Source: TC2000.com)Taking profits as a given stock climbs does two things for investors. 1. Lowers their overall exposure/weight in any one name/industry.2. It allows them to reinvest those funds when there is a correction, or in other securities. Please notice not any of these include shorting the stock. I am not suggesting this is the time, nor place to short the stock. Momentum is clearly on the buy-side of this trade. I am simply suggesting based on a potentially slower year, while the stock is this overvalued, that shareholders take some profits before the stock corrects again.As you can see, I remain fairly bullish longterm on Shopify. I do not currently own the stock, but I am looking to buy into the company at the next best chance. I would not advise buying at this current valuation as the stock is clearly overpriced after posting extremely good Q4 2019 numbers. I fully anticipate a 20-30% correction in the next couple of months. It is at this point I would consider establishing a position, or repurchasing shares if I trimmed my current position today. Until then, we are all left wondering when will it end?"
4321829,23567,2020-02-06T00:21:12-05:00,"According to Shopify, retail eCommerce sales worldwide are growing at a CAGR of 21% and are expected to reach $4.9T in 2021.Since 2015, relative to this eCommerce industry CAGR, Shopify’s revenue has grown at 3x this rate while its market cap has grown more than 5x.Since the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend alone, SHOP has surged 41% in price.While our long-term revenue forecasts are higher than consensus, representing a 10-year CAGR of 31%, we think GAAP EBIT margins should only expand from -9.5% in 2019 to 10% by 2027.We do not see a high probability for long-term margin expansion beyond 10%, hence our blended DCF stock price target is only $268, well below the consensus target of $396 and the recent price of $469.","Shopify Inc. (SHOP) is a $54.8B market cap eCommerce platform company based in Ottawa, Canada, supporting more than 1M merchants from 175 countries. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), representing the total dollar value of orders processed by Shopify, was more than $14.8 billion in 3Q19. The company actively supports more than 3,200 third-party apps in its app store, having added 300 in 3Q19. The company intends to report 4Q19 financial results the morning of February 12, 2020.Shopify should be considered a “Growth” stock company, with revenue and market cap growing faster than the eCommerce industry. However, it remains to be seen if the company can grow into its current valuation, given its negative GAAP EBIT margin, negative free cash flow, and equity offerings to maintain its cash balance and make acquisitions. The company does not pay a dividend.The company was founded in 2004 by programmer Tobias Lütke and Scott Lake to support their snowboard equipment eCommerce business. In 2004 Lütke and Lake could not find an eCommerce platform to support their online snowboard equipment business, so they built their own.In 2006 they shifted their focus to developing and marketing their eCommerce platform, brought in programmer Daniel Weinland as a cofounder, and raised $200,000 from friends and family for further development. Lake left the company in 2008 to pursue other entrepreneurial challenges and Lütke took over as CEO, a position he has held ever since. The Globe and Mail’s interesting story about Shopify’s founding, initially posted in 2014 and updated in 2018, is worth a read.Shopify currently has 116.75 common shares outstanding, composed of 104.52 Class A shares and 12.23 Class B shares. Class B shares are entitled to 10 votes per share, and Class A shares are entitled to 1 vote per share. Class B shares may be converted at any time at the option of the holder at a rate of 1-to-1.CEO Tobias Lütke and board member John Phillips are the largest Class B shareholders, and together with an insignificant amount of Class A shares, own 6.7% and 3.4% of the total shares outstanding. Class B shares represent 54% of the voting power, with Lütke controlling 33.8% of the voting power.1) AccessibilityShopify offers a platform that makes selling online easy and accessible. According to one experienced eCommerce blogger, it took her 19 minutes to create a Shopify online store, add products, and bring the store online. Personally, it took me about three hours to create and configure the Ascendere Associates consulting services store on Shopify, complete with a catalog of digital downloads and a working shopping cart. When I last tried doing this with WordPress eCommerce add-ins about eight years ago it took me weeks of research and trial and error, and I was only able to get it to work with the help of a friend that routinely charged others $10,000 to develop online stores. Shopify, among others of course, has helped lower the barriers to entry in creating online businesses.2) Shopify Partner PlatformEnter the search term “Shopify” on YouTube and it returns a seemingly endless list of young marketers and entrepreneurs describing how to take advantage of the platform, which is a testament to Shopify’s accessibility. Google trends indicate that the keyword “Shopify” is significantly more popular than competitors “WooCommerce” or “Magento.” It is likely that a great many of these people are part of the Shopify Partner Program, which provides access to third-party marketing, customization, web design, and development services, an attractive resource to its merchants. I found several third-party consultants offering to set-up Shopify storefronts for a flat fee of $100.3) Enables the direct-to-consumer shopping experienceAccording to CEO Tobias Lütke, Shopify enables the “direct-to-consumer” shopping experience that was severed by traditional department stores and disintermediation. “The products on Shopify are often the things that people really want rather than the ones they need. It’s boutique-y kind of products.” Shopify helps merchants differentiate from competitors that focus their selling exclusively on Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT).4) Scalability and innovative new productsAccording to Shopify, its eCommerce platform is designed to grow with merchants as they scale over time. In addition to providing an online selling platform, Shopify has been growing its payments business, increasingly lending to merchants, and recently announced it would expand into fulfillment services. The company is increasingly providing capital to its merchants. Over time, these new revenue streams could become significant. In 3Q19 it provided more than $140M in advances, up 85% from $76M in 3Q18.Most of Shopify’s clients are small- and medium-sized businesses paying on average $50/month, with three plans priced at $29, $79, and $299 per month. The company also provides large-scale enterprises with custom pricing. According to a web designer, Penguin Books, Budweiser and Tesla are some of Shopify’s largest clients. Some notable launches in 3Q19 on Shopify Plus, its enterprise eCommerce platform, included SpaceX, the BBC, and brands from LVMH (OTCPK:LVMUY), Heineken (OTCQX:HEINY), and The Unilever Group (UN). Source: Shopify 2019 Investor Day5) The largest or second largest eCommerce platform by market shareDepending on the methodology used, Shopify is estimated by a variety of sources to be the largest or second largest eCommerce platform by market share. For example, after web hosting provider Pagely, Shopify is the second largest with a 20% share while eCommerce dropship manager Oberlo indicates that Shopify is the largest at 31% share. It seems that most sources tend to indicate WooCommerce as the market share leader, followed by Shopify, and then others such as Magento, BigCommerce, Wix, and Weebly.6) Leveraging significant long-term global eCommerce industry growthAccording to Shopify, retail eCommerce sales worldwide were $1.3T in 2014 and are projected to reach $4.9T in 2021, representing a CAGR of 21%. Shopify’s revenue has grown from $205M in 2015 to an estimated $1,556M in 2019, representing a CAGR of 66%, and its market cap of $55B represents a compound annual growth rate of 112% from its May 2015 IPO. Looked another way, Shopify’s revenue has grown 3x the market and its valuation has grown more than 5x.Shopify is clearly an accessible, popular, and inexpensive eCommerce platform that is growing faster than global eCommerce market. The key question for investors is, will its rapid revenue growth continue and help the company generate meaningful margins and cash flow that would support its growth beyond its current valuation?The majority eCommerce platform companies seem to be privately held or operate as subsidiaries of larger companies. Magento and Weebly are subsidiaries of Adobe Inc. (NasdaqGS:ADBE) and Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), respectively. Wix.com Ltd (WIX) is the only other multibillion-dollar market cap stand-alone eCommerce platform we are aware of. Below is a list of eCommerce and SaaS companies we think are interesting peers.With the peer group average EV/EBITDA multiple at 59.2x 2020E EBITDA, it is obvious very few of these SaaS companies are trading on near-term expectations, implying that investors must be anticipating high long-term growth. SHOP itself is trading at 500x the 2020E consensus EBITDA estimate of $105M. Shopify’s trailing free cash flow margin of 4% on its own does not support this multiple.In looking for some justification as to why SHOP may be trading at such a high multiple, we note that investors often fail to appreciate that multiples should only be used as rules of thumb in valuing companies. For example, Amazon.com at 19x 2020 EBITDA could seem overvalued. However, as we noted in 2011 and again in 2018, AMZN deserves to trade at high near-term multiples because it has a long history of proving its ability to realize significant incremental revenue growth from investments in capital spending and R&D. Can the same be said of Shopify? In our opinion, the answer is “no,” as we explain in more detail later in this report.According to some experts it may be only a matter of time before Shopify builds an online marketplace like Amazon.com, Walmart, or perhaps more relevantly, Etsy, Inc. (ETSY). According to Yaniv Sarig, CEO of Mohawk Group Holdings (MWK), a microcap CPG eCommerce platform that leverages proprietary real-time data and machine learning technology, “There is a tremendous amount of value to be had from acquiring a customer, because once acquired that customer is likely to make repeat purchases. In order to maximize the lifetime value from any given customer, I think it would make sense for Shopify to eventually build a search and recommendation engine that would provide a single point of access to all its distributed online storefronts. This is in a way already what the Amazon Marketplace is doing.”At the moment, Shopify considers Amazon.com more of a partner than competitor. CEO Lütke pointed out on Shopify’s 3Q19 conference call that the company offers Amazon Pay to customers and merchants, and when something is bought on Amazon.com it is often a Shopify store that handles the fulfillment of the order. In 2015, Amazon.com shut down its Webstore platform and took steps to make it easy for its Webstore merchants to migrate to the Shopify platform.At the end of 3Q19 ended September 30, Shopify held $2,667M of cash and short-term investments and $111M of capital leases. Cash and short-term investments were up from $2013M in 2Q19 and $1,578M in 3Q18.Last-12-month capital spending was $50.9M in 3Q19, up from $43.3M in 2Q19 and $31M in 3Q18. The company closed on three small acquisitions in the first 9 months of 2019. In October 2019 it closed its $450M (approximately 60% cash and 40% stock) acquisition of 6 River Systems, its largest acquisition to date.LTM free cash flow to the entity was negative $(149)M in 3Q19, down from $(117)M in 3Q18, with an improvement to negative $(115M) projected for 3Q20.The increase in cash on its balance sheet was primarily due to the issuance of stock. Over the last 12 months, the company generated $1,128M from the sale of stock, including $1,083M in proceeds from the issuance of Class A shares and $45M from the exercise of stock options. Weighted average basic shares outstanding increased to 113.1M in 3Q19, up 6% from 106.6M in 3Q18. The negative free cash flow and increase in shares outstanding, while not excessive, is certainly is not a favorable trait. No matter how it is explained, issuing shares tends to be a sure sign that management thinks the company is overvalued.Shopify’s October 2019 $450M acquisition of eCommerce fulfillment mobile robotics solutions provider 6 River Systems is intended to help merchants provide fast and affordable shipping. The acquisition is not expected to materially impact near-term revenue because “…most of its revenue is recognized over the multiyear lifetime of each contract and also reflects the reduction of acquired deferred revenue under purchase accounting.” The company expects 6 River Systems to add $25M of incremental expense in 4Q19, including $10M of cash operating expense, $7M in stock-based compensation and $8M of amortization of acquired intangibles.3Q19 revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $390.6M, with Subscriptions Solutions revenue growing 37% to $1,655.6M and Merchant Solutions revenue growing 50% to $225M. According to Shopify, growth was driven by GMV expansion to $14.8B, up 48% y/y with international being the fastest growing component. Shopify Payments penetration of GMV grew 42% in 3Q19 from 41%, primarily due to Shopify Plus penetration and international growth and new products such as multi currency payments. 3Q18 EBITDA was negative $(26.9)M versus negative $(25.2)M in 3Q18.LTM revenue was $1,416.9M, up 48.8% from $952.2M in 3Q18. The LTM gross margin was 55.6%, in line with the 55.8% posted in 3Q18 and 55.6% in 2Q19. Capital efficiency ratios such as ROA, ROC, and ROE have always been negative.For 4Q19 the company expects revenue of $472-482M, a GAAP operating loss of $(47)-(57)M, and adjusted operating income of $10-20M. Full year 2019 revenue is expected at $1.545-$1.555B, a GAAP operating loss of $(158)-$(168)M, and adjusted operating income of $27M-37M. The company intends to report 4Q19 results the morning of February 12, 2020.During Shopify’s 2019 Investor Day in June, CFO Amy Shapero did not provide long-term guidance or targets for the overall company. However, she did describe the company’s next major growth initiative which is focused on its Shopify Fulfillment Network. Other initiatives mentioned during its investor day included the introduction of 3D model support, improving the checkout and payment experience, a multi-language APIs, and improvements to Shopify POS for bricks and mortar retailers, including a new loyalty app and camera-based inventory search.The company expects to spend $1B on capital spending and operating expenses on its Shopify Fulfillment Network over the next five years, with incremental revenue largely offsetting the costs so that the initiative is largely cash neutral. It expects the bulk of its net return from its various success-based investments to come after 2023. Our interpretation is that investors should not expect meaningful free cash flow growth from this initiative until 2024 or after.According to Shapero, the Shopify Fulfillment Network will “…offer merchants a streamlined fulfillment experience with deep machine learning tools, including demand forecasting, smart inventory allocation across warehouses and intelligent order routing. In so doing, we think we can improve supply chain economics and delivery for merchants, making delivery faster and cheaper than it is today… Merchants’ need for fast, reliable, affordable fulfillment is clear and growing.” Poor fulfillment leads to cart abandonment, lost sales, and low customer satisfaction. The company thinks that by offering competitive fulfillment rates, this will lead to higher cart conversion, which should accrue value to Shopify over time. Source: Shopify 2019 Investor DayThe annotated chart below indicates SHOP has surged in price following positive financial results and favorable events, such as the release of its “State of Commerce Report” on June 5, 2019 and its Investor Day on June 19, 2019.The stock declined following the announcement of its acquisition of 6 River Systems on September 9, 2019 and an equity offering announced on September 16, 2019.Following its December 3, 2019 announcement that “Shopify merchants break records with $2.9+ billion in worldwide sales over Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend,” the stock surged 41% from $330.84 to $469.39 by the February 3, 2019 close.It seems that investors are anticipating a big 4Q19 earnings beat and guidance that will drive 2020 consensus estimates significantly higher in 2020. It is difficult to imagine any meaningful margin expansion in 2020, or an accelerating of already high revenue growth in 2020, so I would be a seller either before or immediately following the release of 4Q19 news and updated 2020 guidance.Shopify has for years proven it can innovate and create new products that retain and attract new customers. We think there is a good chance for this innovation and success to continue, which is why we assume our Best Case scenario with a target of $499 has at least a 30% chance of occurring.Our Base Case scenario assumes continued solid revenue growth and a long-term EBIT margin that falls somewhere between Amazon.com’s and Etsy. We think this scenario is the most likely and assign a probability of it occurring at 60% with a target of $193.Our Worst Case scenario assumes that competition in the saturated eCommerce platform market will intensify and Shopify’s entry into fulfillment will depress margins, though we think this outcome is much less likely and assign it a 10% probability.The consensus price target of $396, composed of the mean of 29 institutional analysts, seems way too high to us. Our revenue forecasts are higher than consensus, but we think consensus is overly optimistic on the company’s ability to expand margins over time. It is also possible some analysts are incorrectly applying non-GAAP EBIT forecasts in their DCF valuations.For our DCF forecast for Shopify, Inc, we assume a 6.9% cost of unlevered equity an asset beta of 1.20, and a market risk premium of 5.5%.The table below, “Actuals, Guidance, Consensus, and our Base Case forecasts,” shows how our Base Case forecast differs from consensus.Base Case Price Target is $193, 60% probabilityOur Base Case forecast assumes revenue grows at a 31% compound annual growth rate to $23.8B in 2029 from an estimated $1.56B in 2019. We think this is a reasonable Base Case growth rate assumption given that company revenue has been growing more than 2x projected global eCommerce industry growth of 20% and is likely to taper over time.This forecast assumes the company attains positive GAAP EBIT in 2022, growing to $2.4B in 2029 as the EBIT margin eventually expands from a projected -9.5% in 2019 to 10% by 2027 and stays at the level. This 10% EBIT margin target is below eBay’s and Etsy’s EBIT margins of approximately 21% and 14%, respectively, and above Amazon.com’s EBIT margin of 5.1%.We think a long-term Base Case target margin that falls somewhere between that of Etsy and Amazon.com makes sense given that Shopify may be considered a disaggregated version of both the “boutique-y” Etsy and of the fulfillment-intensive Amazon.com. In this Base Case scenario, we assume free cash flow turns positive in 2022, and grows to $1.6B in 2029.Worst Case Price Target is $26, 10% probabilityOur Worst Case assumes annual revenue growth slows to 15% by 2029 either due to slowing industry growth, increased competition, or both, representing a 10-year CAGR of 26%. In addition, we assume that GAAP EBIT margins never meaningfully expand, first turning positive in 2025 and peaking at 2.5% in 2027. In this scenario, we assume free cash flow first turns positive in 2027 and reach $157M by 2029.This surely is a Worst Case forecast in that it is hard to imagine global eCommerce slowing, or Shopify not being able to generate operating leverage from revenue growth that would still be the envy of companies in any other industry.However, a pessimist would note that barriers to developing eCommerce platforms is low, and Shopify’s entry into the lower-margin fulfillment industry likely indicates that eCommerce is already fully saturated by a wide range of marketing and selling platforms. In addition, the company has little experience in managing capex-heavy and lower-margin fulfillment centers, and the presumed cross-selling opportunities and customer stickiness by entering the fulfillment market may not materialize. There is no reason why FedEx Corp (FDX), United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), or Amazon.com, and some other more experienced freight shipping and fulfillment center company can create a seamless service for small- to medium-sized businesses.Best Case Price Target is $499, 30% probabilityOur Best Case forecast assumes revenue grows at 45% each year through 2022, eventually slowing to 25% in 2029 for a 10-year CAGR of 36%. It also assumes the GAAP EBIT margin expands to 17.5% in 2027 from a projected-9.5% in 2019 – well above Etsy’s and Amazon.com’s current EBIT margins and approaching eBay’s of 21%. In this scenario we assume free cash flow turns positive in 2020 and grows at a 68% CAGR to $4.4B in 2029.This scenario assumes the company finds ways to extend its current revenue growth through continual development of new products and emerging cross selling opportunities, as well as finding new ways to capture revenue from the expanding Gross Merchandise Volume of its merchants. Ten years from now, it is possible that the key revenue generators of this company come from its payment and lending products, with continued innovations in its eCommerce platform and fulfillment network continuing to grow its customer base and capture share of the overall eCommerce market.So far, the company has proven it is adept at finding new opportunities, attracting new customers -- especially enterprise customers. In addition, it is possible any future recession will only benefit the company in the long-term since part of its success has been due to the emergence of a new class of people which were forced into the entrepreneurship in the last recession. If the company can find ways to expand its margins while continuing to innovate, cross sell, and move downstream into lower margin, more capex-intensive eCommerce fulfillment we think achieving this Best Case scenario is reasonable.Ascendere Associates LLC makes no guarantee on the accuracy of the data, estimates, assumptions or forecasts in this report.

The volume of data, economies of scale, and network effect gained over the years will continue to put Shopify above its peers. While valuation appears frothy, Shopify has a significant runway ahead of it as there is no limit to the success of businesses that can be built on the platform. Therefore, investing in Shopify can be likened to the execution of a call option that doesn't expire as the revenue it will potentially rake in by providing the leading vertically integrated platform for online businesses to set up stores will continue to drive sustainable free cash flow in the near term.Source: AuthorShopify (SHOP) is an infinite piece of land for startups and SMEs to take a shot at creating a distribution network that will generate continuous cash flow if their product-market fit narrative is successful. This means entrepreneurs can spend more time on product-market fit to drive down their customer acquisition cost as great products mostly grow via word of mouth. Unlike Amazon (AMZN), brands don't have to worry about shelf space or competition once they've acquired a tribe of ardent followers or customers.Though governmental agencies and Fortune 500 companies can use the platform, I see Shopify as a platform for small startups and mid-market e-commerce businesses, mostly targeting young entrepreneurs.Shopify puts the decentralization in e-commerce without the need for all the blockchain hype. Like users pay a little transaction fee to use the bitcoin network, Shopify charges merchants a portion of every sale in addition to the initial provisioning cost for providing a robust e-commerce platform that is as vertically integrated as desired. This casts the net of its total addressable market really wide. A five-year-old who wants to create a toy review service while selling merch on the side after getting an invite on The Ellen Degeneres show can set up a Shopify site. Better put, Shopify is the Youtube of e-commerce. At the highest level of abstraction, Shopify's growth will closely correlate with global GDP growth. This correlation will be more pronounced in its top-performing regions, such as North America and Europe. This means consumer spending confidence and other indicators of economic growth will determine how ambitious entrepreneurs become and how much funding they attract to widen their distribution channels as they put their businesses online.Source: TwitterLike all things capitalism, not all Shopify sites will win. However, per industry, the death of poor executors will only serve to increase the market share of survivors.The beauty of Shopify is that it prevents a distribution channel winner-takes-all. Instead, every Shopify site is a mini distribution channel whose growth depends on the total addressable market of the underlying business, marketing and sales budget, product pricing power, and product-market fit.If bitcoin becomes a mainstream success, a lot of banks will lose payment processing fees and other hidden charges that have made them too big to fail. The same goes for Shopify. As Shopify grows, one less developer gets a fat contract to build an e-commerce platform from scratch. One less ad agency gets a contract, and one less payment gateway gets a contract. Though, I don't see Shopify as a competitor to developers, agencies, and e-commerce service providers. Leveraging Shopify, as a productivity tool, can also be a strategy for winning more customers. However, like all platform business models, they accrue the most value and IP to platform owners while partners and business architects fight for whatever is left.Going forward, adoption will be less driven by vertical integration and fulfillment abstraction. Rather, maximum adoption will rely on growth hacking, virality, and brand building abstraction. While distribution will be the biggest challenge for Shopify's customers, we realize that the dream product already exists in Facebook's platform. I consider the Instagram/Facebook/WhatsApp trilogy to be the dream abstraction level. Instagram for brand building and virality, Facebook for pull marketing, and WhatsApp for customer service.Source: ShopifyIn terms of market opportunity, Shopify still has a massive runway ahead of it in terms of deal size and volume. There are tons of potential businesses that can be built off the platform, and it's hard to quantify how large and successful these businesses will become.The biggest risk remains the growth hacking task that comes with owning 100% equity of a product distribution network. In seasons of economic prosperity, merchants will prosper. In seasons of economic gloominess, growth will be hampered, and this will impact Shopify's success. As with every unicorn e-commerce platform, Amazon's growth over the past twenty years has proven that there is an ample runway to be covered, and there is a wide margin of error susceptibility if we try to forecast Shopify's future growth.However, investing in Shopify will have been a no brainer if platforms like Facebook and Google don't have growth hacking tools that could horizontally compete with Shopify.Remember, Shopify is one of the multiple ways for retail businesses to reach out to potential customers. I see a possibility for Facebook to morph Instagram into a smart e-commerce-like solution with WhatsApp providing further leverage on the side as a marketing and brand-building tool. While both Shopify and Facebook can co-exist, the incentive for potential users who find both the capital requirement and abstraction level of Shopify a little challenging will swing the battle in Facebook's favor.Shopify's strength lies in accessibility, fulfillment, and the maximization of the equity that accrues to owning a website as a distribution channel. The fact that Shopify has to add payment and financing facilities shows the limited network effect and growth hacking opportunities that can be derived from the platform. This is where Amazon, Google, and Facebook will thrive. Even Twitter becomes a competitor with overwhelming reach the moment it creates a shopping channel for brands on its platform.It's not clear how and when the major competitor will emerge, however, for now, the market opportunity is large and baring the presence of any global macro headwind in the retail space, Shopify will continue to defy all valuation metrics due to the overwhelming volume of opportunity that can be built off the platform.In the face of a rapidly growing industry disruptor, while having the network effect as a catalyst, most traditional investment theses fold, and most traditional valuation models and metrics, bow. The network effect has been a bet on market dominance via investments in intellectual and brand capital. Therefore, for now, Shopify's intangibles, stock-based compensation, and other market-measures of non-physical assets will appear inflated.As Shopify continues to scale, customer acquisition costs will decline, and margins will improve off its strong base of growing recurring revenue. While valuation appears expensive at 33x P/S, betting against a fast-growth industry disruptor is ill-advised. My best bet is to acquire a little position and average down if there is a market correction. With the huge economies of scale about to be derived from its experience in the e-commerce space, it's hard to see competitors catching up with Shopify."
4321228,105308,2020-02-04T11:41:07-05:00,"Shopify has been a fantastic investment since its IPO, growing at a rapid pace.The stock's valuation, however, has reached levels beyond rational explanation.I don't see how Shopify's current multiples can tangibly justify future profitability.","Shopify (SHOP) has been an excellent investment in the growing and exciting e-commerce sector, snowballing returns with no ending on sight. Since its IPO on NYSE, the stock has returned more than 1700% to its shareholders. The company has benefited from the e-commerce revolution and omnichannel commerce. It has also been a major player around the astronomical growth in the relatively new drop-shipping trend. Shopify is a cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) shopping cart solution. The company offers startups as well as small and big businesses a free platform to launch their store, as well as build their online presence through multiple tools and cloud infrastructure.Nowadays, businesses need to have a strong footprint in online shopping, and Shopify has been a catalyst for the success of many, providing access to numerous tools like Shopify Capital, Shopify Pay, and Shopify Shipping. They also get access to the large Shopify App Store. While the company has been truly amazing, revolutionizing online shopping and positively impacting in their sector, over the past year, the stock's valuation has been increasing beyond reasoning. Shopify's growth has been spectacular over the past five years; however, as with all businesses, the growth eventually slows down. The company had been growing revenues north of 100% YoY nearly four years ago. Since then, while the growth remains impressive, it has slowed down to a little under 50% YoY, as it continues its downward trajectory. While deceleration on the rate of revenue growth has constantly been increasing, few businesses can still expand sales at such a jaw-dropping rate. Shopify has positioned itself excellently to take advantage of the e-commerce era, as management skillfully rides the wave of online shopping growth.However, no matter how impressive a company's growth is, how deep its moat is, or how skillful the management is to keep on delivering, there is a point at which a stock can get too expensive. Shopify's stock has been beyond this point for a long time now. As a result, I don't see how its current valuation can reflect future earnings at any point in time.As you can see below, the stock had been historically trading between 10 and 20 times its sales, which, even though pricy, is relatively common amongst hyper-growth technology firms. However, since the beginning of the year, the stock has been parabolically moving higher with no end on sight, despite no change when it comes to its revenue deceleration. As of writing this article, the stock is trading at more than 38 times its current sales. Moreover, for Shopify to fuel its rapid growth, the company has been continually burning cash, and as a result, has never posted a net income. Losses notably spiked during the last quarter, in which Shopify posted a net loss of $72.8 million, or -$0.64 per share, though that includes a one-time tax provision of $48.3 million. While I am a fan of the burning-cash-for-growth model that Amazon (AMZN) made mainstream, Shopify relies heavily on continuously raising more equity in exchange for cash, continuously diluting its shareholders. The good news is that investors are happy for the company to raise more equity since management has historically been able to transform the extra cash into further growth. Also, Shopify benefits from raising equity at such high multiples, taking advantage of its extraordinarily high stock price. That has allowed the company to build a reasonably large cash position. As of the last earnings report, Shopify had $2.67 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, after raising more cash in the previous quarters.  The question, however, remains. Is Shopify's P/S of 38.4 sustainable? The answer is probably not. For context, the graph below includes various hyper-growth stocks in the technology sector. I make no comparison on their business model, but instead, want to emphasize on how insane Shopify's multiple is. Even TradeDesk (TTD) and Okta (OKTA), which have both seen spectacular turnover growth, don't trade anywhere near Shopify's current P/S. In fact, using Finviz's stock screener, one can confirm that Shopify is the most expensive stock in the whole market, for equities with a market cap above $50B, in terms of P/S. Moreover, the reason I don't see Shopify's valuation as sustainable, is that it never seems to be approaching a tangible level in terms of earnings, at any point in the future. The graph below illustrates the consensus of analysts' estimates in terms of the company's EPS for FY2020 and FY2021.Even if Shopify achieves the higher range estimate of EPS of $1.8 in FY2021, the stock is trading at FY2021 P/E ratio of 258, today. In my view, such valuation is beyond rationality and is not sustainable in the long term.When a stock does not trade on fundamentals, it usually trades in terms of sales growth. Shopify's valuation seems to have gone beyond that level. In the most optimistic and favorable scenario that one can imagine, the stock remains priced beyond perfection. Moreover, if anything was to turn out not as optimistic, there is no doubt that the stock would suffer significant losses, as not earnings will ever support such multiples. Therefore, there is simply no margin of safety for investors to buy here, nor is there any case to be made to justify the stock's valuation. However, based on the stock's past performance, there is simply no way to predict whether Shopify's bubble will continue getting bigger, or whether it will eventually come down to a more rational level. Even when the stock faced a correction during last year, the market quickly took advantage of the drop, launching the stock even higher. Therefore, I don't think trying to predict the future of the stock is sensible, simply because the stock itself is not. Shopify has been a significant catalyst in the success and growth of many businesses, making it a truly special company. Its services have given profound tools and scalability for millions of merchants to take their business to the next level.However, when it comes to investing, I strictly believe that no matter how fast a company is growing, there has to be some point at which future earnings justify its current valuation. In the case of Shopify, I find it hard to see how any future profitability can support its current multiples. With that being said and considering the stock's past performance, to advise on selling the stock would be irresponsible, since any movement in the price occurs beyond any predictable measurement. I will personally stay away from the stock at the moment, and will happily be a buyer, should the stock ever come down to earth."
4314726,104941,2019-12-31T14:49:26-05:00,"Shopify and Square have approached essentially the same business from two opposing angles, but their valuations have diverged significantly. I answer why.The naysayers of both companies have been proven wrong and will continue to be proven wrong today, tomorrow, and into 2020s.I provide an example of ""The Noise"", of which every investor should be wary when playing the contact sport of investing in stocks.While an ideal capital split would be 50/50 between the two, valuations prevent me from recommending such an allocation at present. One is the obvious better buy.","Source: www.merchantmaverick.comBefore we dive into the comparison based on some financial metrics and intangibles, I'd, respectfully, like to shed some light on ""The Noise"", which every single investor faces when holding stocks. I will use a specific example so as to fully illustrate what investors face when buying individual stocks. I believe this is massively beneficial to new and old investors because it serves as a lesson and reminder that we should conduct our due diligence, make our own decisions, and stick to those decisions despite ""The Noise"", which could even come from trusted experts in the investing community at times.Boy, oh, boy have Square (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) been great companies for the longs, the optimists, and the small business owners. Not only have the companies produced outsized gains for their investors over the last 3-5 years, they have also facilitated the growth of millions of small business owners' operations.Those for whom these have not been great investments have been the naysayers, the pessimists, the perennial bears, and a certain firm whose name begins with Cit and ends with ron. As an aside, we're looking forward to the charitable contribution Citron will be making in April of 2020 to the tune of $200k.Source: Citron's TwitterTo be fair, Shopify has one more earnings report on February 11th, 2020 before Citron's donation becomes set in stone.Though I haven't written on either of these companies as yet, you will find that throughout my comment history I've been a staunch advocate for Shopify, from when it was trading around $190. When it was trading at this level, ""The Noise"" was ringing loud and proud. The Citron bet you see above called for sub $100 within the year; however, for me, the narrative behind Shopify was just too compelling to believe that the market would allow an entry point below $150, much less below $100.I want to be clear that I'm not just hating on Citron. I don't dislike them because I focus on the long side of investing, and they the short side (usually). I actually believe they are essential market participants whose presence benefits all investors immensely, most of the time.I cite their call in April of 2019, because I think it's exceptionally important to portray to investors that ""experts"" can be wrong and are often wrong (Just look at Buffett's Kraft-Heinz investment). And if you feel convicted that a company is a great buy because you use their service or have had a great experience with the company, then you should remain resolute and stick with your investment, despite what any expert shouts at you through their hyperbolic writing and statistical speculations.So, I defended Shopify, purchased more of its stock and have ridden it to where it rests now in the low $400s.I certainly did not expect Shopify to rocket to its current price level. In fact, when I was defending the stock, I didn't entirely expect it to rise much into the 200s, as it was already priced very expensively; however, I knew such a tasty entry point as sub $100 wouldn't arrive without something of a black swan event for the company.With respect to Square, I've continued to add at its current 50s-60s price level for a few reasons.Source: YCharts.comFurther, relative to Shopify, Square offers a significantly more compelling value. At just around 6x sales and 40% sales growth, the company isn't what many would consider outlandishly expensive. Conversely, Shopify is what I think nearly everyone would consider outlandishly expensive. Such can be seen in the chart below.Source: YCharts.comFor just 32x sales, you can have the pleasure of owning a company that doesn't currently generate free cash flow. I say this tongue-in-cheek because Shopify's growth initiatives, such as Fulfillment by Shopify (which they initiated with a $450M investment in an already existing warehousing service, 6 Rivers Systems) are eating not only into their operating margins but also their free cash flow. Nevertheless, from whatever perspective you view Shopify, it is extremely expensive at its current valuation.So, from a valuation perspective, Square is unequivocally the better buy. In fact, I could not in any sense recommend buying Shopify at its current valuation, despite loving the company. Shopify is simply priced to absolute perfection, and the slightest slip-up in an earnings report or during a conference call could easily send the stock sliding 15-25%. Easily.What I find most interesting about Square and Shopify is that they were conceived with the same objective in mind: furnish to small business owners the tools to create the businesses of their dreams. However, the path to achieving this goal occurred at different ends of the small business spectrum for each of the companies, respectively.For Square, the original tool was the little square attachment that plugged into smartphones, which allowed merchants to receive payments from anywhere. This evolved into an entire POS system that served brick and mortar small businesses. This part of the narrative is essential to understanding how these companies are presently valued, because it sheds light on how they've evolved into the giants they are today and, more importantly, their trajectories moving forward.So, Square began catering to brick and mortar small businesses, and today, that remains their bread and butter. They have, however, entered into the online space more aggressively with their recent acquisition of Weebly. While this hardly scratches the surface of competing with Shopify, it does promote omni-channel execution by Square's primarily brick and mortar customers and ensures these small business owners can stay in Square's ecosystem without having to use the software of a competitor. Brick and mortar will continue to be a fantastic business for Square, as there are innumerable businesses that operate entirely offline, i.e., barbershops, ice cream parlors, and miniature golf courses to name a few.On the other hand, Shopify began catering to online sellers through what was essentially an online framework, into which small business owners would plug and play (read: sell) their offerings. Today, Shopify boasts over 1 million merchants on their platform (Find a list of their best hosted stores here.) Further, their gross sales volume is increasing at about 50% yoy.Shopify has emphasized creating tools for online sellers, and as a result, today, Shopify is basically the only option for individuals looking to sell their products, first and foremost, online through their own brand. Yes, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) allow small businesses to sell online, but no small business could truly develop their own brand without their own online storefront.As you've probably gleaned by now, Shopify has approached small business from an online first angle; whereas, Square has approached small business from a brick and mortar first angle. This has created very different realities for the companies in terms of what they can offer new or transitioning business owners, and their evolutions are worth considering when you decide into which company to pour your capital.Will e-commerce absolutely dominate brick and mortar in the future? I would say that e-commerce is having its time in the spotlight through its meteoric growth, but brick and mortar will persist, and businesses that cannot operate online will still usually seek out Square before any other option.Because of this dichotomy in their business models, i.e., Shopify focuses primarily on online sellers, and Square focuses primarily on brick and mortar, I believe we have seen a massive divergence in the two companies' valuations. While playing around with their charts, I stumbled on a comparison of what $10k would look like, had it been invested in the two companies five years ago. Source: YCharts.comFor the first few years, they traded in almost lockstep. However, recently, there has been a stark divergence between the two companies. I attribute this fact to the idea that Square's brick and mortar offering has been somewhat commoditized, though we could say the same for Apple's products, yet their strength of brand and quality of product continue to build and maintain their moat. Further, Investors have woken up to the massive moat that Shopify has constructed, (I'm about to make another Apple analogy... sorry) which is similar to the ecosystem Apple created, and out of which many ne'er venture. Shopify has become the central platform for developers to build apps that facilitate commerce on the internet, with over 3200 available to business owners that operate on Shopify.That is, while Square's moat has seemingly had bridges built over it left and right by competitors, Shopify has grown theirs in a prodigious way, through their ecosystem and now via Fulfillment by Shopify that investors have fallen in love with the narrative. Keep in mind that Square's moat that allegedly has all of these bridges continues to generate approximately 40% yoy revenue growth with around a 40% gross margin. Hardly a company that has been dismantled by a perfectly competitive industry.In sum, today, I recommend picking up only Square, because it actually offers a compelling valuation that has lagged the broader market. I would say Square is a ""growth at a reasonable price"" (GARP) situation, to quote the great Peter Lynch. In contrast, Shopify's valuation has taken the form of what I'd call ""irrational exuberance"". Yes, Shopify is the only option for small business owners looking to truly win at online retail. However, at the present price, there's just no room for error, and they are executing incredibly ambitious projects that won't roll out with absolute perfection over the next 12, 24, and 36 months. There will be some degree of reversion to the mean eventually for Shopify; at which time, I will write again and recommend that everybody buy the fantastic company that is Shopify."

Thank you for having me.NB: Thanks for joining. So, yes, it sounds like from the sound of it From Growth to Value implies a couple of different theories here of investing and strategy. So, why don’t we start off and you tell us about your investment strategy?K: Yes. Well, I love the question in that sense that I mean it has indeed several implications. I mean, one of the implications is that I look at growth and value, but also something else that already is some sort of pinnacle of my investing side and that is that if you have growth stocks and you hold them for a very long time, they become value stocks. You know, if you look at stocks like Walmart, Walmart was a growth stock for a long time, but now it’s a value stock, for example. So, that's already very important in my investing strategy holding on, but before we start, maybe I just want to say something there is a lot of confusion I think about investing in that sense that a lot of people try to convince other people that their style of investing is the best one. I don't think that. I mean you have to find an investing strategy which fits you and your personality.I heard on the Invest Like the Best, the podcast of Patrick O'Shaughnessy, that there are 300 investing strategies that consistently beat the market and I think that it's important that you find the one that fits you. So, I was actually more of a value investor at first, but I found that it didn't fit my personality; it didn't fit who I am. I'm forward-looking, I'm optimistic and – well, that being said, my strategy is actually based on optimism and a lot of people concentrate too much in my opinion on pessimism, on the bad news. You know, if you look at the news in general, it's often very bad and pessimistic and, you know, the world’s going to hell etcetera, but if you look at both reality and the stock market, actually they both go up and they get better and better and better.Yes, there are setbacks. Yes, there are things which could be better, but in the long-term, everything gets better, and if you know that, you're already in a minority. I mean, the majority of people focus on the short-term; they focus on the bad news; they focus on everything that could go wrong and what I do is I focus on the winners and that's also why I try to – you know, first maybe I have to explain what I mean by focusing on the winners. If you have even one multibagger in your portfolio that means your portfolio is going to do a lot better than any benchmark you take. You know, if you – in 2000, if you had Amazon in your portfolio and you have owned them till now, well no matter what other stocks you took, you will do very well. And that's actually what I try to do with potential multibaggers. I think the name itself already says a lot. I tried to find multibaggers.Inherently, there will be losers as well, but you always have to lose. Even if you have a value stock, you also will have losers because they’re value traps and you hadn’t seen it etcetera. and the difference is because of the potential of those multibaggers if you focus on the good things and you try to crank up even the winning sides of investing by looking at stocks of companies that grow very fast, and you do the opposite of most people who do growth investing or practice growth investing that is holding on and offsetting one, you know, it doubles are so or 30% up or whatever. If you just hold on for very long periods and you even add to your winners then I think you can have a few stocks which can mean everything, and if you look at potential multibaggers, I said that before I started the series because the first 10 articles were free on the Seeking Alpha, and I said that before and I rode a rather theoretical article first, which still is free even for not premium members because it's about several tickers and I already wrote that that, by the way the title is, This is why you should have growth stocks in your portfolio, and the title already says something namely that if you take a few good growth stocks, even if you pick very bad other growth socks, then, you know, well, you’ll do better than the markets.Now of course, with my service, with my marketplace, I try to weed out the losers as much as possible, but inherently, some things don't work out as well, you think they will work out and you will have losers, but, you know, I picked Amazon – Shopify sorry, at I think $77. It at $420 now and that's just I mean May 2017. If you have a few of those in your portfolio, well, it will do very well, and you know, the results are there – and – I mean that’s a – there’s an alpha and well, it's Seeking Alpha, right, and there is an alpha of 33% versus the S&P, which is not bad I think, and then, of course, if the market turns down and that’s the pessimistic side, which will come…NB: Yes.K: …you know actually we will never know what, when, but it will come. Well, okay. You know those stocks will go down probably a lot more than the market, but well, in the long term, I think they will do great. I mean if you bought Amazon – again Amazon, I mean Shopify, but you know Shopify is the new Amazon, so if you have Shopify, well, it can go down. If the market goes down 25%, Shopify can go down maybe 50%.NB: Sure.K: …but you will still be up, you know, I’m not that good at math, but, you know, what is it? 200% then or so. So, that’s something that some people don't realize that you – that they always look at the most pessimistic part as if you always buy at the top and never scale in. I always scale in over years and years in stocks. So, and there’s also – if you have a stock and it goes up about five times, for example, let’s takes a theoretical example, you take two stocks, they both cost $100 and three years later, one is up five times and the other one is minus, I don’t know 60% or so. Well, they still do very well, compared to the market and that's actually the good basic philosophy of potential multibaggers.NB: Very interesting. It’s a challenge obviously to find these growth stocks. Going back real quick to your strategy here, it says here on your Seeking Alpha page, you do not care what this selection of stocks will do next year and what the result will be in 2040 or so. So, really a long-term outlook, but finding these stocks and these companies that are going to be the next Amazon, the next Shopify is obviously a major challenge for investors. How do you go about wheeling down all of the universe of potential multibaggers to find the ones that you end up investing in?K: Yes. well, my readers know that I only include or especially my subscribers know that I only include stocks in potential multibaggers, which I think – I mean it happens that I have held them for a year or longer for a very small position in my portfolio just to keep researching, and if you have a small position, you're more inclined to research deeper. So, yes, I mean, you have to look at lots and lots and lots of things. So, what do I do? I study, I read, I listen to podcast. I read books, I read articles, I try to keep up with everything and there are lots of alternative ways to look at the things, of course, the financials are important, but how happy are the people who work at the company that you're buying stock, that's so important.Investors don’t always realize that. There's also a lot of fog sometimes. I mean, for example, one of the ways in which you can check how happy people are is Glassdoor, but, yes, sometimes there’s a very bad – well, a very bad mark or it's a low, but then if you read those things, you see that, well, it's all aimed at one manager who was fired three years ago.NB: Right.K: So, you know, you really have to look into it hard and read the lots before you – well, before I have enough confidence to include them in the potential multibaggers.NB: Interesting. What about your background as an investor? You’ve been doing this for a little while, can you tell us a little bit about that and you came to this particular type of investing style?K: Yes. Well, it's been quite a long road actually. I mean, I was rather passive for a long time, passive investor, and you know, just buying stock market, and then, when my wife was pregnant, I had the change. I mean I don’t know, it was some sort of feeling deep inside is that typically male, I don’t know, but I really wanted something for my child, you know, and I wanted to put something away and already, of course there was already some investing, but I really cranked up my game and I started reading voraciously first as a value investor, as I said, but then I found my own style as it were, I’m something who’s excited by new evolutions and long-term trends and that's how I came to the – well, the growth side more of things. Although – well, and my readers know that I also have the Pink Portfolio, which is still free on Seeking Alpha as well and that's investing for our daughter, that's her real life portfolio and – well, that's where it originated from actually.NB: Cool. Yes, and I noticed some of your recent additions to the Pink Portfolio that I wanted to talk to you about maybe in the second half of the program, some pretty interesting stock picks here.K: Yes, I want to make sure those are two completely different approaches of potential multibaggers and a Pink Portfolio.NB: Sure.K: Sometimes readers confuse them, so I – the stocks in the Pink Portfolio are not multibaggers, or not potential multibaggers at all.NB: Okay, okay. So, let’s stick to the multibaggers and for the purposes of this conversation.K: Alright.NB: Since that’s what we’ve been talking about. So, is there anything over the past year you think – it’s been a pretty tumultuous year, good year for growth stocks, good year for risk assets in general? Is there anything that you’ve learned in particular over the past year you think that you could now take to your investing style as we move forward into 2020?K: Yes. Well, actually the same thing, but in a more concentrated form. I mean ignore the noise and just keep on going and look at the stocks and not at the general markets. And again, there's so much pessimism and you have to look through the fog even if there would be recession, so what? I mean – and again, there are different styles of investing and, you know, if you’re retired, you'll invest differently than if you're still accumulating, and – well, I’m 43 years old, but I still feel, you know, in my 30s or so, and – well, I’m still – I’m accumulating, and again, that's me. Someone else of 43 can be rather conservative and you have to adapt your own style of investing to your personality.I have seen that I attract quite a lot of young readers and I like that a lot because, well, they are – one of the target audiences for this. I mean it’s very good to think long term if you're young. I mean I really like that. On the other hand, I have subscribers who are in their 50s and still have that, you know, energy and drive to look for long-term awareness. So, again, what have I learned about – in the last year? I have learned a lot because that's one of those things that makes me enthusiastic about the stock market is that you’ll never stop learning. You keep on learning, but not particularly because of the movements of the markets. you know the longer you see the markets, the more you realize they always stay the same time and there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of talking, and you know, the television hours have to be filled, but it doesn't mean something, and especially, not if you look at individual stocks.NB: Yes, no doubt. No doubt. So, what is something here – we’ve talked a lot about optimism and about finding growth stocks and looking beyond the noise. Nevertheless, I'm sure you won't deny that there is risk that's out there whether it's, you know, something that people should be concerned about is another question, but what is something about the markets or about your portfolio that concerns you at present?K: Well, it’s not something for at this moment particular, but in general, it's very hard to, you know – it's simple, but not easy to hold on to your stocks if they go down 40%, 50%. So, one of the things that I try to do – at this moment I don’t have to say to my subscribers, oh! No. you really have to hold to this stock. It’s so good because the market is doing great. But I'm very sure that at the moment that a few stocks go down a lot that I will have to help them to hold onto their stocks because – and that's really a risk. I mean, you – especially with those fast growers, you really can lose a lot of money if you sell at the wrong time and if you buy at a peak and then sell at the bottom, and it's typical for stocks in general, but even more for those, well, high-growth [stocks], that's I think the biggest risk of my approach actually.NB: Interesting, okay. So, what would you say to [indiscernible] other than just keep an eye on the long term always and maybe do you view that – if there is a dip, do you view that as an opportunity to accumulate more of the shares?K: If there’s a general markets dip, yes. If there’s a dip in the stock, one single stock, you always have to look at what's going on really. I mean, some things re-fundamentally change, yes, the long-term perspective. I mean if there's a new competitor and that competitor takes a lot of your markets, well, that's changes the view, you know. So, it has a lot of things in life. It depends.NB: Yes, good point. Good point. Okay, the flip side of that previous question, going back to a more optimistic track, what are some things that have you most excited right now? You mentioned new technologies before, and yes, so I’d be curious about that, what is – what are some of the areas that you’re most excited about?K: Yes. One of the things – I always try to look at long-term trends. You know technology stocks often have the reputation of going very fast or technology in general, but actually technology is slow too. I mean, if you look at the Internet, I was one of the first in my community to have the Internet. I think it was 1994, 1995 or so. My father was a computer engineer, so he liked that and that's why we had it at home.I was, I don’t know 18 or so then. You know, if you had to explain to people what the Internet was, that was very, very difficult because they didn't have something to compare it with and if you look at the general public, well, it took well into the 2000s and nearly before the general public was on the Internet and that's actually the same thing now and that will always be the case. You have technology [geeks] let’s call them, who are very, very, very excited about a certain new technology, new opportunity, but before it hits the general market that takes years and years and years, and that’s something that investors should know. So, it's – well, you have to find a balance between investing in new technology and the viability in the markets. So, that's something I try to do and I – if I look at the markets right now from that perspective and if look what are the long-term trends then, then I see several things, you know.One of the most important things that I see now is unscaling and I’ve read a book, which was called Unscaled. I don’t remember the author, it was an [indiscernible], but a very interesting book in which he said that well, because of the trends that we see, namely AI and genetic testing, etcetera, you will be – that will be unscaling. you know now everything is big and the bigger, the better. but it will be a lot more targeted and you already think – I think you can already see that a bit in the Amazon, and Shopify say, in that sense that Shopify is much more individual and people hated if Amazon shows lots of sponsored content, which they don't want. And I think that's one of the first issues of or the first examples of unscaling already, but it goes a lot further. I mean healthcare for example, you know, at this moment there are so many drugs already and if you see – if you look at the drugs that are being developed now, what you often see is the gain is not that much. I mean often it’s about orphanage diseases – orphan diseases, sorry like I mean maybe hundreds, 100 or 200 people in the whole U.S. who have a certain disease and that drug is developed, which costs millions and millions and millions.I mean, it's impossible that that will go on. I mean both for the drug companies, but also, of course, for public health spending and what you will see is that more drugs will be developed, especially for that person or that type of person. So, if you have a certain disease, well, you'll be able to choose between several drugs, which are oh! This is your type. You better take this. Now, it’s just, well, try this. Oh! It doesn't work. Let’s take something else, so that's unscaling too. Another example, shoes for example, now you have, you know, few thousands of pairs of shoes, which you can choose from, but, you know, they are not fitted to your feet and your feet can be I don’t know a bit bigger or whatever, then your right one and – you have shoes which fit, but they're not perfect.If they can be, I don’t know 3D printed for you, scanned and 3D printed for you, well, that's, you know, and that's unscaling. You go to the individual again and not to the mass-markets and that's actually how it has been for centuries before the Industrial Revolution.NB: Yes, interesting there Shopify is clearly one company that is taking advantage and exploiting that trend. Are there others that you found in your research that you can speak to that are also doing this unscaling, like how would an investor be able to profit from this? Like, what other companies are seeing that you think are at the front end of this?K: Yes. Well, several, but let’s take The Trade Desk, for example. The Trade Desk is a typical example of unscaling, because you know, it's not a guarded wall, [indiscernible] excuse me. It’s the opposite. It's everywhere, and for example, you know, one of the most important trends in The Trade Desk then is that it plays on the connected TV and connected TV is unscaling because you choose what you want to see. It's not, you know, CNBC or whatever or whoever – who chooses what you will look at. You know, no, you choose your programs and The Trade Desk is one of the – well one of the companies that will take advantage over that because they can diversify their ads to that public, so that's one. Another example, which comes to mind is, for example, Square. I mean, now we have big banks and everyone is the same for that bank and you’re just a number and the Wells Fargo scandal showed that again, you know as long as the numbers.If you’re a customer, even if you're not a real customer, you turn out, but people are sick of that. People want to be individual and with Square, you get your own bank. In the long term it's not – they have applied for a banking license, but is not there yet, but in the long term, I think Square will be some sort of new bank in which you can choose all the options that you want, you know. if you want to trade stocks with Square, alright. If you don't want to, you can choose I don’t know Robin Hood or another, and that's how people will be able to individually choose their own offerings.NB: Cool. Very cool. Alright, so we got into a little bit here as far as favorite – you know some ideas that you have as far as companies that might be able to profit from these themes? Are there any favorite ideas that you have where these or other trends are concerned right now?K: Well, those are really two of my favorite ideas, you know.NB: Sure, okay.K: The Trade Desk and Square, also because people don't realize yet the full potential I think. For example, for Square they have cash app and it's not monetized that well yet, although in just three years time. It’s already their biggest source of revenue, you know people still associate Square with the point-of-sale technology, but cash app is already a bigger contributor to revenue. Of course, the point-of-sale is at this moment more profitable, but that will change, I’m very sure, and what Square is doing is its building out its ecosystem. Well, it has -- actually has two, you know, the merchants and, you know, the individual consumer, and once they can combine the two, they have a goal in mind. I mean one of the things that is in that book unscales too is that – and, you know, it's a popular saying data is the new goal or the new oil and I think – the oil and I think it's a good comparison in that sense that no oil changed everything the way transportation went or, you know, with the trains and cars, etcetera, the way electricity was made, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. I think you will see the same thing with data. It will change everything, and, you know, well, you think there will be some companies which will prosper a lot from data and Square is actually very well-positioned there because they will have a lot of data from both sides.NB: Alright. So Trade Desk, TTD, Square, SQ, those are some pretty good ideas. Okay, Kris, thank you.

4317660,102465,2020-01-17T15:50:43-05:00,"Pushed to all-time highs of $448 to start 2020.YTD return is just shy of +180%, compared to the market which is up 24.7%.I still believe in the stock, but it is currently overrun and now is a good time to secure some profits.","Shopify (SHOP) has been a market darling ever since its IPO back in 2015. Since it has hit the market, it has soared roughly 1875%. Major congratulations go out to anyone who has bought it and held on for the entire ride. I am not in a position where I would be selling the entire holding, but there is a great opportunity to lock in some profits right now and buy again down the road as the price sees a correction. This article may not appeal to those who buy and hold forever, but for those more active investors who are looking to lock in some early 2020 profits and start the year off strong!(Source: Simplywall.st)For those who do not know, Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business online. Shopify is an entirely cloud-based network that takes a lot of the hosting stresses off the business owner. This provides flexibility for the owner to access and run their website from anywhere with an internet connection.What Does The Future Hold?If we simply look at nothing but Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM) numbers for Shopify over the last two years, their tally for 2019 was $2.9 Billion in Gross Merchant Volumes (GMV). That means we saw a 61% increase YoY from the $1.8 Billion that was done on BFCM in 2018.Current projections are for their explosive growth to continue over the next few years and, finally, become profitable in 2022. As you can see below, Shopify is going to continue to grow earnings at roughly 47% per year, and revenues at roughly 28%, which is faster than the market rate of 7.5% per year.(Source: Simplywall.st)This data will be driven by increasing the GMV, which comes from new merchants signing on board. It is predicted that Q4 GMV will increase by roughly 38%. With the company estimating that there are over 45 million customers globally on their radar and not a ton of competition in the space as of now, there is lots of room for growth in the years to come without much standing in its way.The biggest challenge for Shopify coming down the pike is rolling out the Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN). SFN has the potential to boost revenues by $120 million by 2021. The risk part comes in when talking about delays for a full-blown roll out as the company ensures the offering will meet its stringent requirements. If this is successful, it will present another tough barrier for the competition to overcome to really be a threat to Shopify.Taking a look at the valuation, which I will add is always off when it comes to tech companies due to a lack of revenue. Majority of the time, these kinds of stocks come in ""overvalued"", but this is on the high end. Let me be clear, I do not expect the price to correct to $224.23 ever, barring something goes terribly wrong. But the below image shows that the current valuation given by the market is a bit high. Most target prices that I could see for the year were in the $455-465 range. We are already not far off that mark and we are only 15 days into the new year, this is why the current valuation is a little concerning to me.(Source: Simplywall.st)With Q4 data coming in February, we can expect that some of the news will be priced in, but naturally, the stock will drift one way or another shortly after results.The stock had a very, very impressive 2019 pushing 220% returns over the entire year. This including a pretty heavy price correction of 24% from September to November. But the stock had a very strong run to finish out 2019, and that has continued into 2020 as the stock is up 59% off the November lows. I hope you can start to see why taking profits now may be a wise decision.(Source: TC2000.com)Looking at the chart above, we can see just how explosive 2019 was for Shopify. As stated above, I believe 2020 will be a good year overall for the stock. However, now is a good time to take profits. The stock has a very turbulent past, and investors can capitalize on these swings.(Source: TC2000.com)Looking above, I have taken the 2018 chart and broken it down into the swings throughout the year. Shopify has been a very volatile stock over the past 5 years when compared to its industry peers. Looking at the chart above, we can see just how true this is. There are drops in the price every 3-4 months. You can look back and see the same is true is 2017. But, what this shows is that the stock always recovers very quickly. For the investors that just want to hold the stock forever and never look at it, the good news is the stock always manages to finish the year to the positive as the rebounds are larger than the previous decline. That said, I believe we could see the stock pattern look similar to 2018 this current year after the explosive year that it had in 2019.Love the stock or hate it, if you want to increase your annual return, selling portions when the stock becomes overdone is the best way to lock in returns. You may not always be 100% correct and could miss a couple more days of potential return, but trust me when I say, it is more fun locking in profits than panic selling when things start to turn.The fundamentals remain very solid for Shopify, and the company continues to excel, but the valuation where it currently is, is a little concerning. The way the shares are currently trading is not sustainable and something has to give to bring them back slightly. There will begin to be a decline in growth rates and with that, stock price growth should slow as well. I fully expect a strong year from the company and would by no means sell all my shares, but this is a great opportunity to lock in some profits as the stock spikes. Depending on what happens, you should get an opportunity to re-invest those profits before Q4 earnings in February. Which, I expect to be very strong."
4317957,69905,2020-01-20T20:05:16-05:00,"Dissecting Shopify's business model and pointing out its key flaw.As its shares climb higher and higher, this stock has become increasingly risky.The stock is best avoided.","Shopify's (SHOP) share price continues its aggressive appreciation. If there was a point in time when this company's narrative could turn into strong profits, thereby making its valuation compelling, this potential has long ago been abandoned.With declining growth rates and more competition than ever before, investors are now chasing the stock on hope rather than on rational analysis. This investment is best avoided. Here's why:The recent run-up on Shopify's share price came to me as a surprise - I'll acquiesce. Speculation of M&A potential was all it took for this overvalued investment to increase its valuation. Indeed, as David Einhorn reminds us:Admittedly, with so many companies' share prices dramatically increasing the past couple of months, why not Shopify too? And the sell-side too, for its part, is more than happy to see the share price increase - after all, this makes their job so much easier (and more profitable).Moving on, what makes Shopify a highly alluring investment is the rhetoric that goes side by side with it. It speaks of modernity, of being ahead of its time, something esoteric and daring. Altogether, with its rising share price, this makes the stock unavoidable for fear of missing out.Still, as I highlighted earlier last month in an article titled Shopify: Declining Growth Rate in the graph below:Source: Author's workWe can see the rapidity with which Shopify's top line is declining. Accordingly, investors should take a step back and appraise why the company's top line is reducing its growth rate at such a fast pace.For Shopify to grow its top line, it needs to continuously increase the number of merchants coming onto its platform.Then, the company sells valued-added services (Merchant Solutions) to these merchants, which works like leverage to increase its top line.Put another way, if a new merchant comes onto Shopify's platform, the company is able to sell the entrepreneur ""value-adds"" to help the merchant set up their shop.The problem is that many new merchants will fail to make their business profitable enough to keep going month after month. As you know, running a business is a challenging endeavor, fraught with risk.Whence, the merchant calls it a day on their endeavor, Shopify has not only lost its merchant, but it has lost its ability to sell that merchant value-adds.The next problem is that Shopify now has to seek out a new merchant. But that's not a problem, is it? Actually, this right here is exactly where we find the problem. As long as the merchant stays on the platform, the company is able to sell that merchant a rolling subscription (Merchant Solutions).Source: Author's work, Do Not Stay PassiveThus, as you can see above, the profits from Shopify's Subscription Solutions are terrific and fair outweigh its profits from Merchant Solutions.Please note, even though Subscription Solutions are substantially more profitable to Shopify than its Merchant Solutions segment, the bulk of the company's revenues are derived from its Merchant Solutions. Specifically, 60% of Shopify's revenue is generated from its Merchant Solutions.In an ideal scenario, merchants would adopt Shopify's platform and succeed with their business. This would allow the company to retain that merchant and renew their subscription, which is far more profitable to Shopify's operations. But that is not so, as reality gets in the way.As the table below demonstrates, there is no margin of safety in Shopify's present valuation.Source: Author's calculationsAs a reminder, going into late 2019, many SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies were being priced at close to 20x trailing sales. These were richly valued companies, but their business models made these sorts of valuations (somewhat) justifiable.SaaS players boast of their annual subscription revenues, with some of them having medium and large enterprises signing up for 3-year subscription models. With that sort of long-term visibility and predictability, and the customer base not going anywhere, it is understandable why SaaS players are able to hold onto these sorts of valuations.But in the case of Shopify, the absolute opposite takes place. As discussed above, the bulk of its merchants are on monthly rolling contracts - small-time entrepreneurs who struggle to make their businesses profitable.Also, not only are investors already paying 36x its trailing revenues, the company is evidently unprofitable on a GAAP basis, and increasingly so.Shareholders clamor for Shopify's shares and chase them higher.Meanwhile, I declare that these shares have long ago abandoned any prospects of being a reasonable investment. Presently, this stock is nothing more than speculation."
4310525,69905,2019-12-04T14:04:59-05:00,Dissecting Shopify's growth rates.Digging into Shopify's multiple.Why investors are going to struggle to find a positive return here.,"Shopify (SHOP) continues to be priced on the belief that online, direct-to-consumer brands will be the only shopping experience for consumers globally.But in a highly fragmented market, common sense should lead investors to reconsider this one-size-fits-all consumer approach.Presently, Shopify's shareholders are overpaying for hype while they turn their backs on reality. With no margin of safety, compounded with poor visibility into downstream GAAP profit margins, this stock is simply not a compelling investment. Here's why:Shopify is a growth stock. Thus, investors are focused on two characteristics when it comes to valuing its stock: its growth rate and its predictability.Accordingly, I wish to shed some light on these two aspects:Source: Author's calculations, including Q4 2019 high-end guidanceThe first attribute which I believe bears significance is the unavoidable truth demonstrated above that Shopify is rapidly slowing down. This should not be news to any reader.But what I believe is insightful is the repercussions this will have on Shopify's multiple.Indeed, Shopify attempts to shape its narrative as a steady and predictable business model. One with a strong level of monthly recurring revenue ('MRR') sources. But let's stop and question the factuality of this proposed business model.The bulk of Shopify's revenues are made up of its merchant solution and not its subscription solutions.Source: Author's calculations; Q3 2019 press statement; operating segmentsAs you can see above, close to 60% of Shopify's revenues are made up of ''value-added'' services to merchants subscription solutions. Why does this matter? Because the profitability derived from this segment is fairly mediocre.Consider that Shopify's merchant solutions are principally coming from its payment processing fees from Shopify Payments. In other words, Shopify's merchant solutions are simply taking a fee from its Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). And why is this significant? Because the profits derived from this revenue stream are razor-thin. How can I tell?Firstly, because we can see gross profit margins typically oscillate around 36%. But more importantly, we should note that this is simply a fee-taking model. In fact, below its gross profit margins are Shopify's truly significant costs, which are predominantly made of employees' stock-based compensation.Source: Author's calculations; 10-K, 10-QsAccordingly, as you can see above is a very different narrative from the one Shopify wishes to present. Rather than an asset-light payment system for merchants, we are met with an enterprise with slowing growth rates and with a lack of profitability.Source: Author's calculationsIf Shopify was a monopoly, where merchants had no other options, I could thoroughly comprehend shareholders' enthusiasm for the stock.But as the table above reflects, not only does Shopify have numerous competitors (I only listed three), but they are all being priced significantly cheaper than Shopify's stock.Lest we forget, not only is Amazon (AMZN) no ''pushover,', but Amazon is not an actual partner of Shopify. In fact, Amazon is also very eager to find new sources of revenue.With the above facts, how is it possible to argue that Shopify makes for a compelling investment opportunity?SourceCharlie Munger explains that Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) success is largely derived from their ability to destroy their best ideas. Similar, Keynes relates that it is not finding new ideas which is the problem, but escaping the old ones.Historically, Shopify has been such a rewarding investment that investors are unwilling to question how the future will play out. Presented with an overvalued stock with declining growth rates, investors are priming themselves for permanent loss of capital."

If you truly regret a purchase, sell it immediately. You can always buy it back after you are sure.","Trump's speech yesterday was bellicose and threatening. If this was 2 months ago, it would have cratered the market. He threatened to raise tariffs if there was no agreement, and by stating that ""if there was no agreement,"" it meant that Phase 1 was not baked into the cake. Remember when the deal was announced with great fanfare? All it needed, and I am quoting the ""dealmaker-in-chief"" was that the agreement needed to be ""papered"".What did the market do? Surprisingly or actually not (at least to this observer) it closed flat yesterday, and after weakness this morning coming in from Europe and Asia influencing our futures, the market is continuing higher. There are two theories:Theory 1: Trump is just being Trump, the Chinese are dithering and stalling. They want some good faith reduction in current tariffs and not just rescinding the next tranche of tariffs on December 15.The White House is divided into 2 factions. Those who want to get any kind of deal on the books and then do the heavy lifting into next year at the height of the election campaign. They want a win now.The other faction is the trade war hawks that don't care if the stock market sells off and argues that Phase 1 is the most important step. In this theory, logic will win out, and there will be a deal no matter what because both sides need it.The market is wisely discounting that a deal will happen by looking through the current static to see a positive end result.Theory 2: The market is bored with the whole thing by now. In the teeth of this scare, the US is doing just fine, and the consumer is rocking.In this scenario, the market is contrarian in that international corporations have had years moving what they can move out of China, and now the additional tariff costs will be borne by a combination of the consumer and product mix. In this logical argument, the market participants make note of the fact that the world is recovering from the change in trade flows and the US is growing at a 2% rate. This is where many economists say is the US trend anyway.If China and the US walk away from each other, the market dips 3%, consolidates its gains, and then moves higher like it's doing already. Powell has committed to NEVER raising rates ever again, or at least that is what it sounded like this morning. Employment has been below 4% going into the second year. Workers, while not plentiful, are coming into the workforce. Corporate profits are predicted to grow between 6% and 9% in 2020. Goldilocks!It should surprise no one that I ascribe to ""Theory 2"". The market is just jaded and has moved on; it has discounted the effects of tariffs, and there has been no hint of inflation, and no hint of the consumer not powering ahead. In fact, I think that if the trade deal does come through, the market goes that much higher.In ""Theory 1"", the market has already decided that the trade deal is happening and the only reason for this rally is that the trade deal will happen. When the deal is announced, the market will sell on the news. I am sure you have heard that the market is a ""discounting mechanism""; the key is figuring out what the market has already discounted.Bottom line? The market is rolling like a runaway train; we are going way higher. That doesn't mean we don't get a 3% dip here and there, but this week was the week that I thought we'd get a little static, and... nothing.Proof of my assertion? At the time of this writing, it has been announced that the negotiation has hit a snag over agriculture purchases. The indexes went flat; in the olden days, the indexes would be down 7% in a snap. We are now right back to where we were. Any questions?The health of the market continues to be proved by the constant announcement of deals. We see private equity trying to jump in now while the funding is plentiful and stock prices are CHEAP. That's right, private equity are looking to pick the bottom and sell the high. Going after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and now this announcement about Tech Data (TECD) tells me that the stock market is a Bargain. To wit: TECD, the technology products and services distributor, agreed to be acquired by affiliates of Apollo Global Management (APO) for $130 per share, or about $5.4 billion.This week I have been writing that the Industrials and the transports are part and parcel of this rally. I want to also note that the tech names have also woken up, so have the chips. So I want to chart 3 names in the cloud space that look like they are waking up and should be bought.Shopping Shopify (SHOP)Source: tradingview.comIt looks like Shopify has woken up after market participants treated it rather poorly. We see a classic ""Head and Shoulders"" formation. The right shoulder has fallen lower than the left shoulder, the classic result of that formation. It has since bounced from that level and has shot right through the downtrend line. I believe that SHOP will now move higher. Perhaps not to new highs this year but certainly higher from here.MongoDB (MDB)Source: tradingview.comMDB is displaying an even better formation here. We have an inverse ""Head and Shoulders"" formation, with the right shoulder higher than the left. We also see a broken downtrend line. This is a flat out buy as well.ServiceNow (NOW)Source: tradingview.comThe NOW chart has the craziest ""Cup and Handle"" formation I have seen in a long time. In all fairness, NOW went through a terrible headline bomb. Nike (NYSE:NKE) plucked the CEO of NOW away to take the place of Mark Parker, who will now take the Chairman's seat. Chatter was rife with rumors of NOW having some kind of accounting scandal. Then Bill McDermott got into the fray as the new CEO and reassured market participants that all is well. Attention went back to the quarterly results which were near-perfect.Now, the question is, does NOW still deserve higher prices? The answer is a resounding YES! We see that gap down, in technical parlance, charts will fill gaps. In this case, the gap down will likely be easily filled by the upward movement of NOW. The caution is, how much of the gap that will be filled. I am not sure of that but a gap acts like a magnet and it will pull prices up into it. NOW is a buy right now.Luckin Coffee (LK): The big China-based coffee chain lost $0.32 per share for its latest quarter, smaller than the $0.37 loss expected; revenue was above forecasts. The Starbucks (SBUX) rival also forecast better than expected current-quarter revenue.My Take: Beware, LK IPO lockup is today. Stock is up strong on this positive news. Does that mean that insiders are holding off selling, or have they sold into this rally? Well, the IPO offered 33 million shares. Let's keep an eye on this name and see how much trading volume there is. The normal number of shares traded per day is nearly 3 million. As of 2:45 pm Eastern, 15 million shares have traded. I would stand back.Datadog (DDOG) had its price target raised by analysts at Needham & Company LLC and at Stifel Nicolaus from $45.00 to $48.00 and from $40.00 to $43.00, respectively. They both now have a ""buy"" rating on the stock.My Take: DDOG has grown revenue by 88% and no losses in its earnings results. That is amazing. I would be cautious about buying it right here. It peaked at $41.92 and is now at $39ish. I would trade against that $41.92 level, and if you can get in at below $37 in the next week or so, great give it a shot. Otherwise, wait for it to break above that intraday high for a fast trade.Chesapeake Energy (CHK): R. Brad Martin Director bought 250K shares at $0.91 for $225,500,000 and the CEO Robert D. Lawler bought 50K shares for $45.5K.My Take: This was after the ""Going Concern"" filing last month. If there was a real ""Going Concern"" issue, would these guys throw away a collective $250K? Maybe, but it's trading for $0.80 cents, maybe just for the goof buy a few hundred shares?Their actual performance in moving to oil and liquids is working. Look, I hate the oil business right now. But I love a good risk/reward; if you spend $160 for 200 shares, that's like a bad week of sports betting. If you like taking a train to Jersey to get on Draft Kings, then fine. If you want the same thrill and stay on this side of the Hudson, why not? Obviously, this article is not written just for New Yorkers, but you should get what I am saying in any case. It's a gamble; if you treat this as an ""All In"" recommendation, then please seek counseling.Personally, I am going to hold off and see if there is more insider buying or upgrades by analysts. It got a downgrade by Morgan Stanley. Still, I am very intrigued, I actually bought some, thought better of it and sold it at a tiny loss five minutes later. The lesson here is, there is no shame in changing your mind.Very often, in my past, when my ego was all wrapped up in trading, I would NEVER do that. Once you take a position you should stay loyal to the end. No, my friend, this is not a hometown sports team or adopting a dog, dating or marriage. This is your money, and if you have regret and it is real, then take that loss immediately.The first part of this paragraph was written before I bought CHK, and the latter part was after. I will track this name, and if I get any further confirmation, I WILL pull the trigger. Right now I am glad I dropped it like it was hot.Once again, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is running higher and I am rolling my call spread higher. I got long MDB as well and went back into Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) as well. I spread The Trade Desk (TTD). Finally, I bought, then regretted and immediately sold CHK."
4318531,102646,2020-01-23T08:15:14-05:00,"Shopify is up 42% after my last recommendation in October.Shopify is clearly overvalued using conventional metrics like P/E and P/S.Its revenue growth is slowing, but the growth rate is above average for a company that was founded in 2004.","I have followed and written about Shopify (SHOP) for years. I first invested in the stock in 2015 shortly after the company went public. I loved the company's easy-to-understand business model and its big moat in the e-commerce software business. This thesis became more visible when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shuttered its webstore and referred the clients to Shopify.I held my Shopify shares in December 2018, after I started fearing about the company's slowing momentum. I wrote about the decision to sell in this article. I then started buying the stock again in September when the stock was going through a selloff. I wrote about the decision to buy again in this article. The stock has gained by more than 42% since my last recommendation. In this article, I will review my investment thesis and explain why I have started to wind down my investment ahead of the February 13 earnings report.The just ended decade was characterized by a few things. It was a decade of huge technological advancements that included the iPad, the Apple (AAPL) Watch, Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and e-commerce. According to comScore (SCOR), e-commerce sales rose by 5% to reach $27 billion in the 2009 holiday season. According to Adobe (ADBE), e-commerce sales reached a record $125.6 billion during the 2019 holiday season.This growth in e-commerce was great news for companies that invested in digital. This includes companies like Amazon, Wayfair (W), and eBay (EBAY). It was also a decade where traditional retailers like Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) started to invest heavily in e-commerce. Retailers, like Sears, who lagged behind in digital investments, went out of business.Shopify was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the transition to e-commerce and omnichannel commerce. The company has seen its annual revenue increase from just $23 million in 2012 to more than $1 billion in 2018. It is expected to have made more than $1.5 billion in 2019. Shopify was also a key beneficiary of the drop shipping craze of the past decade. This is because it provided tools to start and run a dropshipping company within days.Source: GoogleShopify has achieved this growth because it has created an e-commerce operating system for companies of all sizes. It offers low-budget startups a free platform to launch their store. As they become successful, they start adding more services like Shopify Capital, Shopify Pay, and Shopify Shipping. They also get access to the large Shopify App Store. All this has seen Shopify add more than a million merchants from around the world.Shopify has been one of the fastest-growing companies. In the most recent quarter, the company's revenue grew by 45% to more than $390 million. The company is expected to see an annual revenue growth of 44% in 2019. This will be lower than the 59% growth of the previous year. Still, it is a great number for a company that was started 16 years ago and one that operates in a crowded space. It competes with well-funded companies like WooCommerce, Wix (WIX), and Big Commerce. The chart below shows the slowdown of Shopify's annual revenue.Source: YChartsI expect this slowdown to continue as the overall growth rate of e-commerce sales start to decline. The company, which has more than a million merchants, will need to reduce churn and increase how it monetizes its installed base.I also expect the company's user growth to slow down. This is simply because the past decade was a period when most big retailers started to implement their e-commerce strategies. I know no serious retail company that does not have an e-commerce platform already. The big stores are usually the best customers because they pay a higher monthly subscription of $299. They are also likely to pay for other additional features like Shopify Plus. Also, their churn rate is usually relatively minimal. Today, most big brands like Nike (NIKE), Lululemon (LULU), and Kylie Cosmetics already own their e-commerce stores.Shopify will also likely see slowing growth from its dropshipping customers. The company's platform is one of the most popular platforms for drop-shippers. These are people who create referral stores. They mostly sell products from AliExpress and other Chinese stores at a higher price. As seen in the image above, Shopify creates ads that target drop-shippers. A YouTube search for Shopify Dropshipping shows videos with hundreds of thousands of views. Most of these videos are of people who are earning referral money from Shopify itself. While dropshipping has been a lucrative industry for some people, I believe that most sellers don't succeed. This could pose a challenge to Shopify's growth this decade.Source: CloudwaysShopify is a great company. As I have written before, I know this because my wife has been selling on Shopify for a few years now. She pays the $79 subscription and pays for some more services in the App Store. Hearing her talk about it was one of the reasons why I invested in the company.While I expect Shopify's growth to slow, the reality is that the company will maintain a good number of subscribers. It will likely continue adding more users than it loses through churn. Also, I expect the company to end the decade while having an annual growth rate of above 15%, which is a reasonable growth rate for a company of this size.However, I expect the management to start shifting from growth at some time. As a reminder, Shopify is a 16-year old company that has never made a profit as shown below. This is usually okay for companies that are showing significant growth like Shopify.Source: YChartsA common mistake that I, other Seeking Alpha contributors, and short-sellers have made is to base their thesis on the company's valuation. When you look at the headline and conventional numbers, the reality is that Shopify is an overvalued company. This is a loss-making company with annual revenue of $1 billion that is being valued for more than $52 billion.While valuation matters, I don't think it matters for a momentum stock at this stage. This is because investors are not mostly focusing on earnings and losses. In most cases, they are focusing on top-line growth. This happens in all growth companies like Tesla (TSLA), Okta (OKTA), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). While Shopify's growth has and will continue slowing, it will take a few more years before the company is viewed as a value play.As mentioned before, I have started winding down the investment that I made in September. The goal is to have no exposure in the company when it releases its quarterly earnings in February. This does not mean I am bearish about the company. The decision is meant to caution my portfolio against any downside risks that may come up after the earnings. In the past, momentum stocks tend to be a bit volatile even after a small earnings miss or weak guidance."
4307957,101848,2019-11-20T06:03:54-05:00,"Shopify is up just over 130% YTD, about 5 times the S&P 500 gain through the second week of November, despite falling into bear territory since peaking in late August.The company fell into the crossfire of an equities selloff and a bond rally as the dark clouds of economic uncertainty enveloped markets in September and October.Economic fundamentals signaled otherwise, as market sentiment abruptly changed, providing a fecund environment for further market momentum.","Toronto-based Shopify (SHOP) is an online e-commerce platform that offers turnkey online, management and, most recently, fulfillment solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses. The company now boasts over 800,000 merchants in 175 countries around the world. Through Monday’s market close, SHOP is up just over 130% YTD, outpacing the S&P 500 benchmark by more than five-fold through Tuesday’s market close (Nov 19). The company has doubled its market capitalization to just over $37 billion, surpassing eBay (EBAY) on the measure earlier this year. SHOP is now on the verge of surpassing eBay in total merchant sales in the all-important US market from which over 70% of the company’s revenue derives.Since hitting its peak stock price for the year on the 27th of August, however, SHOP has fallen into bear territory at just over 22% as market momentum deflated in much of September in the face of an equities selloff and bond rally that darkened skies with global economic uncertainty. Shopify share price fell through its lower trend line of support, shredding an upside Ichimoku cloud whose origin breakout point dates back to mid-January (see Figure 1 upper frame, below). SHOP’s plunge into bear territory appeared oversold in the latter part of September (lower frame), as the company’s market fortunes see-sawed through much of October and into November.Figure 1: Shopify against the S&P 500In spite of this rough patch, SHOP’s consistent double-digit revenue growth remains impressive and gets to the heart of the stock’s current market momentum, despite fair market valuations running at roughly half the current share price. The company’s 5-year compounded annualized growth rate since its 2015 IPO is just under 60% through the end of 2018. By way of comparison, tightly integrated e-commerce platforms from competitors such as Amazon (AMZN) grew at an annualized rate of just over 21%. Salesforce.com (CRM) posted 19.23%. Adobe (ADBE) put up 19.84% over the five-year period. eBay (EBAY) grew at a scant 4.1%. Aggregate S&P revenue at the conclusion of the current earnings season fared far worse at 3.2% YOY - the slowest pace since the 3rd quarter of 2016. Arguably, there is little evidence to bring to the fore - short of a broad-based economic downturn - that would threaten SHOP’s double-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future. SHOP’s revenue growth should drive its share price back to the company’s August high of $400 by year’s end 2020, and here’s why.Robust consumer spending, low inflation, historically low borrowing costs and 3%+ annualized wage growth provides a pretty fecund environment for any momentum stock. Consumer spending is clearly driving annualized US output over the past five years with a high of 3.7% YOY (2015) and a low of 2.6 YOY (2017). Consumer spending was 3% YOY through the end of 2018, hitting a high of 4.7% in the 2nd quarter of 2019 before slipping to 2.9% on a quarter-to-quarter basis through the first estimate of GDP growth through September. Global consumer spending has been further bolstered by continuing synchronized monetary easing courtesy of central banks across the globe, producing some of the lowest borrowing costs for corporate and household decision makers in the post-WWII era.Here in the US, a spinoff of the Fed’s various asset buying programs has been a 50-year low in the US unemployment rate, curiously coupled with scant price inflation in the broader economy. A contributing factor is the anemic demand and, consequently, an abundant supply of oil on global markets, with demand sketching out its slowest pace since the financial crisis. Efforts to limit production by OPEC have proved less than fruitful in lifting global oil prices. Even with US sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan production, coupled with the September drone attack on Saudi oil processing facilities that temporarily knocked out more than half of the country’s production, the impact on prices has been surprisingly minimal. US shale production in September, which was 12% higher YOY, continues to provide more than enough production to maintain downward pressure on prices across advanced global markets. That pace is expected to rise to 16% YOY by the end of 2019. The US benchmark hasn’t traded above $60/barrel since mid-September, and only then in response to the drone strikes on the Saudi Aramco (ARMCO) facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in the eastern part of the country. Moving forward, OPEC’s current 1.2 million b/d production cuts that carry through March 2020 may be insufficient to keep Brent crude above $60/barrel.Core PCE inflation has yet to breach the Fed’s 2% annualized inflation threshold through the end of 2018, with 2019 more than likely to follow suit. Market-based inflation expectations 10 years into the future have risen to roughly 1.63% at today’s market close, a gain of about 10 b/p on yields posted at the end of October. At the same time, disposable income in current dollars is at 6.1% annualized through the end of 2018. Holdings of cash fell to 4.2% for investors during the month, the steepest monthly drop since 2013, as the decade-old bull market regains its footing after a late summer tempest.The global equity selloff and offsetting bond rally in the late September-early October period was surprising given how little the economy has changed between the September and October meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The target range of the Federal funds rate settled at 150 basis points to 175 b/p with the year’s third rate reduction at October’s FOMC meeting. With 75 b/p lopped off the Fed funds rate since July, market expectations that the current range will remain intact for the balance of the year and the near-term beyond are just shy of 100%. The S&P 500 hit another record high at the end of last week on equity fund inflows as the American Association of Individual Investors’ weekly survey captured the largest bullish sentiment shift since January 2018. While survey data still places US manufacturing and German industrial production in contraction largely on continuing trade tensions across the Pacific and looming tensions across the Pond, the 10-year Treasury yield soared to a four-month high of 1.93% last week - one of the clearest signs yet that investors’ fears of recession are on the wane. In early September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 1.461%, a mere 10 b/p from its all-time low post of 1.36% in 2016. That said, few analysts expect the yield of the 10-year Treasury note to hit 3% anytime soon, as slow global economic growth and the difference between bond yields in the US with similar maturities in Asia and Europe will likely continue to place downward pressure on US bond yields for the foreseeable future. Along the way, the US yield curve quietly ""un-inverted"" in mid-October - no matter that the predictive powers of the yield curve may not be as catholic in the age of large-scale asset programs. And for good measure, the VIX volatility index is down to 12.86 at today’s market close, well off its historical average reading of around 20.And let’s not forget October’s 0.3% uptick on September or a 3.1% YOY increase in retail sales. Consumer purchases of cars, goods from general merchandise stores and online purchases grew by 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively. Online purchases are expected to do well in the coming holiday shopping period with more than 41% of consumers planning to make at least half of their purchases from their living rooms or office desk computers. Consumer spending, about 70% of total US output, appears largely intact. Perhaps investors were a bit too hasty in bolting for the exits last month. What can be gleaned from recent Fed statements is this: without a sharp increase in inflation over the near-term, the Federal funds rate will likely remain in its current range for the foreseeable future. The lag time for the Fed’s most recent rate moves will extend well into 2020 before recent rate changes impact the greater economy. This means more investor appetite for stocks and other risk assets, which is bringing a cache of investable cash from the sidelines and into market play. The decade-long bull market continues. All of this bodes well for further consumer spending and Shopify revenue growth in the all-important US market as well as further afield.SHOP operates through two segments: subscriptions and merchant solutions. Subscriptions include monthly, annual or multi-year software access to the company’s e-commerce platform, comprising about 43% of company revenue through the end of 2018. Subscription revenue also includes fees for the sale of customized merchant themes, apps and the registration of domain names. The company’s application program interface now has over 3,200 apps through the end of September. These apps allow merchants to display, manage and sell their wares over a variety of sales channels, including web and mobile storefronts, bricks-and-mortar locations, pop-up stores, social media storefronts and marketplaces - basically anywhere within digital reach of the consumer and in an ever-growing array of languages. Subscription revenue has a compounded annual rate of growth of almost 42% from September 2015 through September 2019, posting $165,577 million in sales. Subscription sales should post in the neighborhood of $212,000 million by September 2020 for a projected 28% YOY increase.Merchant solutions generate the bulk of its revenue from credit card processing fees transacted through Shopify Payments, which is itself driven by an ever-growing array of revenue streams, including the number of merchants on the platform, the volume of goods processed through the platform and now the volume of inventory and number of orders that pass through the Shopify fulfillment network. Additional funds for the revenue segment derive from third-party partners, Shopify Capital, as well as point-of-sale supplied hardware. About 90% of merchants on the platform use Shopify Payments, while about 40% use Shopify shipping. Merchant solutions revenue posted a CAGR of 57.48% through the end of September on $224,975 million in total sales. Merchant solutions revenue should project out at just over $299,000 through September 2020, or 33% YOY.While basic merchant subscription plans are as low as $29/month and with an undefined bulk of subscription rates weighing in around $50/month, the issue of YOY retention and small business failure rates is more than an ongoing concern. About 20% of all small businesses fail in their first year, while 30% fail in their second year of operation. A further 50% fail after five years, and about 70% fail in their tenth year, according to national statistics. A persistent and stubborn merchant churn results. Unsurprisingly, the company does not supply a churn rate in its official reporting. It goes without saying that subscription retention remains necessarily problematic at the small end of the Shopify platform. That said, digital business-to-consumer commerce has comparatively lower barriers of entry than a traditional bricks-and-mortar retail outlet, which speaks to the ever-growing vacancy rate in the nation’s malls, particularly in rural America. Digital stores clearly require less initial capital outlay, which provides more of a draw to would-be entrepreneurs wanting to sell their wares to the consuming public. Shopify supplies continuing turnkey access that allows a steady flow of retailers at all levels of entry to try their hand at making their ideas and brands work that would otherwise not be possible. That the company’s subscription business has a CAGR of 42% over the past five years and speaks loudly to realization that platform upstarts continue to outpace platform failures by wide margins for the period.More advanced plans for larger businesses come to about $299/month. Shopify Plus includes over 5,000 larger businesses with high sales volumes on variable payment schedules. Here, platform integration pushes subscription attrition rates to 10% or less, on par with those found on high-end enterprise business platforms such as Salesforce.com.SHOP has all the makings to play at the high end of enterprise business platforms, to which its current market attention attests. On a GAAP basis, the company is still generating negative operating income at ($35,658) million, or 9% of total revenue through the end of September. Net GAAP loss came to ($72,784) million, or 19% of total revenue over the period, for a net loss of (0.64) per outstanding share. Positive GAAP operating margins are still in the future, with the most likely target date being calendar year 2023. Until that time, company and investors alike will continue to chase less-traditional measures of growth."
4300413,69905,2019-10-30T13:39:48-04:00,"Top-line growth continues to impress.The lower down the income statement we go, the worse it gets.Why investors should avoid this stock.","Shopify (SHOP) delivered results that were largely in line with estimates. Yet, rather than rallying, the stock is losing its appeal. Why?Because there is a large discrepancy between its actual potential and its present valuation.Stay with me, while I explain why now is the best time to avoid this stock.The graph below highlights my coverage of Shopify:The first article, in September 2019, was titled Awesome Company, Wrong Price. Since then the stock is down 12%:Throughout my past articles, I put forward the question:Today, I believe we are getting closer to answering this question.Because, for all intents and purposes, Shopify did, in actuality, deliver positive results and guidance -- at least superficially.Source: author's calculationsReaders can see that Shopify is still on target to finish 2019 up 45% year-over-year.Even if the trajectory since the start of the year is one of rapid deceleration: starting Q1 2019 with 50% year-over-year growth rates, and then ending Q4 10% lower, at 40% revenue growth rates.Nonetheless, for a company of its size, to still be growing at 40% year-over-year is remarkable.In the previous quarter, one aspect which made me pause for thought was Shopify's merchant solutions segment which had reversed a previous declining momentum. Source: author's calculationsYou can see that in Q2 2019 this segment was up 56% having only been up 50% in Q1 2019. This reversal made me question whether Shopify's merchant solutions had found a way to reignite momentum.However, as it transpires from Shopify's Q3 2019 results, this is not the case, as the downward momentum has once again returned.More attentive shareholders will be cognizant that both segments carry substantially different gross margins.Consider this, even though merchant solutions is growing at a much faster clip, these revenues are worth substantially less. For Q3 2019, merchant solutions carry gross margins of 37% versus subscription solutions at 80% gross margins.Shopify would prefer investors to focus on its top-line growth rates, that is its consolidated top-line growth, while ignoring its bottom-line profitability.On the bottom line, we can see the more Shopify grows, the less profitable it becomes.Specifically, we can see that whereas last year in Q3 2018, its revenues were $270 million, its bottom line EPS was $0.22.Meanwhile this year, for Q3 2019, it delivered resounding revenue growth, but its bottom line EPS fared even worse down to $0.64.Even if we factor in the tax movements, its operating loss before taxes was $23 million in Q3 2018 and $24 million in Q3 2019.Looking through Shopify's balance sheet and we may be tempted to believe Shopify's financial position is rock-solid with no debt and ample cash ($2.7 billion).But this strong balance sheet is merely a function of its consistent and large shareholder dilutions.Looking back to 2017 and Shopify raised $560 million. In 2018 over $1 billion was raised from shareholders. Then, just a few weeks ago a further $700 million was raised.In other words, this is not a healthy cash flow generative enterprise.Shopify wants investors to focus on its recurring revenues, but what's ultimately more recurring is its shareholder dilutions.Shopify was once a stock market darling.Raising day after day and month after month. Any skeptical investor was easily dismissed for having concerns and may have even capitulated to join the party.Today, as the stock starts to deflate, it will happen slowly at first, but then it will go on to pick up momentum.Don't overstay this investment with a very poor risk-reward profile. There is close to no upside at $35 billion and there is plenty of downside potential."
4307352,105567,2019-11-18T02:13:58-05:00,"Shopify has produced massive growth over the past 5 years. The company is growing in a thriving sector.However, the price is too optimistic based on the firm’s fundamentals, and growth is likely to slow down.The company should focus on its core business and delivering value to shareholders.","We believe that Shopify (SHOP) stock is overvalued, and we expect the market to correct for this shortly. We believe the company to be overvalued because:Having said this, we also think Shopify’s core business has the potential to be profitable. To prove this, we will value the company by forecasting its trajectory based on its current performance and projecting potential future profitability to determine a target price. To this extent, Shopify should focus on improving its core business rather than expanding its operations, which seems to be what it is trying.Our analysis will serve to support our thesis that there is value in the company’s core business, as it is capable of generating sustained profits. At the right price, Shopify will be a great buy.Founded in 2004, Shopify has made a name for itself as a revolutionary “ground-breaking” tech stock. It is the Cinderella story of a small Canadian company poised to take over the eCommerce world. This is the kind of company that creates fanaticism and hardcore believers, which is part of the reason it has enjoyed such hefty valuations.Shopify offers a web service that allows its customers to easily and inexpensively set up an e-commerce page. You can visit its site, purchase a basic Shopify plan for $79 a month, a domain and voila! Within minutes, you can have your page set up. The company offers a variety of free or paid “themes” (website templates). You can choose the design and “look” for your store.In the back-end, you have a rudimentary control panel to manage your products, set prices, control stock, etc.On top of this, for any additional functionality, you may visit the Shopify App Store, where the company itself or individual developers or companies offer apps (software) that integrate with the store.Furthermore, the company offers Shopify Payments to facilitate payments, taking a transaction fee from every sale, Shopify POS for physical stores and even Shopify Capital to help merchants fund their activities at, if I may add, exorbitant interest rates.It would be an understatement to say that, from start to finish, the company exploits every single possible way to: 1) extract money from its users and 2) increase their dependency on Shopify. This is a double-edged sword. As someone who has worked in the industry, I have encountered much frustration in this area. For example, Shopify charges a fee for using any third-party payment processing system, such as Stripe, virtually making its system, Shopify Payments, the most affordable option. The funny thing is, Shopify Payments is powered by the same technology as Stripe. Shopify isn’t adding any value here more than penalizing you for opting out of its system.Having said this, Shopify is trying to be more than SaaS, and that is commendable and does have the potential for value creation. The company offers a complete service and incredible support. Its team of “Shopify gurus” is available round the clock by chat or phone to help users with any problems and questions.Furthermore, as previously mentioned, it offers financing, payment solutions (online and physical), technological solutions (a community of vetted and rated “Shopify experts”) and a plethora of instructional content on everything eCommerce.The company has plenty of room to grow in its sector and market, which is why I believe the latest move to enter the fulfillment business would be detrimental to its bottom lineShopify’s main source of income is recurring subscription payment. This accounts for around 80% of revenues.In this department, the company has the following offers:The rest of the revenues can be attributed to “merchant solution”. This is money people pay for all the additional services Shopify offers.These include:In this regard, it is interesting to analyze the difference between these sources of income.Source: Q3 reportAs we can see, in terms of total revenue, subscription solutions represented a little over 1/3rd of revenues. Quite a striking difference from 2018, where the distribution was a lot closer to 50/50. This shows us that merchant solutions is growing at a much faster rate than Shopify. Is this good or bad?Further analysis verifies that subscriptions represent a much higher percentage of gross profit, or in other words, have a much lower cost of revenue and, therefore, higher profit margin.In 2019 Q3, subscription revenues represented 80% of gross profit.Source: ""Shopify: Do Not Stay Passive,"" Seeking AlphaTherefore, it is quite reasonable to conclude that:The software aspect of the company itself is not expensive. To this extent, Shopify’s business model shouldn’t carry high variable costs, which should allow it to command high profits margins on its operations.Here we can see revenues and expense growth.Source: YChartsAs we can see, revenues have grown in lockstep with expenses. This is because, as a growth company, Shopify increases its expenses deliberately to seek growth. However, as the company matures, we could expect Shopify to easily be able to reduce expenses.Now, let’s have a look at how these expenses are broken down:Source: Q3 reportShopify spends almost 1/2 of its operating income on sales and marketing. The company does this mostly through affiliate marketing and what it labels its “partner program,” which allows partners to receive a recurring income from referrals.The company is dependent on this marketing expenditure to maintain subscription growth, and it is hard to see a scenario where it could reduce this significantly without damaging top line growth.The remaining operating expenditures are roughly 1/3rd R&D, with the rest attributed to GA. In the near future, if Shopify wanted to increase profitability, a strong argument could be made for a reduction in R&D.Shopify operates within the growing world of eCommerce. It is undeniable that this sector is poised to grow at a rate calculated by some analysts of around 4.6% in 2020.Source: eMarketer.comFurthermore, the company is in the SaaS business, which is also one of the highest-growth spaces to be in. Investors and entrepreneurs alike have accepted for the past few years that this is a business with the potential to create value and save companies millions, even billions.With the advent of AI, SaaS will soon be able to replace a very significant part of the workforce - accounting, sales and even marketing.In terms of eCommerce, the company needs to expand on its technology to help deliver value and stay ahead of the competition.Shopify needs to be more than a platform. It needs to be an automated employee capable of running data analytics and implementing sales, marketing, and overall growth strategies. This is where the money is.Shopify users can range from small physical stores that are getting started with eCommerce to large multinationals spending over $2000/month on Shopify Plus services.Although the company won’t disclose exact information on this, it is suspected that a large chunk of users are “dropshippers.” These are individuals who are, in essence, “reselling” goods on the internet by listing products found on “cheap” marketplaces like AliExpress and listing them and rebranding them on their store.This poses an interesting question as to the sustainability of Shopify’s customer base, which we will explore further on. Dropshipping does not provide value, since it just takes advantage of people’s ignorance. It has been hailed in the past few years as a get-rich easy scheme and what not. Shopify is encouraging this, as it owns and operates Oberlo, a Shopify “app” which helps automate the fulfillment process for dropshippers.The situation is akin to that of the gold fever in California, and Shopify is the one selling the shovels. But how long will it be able to continue to do so, as less and less gold is left?Shopify competes directly with other eCommerce software such as Wordpress’s WooCommerce and BigCommerce. It also competes with marketplaces like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Instagram, where people can also essentially sell their products. However, these sales channels can also work in conjunction with Shopify allowing its users to easily sell their products on other channels, such as the ones mentioned above.In this way, Shopify tries to set itself up as a center of operations for eCommerce businesses.Nonetheless, the eCommerce industry is getting crowded. As an example, Mailchimp, an email provider, earlier this year decided to stop working with Shopify to pursue its own eCommerce business. Facebook will be expanding into this realm, as social media becomes a platform for eCommerce in itself.Since its inception in November 2011, Shopify has acquired a few different companies. In chronological during the last 4 years, these include:The last acquisition, 6 River Systems, came at a steep price, paid out 50/50 in cash and equity. The company acquired is in the fulfillment industry, focusing on automated solutions using advanced robotics and AI. While the technology seems promising, we believe that this move by Shopify will not pay out.The fulfillment industry is crowded, and Shopify can’t compete in size or price with Amazon, which is losing money on its shipping. Furthermore, margins in this business are small, and if we are to believe that most Shopify users are dropshippers, there’s no advantage the company can offer in this sector.As stated in the thesis summary, there are two clear reasons which lead us to believe that the company is overvalued.1) Funding through equityData source: Seeking AlphaShopify has been funding its activity through stock offerings since its inception. Not only this, but the company has also greatly increased stock compensations and has also used stock exchanges to pay for part of its mergers & acquisitions.Data source: Seeking AlphaAs recently as September 16, 2019, Shopify raised around 600 million, offering 1.9 million class A subordinate voting shares at $317.50. The thing is, it is unclear why exactly the company has done this. Yes, part of it was raised to fund the acquisition of 6 Rivers, allegedly, but Shopify now holds 2.3 billion in cash and ST investments.It’s likely, that this money will go towards expanding its new fulfillment operations. In any case, it seems quite clear that management is cashing in on the hefty valuation that the company currently has, after appreciating over 140% in the last year.2) High valuation ratiosLooking at a comparative analysis between Shopify and its peers, it is quite clear that Shopify trades at higher than normal ratios, even for a tech stock.However, despite high PEG and PES, if we look at growth and profitability ratios, the stock doesn’t stand out.Of course, the above valuation ratios looked quite different one year ago, with Shopify’s stock price at ~$150.Our extensive analysis of Shopify has led us to conclude the following. In terms of strong points and opportunities, the company has:Shopify is in a sweet moment. It’s in an interesting and growing industry. Ecommerce brings together the best of traditional retail and technology. In other words, this is not some technology that may or may not be profitable in the future. Ecommerce is here to stay and to create value and profits.To this extent, Shopify is well-positioned to provide value to its customer base. We believe the company should focus on retaining and maximizing profits from its existing customers and, especially, big multinationals. To do this, it must focus on its core business and adding value to merchants, rather than increasing subscriptions.On the other hand, Shopify faces the following weaknesses and threats:One of our biggest concerns is the rate of “churn” of its customer base. While we don’t have exact numbers on this, it is quite evident that a high proportion of Shopify users are dropshippers or new entrepreneurs. Not that there is any problem with this, but dropshipping doesn’t add value, and 9/10 businesses fail. This means subscription revenue will decrease, which will also affect profit margins.At the same time, Shopify is facing competition from giants like FB and Amazon. While Shopify is an established brand and name, its software is easy to replicate and doesn’t offer many advantages.Our valuation of the stock is based on the profitability of Shopify’s current core business. Our model is limited to forecasting the profitability of the company based on what it is/has right now.Given the above qualitative analysis, we believe that Shopify is in a position to continue growing and generate substantial FCF.Therefore, our valuation will serve to justify our thesis that there is plenty of value to the company, which is why it should focus on its core business and expanding profitability, instead of expanding aggressively to other markets through mergers and acquisitions.Now we are going to attempt to find a value for Shopify’s core business, assuming a scenario where we cut R&D spending, which we have established to be mainly focused on penetrating markets outside the company's core business. As a consequence, we assume the core business does not require any further issuance of equity or debt, and excess cash, as well as current short-term investments, are treated as free cash flows. We will forecast revenue growth and product cost with some attention to the evolution of the two main business sections defined in the latest Shopify 6-K report. Ultimately, the valuation is based on the present value of perpetual and growing free cash flows. All assumptions are specified below.First of all, we assess revenue growth. It appears that revenue growth is very high but logically slowing down as the business grows. Revenue for 2019 is estimated by taking the year-to-year growth rate in 2019 Q3 and applying the same rate to 2019 Q4. This leaves us with an estimated revenue of just over 1.55 billion and 44.61% growth. We can take all available growth rates from 2012 to our 2019 estimate and create an exponential trend line on a spreadsheet. Then, we can use the function of the trend line to forecast revenue for the next few years. We will assume that growth will increase until it hits a long-term industry level, which we estimate at 4.6%, based on the forecast for e-commerce growth seen earlier from eMarketer, and then remain constant. In our model, this would happen in 2035.Source: Author’s estimatesIn terms of product cost, we mentioned earlier that there are two lines of business with different growth and product cost - a subscription services business with 20.1% cost of revenue and 38% growth, and a merchant services line with 50% revenue growth and a 62.5% revenue cost (based on the latest quarterly report). We can calculate the proportion of overall growth that each line represents and keep that constant over time to estimate the product cost going forward, and we can see that it grows over time to an almost stable 46.5% of revenue by 2035. We will assume it keeps that percentage going forward.- SG&A expenses seem to be moving towards 40% of revenue, so we will keep them at that level.- R&D costs will be frozen at $310 million until 2035, from which point they will grow at the same rate as revenue.- Interest gains from short-term investments will be eliminated, as excess cash is being treated as a free cash flow year by year.- There will be no further equity-based compensation or issuing of equity, since there is no need for it.- Income tax is a fixed 21% of net income.- Working capital and fixed assets grow at the same rate as revenues.- Other minor expenses grow at the same rate as revenues.These assumptions are designed to create an eventually fixed growth rate for net income and free cash flow (from 2035), while remaining reasonable estimates of how the business might evolve if it follows its natural course in a growing market. As established before, we have assumed that growth plateaus at 4.6%, which is the estimated growth rate of eCommerce according to eMarketer research.Source: Author’s estimatesThe present value of all future free cash flows in this model can be seen on the following table, for a variety of required rates of return (values are discounted to December 2019):Source: Author’s estimatesOur forecast concludes that at the current price of ~$319, the expected rate of return should be somewhere along 6.0%. The S&P rate of return over the last 3 decades is over 9%, but correcting for risk-free rates, we believe a current market expected return is more along the lines of 8%, so the value of Shopify’s core business according to these calculations is closer to $100.Having valued Shopify for what it is, rather than what it can be, it is quite evident that anyone who is investing at current prices must have some very optimistic hopes about what the company can achieve.We believe the qualitative analysis has proven that there is indeed no fundamental reason why we should believe Shopify can maintain double-digit growth figures in the medium to long term.While the growth assumptions we have used may be conservative, it is clear that Shopify is operating in an increasingly crowded market, and any expansion into other areas will come at great cost to profitability, even if higher growth can be achieved.Shopify has done a great job of marketing itself as cutting-edge and revolutionary, and this has served the company well in the eyes of both consumers and investors. However, we believe in the long term, hopefully sooner rather than later, Shopify will realize that it is not going to be the next Amazon. At that point, profitability will become the true measure of its potential and the company valuation will reflect this."
4299951,105256,2019-10-29T13:07:38-04:00,"Alphabet is selling off today, after the earnings were missed by a lot. Very understandable. But dig deeper and you should like what you see.Shopify is a similar case of missing earnings by a lot, and yet by taking a second look you should consider participating in shares of this name.Beyond Meat is still beyond the level of any rational valuation. It could be a great company, with a great product, but terrible stock.Grubhub, not sure it's a great company. I am pretty sure the CEO needs to re-evaluate how he communicates to Wall Street. I see no reason to own a stock that has competitors who are largely using free money to compete. SELL.","I took this (paraphrased) quote from Eric Sheridan, the number 1 analyst on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from UBS:""They had to account for the $57 million French fine. Investments were marked to market. If you drill down, GOOGL didn't disappoint. No miss on-site revenue and beat on cloud revenue. Core business doing great still running at 20% growth. I still have an 18-month guide for an upside $1,500-1,600 with a downside of $1100. GOOGL has now had 2 quarters of accelerated revenue...""He went on to reiterate his buy recommendation on GOOGL.My Take: These are great numbers, and the reason for the shortfall is that GOOGL is investing in Google Cloud to grow the business to take advantage of a huge business opportunity. They don't break out the cloud services number, but analysts are saying that they are growing the business a bit above 35%. There is basically a land grab out there, and while Google Cloud is on par with Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Amazon's (AMZN) AWS technologically in most areas and ahead in AI/ML, it is frankly a distant third to these two leaders.It needs to hire more sales and marketing pros and make more acquisitions. The Looker acquisition is a start. Buying applications is important but capacity is also important. I think they should buy Akamai (AKAM). This would be a great tuck-in acquisition that would expand GOOGL services and capacity. AKAM was looking to sell itself last year, but it seems they were asking too much. They reported yesterday and with strong cloud security and growth in their traditional content delivery service. AKAM is selling off also, undeservedly in my opinion.I digress, if you are an investor in GOOGL, you want them to boost their investment and build up this revenue center that should generate much better free cash flow in the future. I think that after GOOGL settles down it will continue to climb in price. If you look at how GOOGL behaved price-wise, you should feel pretty sanguine. It sold off in the post-market, but the stock ran up 30 points right into its all-time high the day before. Naturally, traders sold off on the headline miss, but the stock never gave up all the gains of the regular trading day. As of the time of this writing, I admit it has given up all the gains from yesterday. Let's see how it closes, if it closes at this $1260 level or above, then the rally thesis should be intact. Let's look at the chart. Basically, this $1260 level is still an elevated price from the prior pattern. Let's take a look...Source: tradingview.comObviously, this is not a pretty picture. A lot of damage has been done to the chart. This is a 5-day chart, let's zoom out and see a one-year chart:Source: tradingview.comAs you can see, there have been many times that GOOGL has sold off in a similar fashion as it has been on this very powerful months-long uptrend. I am going to go out on a ledge once again and speculate that GOOGL will close closer to $1280 than $1260. I think GOOGL is a very good risk for a trade, and if you have room for a non-dividend paying stock as a long-term investment, I think GOOGL would be a good investment as well. I suspect that at some point GOOGL will pay a dividend since it generates prodigious cash that is sitting on its balance sheet. GOOGL is a buy, and going into 2020, I would not be surprised if it was 150 points higher than where it is now.I believe that Amazon will also recover in its losses, and will also go back towards the old highs going into the end of the year. I mentioned this yesterday, but I think it is germane because I think the same phenomenon is happening. Traders (and robots) will sell on the headlines and then over time, a more rational analysis will take hold. For AMZN, the realization of a 35% growth rate in the AWS cloud services division at such a large scale is fantastic.Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) missed earnings for similar reasons to Alphabet. Revenue rose 45% to $390.6 million, above the FactSet consensus of $383.8 million, as both subscription and merchant solutions revenue topped forecasts. Gross Merchandise Volume +48% and Monthly Recurring Revenue +34% for Q3.During the quarter, Shopify said it surpassed 1 million merchants. The company recorded an adjusted loss of $33.6 million vs. adjusted net income of $5.8 million a year ago.Says Shopify CFO Amy Shapero, ""Our strong results in the quarter were driven in part by the success of our international expansion, which is just one of the many ways we are investing in the platform"".The company expects fourth-quarter revenue of $472 million to $482 million, above the FactSet consensus of $470.6 million. The stock has more than doubled (up 135%) year to date through Monday, while the S&P 500 has advanced 21.2%.My Take: SHOP is growing tremendously customer-wise, as we see with it reaching the 1 million merchant level. The CEO recently announced acquiring a robotics company to boost warehouse productivity. SHOP made clear that is was going to start investing in logistics and fulfillment to service 3rd party merchants.This is an arms-race with Amazon 3rd party business. AMZN is getting flak for its practices and perceived abuses of these merchants. If SHOP can provide similar functionality, it can grow its services mightily as a trustworthy alternative to AMZN.The stock has more than doubled so selling on the earnings news is to be expected. However, SHOP has a superior business model that is executing very well. The fact that the selloff is not shocking does not mean it is deserved.Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) beat on earnings and revenue, and future guidance was raised. This is all great, but the stock price is STILL overvalued. The growth rate would be fantastic for any other packaged food business, but at a $5.1 billion market cap, the fact it is still trading at more than 10 times REVENUE is just nuts. Conagra (CAG) is trading a little over one-time revenue.Even with torrid growth, a food company should not be valued at the level of a cloud software company that has zero costs to service an incremental customer. BYND is a manufacturer that has comparatively tiny margins.The BYND IPO took advantage of unsuspecting retail investors by releasing a tiny sliver of shares. The stock was naively snapped up and soared to ridiculous levels of $240 per share at its height. Today, BYND's IPO lockup expires, and the rank and file, who have seen their stock compensation evaporate, are selling their shares hand-over-fist. I am further appalled that the CEO and other C-suite denizens got a dispensation to sell their shares at $160 (below the market at the time), leaving their own people holding the bag. Is it any wonder that the stock is down hard today even after good results?On CNBC, the CEO was on, he said: ""Our sales velocity this quarter was up 144%, and we raised guidance."" He spent the rest of the time waxing poetic about plant-based meat and that BYND has unlocked the mystery of taste. Frankly, I was disappointed that no one there challenged him on his sell-out of investors at $160 per share.My Take: The stock is now cut in half from there at $80-ish, and down a full 160 points from the all-time high of $240. The stock is still up 250% from the IPO price. There will be many more competitors coming on the scene, Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY) (OTCPK:NSRGF), Tyson (NYSE:TSN), and Impossible (IMPSBL) and many others.I still think the stock could be cut in half again from here. Never try and catch a falling knife, this one is a falling machete.Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) competes with Postmates (POSTM), Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER), Freshly, DoorDash (DOORD), Deliveroo, Instacart (ICART). Aside from Uber Eats, all of these competitors and I am sure many more regional competitors are venture funded. That means they are all subsidized with free money, while Grubhub has to show earnings. This is a commodity business that is based on reducing costs. No wonder there is no loyalty from customers about using GRUB.My Take: Calling your customers ""promiscuous"" is a gaff of epic proportions. Never mind the common use of that word, the CEO reinforced the idea that the customer has no reason to be loyal. There is no reason for anyone to own this name. SELL!"
4311351,99986,2019-12-09T07:58:31-05:00,"Shopify is up 160% year-to-date, crushing the S&P 500's year-to-date performance.While the company continues to put up record revenue each quarter, there are signs that we're seeing even more material deceleration in revenue growth on the horizon.This deceleration is not helped by the fact that the valuation is getting lofty, currently sitting at a forward P/E ratio of nearly 400.Based on this, I would view any rallies back to the $370.00 area as an opportune time to book some profits.","While online retailer Amazon (AMZN) has had a sluggish year, underperforming the S&P 500 (SPY) by nearly 1000 basis points, Shopify (SHOP) has had a massive year, putting up a triple-digit return year-to-date. Shopify's strong performance has been tied to continued high double-digit revenue growth in the 50% range, while Amazon has finally seen its growth rates come under pressure this year. Even more impressive for Shopify, the company recently celebrated 1 million merchants on its platform in the most recent quarter and raised guidance yet again, expecting a strong finish to 2019. While the company's growth rates are exceptional, I believe we're likely to see more material deceleration on the horizon and a drop below 40% sales growth in 2020. Based on this slowdown and a valuation that's priced just shy of perfection, I would view any further strength in the stock as an opportunity for investors to book some profits. (Source: TC2000.com)Shopify's Q3 results released in late October included tons of great news for investors, with the most exciting news being the company's achievement of reaching the 1 million merchant mark, up from 377,000 at the end of 2016. This represents outstanding growth, with a compound annual growth rate in total merchants above 70%. In addition to this milestone, the company is now the first commerce platform to roll out both 3D and Augmented Reality [AR] shopping experiences. Finally, Shopify Capital had a massive quarter, with merchant cash advances of over $140 million. This remains an important growth driver for Shopify, as it allows merchants the funds they need to build their businesses faster without the financial constraints some small businesses might typically see otherwise. (Source: Company Website)While there's certainly a lot to like when it comes to business highlights, financial highlights for the quarter were just as impressive. Total revenue came in at $390.6 million for Q3, up 45% year-over-year, and this is helping to drive the trend high in bottom line estimates. FY-2020 annual EPS estimates have been revised higher from $0.84 in April to $0.96 as of last week. This is now forecasting 384% growth in earnings year-over-year, after the 50% drop-off we see in FY-2019 tied to much higher spending this year on capacity and service offerings. In addition, the company announced that it had acquired 6 River Systems, which comes with a fleet of collaborative mobile robots to drive massive efficiency in order-picking. Notably, the robots, known as 'Chuck,' can work 24/7, as they charge automatically. This acquisition will drive efficiency and speed when it comes to fulfilling orders for thousands of different businesses. (Source: 6River.com)Not surprisingly, with the new milestones reached this quarter in total merchants and Shopify Capital, Shopify has raised its full-year 2019 guidance provided in Q1 from $1.495 billion at the mid-point to $1.55 billion at the mid-point. This is a bump of nearly 3% and should lead to further earnings revisions higher if the company manages to eke out a beat over these estimates. Let's take a closer look at the company's growth metrics below:As we can see from the below chart of annual earnings per share [EPS], Shopify's earnings continue to grow at a rapid pace. FY-2018 annual EPS grew over 100% from $0.15 to $0.38, FY-2019 EPS stalled out and is expected to finish the year at $0.19, but we are expecting a surge in earnings growth for FY-2020. FY-2020 annual EPS estimates are currently sitting at $0.92, and this is forecasting growth of over 380% next near. Even more impressive, analysts now have FY-2021 estimates pegged at $1.76, predicting yet another year of nearly triple-digit growth (91%). Therefore, while the current trailing P/E ratio of over 1000 may look insanely expensive, it's important to note that earnings are expected to grow by nearly 400% next year alone, and offset any drop-off in FY-2019 earnings, a transition year for the company. Based on my minimum metrics for growth stocks, I want to see annual EPS growth of 12% or higher every single year. Given that Shopify is likely to grow earnings by 350% or more even if it misses estimates next year, it's in a small group of the highest growth companies on the US Market. Wiliam O'Neil found through his CANSLIM criteria that the best growth stocks with the strongest advances grow earnings at over 40% each year, and Shopify certainly fits in this group currently. Therefore, while the FY-2019 hiccup may look negative, it can be discounted due to the immense growth in earnings expected in FY-2020. (Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)If we move over to quarterly revenues, we can see that Shopify continues to grow revenues at a brisk pace. Quarterly revenues have grown from $222.8 million in Q4 2017 to $390.6 million in the most recent quarter. Based on Q4 2019 estimates, we should see yet another new record next quarter, with analysts currently forecasting $490.1 million in revenues. While this is an exceptional figure that translates to 42.5% growth year-over-year, this will mark yet another quarter of sequential deceleration for Shopify.It's certainly worth noting that revenue growth rates have been decelerating moderately for several quarters now, but the difference this time is that this slowdown is occurring below the 50% level. Based on my criteria, which separates hyper-growth companies from high-growth companies, the cut-off is 50% revenue growth. Based on this, Shopify's deceleration as we head into 2020 is transitioning the company from hyper-growth to high-growth, a demotion that can sometimes lead to a contraction in the company's multiples.(Source: Author's Chart)If we take a closer look at revenue growth rates below, we can see that revenue growth rates are expected to come in at 42.5% in Q4 2019, 40% in Q1 2020, and 38% in Q2 2020. This is a negative sign. The blue line in the below chart represents the quarterly growth rate, while the white line represents the two-quarter average. I like to use a two-quarter average for revenue growth rates as it helps to smooth out any lumpy quarters and better dictates the overall trend. As we can see from the below chart, this deceleration is not a one-quarter anomaly but is part of a pattern of meaningful deceleration. If the company can only meet these current estimates, Shopify's two-quarter average revenue growth rate should slip from 46.5% in the most recent quarter to 39% in Q2 2020. This would mark a deceleration of over 600 basis points and is quite significant.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)While revenue estimates are not set in stone and can be beaten, the company certainly has its work cut out for it to trounce these estimates. In order to prevent deceleration, Shopify will need to report $498.7 million in revenues for Q4 2019 and $464.7 million in revenues for Q1 2020. The Q4 figure is just $8 million above current estimates and is therefore potentially attainable, but the Q1 2020 figure is going to require a miracle to beat. To keep revenue growth rates stable at 45%, Shopify will need to beat current estimates of $448.9 million by $15.8 million, or about a 4% revenue beat. Some investors may argue that deceleration is normal, and is not a reason to ever consider selling a stock. While I would argue this is entirely true on the first point, I would strongly disagree on the latter point. Companies that transition from hyper-growth to high-growth often go through some growing pains, and this can shock the stock, leading to a choppy range, or a decent correction. We have seen this occur in Amazon for the past 18 months, as revenue growth rates finally decelerated to a point where growth fund managers decided to park money elsewhere. Therefore, barring a Q1 report with revenue above $464.7 million in Q1 2020, I believe that Shopify will struggle to make new highs next year above the $411.00 mark. (Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)Therefore, while there's a lot to like about Shopify's earnings growth for FY-2020, there's just as much to dislike about the deceleration in revenue growth rates. This deceleration has made it more difficult for the company to beat earnings estimates, and we saw one of the smallest beats yet on revenue last quarter. Given the combination between a forward P/E ratio of roughly 400 using FY-2020 earnings, as well as a consistent deceleration in growth rates, I see Shopify as finally beginning to get slightly overvalued at current levels. Given this overvaluation, the stock is more susceptible to a correction of 15-25% than it's been in the past.If we move over to the technical picture, we can see that Shopify saw its first signs of distribution in over three years show up in August. While this distribution, which can be characterized as abnormally weak price action. These distribution bars do not predict tops, but they do warn of them, and the stock promptly corrected following this. Since that drop, the stock now has resistance at the $384.00 level, and I would consider rallies that can't get through this level on a weekly close to be noise.Based on this, I would view any further strength in the stock above the $370.00 level as an opportunity for investors to book some profits. This does not mean one should exit their full position as the long-term trend remains up, but it does mean that risks are elevated if we head back above $370.00. For me, I prefer to trade-off reward to risk metrics, and the reward to risk on Shopify is poor above $370.00.(Source: TC2000.com)If we take a closer look at the chart, we can see that Shopify found strong support at its 200-day moving average (yellow line), and also printed two accumulation bars near this level. This suggests that there are eager buyers at the $282.00 level, and this would be a much wiser spot for investors to add exposure if they do want to get in the name. As long as Shopify remains above its 200-day moving average, the bulls will stay in control. However, it's important to note that valuation is not what it was the past three years, and the stock is getting expensive up here unless growth rates can re-accelerate.While Shopify could certainly continue higher over the next few months, I see risks as elevated as the stock trades at a forward P/E ratio near 400, while growth continues to decelerate. Based on this, I would view any rallies above the $370.00 level as opportunities to book some profits. In addition, I see no reason to be putting new money to work at current levels. Unless Shopify can put up $464.7 million or higher in revenues for Q1 2020, I have a hard time seeing the stock making new highs above the $411.00 level next year."
4297262,105417,2019-10-18T08:38:56-04:00,"We estimate 23% Y/Y growth in Shopify Payments for 3Q, with domestic growth continuing to outperform.More color is needed on both fulfillment centers as well as longer-term international strategy.Guidance raise for the rest of 2019 (essentially Q4) is likely.","Shopify (SHOP) is a multi-channel commerce platform that builds mobile-based software that enables merchants to set up online storefronts with retail functionality. Merchants use SHOP’s software across various sales channels, such as web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, and social network marketplaces, among others. The Shopify platform allows merchants to manage products and inventory, build customer relationships, leverage analytics, and even access financing.We see EV/revenue as the best valuation multiple in Shopify’s case, given the company’s focus on net merchant and add-ons growth. When we apply the multiple of ~22.2x to the 2020 revenue base, we see an estimate of $394 (down from $395). We note that this multiple holds true only if the United States economy does not start deteriorating in 2020, since new merchant additions are particularly strongly dependent on economy at Shopify.Upside to the Gross Margin: While upper 50’s has become the standard for Shopify’s top line gross margin story, we believe that the “no-inventory” model affords the company to eventually push the gross margin in the vicinity of 70%. For the third quarter, we are estimating the margin to be in the 58-59% range.Estimate 23% Growth in Shopify Payments for 3Q: We believe that continued solid growth in domestic merchants and a decline in attrition rates should power 23% growth in Shopify Payments during the quarter. Some traction should come from the international market as well, where growth should be faster, albeit we are assuming a 4-5% discount to non-US growth in order to stay conservative, in case any unforeseen softness (not modeled by us) shall emerge.Modeling $155 Million for Subscription Solutions Revenue in 3Q, driven by 88% of recurring revenue and 12% of newly established accounts. In addition to repeat customer rates, we also incorporate average order values, total sales, conversion rates, and overall traffic numbers to produce this estimate, which could be as high $168 million, provided that month/month growth accelerates by 10-12 bps.More Color Around Fulfillment Centers and Associated Costs: While the bottom line (our estimate is 13 cents for Q3) is not of the foremost importance to the investor community, we do believe that expansion into fulfillment centers may quickly hit a roadblock from the expense standpoint. As we look at Amazon (AMZN) and the entire e-commerce ecosystem, it does appear to us as an ""all or nothing"" opportunity, which would make cost management difficult going forward.International Copycats? While SHOP remains fairly well-shielded from domestic competition, there have been too many Shopify-like websites mushrooming abroad, not only in Europe but also within emerging markets. In light of these developments, we would like to get more color on the company’s international strategy, particularly since starting around 2021-22 Shopify’s growth will likely begin to saturate in the United States.Expect 2019 Guidance Raise: We believe that the company may up its 2019 guidance (essentially, 4th quarter estimates) during the next earnings call. Both Subscription Solutions and Merchant Solutions are likely to see a modest uptick in guidance, which the company may set conservatively enough to allow for a comfortable beat the following quarter. This strategy of conservative guides and subsequent beats has served Shopify well during most quarters so far.We see the following risks as potentially damaging SHOP’s business. In our view, most of the key risks are technology-related:"
4296516,69905,2019-10-14T19:17:42-04:00,Insatiable revenue growth rates. But what about profits?Shopify's revenue growth rates are starting to taper off.Investors are not likely to be rewarded and should sidestep this investment.,"Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has been on an impressive run. Last month I concluded my article on Shopify by saying,In this article, I will focus on a more overarching hypothesis - investors' sentiment.It is very difficult to argue with the fact that Shopify has been a rewarding investment. But looking ahead, new shareholders are not likely to be rewarded anywhere near the same amount. How do I know? I don't! But common sense dictates this much.Here is the thing, we can all agree that the past two years, Shopify has offered shareholders a big return. Presently, investors are looking towards each other for confirmatory signs: if the stock continues to increase in value, therefore, we should conclude that it must be undervalued? Sadly, not quite so.In her terrific book, Bull, Maggie Mahar touches on the fact that investors have very short-term memories. She highlights that investors typically have a 17-year memory and that very few investors are willing to study financial history, thus why cycles have a tendency to repeat themselves.Similarly, if I were to declare that investors are not likely to meaningfully profit from Shopify at close to $40 billion market cap, very few shareholders would be willing to give this assertion the benefit of the doubt.Firstly, from the anecdotal side, it is imperative to remind readers that Shopify is not Amazon (AMZN). Amazon is a once in a lifetime company, on a league of its own. Investors analyzing Amazon and Shopify closely enough are more likely to find aspects that make them different rather than make them similar.Secondly, that pesky detail, that the more Shopify growth, the worse its losses become:Source: author's calculations, Press StatementsAnd the problem is that for as long as its share price continues to ever-so-steadily climb, nobody is willing to ask: at what point will this stop?Shareholders would be ready to retort that they are: buy-and-hold forever investors. However, everyone is a buy and hold investor, for as long as they are making returns. The problem though, is what happens when a company that is priced beyond perfection misses a quarter? Impossible? Nope. Inevitable.Thirdly, I find it interesting to note that even though Shopify's revenue growth rates are starting to taper off, management's stock-based compensation continues to increase at a rapid clip.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsThis discrepancy between slowing revenue growth rates and increasing stock-based compensation should make investors pause for thought. Further compounding issues, in the event that for whatever reason, Shopify's shares were to decline in value, its shareholders would be forced to ante up even more share to make up for management's take-home compensation.From the table below, which stock is the most overvalued?Source: author's calculationsNext, question, which company in the table above is most likely to suffer from a recession? Again, I believe that Shopify is the correct answer. Why?Because Shopify's whole business model revolves around giving small and medium-sized merchants one-month contracts, in order to ensure merchants adopt its platform in the first instance.If, for whatever reason, Shopify was unable to get new merchants onto its platform, this would cause its growth rates to slow down, which would severely impact the sentiment around its share price.This is not to say that its competitors, such as Adobe (ADBE) are not likely to be as impacted, it certainly may as affected. My only assertion is that Adobe is only priced at 33x its cash flows from operations, while Shopify is priced at approximately 600x its cash flows from operations.It is extremely difficult to find any sort of edge as to why Shopify's shares still have any upside potential left. For now, even though its revenue growth rates remain relatively stable, the more it grows, the less profitable it becomes. At some point, investors will come to understand that multiple expansion only works for so long.On the 29th of October, Shopify will release its Q3 2019 earnings. Stay tuned!"
4294274,35181,2019-09-30T17:05:10-04:00,Shopify's expansion into fulfillment will drive down margins and profitability.6 River Systems robotics and AI is a great solution for fast startup and no building modifications but inefficient in terms of real estate.Expect a long lineup of expenses in order to compete. Pick-and-place robots and automatic packaging machines will be the tip of the iceberg.,"(Source: eBay/MS Paint)Investors should feel betrayed after Shopify Inc. (SHOP) announced that it is entering the fulfillment business. Betrayed because they thought they were investing in a high-margin high-growth software company. But now, they are discovering that Shopify is morphing into a low-margin warehousing business, a business that will have difficulty competing in the e-commerce pro league as I shall explain later in this article.As part of this transformation, Shopify has acquired 6 River Systems to give it a high tech advantage over traditional fulfillment centers. But 6 River Systems isn't the $450 million home-run acquisition that management believes it is. The technology that this company brings to the plate makes the fulfillment center setup more convenient but doesn't provide the level of efficiency that Amazon (AMZN) achieves and will likely never be able to compete with the ever-decreasing fulfillment times. This leads me to wonder what real advantage this move will provide Shopify for the huge amount of money being spent.My opinion is that Shopify will need to sink a lot of money into this business, and the $450 million acquisition is just the beginning. The move into fulfillment, acquisition of 6 River Systems, and subsequent capital raise have caused me to revise my previous Shopify rating from neutral to bearish.I have been reading Seeking Alpha comments indicating that Shopify fulfillment will not only be self-funding but also have a 30% margin. Let's be clear on this point. Fulfillment centers offer some advantages, but profit isn't one of them.Consider the two biggest expenses: transportation and labor. Transportation cost is driven by the volume of product shipped. Without a huge buy-in from Shopify customers, present and future, transportation costs will be higher than competitors such as Amazon, FedEx (FDX), United Parcel Service (UPS), and Walmart (WMT).When it comes to labor cost, Shopify is banking on its robotic technology to gain a competitive advantage. However, 6 River Systems has nothing on Amazon in this respect, and it is dubious how much of an advantage that 6 River Systems has over other automated warehouse technologies.The technology that 6 River Systems has and Shopify paid $450 million for is Chuck the robot. In simple terms, Chuck is an AI-powered robot that guides employees around the warehouse and instructs the worker what to pick. The package is placed on the robot which then carries the package to its destination where the worker picks up the package and dispositions it.Chuck has been designed with convenience in mind so that buildings and shelving do not require extensive modification to support the robotics. While the 6 River Systems technology provides some improvement in labor efficiency by use of robotics and AI, it is not an end-to-end automatic robotic line and the majority of operations are still manual.Chuck is a great solution for small-scale fulfillment operations, offering ease of installment and fast startup. But this comes at a price. The 6 River Systems solution doesn't achieve the reduction in real estate that makes it practical and cost-effective to locate warehouses close to city centers. And while Chuck does make warehousing more efficient and faster, the fulfillment exercise is still 70% manual, and there is generally no apparent reduction in (human) jobs. They are redeployed to operate and maintain the automated system.Amazon started its foray into robotics back in 2012 and has evolved dramatically since then. Amazon fulfillment centers have several types of robots:Amazon doesn't operate fulfillment centers per se, the company actually has a fulfillment network consisting of six different types of buildings:From the above building descriptions, one can see that the manual effort is still quite extensive, even with the various types of robotics involved. Amazon claims to be able to fit 50% more inventory in the storage space in its robotics-based centers:In another development, Amazon recently announced that it is procuring machines known as CartonWrap that automate the boxing up of some customer orders. In another initiative, Amazon is introducing machines known as ""SmartPac"" which automates packaging in patented envelopes.Shopify has bought Chuck but didn't get any pick-and-place technology with the deal. An interesting development is that 6 River Systems has made a strategic partnership with Soft Robotics for such technology right after the 6 River Systems acquisition by Shopify was announced. I guess $450 million doesn't go that far anymore.We can expect more expenses, not only for pick-and-place technology but for automated packaging and envelopes to start with. The 6 River Systems acquisition was just the beginning of a long journey in competing with other e-commerce companies, and it will be very expensive and probably unprofitable.This is where the Shopify business model gets a little bit murky. Some of Shopify's merchants employ drop-shipping companies and don't require fulfillment services. Others store product locally and ship directly to customers. Then, there are the larger merchants that already have their own fulfillment capabilities. And finally, some merchants already employ one of the many fulfillment services that are easy-to-integrate with Shopify.Here is the problem. Shopify needs to process a high volume of product in order to achieve competitive shipping rates. Is Shopify going to mandate the use of Shopify Fulfillment by its merchants? I don't think this would be a wise move, considering that fulfillment isn't a one size fits all service. Dictating the fulfillment solution would only serve to drive away Shopify's customers.A number of factors that dictate the total fulfillment cost for individual merchants, and there isn't one best service. In fact, consultants make a business out of assisting merchants in their choice of fulfillment services to minimize costs. In any case, if there were one best service, Shopify may not be the one to offer it.Many small businesses don't require the use of fulfillment services. If a company can easily store the product in a basement, spare room or garage, then why would such a business want to pay significant fulfillment costs to achieve 2-day delivery in the United States only? The cost of shipping direct by the merchant is less than the fulfillment fees paid to Shopify.Shopify is a high-margin high-growth software e-commerce company but has now decided to expand into the business of fulfillment. It isn't clear to me what is driving this move as Shopify will become a warehousing, transportation, and logistics company. Nothing about these activities spells ""high-margin"" or ""profitable"".In all likelihood, Shopify will not be able to compete with Amazon, FedEx or UPS on transportation costs. The company may be on par with dozens of other fulfillment companies, some of which offer 1-day and international delivery. Shopify only intends to offer 2-day delivery in the United States, not particularly competitive.It isn't clear that 6 River Systems offers superior robotics and AI technology that will drive down labor costs more than the competition. Certainly, Shopify will have trouble competing with Amazon and Walmart at the very least.The 6 River Systems technology is designed for convenience and fast startup. It won't deliver a small footprint, however. Shopify will have difficulty competing for the last mile, in city centers where the cost of real estate is high.I expect that we are seeing the tip of the iceberg with regards to expenses, not only for acquiring new technology but for building the machines and fulfillment centers and acquiring real estate. Oh, and let's not forget the large number of delivery vans, airplanes and other delivery methods that the competition has invested in.Yes, Shopify investors, you have been relegated to the minor leagues. No more high-growth high-margin investment."
4299883,23570,2019-10-29T13:00:00-04:00,"SHOP is an extremely expensive stock at 20.2x EV/Sales - trading at a significant premium even to other hot tech stocks.It is not a profitable business, and management is investing significant capital in a series of non-core projects (reminds us of WeWork).It seems probable that a significant percentage of the user-base is made up of drop-shippers who provide negative value to their customers and unlikely to survive an economic downturn.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Short Ideas subscribers - find out more here.Shopify (SHOP) is a blisteringly expensive stock and currently trades at 20.2x consensus EV/Sales. The serious questions about the company's valuation have been well covered on Seeking Alpha in recent months, and this article is primarily concerned with evidence of how reliant the company is on drop-shipping - but it is worth covering a few key points about the extreme valuation at which the company is trading at before we begin.Not only is this a very high multiple compared to profitable software and e-commerce businesses (Adobe is trading at 11.7x, Alibaba is at 6.2x, Amazon is at 3.2x, eBay is at 3.2x), SHOP is a perennially unprofitable company - and as its revenues have grown, so have its operating losses (i.e. increased scale doesn't appear to be resulting in increased profitability).Source: Company filings, Noster CapitalAlthough by all accounts SHOP's core product is quite good, it is operating in an increasingly crowded space, and it does not have a dominant market share and does not have a significant technology advantage over its competitors.Source: Pagely.comAlthough revenue is growing reasonably fast (consensus expects 43% growth in 2019), it is moderating sharply from the almost 60% seen in 2018 and slowing revenue growth on a very high EV/Sales multiple is rarely a good sign.Management is also investing significant capital in a series of projects outside the company's core competency - all of which are potential boondoggles. The company has recently spent $450m on a warehouse robotics business (not especially helpful if the company is, as we suspect, heavily reliant on drop-shippers), and has ambitious plans to build its own fulfilment network.; it is investing in television and film content; and in unproven AR/VR technology - all of which suggests that management is concerned about the growth of the core business, and is looking for ways to keep the revenue growth rate up.At the same time, there are persistent questions about the company's disclosures on user numbers, its lack of disclosure on customer churn, and the apparent reliance of the business on 'drop-shippers' - Shopify stores which simply re-sell cheap Chinese merchandise, ordered directly from Aliexpress - at huge mark-ups - a practice which appears to be not only endorsed, but encouraged by SHOP.These questions have been around for a while - and we are not accusing SHOP of fraud - but if it is the case that a material percentage of SHOP's clients are this kind of business, then the sustainability of the growth rate, and perhaps of the entire business could well be threatened.Poor Disclosure of Customer Numbers:The way in which SHOP discloses information about its customers makes it difficult for investors to have any meaningful insight into their customer base.It seems clear from the disclosures that SHOP provides that they are not keen on investors having any meaningful insight into their customer base.SHOP discloses the overall number of merchants on the platform, which at FY18 was ""over 820,000"".Source: SHOP, 2018 Form 40-FUnfortunately, they decline to provide investors with any information about the rate of churn of these customers:Source: Text Search for ""Churn"", SHOP, 2018 Form 40-FIt is always a red flag for a company like SHOP to fail to disclose a metric as simple as churn - but they do give another number which investors can use to get some insight into the customer base - the Gross Merchandise Volume - or GMV.Source: SHOP, 2018 Form 40-FFrom this, investors can make a very simple calculation, dividing the GMV by the reported number of merchants on the platform to see how much volume is passing through the store of the average merchant.Source: Company filings, Noster CapitalThis is obviously a very crude calculation. SHOP serves a series of notable e-commerce brands (Allbirds, Kylie Cosmetics, etc.) which we can be certain are processing many multiples of this $50k average. If we had reliable revenue numbers with which we could exclude these, then the average user would be seeing rather less than $50k in average revenue.To be charitable to SHOP, we can give the average user full credit for the $50k in revenue. If we put this on a 25% gross margin (which again seems to be highly charitable to SHOP, as 25% is a relatively good gross margin for an undifferentiated retailer), we get gross profits for the average store of $12.5k.Doing this suggests that the average store on SHOP, using generous assumptions, is generating less gross profit that would be necessary to support even a single worker at the Federal minimum wage.Source: Company filings, Noster CapitalThe very clear implication of this is that the average customer of SHOP must be an extremely small business; or a hobbyist; or a tiny e-commerce operation attached to another business (or there is a problem with SHOP's reported numbers).This should be highly concerning for any investor in SHOP shares - and especially concerning at the astronomical multiple at which they are currently tradingDrop-shippers:Investors following the SHOP story will already be aware that the platform serves a significant number of 'drop-shippers'.These are merchants who instead of producing their own products simply re-sell products from other merchants - usually directly from Chinese manufacturers via Aliexpress. Usually, these merchants sell their products at an extreme mark-up to the price they pay to source them from Alibaba, and almost without exception, these merchants are primarily selling low-quality, low-utility goods.We include a 'Extreme Mark-Up Hall of Fame' below, but for now, a single example will suffice.Humblehousehold.com lists a ""Gold Rose"" product at $59.85 - although graciously claims to be offering at a discounted price of $19.95, allowing customers to ""SAVE $39.90"".Source: Humblehousehold.comAccording to our reverse-IP search research (described in more detail below), Humblehousehold.com is listed as the 143rd most popular store run on SHOP (based on daily user traffic). This suggests that it is in the top 0.02% of SHOP stores - right up there with the most popular on the platform (we expected drop-shippers to appear much later in the list, but clearly they are more prevalent than expected).Unfortunately for customers of this store, they are paying an extraordinary mark-up over the price at which the exact same product is available on Aliexpress:Source: AliexpressIn fact, taking the bottom end of the range shown on Aliexpress the mark up on the SHOP store is an astounding 4,333% - or to put it another way, a customer unwittingly paying $59.85 for the exact same product they could by on Aliexpress for $1.35 is paying an ""ignorance tax"" of 97.7% for not thinking to shop around.Source: Noster CapitalCitron Research, the well-regarded short-seller published a 2017 article on this problem Citron Exposes the Dark Side of Shopify The FTC will Take Notice and various articles have commented on it since.With such a concerning allegation out in the public domain - albeit in an article that is now a couple of years old, we thought it would be interesting to look into the current state of drop-shipping on SHOP and to see if we could find evidence of how big a problem it currently is.The first task was to check YouTube to assess the current level of video-makers pushing the idea of individuals starting a business on SHOP that attempts to make money simply buy drop-shipping cheap goods from Aliexpress.Surprisingly - given that this was exposed by Citron Research several years ago and given the serious questions it raises about the customer numbers reported by SHOP, the pushing of drop-shipping as a kind of ""get rich quick scheme"" on YouTube is alive and well.Source: Youtube.comWorse than this, many of these video-makers are attempting to sell training or coaching services on the back of this ""drop-shipping opportunity"".Source: Youtube.comSource: theecomclubhouse.comMany of these video-makers are paid commissions by SHOP under its affiliate marketing program - although the company does not disclose exactly how much it is spending on pushing these drop-shipping schemes.Source: SHOP, 2018 Form 40-FA good way for anyone offered the chance to pay for an investment method or business plan is to ask himself: ""If this plan really produced the promised results, would those generating these results really be bothered to teach courses on it?"".In the case of these video-makers, the answer is obvious. If the producer of the video that claimed to demonstrate $51,573 within the first month of drop-shipping on SHOP was really generating such results, then they would have no rational reason to spend their time on providing services to others - not only would it be a waste of their clearly highly valuable time, it would also be introducing competitors in what (for the courses and lessons to work) is a business with no barriers to entry.Worse than this, SHOP itself is producing high-production-value videos trying to push drop-shipping in a way that appears dangerously close to being ""get rich quick scheme"".In Q2 2017, SHOP acquired a company called 'Oberlo', which has as its main product a tool for dropshippers to import Aliexpress listings into their SHOP store.Source: SHOP, 2018 Form 40-FOberlo - which is in effect SHOP using the name of one of its subsidiaries - also makes drop-shipping videos, some of which are, extraordinarily, literally tutorials on which products drop-shippers should select from Aliexpress, and how aggressively drop-shippers should mark them up.Source: Youtube.comOur favourite video from Oberlo was produced in late 2018 is titled ""Realistic Dropshipping Startup Budget for 2019"" (link: Realistic Dropshipping Startup Budget for 2019).This video purports to reveal the necessary 'startup budget' for someone looking to start drop-shipping on SHOP. The video explains that to drop-ship at higher volumes will require a larger investment, but ""if you just want to make one-hundred extra dollars a month your budget can be much more modest… today we will focus on the more modest budget"".The total start-up budget that the video suggests is $387.99, and the presenter claims that this kind of drop-shipping is ""a low risk business model for new entrepreneurs"".Source: Youtube.com (link to exact time: Realistic Dropshipping Startup Budget for 2019)We invite readers to think about this for a moment.This is a video produced by a company owned by SHOP (as shown in the screenshot from the 40-K above), using the same logo that is used by Oberlo on SHOP's own app store. The high production values of the videos imply that they are being made at some cost to SHOP. These videos seem to be suggesting that for an initial investment of about $400, a user can expect to earn ""one-hundred extra dollars a month"".Grossing up the monthly cost of the SHOP store to 12 months, and ignoring the fact that Oberlo is only free if a user is selling less than 50 items a month (which will surely be necessary to make any such business viable), the numbers provided in this video produced by SHOP seem to suggest that for an annual cost of $718, a drop-shipper can make $1,200 in income a year. This is a one-year return of 67.2% on these start-up costs.If such returns really were possible from drop-shipping, then the rational thing for SHOP to do would be to stop paying for any marketing and devote itself solely to being a drop-shipper.If the returns available to an individual drop-shipper are so high, imagine the astronomical returns that SHOP could earn if they were to do this themselves with all the benefits that scale could provide! How strange it is that they are devoting shareholders' capital to marketing this opportunity to individuals on the internet instead of capturing this opportunity!The SEC provides basic advice to investors on how to avoid bad investment opportunities. We are certainly not suggesting that SHOP is involved in any sort of fraud - but it might be interesting for readers to reflect on the kind of returns that the Oberlo video suggests are possible, and the suggestion that this is ""a low risk business opportunity for new entrepreneurs"", and compare them to the following advice from the SEC.Source: SEC, 2015How big is SHOP's Drop-Shipping Problem?Due to SHOP's very limited disclosures about its user numbers, there is no data from the company about how much of the user-base is made up of drop-shippers.However, there is some evidence that we can look to in order to get a sense of the scale of drop-shipping within SHOP's user-base.We searched YouTube for ""shopify dropshipping"", and checked the subscriber numbers (note, this is the number of people who have elected to subscribe to every new video from a particular video-maker, rather than the number of views for individual videos) for the first 25 different video makers that appear.Because we have used a simple YouTube search and have not attempted to weed out video-makers with relatively low subscriber numbers, this is necessarily a fairly conservative view of the number of people signed up to receive such videos. It is not only possible but likely that this method is materially understating the number of people subscribing to these videos.This non-targeted sample of 25 video-makers demonstrates that there are just under 3m subscriptions to these videos - when the SHOP merchant count is 0.82m.Source: YouTube, Noster CapitalNow, it is clear that not every subscriber to these videos is actually drop-shipping on SHOP (because the subscribers are a multiple of SHOP's users), and it is also highly likely that there will be a material overlap between the subscribers to each video (although this will be limited by the fact that several of the video-makers in the sample present in languages other than English).The table below shows what percent of SHOP's reported users might be drop-shippers under various assumptions about what percentage of subscribers are actually involved in the practice, and how great an overlap there is of subscribers between the different video-makers.For example, if we were to estimate that only 30% of the viewers of each video are actually involved in drop-shipping (and this feels generous to SHOP - because having watched several hours of these videos we can earnestly state that they have minimal entertainment value and are unlikely to be interesting to anyone not involved in dropshipping), and that only 30% of the viewers are 'unique viewers' (i.e. not subscribed to multiple video-makers), this non-targeted sample of a few YouTube accounts would suggest that 32% of SHOP's reported merchants could be simple drop-shippers.The argument here is not that we are sure that 30% unique viewers and 30% of viewers drop-shipping are the correct numbers - it is not possible to know exactly which inputs are correct. However, readers can use this table to see how much of the user base could be drop-shipping even if we assumed that the vast majority of subscribers to these videos were overlapping, and not drop-shipping themselves.Source: Noster CapitalThis isn't conclusive evidence, however. To get more conviction on the size of the drop-shipping product requires deeper digging.Luckily, despite SHOP's reluctance to provide its investors with meaningful detail on its user-base, there are ways to get an insight into the make-up of their merchants.There are several websites that allow a user to perform a search of hosting data for all websites hosted on a particular IP (in fact this is a method used by drop-shippers to do research on their competitors), and the method we used is described here: How to find best Dropshipping sites on Shopify Stores| Dropshipping Agent.SHOP appears to use the same Canadian IP address for its users (even when they have paid for a unique domain name), and so it is possible to generate a list of SHOP stores ordered by daily user traffic using this kind of search.We performed such a search, and manually checked the top 1,000 stores (listed in terms of daily users), and the results weren't pretty.In the top 1,000 stores (or the most popular 0.1% of SHOP's user-base), there were at least 35 drop-shippers (we have screenshots to document each of these - although we do not present them here as the evidence runs to more than 50 pages).We say ""at least"" - because our definition of 'drop-shipper' for the purposes of this research was ""a store on SHOP which has on its front page a product that can be found on Aliexpress at a much lower price in a few seconds of searching"". We also ignored all shops selling only clothing (as evidence of drop-shipping of these is more difficult to gather).Had we gone through the top 1,000 stores in more detail, were more persistent in checking Aliexpress for products that appeared to be drop-shipped but did not immediately appear in the search results, and were not excluding all stores selling apparel we are certain that we would have found a rather higher preponderance of drop-shippers.35 out of the top 1,000 - or 3.5% - is not a number fatal to the SHOP bull case. However, these were the top 1,000 stores when listed in terms of popularity (and we are satisfied that the popularity numbers are at least basically reliable, as the big-name SHOP clients - Gymshark, Allbirds, Jeffree Star, Kylie Cosmetics - all appeared at the top of the list).We then set out to find out at what point in the list a significantly concerning percentage of stores were drop-shippers.Using the list of SHOP stores in order of popularly, at various intervals we checked 50 stores for evidence of being a 'drop-shipper' (using the definition explained above).The results are shown in the chart below. We stopped when we reached more than 25% of stores that were drop-shippers - which occurred for the first time within the top 10,000 stores - or the top 1.2% of SHOP's reported merchant numbers.Source: Noster CapitalEven within the top 3,000 stores, our samples were including more than 15% drop-shippers - and despite the lull in the samples between 4,000 and 6,000, the trend is clearly upwards.If within the top 1.2% of reported customers, samples are coming up with 28% drop-shippers, and the trend is upwards, imagine how prevalent they must be in the other 98.8% of the company's user-base!Drop-shippers are not a sustainable userbase for SHOP:At this point, it might be worth asking how serious a problem this high concentration of drop-shippers actually is for SHOP. These merchants must be generating revenue for SHOP, and so even if all they are doing is acting as middle-men between consumers and goods sold on Aliexpress their presence is still a net benefit to SHOP shareholders?This argument doesn't stand up to scrutiny:Other Curious Findings:An interesting side-effect of manually checking the top 1,000 SHOP stores listed by the reverse IP search was the discovery of a series of weird and wonderful merchants. Each of these can only be serving a customer base that is vanishingly small (how many buyers are there, even in a global market, for t-shirts based on esoteric numerology?), and unless these websites are suffering a serious problem with fake traffic, and if the reverse IP search is even close to accurate, then the fact that these stores appear to be in the top 0.1% of SHOP's clients by traffic is extremely concerning.A selection of the most unusual SHOP stores in the top 1,000 by traffic is below.Spiritual Numerology Accessories:Witchcraft Supplies:Supplies for Russian Magicians (note: the website is entirely in Russian and is unlikely to be selling to a global audience):""The paradigm-altering discoveries of quantum science"":$12 Wedding Rings:""God's Marvelous Protective Provisions for the Coming Nuclear & Solar Storm Crisis"":Steam Train Whistles:An incoherent mix of cheap jewelry, and sex toys that we found so disturbing we felt the need to report them to the relevant authorities:Source for all: Myip.msWhat are we left with?SHOP is an extremely expensive stock at 20.2x EV/Sales - trading at a significant premium even to other hot tech stocks. It is not a profitable business, and management is investing significant capital in a series of non-core projects.The disclosures the company makes about user numbers are of minimal use to investors, and the lack of disclosure on churn is a red flag.It seems probable that a significant percentage of the user-base is made up of drop-shippers who provide negative value to their customers, are surely not a high-quality source of revenue for SHOP, are too small to be sustainable, and unlikely to survive an economic downturn.Investors should be demanding from SHOP full and complete disclosure of its user base, its churn, the scale of any reliance on drop-shippers. Without this, it is difficult to see how the shares can be considered investable - let alone to command such an astronomical multiple.Appendix - The Extreme Mark-up Hall of Fame:The mark-ups attempted by some of the SHOP drop-shippers that we have seen while researching this article are so extreme - and so audacious - that it seems only fair to recognise some of them here so that readers can admire quite how brave they are.1: ""Animal Baby Playmat"" from ""shopbabychild.com"".Price on SHOP: $60Source: shopbabychild.comPrice on Aliexpress: $6.81Source: AliexpressIgnorance Tax = 91.4%2: ""Talking Hamster Toy"" from ""zplus.store""Price on SHOP: $59.99Source: zplus.storePrice on Aliexpress: $4.89Source: AliexpressIgnorance Tax = 91.8%3: iPhone Case from ""Expressdeal.net""Price on SHOP: $15.75Source: expressdeal.netPrice on Aliexpress: $1.59Source: AliexpressIgnorance Tax = 89.9%"
4294397,102646,2019-10-01T13:01:50-04:00,Shopify stock is in a bear market after a 20% decline in the past month.Stock is now trading at the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level.I expect the stock to retest the all-time high of $405 in November.,"I have always like Shopify (SHOP). In my past articles, I have detailed how I bought Shopify in 2017 and exited my stake in December last year. My profits for the investment were great, but they could have been better if I didn’t sell. I have also mentioned that my wife is a big fan of the Shopify platform. She has been running her e-commerce store using the platform and she really likes it. She was using Woo-Commerce before making the switch to SHOP.Shopify has had a great year. YTD, the company’s stock has risen by more than 120%. However, in the past one month, the stock has declined by 22% as investors have started developing jitters on the company. The stock is trading at $305, which is lower than the all-time high of $405. The current price is along the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level as shown below.Source: Trading ViewShopify is not the only SAAS stock that has been declining. Some of its closest SAAS peers like Okta (OKTA), Twilio (TWLO), and Wix (WIX) have fallen into correction territory. This has happened as investors fear about these companies’ valuation, the slowdown in IT spending, and their increased losses. Investors have also worried about the sky-high valuation of loss-making technology companies.Source: Trading ViewShopify has had more issues. This month, the company announced that it had raised $450 million after selling 1.9 million shares. The company used the proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet and to fund growth. This announcement came two weeks after the company acquired 6 River Systems for $450 million. The company provides warehouse solutions.Buy the Dip for the Short TermIn the past, regular readers know that I have been critical of the company’s valuation. In June, I wrote that the company had a ridiculous valuation. In February this year, I wrote that while Shopify was a good company, its valuation made no sense.To a large extent, these concerns still remains. Furthermore, SHOP is a company with annual revenues of more than $1.3 billion and a market valuation of more than $35 billion. The company is still making losses as the management continue to invest for growth.I have also expressed caution that the market for e-commerce software was peaking. My argument has been that large companies like Nike (NIKE) and Lululemon (LULU) that sell directly to consumer have their e-commerce presence already. It is companies like this that are able to pay Shopify $399 per month. A major bull thesis for SHOP has been that most small companies that are not yet online will sign up. While this point can be made, I simply don’t see many of these companies moving online. In line with this, the company appears to have started to experience weak traffic growth. As shown below, in the past six months, traffic has declined from 47 million to just 40 million.Source: Similar WebIn the long-term, I believe that SHOP’s stock could move lower as the growth stabilizes. However, I do believe that the current 20% decline is an overreaction. Therefore, while I think the stock could continue being subdued this month, I believe that the stock will make a good recovery when it releases its third quarter earnings.The company will release its earnings on 1st November. Investors expect the EPS will rise to ten cents. This will be a significant increase from the 3 cents loss in the same quarter a year ago. They also expect the EPS to grow to 60 cents in the December quarter. They also expect the company’s revenue to grow to $383 million from $270 million it had in the same quarter a year ago. It will be impressive growth even if the company’s results are in line with expectations. But SHOP will likely surpass analysts estimates in all quarters as a public company. I see it doing the same this quarter.Technical Indicators Point to a ReversalAs mentioned above, the stock is currently trading at the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. At the same time, the RSI has dropped from a high of 73 and tested a low of 26. It has recovered slightly and is currently at 35. The 50-day and 25-day EMA are making a bearish crossover, which signals that the price could move lower. If it does, I see a possibility of the stock testing the 50% Fibonacci level of $265 before the stock starts moving up to retest the YTD high of $400.Final ThoughtsShopify stock has declined by 20% in the past one month. This makes September the worst month for the company. This drop has been in line with what other SAAS companies have performed. The decision to raise money has also been a bit bearish for the company. However, I believe that the company will likely surprise investors in the upcoming quarterly earnings. If it does, the stock will likely recover and retest its previous highs of above $50 billion. In the long-term however, I believe Shopify could see slower growth that will affect the stock performance."
4294167,105417,2019-09-30T11:33:30-04:00,"Guidance for 2019 will likely increase further during the next earnings announcement.International growth remains key, though regulatory concerns in Canada is a red flag.Percentage of recurring business to meaningfully grow in 2020.","Shopify (SHOP) is a multi-channel commerce platform that builds mobile-based software that enables merchants to set up online storefronts with retail functionality. Merchants use SHOP’s software across various sales channels, such as web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, and social network marketplaces, among others. The Shopify platform allows merchants to manage products and inventory, build customer relationships, leverage analytics, and even access financing.We see EV/revenue as the best valuation multiple in Shopify’s case, given the company’s focus on net merchant and add-ons growth. When we apply the multiple of ~22.4x to 2020 revenue base, we see an estimate of $395. We note that this multiple holds true only if the United States economy does not start deteriorating in 2020, since new merchant additions are particularly strongly dependent on economy at Shopify.We see the following catalysts driving the SHOP Story:Expect 2019 Guidance Raise: We believe that the company may up its 2019 guidance (essentially, 4th quarter estimates) during the next earnings call. Both Subscription Solutions and Merchant Solutions are likely to see a modest uptick in guidance, which the company may set conservatively enough to allow for a comfortable beat the following quarter. This strategy of conservative guides and subsequent beats has served Shopify well during most quarters.International Growth Remains Key: While this is the tailwind for the long run, we believe that 2019-20 will become “test” years that will indicate whether Shopify can in fact make international presence as meaningful as it is in the United States. While SHOP comfortably gains share in non-US markets, there is an overwhelming question of cost benefits and their impact on the overall margin. In particular, as we zero in on Canada, the extent of the regulatory headwinds becomes a crucial factor in the growth story.Shopify Payments to Continue Growing in Double Digits: We see Shopify Payments as the key growth engine of the Shopify story, which makes at least 15-18% Y/Y annual growth as key to the top-line support. Domestic merchants are predominantly driving Shopify Payments at present, though, over time, we should see greater international traction as well.Subscription Solutions to Expand in 4Q: We are modeling at least $160 MM in Subscription Solutions revenue in the 4Q, mostly driven by new accounts. In our view, Subscription Solutions will soon become consistently greater than 50% of the company’s total revenue base, overtaking Merchant Solutions.Expect Monthly Recurring Revenue to Hover at 20%+ in 2020: One of Shopify’s crucial (and often underestimated, in our view), metrics is monthly recurring revenue. With the annual revenue base of about $1.1-1.2 billion, we have seen recurring revenue in the $150-200 MM range throughout 2019. We believe that smaller merchant accounts, which are inherently more loyal and stickier, shall gradually drive this recurring percentage higher in 2020, surpassing the 20% as percentage of total revenue.We see the following risks as potentially damaging SHOP’s business. In our view, most of the key risks are technology-related:"
4292151,24849,2019-09-17T22:51:57-04:00,Shares enter correction mode on share offering news.Revenue growth continues to improve.Balance sheet allows for future investments.,"One of the best stocks to hold in recent years has been Shopify (SHOP). The leading multi-channel commerce platform was under $20 a share in the beginning of 2016, but recently hit a high just under $410. For those looking to get into one of the market's hottest names, the recent bear market may provide the perfect opportunity.(Source: Yahoo Finance)The name is now down more than 20% from its recent high, trading just above $320 in Monday's after-hours, after the company announced a secondary offering of 1.9 million Class A shares. This would represent dilution of about 2% before including the 15% over-allotment option given to underwriters, yet the stock is down more than 5% on the news. This news of dilution comes after a recent acquisition was announced that also has a partial stock component.On one hand, the secondary offering represents a little bit of a missed opportunity given where shares were in recent weeks. Had management announced this deal when shares were around $400, they could have sold less shares or raised even more money for the same number of shares. Imagine pricing the deal at, say, $385 instead of under $320 where it did end up. However, the deal will help to improve an already sparkling balance sheet, which, at the end of the most recent quarter, featured over $2 billion in cash and short-term investments, against just about $300 million in total liabilities. This gives the company plenty of financial flexibility to continue investments in future growth, whether they be internal projects or external acquisitions.One thing I really like about Shopify is that it is consistently outperforming expectations. When you take a look at the earnings history page here, all you see is green, meaning there have been no estimate misses. That means both revenue and earnings estimates are almost always on the rise, and management has certainly boosted guidance for this year a few times as detailed below:With two revenue guidance hikes already in the books, the Street is expecting to see another one coming moving forward. The current analyst estimate for revenues this year is $1.54 billion, and given the company's track record, it would not surprise me to see that number be low when all is said and done. Revenue growth for the year could be 45%, with projections for double-digit increases expected for many years to come. This was a name that had total revenues of just $205 million in 2015, but is already expected to do more than ten times that amount next year.Unlike some of the new tech names out there, Shopify is already profitable on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP losses right now are primarily a function of stock-based compensation, but as revenues continue to soar, I think we'll see margins scale a bit, with GAAP profitability eventually coming. The company has produced positive cash flow from operations the past two years, and getting to free cash flow in the coming years will only help the balance sheet further. Shopify is not a name that's selling shares because it is burning cash and needs to plug balance sheet holes, it's one that is selling shares to fund growth opportunities.Let me discuss one of the bear camp's main concerns, and that is valuation. Right now, shares go for about 17.5 times next year's expected sales, compared to a name like eBay (EBAY) that goes for about three times. However, eBay is barely growing right now, and one analyst thinks Shopify will pass eBay by year's end to become America's second-largest e-commerce platform. That analyst put a $410 price target on the stock, while another recently stated Shopify could trade to $481 in the most bullish note on the Street currently. While Shopify is expensive right now, investors in this low interest rate environment seem to love to pay for growth - and that's something Shopify currently has plenty of. As revenues soar, that valuation won't look as bad even if the stock rises a bit from here.In the end, I believe investors could use the recent bear market in Shopify to load up on shares. While the secondary offering will mean a small amount of dilution, the stock sale is a way to fund more growth opportunities and add to an already strong balance sheet. The company continues to outperform expectations and has already raised its revenue forecast twice this year. With many years of growth expected ahead, I think investors that pass on the name now will look back at this pullback as a missed opportunity."
4293645,23903,2019-09-26T08:15:46-04:00,"Shopify has been on a tremendous momentum-fueled rally since the start of 2019, taking its market capitalization to nearly $50 billion.The stock's rally never broke most popular technical indicators until early September 2019.Potential technical support for Shopify stock indicates further downside is possible.","Shopify (SHOP) had been one of the top-performing stocks in 2019 with gains as high as 200% since the start of the year. With nearly all dips lasting no longer than a few days, SHOP's bullish technicals gave momentum traders fuel to continue buying, which accelerated the stock's parabolic move. However, after peaking at $409 in late August, the stock went heavily under distribution, which resulted in a correction exceeding 25%. Despite the magnitude of the recent correction, longer-term technical support levels suggest additional downside is possible.There has been a lot of fundamental arguments around Shopify during its stratospheric rally. Bulls argued it would become the next Amazon (AMZN). Bears cited stretched valuations in an extremely competitive industry. Though I wrote an article citing SHOP's valuation far exceeded its earnings potential even years forward, I admitted in my conclusion momentum could take the stock higher.In a follow-up article, I showed how SHOP was performing like dotcom stocks twenty years ago after analysts perpetually increased price targets despite little change in the company's fundamentals. All news was good news, as investors took any actions the company took as another step towards becoming the next great thing.A perfect example was SHOP's announcement of a fulfillment vertical which bulls compared to Amazon's FBA. While I acknowledged this step should be incrementally positive towards revenue growth, I questioned the actual profitability of an additional low-margin ""bricks and mortar"" vertical and the additional capital investment required for its expansion.In early September, Shopify announced a $450 million purchase of 6 River Systems to help in the expansion of the company's new fulfillment vertical. A week later, it announced another secondary of nearly $700 million, despite already having over $2 billion in cash partly from two prior secondaries last year and the year prior. Investors may finally be questioning how costly the build-out of a fulfillment vertical would be for a company with far less resources than the Amazon investors hoped it could become.Momentum works both ways, and clearly, it has shifted bearish for SHOP in the last three weeks. Momentum ignored valuations on the upside, and it could ignore any sense of potential value in the company's business on the downside. With many articles already detailing the stretched nature of Shopify's valuations, the remaining portion article will solely focus on the stock's technicals and its potential downside targets.Trend LinesThe first indicator of momentum shifting is a clear break in SHOP's trend lines. The following daily chart shows both the initial lower sloping trend line and the higher sloping trend line that formed after SHOP's rally intensified.The green trend line extends from the early January 2019 lows, while the purple trend line formed from SHOP's early April lows.A weekly chart below shows the trend lines more clearly.Bearish CrossoversTwo key momentum indicators have also turned bearish in the past two weeks. On the daily chart shown below, both MACD and PMO crossed over their signal line about two weeks ago. In addition, both indicators have crossed below the neutral zero line, signaling a potential extended downturn. This represents the first crossover below zero for both indicators since the start of SHOP's rally in early January.On the weekly chart, the signal line crossovers also potentially indicate the start of an extended bearish period. Again, these were the first signal line crossovers since the very start of the rally nine months ago.Bearish Stock Distribution TrendsPerhaps the most telling momentum shift has been the dramatic change in SHOP's accumulation/distribution and on balance volume indicators. These indicators in the chart below show a clear exit of bulls to levels below the start of SHOP's rally. What should concern bulls further is that SHOP stock price is still far above levels where these indicators suggest its stock should be based on accumulation/distribution (blue horizontal line in the chart below).A major support/resistance indicator followed by many traders are moving averages. The following daily chart shows SHOP's 50-day MA (green line) and 200-day MA (red line). With its current price right in the middle of the 50-day MA (about $350) and the 200-day MA (about $250), SHOP's short-term movement could be in either direction, but major support based on moving averages suggest additional potential downside.Key Retracement LevelsSince SHOP's extended rally caused a large divergence between its 50-day MA and 200-day MA, other support levels such as retracement ratios should also be examined. The chart below shows the key 50% retracement and popular Fibonacci retracement percentages.If SHOP does not convincingly hold the 50% retracement line around $293, the first Fibonacci line below, which is around $264, would be the next support level. From there, the stock should see strong support around its 200-day MA at $250.Volume ProfileShould SHOP break below its 200-day MA, additional technical downside could be significant beyond the 78.6% retracement level, as shown in the volume profile below.The key takeaway is that the point of control (thick red line) is far below the stock's current price and even its 200-day MA. SHOP experienced heavy accumulation throughout most of 2018, which fueled its extended rally once old highs around $175 were broken. With low-volume profiles between its current price and the point of control, a break below the stock's 200-day MA could cause a full retracement to its 2018 highs of $175.The momentum behind Shopify stock can make it dangerous in both direction for the average investor. For this reason, it is advisable not to take a major position either way. Given this volatility, option premiums can often be high, allowing both bulls and bears to reduce costs by selling covered options.However, with key technical indicators turning bearish as mentioned above, the short-term risk is clearly tilted to the downside. For the same reasons that bears should not have relied on overvaluation arguments as SHOP rallied, bulls should not fall into the trap of making longer-term fundamental arguments either. In the end, as the stock market has shown, stocks always seep to their rightful value over time."
4291261,104302,2019-09-12T16:20:16-04:00,"Compared to other companies within its league, Shopify is clearly the most expensive, and its valuation cannot be justified using typical valuation methods.This article provides a valuation spreadsheet and based on very optimistic estimates, Shopify should be valued at about 25% of its current valuation (as of September 1st, 2019).Shopify is clearly a stock bubble that is bound to burst and drop significantly in price.Shopify has already cleared the later stages of the “Mania Phase”, and we have either just entered the “Blowoff Phase” or on the edge of entering that phase.","Over the last few months, Shopify (SHOP) has been experiencing a meteoric rise that has not been seen since the late 1990s in the dot-com era. This price has been mostly supported by analysts who have been increasing their price target for the company stock price to very high levels.In addition, for every article that was published about Shopify on Seeking Alpha or other sites during this rise, regardless of whether the article was positive or negative about Shopify, arguments sprouted about the justification of the company stock price growth.I currently hold a short position on Shopify and the slew of positive comments about the company from both commentators and analysts alike made me doubt my position; I thus decided to go back to the drawing board, review my position, go back to the basics and conduct my own analysis on the company.After I conducted my own analysis on the company fundamentals from both the growth and value perspectives, I decided to submit this analysis for publication.This article starts by comparing Shopify’s value to similar companies within its own league in terms of capitalization, revenue, revenue growth, dividends and net income. In addition, the article also looks at different companies which readers can relate to. These companies fall into one of a two categories:The article next reviews what analysts are predicting for Shopify’s value, and what is driving the analysts to come up with their price targets.After that the article presents a spreadsheet that contains a parametrized expected future revenue/expenses/income for Shopify; this spreadsheet is made available for downloading so that the readers can play with the parameters and come up with their own valuation.The article then looks at the characteristics and history of stock and investment bubbles, and cross-references Shopify stock against these characteristics. The article concludes that Shopify stock price is a poster child bubble that is very highly over-priced, and that with very optimistic assumptions, its capitalization is expected to drop to about 25% of its current value.In this section, we will review a few Canadian companies that compare to Shopify in terms of capitalization, line of business (e-commerce or technology) or revenue, regardless of the industry they are in. The specific companies that we will look at are BCE (BCE), Canadian Tire (CTC.A), CIBC (CM) and Rogers Communications (RCI.B).We will next review other SaaS or e-commerce companies (mostly US companies) that provide similar offerings, have similar capitalization or have comparable revenues. These companies are Adobe (ADBE), Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba (BABA), eBay (EBAY), Salesforce (CRM), Square (SQ), WiX (WIX) and Workday (WDAY).Please note that because Shopify does not generate any net income, so we are not doing any significant comparisons related to net income.BCE Inc. (BCE)There are two reasons for comparing BCE to Shopify: First, its capitalization is very similar to Shopify and second, it can be construed as a technology company. The dollar figure revenue growth for BCE is almost twice that of Shopify’s total revenue and its capitalization is almost the same as that of Shopify but it is trading at a multiple of 2.41 times revenue versus 35 for Shopify.Canadian Tire (OTC:CDNTF)I included Canadian Tire here because it is investing heavily in e-commerce, and may be construed as a direct competitor to Shopify. Canadian Tire makes about ten times as much revenue as Shopify, its dollar revenue growth is twice that of Shopify, and is only 15% the capitalization of Shopify.CIBC (CM)CIBC was included here only because it is a Canadian company with a capitalization similar to that of Shopify. CIBC’s revenue is about 12 times the revenue of Shopify, its dollar revenue growth is higher than Shopify’s total revenue and its net income is 3.5 times as much as Shopify’s total revenue. CIBC has a capitalization lower than that of Shopify.Rogers Communications (RCI)Rogers was included here because it is a technology company that is within approximately the same range of capitalization (half Shopify’s capitalization). Rogers revenue is about 10 times Shopify’s revenue and its net income is 150% Shopify’s total revenue. Rogers dollar revenue growth is about twice Shopify’s revenue growth.** Capitalization as of September 1st, 2019; Revenue and Income are for the 2018 fiscal year.** Symbols are the Toronto Stock Exchange symbols** All figures except for revenue multiple and number of employees are in Canadian Dollars (Billions)Adobe (ADBE)Adobe was included here because it owns Magento, one of the direct competitors of Shopify. Adobe is arguably a fairly expensive company with 3.5 times the capitalization of Shopify. However, its dollar revenue growth is 50% higher than the total revenue of Shopify and its net income is more than twice Shopify’s total revenue.Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba currently has the highest net income worldwide in the e-commerce industry, even higher than that of Amazon. Its capitalization is about half that of Amazon and about 12 times the capitalization of Shopify. The revenue growth of BABA is over 17 times the total revenue of Shopify and its net income is about 11 times the total revenue of Shopify.Amazon (AMZN)Some analysts consider Amazon one of the key Shopify competitors. Although Amazon has 128 times the revenue of Shopify and its dollar revenue growth is 88 times the dollar revenue growth of Shopify, it only has 22 times the market capitalization. I recently published an article in Seeking Alpha about the relationships between Amazon and Shopify: “Amazon And Shopify: 'Coopetition' mAt Its Best”, which you might like to review to have a better understanding of the relationships between Amazon and Shopify.eBay (EBAY)Shopify recently surpassed the market capitalization of eBay, and they are still in the same capitalization range. This is despite the fact that the revenue of eBay is 34 times that of Shopify, that eBay’s net income is more than twice Shopify’s total revenue and eBay's revenue growth is larger than Shopify’s total revenue.Salesforce (CRM)Salesforce can be arguably coined as the world’s SaaS leader, and this is why it is included here. Its capitalization is just 3.5 times that of Shopify, although it is a profitable company with revenue equal to 13 times that of Shopify's and its dollar revenue growth is higher than Shopify’s total revenue.Square (SQ)After acquiring Weebly, Square became a direct competitor of Shopify. Its capitalization is about half of Shopify’s capitalization. Square has 3.5 time the revenue of Shopify and its revenue growth is over 50% of Shopify’s total revenue.WiX (WIX)Some may argue that WiX as the biggest potential competitor of Shopify. While WiX has significantly more customers than Shopify, it is mostly used as a web site builder rather than an e-commerce platform, despite its abilities to provide this functionality. The target market that WiX has for its e-commerce abilities is not for drop shippers like Shopify but rather manufacturers and service providers. This is a much more sustainable market and as a result, its churn would be much smaller for WiX. WiX has about half Shopify’s revenue but its capitalization is less than 20% of Shopify’s capitalization. Over a year ago, I published an article that compares Shopify with WiX: “Shopify And Wix.com - Where Are They Going?”, and many of the comparison points are still valid now.Workday (WDAY)This is a very fast-growing SaaS company; that is, while not a direct competitor, it is in the same industry sector as Shopify. The company has a capitalization of 75% that of Shopify with almost twice the revenue, and Workday’s revenue growth is over 50% of Shopify’s total revenue.** Capitalization as of September 1st, 2019; Revenue and Income are for the 2018 fiscal year.** Above figures except for revenue multiple are in US Dollars (Billions)Based on the above analysis, Shopify is insanely expensive compared to the other companies that are compared against. The comparison shows that many companies have a lower capitalization than Shopify while their last year revenue growth is higher than Shopify’s total revenue. Yes, you read it correctly: I am comparing the revenue growth against Shopify’s total revenue.Looking at Shopify’s number of employees compared to the other e-commerce companies like Alibaba, Amazon and the likes, we can easily make an assessment that it is a very small company. If the company were generating a large net income, that would be ok, and it would position the company for high growth. However, for Shopify to grow, it would need to increase its number of employees; because Shopify generates no net income, growing its number of employees may have a negative effect on the company’s cash flow.So, why am I providing this comparison here?Investors need to make a choice about how to invest their hard-earned cash, and have to conduct their thorough analysis related to where to put their money. This above comparison provides a few alternatives for other companies that are growing at a relatively fast rate, with a dollar growth much higher than that of Shopify and are valued at a lower price. This is not a recommendation for buying the other companies but rather a pointer for readers to investigate these companies, conduct their own analysis and decide whether they should invest in Shopify or any of these other companies.Some investors invested early in Shopify, recouped their original investments, and their Shopify investments are strictly composed of their Shopify profits; these investors need to remember that in investments there is no “house money”, even if your assets are locked into an escrow account. It is “your money”; if you keep it invested in a particular stock because you already recouped the original investment of this stock as it rose multiple folds without proper justification, then gambling on the roulette may be no different. In other words, these investors need to make a decision whether to keep Shopify or to sell it assuming that it is a brand-new investment that they are starting today, otherwise, they would be simply gambling.Analysts who are coming up with the price targets described in the next section (average of approximately $360) are relying on some assumptions that are sometimes believable and sometimes unreasonable. This section will list and analyze these assumptions. Now, whether these assumptions are valid or not is a decision that the readers have to make. So, here are a few assumptions that analysts tend to make to reach the price targets described in the next section.(1) Shopify will maintain its technological lead in the e-commerce marketShopify currently has a distinct technological advantage over its competitors in terms of ease-of-use, customer service, rich features and full integration of e-commerce functionality. While some may argue that Magento is more flexible and has more third-party tools available with it and is accordingly more flexible, and that WiX has an easier user interface, I personally believe that Shopify currently has a clear technological lead when taking the combined aspects listed above. However, as we have learned over the years, a technological lead cannot be construed as a moat against competitor’s attacks especially when the competitors are larger companies, and should be heavily discounted in the company valuation.(2) Number of Shopify stores will continue growingAnalysts base their valuation on at least a linear growth of Shopify’s stores (e.g. Baird boosts SHOP target on merchant growth). I am personally very uncomfortable with this assumption and believe that eventually, the number of Shopify stores will start declining. The number of Shopify stores is over 800,000 stores, the vast majority of them are drop shipping stores that are aggressively competing with each other in addition to competing with the giant e-commerce companies. Despite the assertions of Shopify’s CEO Tobi Lutke about drop shipping (which coincidentally contradicts the assertions of his COO and CFO about fulfillment and warehousing), I personally believe that the drop shipping business is a doomed business and that eventually the number of Shopify stores will start to decline. There are simply not enough products in the world to support 800,000 stores, the vast majority of which are operating in a drop shipping model. In addition, the whole e-commerce business is expected to be dominated by a few giant competitors. I tried to explain this point in details in my earlier 2 articles that I published about a year ago: “Shopify: Will It Be A Winner Or A Loser Because Of E-Commerce Growth?” and “Shopify's 600,000 Online Merchants: Too Many For Our Planet”.Tobi Lutke’s response to a question related to his opinion about drop shipping during the February 2018 conference call. Source: Seeking Alpha Transcripts(3) Shopify will maintain its multi-channel listing lead in the e-commerce marketCurrently Shopify has the ability to list the merchandise of its merchants in different venues like Amazon, Walmart, Etsy and the like. In addition, Shopify allows its clients to place their advertisements in different places like Facebook, Google, Instagram and the likes. While some people argue that BigCommerce has better multi-channel capabilities, I personally believe that Shopify has a distinct leading advantage in this area. The multi-channel capabilities for Shopify makes its product sticky; that is, it would be difficult for customers to switch from Shopify to another customer. However, the Shopify business is built on replenishing its very high percentage of departing clients with new clients, and the stickiness cannot apply to new clients. I have done some calculations and found that Shopify’s churn rate is over 50%, and I invite you to download the spreadsheet and play with the assumptions to come up with your own estimate of Shopify’s churn rate.(4) Shopify will reduce the cost of customer acquisitionCurrently the vast majority of the cost of customer acquisition is the money that is paid to Shopify partners (approximately, $800M annually as per the DIGIDAY article). The $800M are paid (usually in perpetuity) to partners who refer clients, who write blogs about Shopify, who provide training programs, and practically, anyone who promotes Shopify to its customers and investors. Some people may even take this partnership program as an outsourcing of the sales and marketing functions for the company. Shopify can easily drop this amount quite significantly (their partner program agreement allows them to do that); the challenge would be that without the partner network, the rate of loss of clients would exceed the rate of acquisition of new clients and this can be devastating for the Shopify stock price and its growth story.(5) The Shopify fulfillment business will be self-fundingWhen Shopify announced its last financial statements, management indicated that they are starting a fulfillment line of business to service the needs of its clients. The company management later indicated that the fulfillment program will be self-funding. Despite an expert assessment of the massive capital requirements for fulfillment systems, most analysts take the management assessments at face value and take this fulfillment “no additional capital” assumption into consideration when conducting their valuations.(6) Shopify will generate billions of dollars in fulfillment revenueSome analysts are assuming that Shopify fulfillment business will contribute $6B in six years to Shopify’s total revenue (e.g. Shopify +1.5% on Street-high target). Given that the total revenue of Shopify now is $1.1B, and assuming a 35% growth in annual revenue, the total Shopify revenue would be $6B in six years. This means that these analysts are assuming that Shopify’s fulfillment revenue will be equal to the all the other revenue from Shopify within six years. While possible, the likelihood of this happening is very remote because the vast majority of Shopify customers are drop shippers who do not need fulfillment, but then again, miracles do happen.(7) The profit margin for Shopify’s fulfillment business will be 30%Shopify management indicated various times that the profit margin for the fulfillment business will be 30%. The average successful fulfillment business margin in general is 3%. Despite this order of magnitude discrepancy, some analysts take the 30% margin into consideration when coming up with the Shopify valuations. This SA article casts some doubts on Shopify’s fulfillment expansion plans: Shopify's Expansion Plan Is Questionable, and presents the reasons for its doubts in a professional and comprehensive manner.(8) No new competition will enter into this market and existing competition will not changeCurrently, Shopify is leading the e-commerce third-party provider market together with WooCommerce and Magento. Analysts are assuming that most of the growth of the e-commerce market will be going to Shopify and that new Shopify clients will continue flocking to them from the other competitors in big numbers.Market Ahare of Top e-commerce providers. Source: Coudways(9) The Shopify Capital business will continue growingShopify Capital may arguably be considered the most profitable business line of Shopify. Through Shopify Capital, the merchants securitize their receivables by giving away 10% of the future receivables. Given that the inventory turnover for retailers on average is over 13 times annually, then we are talking about an annualized return interest rate of over 130% on these loans. Please note that the turnover for e-commerce companies is usually much higher than 13 times annually because of the relatively smaller need to carry inventory. This means that the interest rates that Shopify charges for their loans is arguably higher than 130% annually. This is not much different from pay-day loan companies and/or loan sharks. Analysts are expecting this business to continue growing.(10) The Shopify subscription revenue will not drop and will increaseAnalysts are expecting that the growth rate of the subscription solutions fees that Shopify receives will continue at its current rate of 35%. This is happening despite the declining trend as shown in the next chart. The margin on the subscription services is significantly higher than that of the merchant solutions, and a high growth in this area may result in abnormally high valuations.Source: The Street(11) The drop shipping business will continue to thriveShopify’s vast majority of clients are drop shippers, and as a result, the growth of drop shipping is integral to the growth of Shopify. Many analysts are assuming that drop shipping is here to stay and its growth will not abate. This is despite the fact that interest in drop shipping has been constant, and even declining over the past 2 years as shown in the following 5-year chart.Source: Google Trends(12) Customers will switch into buying from small stores through impulsive ads rather than from large e-commerce companiesSupported by assertions from Shopify management, analysts have been assuming that the e-commerce market will transform into buying mostly from smaller e-commerce firms instead of larger e-commerce companies. Such a transformation would be very beneficial for Shopify as, according to Shopify’s COO, its focus is on smaller companies.This article asserts that the assumptions made by the analysts are questionable, and as a result, their price targets of an average of CAD$476 (US$360) and an average rating of 3.68 as shown in the graph below cannot be justified. The readers need to make an assessment of whether these assumptions are justifiable or not according to their own analysis. Based on this assessment, they can determine whether they should invest in Shopify based on the price targets of these analysts or not.Source: Analyst Sell Side Rating, Seeking AlphaBased on my experience, once the stock price misses any of the analyst estimates, analysts will start publishing new reports that have lower price targets and the stock price would start its decline. As of today, I am not familiar with any company that has never missed analyst estimates, and the decline in Shopify will start aggressively when this happens. When Shopify will miss analyst estimates is practically anybody’s guess.I tried to come up with the most justifiable optimistic assumptions related to Shopify and created a simplified spreadsheet to come up with what the valuation of the company should be. The calculations that I have performed are based on the discounted net income for the company. I started by looking at the discounted cash flow, but it resulted in an abnormally low valuation, so I decided to use the discounted net income instead. So, here are the assumptions that I made:The above assumptions give rise to the following chart that shows how the revenues will be growing above the expenses to reach a net income of $4B in 10 years.Source: Compiled by the authorAs per the attached spreadsheet, the above assumptions result in a valuation of approximately CAD$14B (versus the current CAD$50B+ as of the time of writing this article). I invite readers to download the spreadsheet, and play with the parameters in it to come up with a valuation that makes sense to them.According to the Smart Market Data article of 2014, there are 8 key characteristics of a bubble. This section will look at each of the 8 characteristics and assess whether it applies to Shopify or not.(1) This-time-is-different mentality: Many Shopify long investors are indicating that Shopify is different from all the other competitors and that they have a management team that will always perform to perfection and is not subject to making any mistakes. When comparing Shopify to other companies that experienced the same growth rate as Shopify and eventually collapsed (e.g. Nortel and Blackberry at the end of the last century), these investors indicate literally that “this time is different”.(2) Financial risk has been underwritten by the authorities: Because of the relationship that Shopify’s CEO has with the Canadian political circles (for example, Tobi Lutke is currently considered one of Justin Trudeau’s technology advisors and Trudeau spoke at the annual Shopify conference (UNITE) of 2018), long investors of Shopify do not expect any actions from the Canadian government that may negatively impact the operations of Shopify. In addition, Shopify’s head office is in Ottawa, the centre of the political arena in Canada which would put it in an ideal position for lobbying government officials and bureaucrats.(3) Easy money: Almost every investor of Shopify has been raving about how easy it was for them to double and triple their investments by just buying the shares and holding them, possibly without performing any analysis. The same thing happened very recently with Bitcoin. I am not claiming that Shopify is comparable to Bitcoin from a business perspective, but it can certainly be construed as comparable from this specific bubble perspective.(4) Overblown growth stories: Just read through the comments about any news item or article about Shopify in Seeking Alpha and you will find a committed fan club for the stock and claiming that it would be worth as much as the overall e-commerce economy in the world. In addition, most of the Shopify analysts are valuing the stock based on very optimistic assumptions that are positioning the company to be managed to perfection.(5) No valuation anchor: This is a typical characteristic of all bubbles which are marked by the absence of any valuation anchor; when there’s no income to tether the speculator’s imagination, asset prices can become unbounded. This started with the Dutch Tulip Bulb bubble, and we recently experienced it with the dot-com bubble and the Bitcoin bubble. Shopify is the poster child of the absence of a valuation anchor; it has no income, and its business model (that depends on paying huge referral fees, over 50% of its revenue, to its partner network, primarily to replenish its lost clients), does not predict any significant income appearing any time soon.(6) Conspicuous consumption: With Shopify, the conspicuous consumption shows with partners who pride themselves of how fast they were able to get rich and the “fancy cars” that they bought. To verify that, just type “Shopify Millionaire” on YouTube, and you will see that about 50% of the top results are showing people with fancy sports cars priding themselves of how they got rich fast with minimum effort, and soliciting to sell the viewers the programs that they created for getting rich.(7) Ponzi finance: Shopify is not really a Ponzi scheme, but it is a very clear implementation of affiliate marketing. The company spends $800M (over 50% of its expenses) annually on their affiliates, and this is one of the reasons why it is experiencing a large growth in the stock price while having no income. While affiliate marketing is not illegal like Ponzi schemes, unless there is a clear path to reduce the dependency on affiliates, it would tend to collapse like Ponzi schemes when the number of customers starts drying up. At this stage, I was not able to find any references related to what Shopify is doing associated to reducing its dependency on affiliates.(8) Irrational exuberance: this is the phrase used by the then-Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, in a speech given at the American Enterprise Institute during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. At that time, there was absolutely no justification for the price targets that analysts were coming up with, and the dot-com stock prices eventually collapsed. This term was also used during the 2008 housing bubble and later when Bitcoin reached $20,000. I am now reading and watching some commentators mentioning this same term again for the Shopify stock, and I would like to join my voice with them: There is absolutely no justification for the Shopify stock to have the level of capitalization that it currently has and the stock price growth is the result of irrational exuberance. Just to put it in perspective, Shopify has almost the same capitalization as Ford Motor Company (F), while Ford’s dividend distribution (yes, dividend) is twice Shopify’s total revenue (yes, revenue). If this is not irrational exuberance, what would it be then?Based on the above analysis, it seems that Shopify fulfills all the characteristics of a bubble, without exception. Why people are still investing in it can only be explained with two things: (1) Greed and (2) the Greater Fool Theory.Dr. Jean Paul Rodrigue explained the stages of the bubble very clearly in the following chart:Source: Dr. Jean Paul Rodrigue, Stages in a BubbleMany analysts consider that the “Bear trap” happened when Andrew Left came up with his first article on Shopify in 2017. At that time, many people (including myself) shorted the stock, and fell into this trap. Now that we have determined that Shopify is a bubble, the challenge now is to determine which stage of the bubble Shopify is in; this is something that the readers have to come up with on their own.The above research shows that Shopify is a bubble and that its stock price is bound to drop significantly. Based on the current market price and based on the valuation conducted in this article, the stock price is expected to drop to about 25% of its current market price. The valuation provided in this article is available through a spreadsheet, and I am encouraging readers to download it and play with its assumptions to come up with a valuation they are comfortable with. My assumptions, which are based on very optimistic estimates, indicate that the valuation of Shopify should not exceed CAD$14B.Compared to other companies, Shopify is extremely expensive, and companies within its same league have a net income that is comparable to the total revenue of Shopify, and have a dollar growth in revenue higher than the total revenue of Shopify.Looking at the typical characteristics of a bubble, Shopify seems to fulfill every one of them, without exception. We seem to be currently at the later stages of the Mania Phase or have already entered into the Blow off Phase; The article does not expect us to have experienced the bull trap yet. I am personally expecting that the “Blow off Phase” will start accelerating once Shopify misses analyst estimates in any of its quarters. When this will happen is anybody’s guess."
4291121,69905,2019-09-12T04:43:19-04:00,Shopify has tremendous growth rates.Awesome company? Yes. But everyone already knows that.No margin of safety in this stock.,"Shopify (SHOP) has been one of the best stocks to own in the past several years. It has come out of nowhere and smashed every benchmark. But that's now in the past. What matters to today's investors, is what happens going forward?In a balanced article, I note the many positives with Shopify, as well as, the one problem for investors: valuations ultimately matter.The message coming out of Shopify in Q2 2019 was an echo of what investors have become familiar with -- Shopify continues to put merchants first.Shopify's focus on offering the right tools to small and medium-sized merchants continues to allow it to solidify its competitive position.In fact, what truly makes Shopify stand out is the careful symmetry between its application program interface's (""API"") ease of use on the one hand, while on the other hand, the API not fundamentally lacking in capability.What's more, Shopify's pain free onboarding allows new merchants to seek out Shopify in the first instance, and then, later on, Shopify has all the necessary functionalities to allow merchants on its platform to scale. Accordingly, Shopify's strongest value proposition can be seen on its low churn rates.Moreover, while many other platforms, such as Adobe's (ADBE) Magento is highly complex and requires substantial investment from merchants, in terms of back-office setup, Shopify has opted for convenience and speed, but all the while allowing merchants to put their own customer's experience at the forefront of operations.To this effect, the graph below speaks for itself.Source: author's calculationsWe can see just how stable Shopify's growth rates continue to be. Not many companies the size of Shopify are able to sustainably grow their revenues above 25%, much less continuously pointing above 40% growth rates.So far, so good, but what fundamentally surprised the market of late and has the sell-side gushing was the uptick in Shopify's merchant solutions, see below.Source: author's calculationsAs we can see, Shopify's merchant solutions segment appears to have reignited its revenue growth. Incidentally, it's worth noting that merchant solutions' gross margins are simply stellar -- slightly above 61%.The thing with investing is that it is not all that difficult to find companies with strong revenue growth rates. Also, it's not even that challenging to hypothesize which companies are expected to continue to grow into the medium-term and long-term future.Source: author's calculationsMore to the point, investing is less about identifying great companies, but more about identifying companies which investors are not accurately pricing in. To look at the above table and seriously contend that investors are not pricing in Shopify above and beyond expectations is nonsensical.Shopify is presently valued at close to $40 billion market cap and thus far, aside from revenue growth, it has little else to show for itself. For example, we can see that the more Shopify's top-line grows, its bottom-line rather benefiting from top-line leverage, is actually increasing its losses.I'm not disregarding that Shopify has accomplished an amazing feat in growing its top line with a CAGR growth north of 60% for several years now. There is no question that its platform has a significant amount of value. The fundamental question which needs to be answered is whether new shareholders are likely to see any upside potential from here.It's certainly possible that Shopify continues to see its valuation getting increasingly expensive.In fact, for so long has Shopify's stock been growing, with the past twelve months alone seeing the stock soar by more than 130%, that nobody appears to be asking the difficult questions. What happens to an overvalued stock, when it has a bad quarter?Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4291195,38961,2019-09-12T12:04:48-04:00,Shopify has built a business model around helping people start online businesses.The Great Recession kind of saved Shopify because merchants had to switch to them from more expensive systems.Overall revenue from older cohorts has been increasing.Shopify provides merchants with tools to easily manage their business.,"My thesis is that Shopify (SHOP) is under-monetized with a flywheel in full gear such that future economics will be extremely different from what we see today.Looking at the competitive landscape, BigCommerce isn't yet public. WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin and it requires some do-it-yourself work on the front end along with integrations on the back end. Demandware was acquired by Salesforce (CRM) in 2016. Magento was acquired by Adobe (ADBE) in 2018 and CEO Tobi Lütke answered a question about them in the 2Q18 earnings call. Among other things, he doesn't think Magento is adequate for the modern internet:I make comparisons to eBay (EBAY) and Amazon third-party marketplace (3P) (AMZN) but the reality is there is no pure play public competitor identical to Shopify. Amazon 3P and eBay are marketplace channels whereas Shopify is a single back-office system for multiple channels like eBay, Amazon 3P, Instagram and others. In the Shopify 4Q17 earnings call it was revealed that about 60% of their merchants use more than one channel to sell. Amazon 3P and eBay are apples and oranges with respect to Shopify in many respects but it is interesting to compare their gross merchandise volume (GMV).The 2018 annual report says Shopify has more than 4,000 employees/contractors.In March or 2018, VP of Production Engineering Dale Neufeld made a post about Shopify transitioning to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(GOOGL) Cloud.An important development discussed in the 2Q19 earnings call is the Shopify Fulfillment Network. Approximately $1 billion will be invested in it over the next five years. And on September 9th Shopify announced that they are acquiring warehouse fulfillment solution provider 6 River Systems for $450 million.One should be familiar with the Shopify flywheel before I explain my thoughts on churn. CFO Amy Shapero explains the flywheel at the June 2019 Investor Day saying that when less successful merchants leave, they often take little or no GMV:Here is a visual of the flywheel:Image Source: CFO Amy Shapero from the June 2019 Investor Day SlidesThe first flywheel objective above about keeping a wide funnel is crucial. Parts of the Wall Street churn discussions can be minutiae with respect to the big picture. Churn isn't zero so the number of merchants in past cohorts declines over time but the overall revenue from older cohorts has been increasing:Image Source: CFO Amy Shapero from the June 2019 Investor Day SlidesMerchant accounts tied to unsuccessful experiments fail to survive but many of the remaining merchant accounts get massively stronger over time. At the November 2017 Credit Suisse Conference, former CFO Russ Jones says they don't focus on unit churn and he ostensibly points out that the best way to improve churn is to stop adding people to the platform. Obviously this would be a terrible business decision and it goes directly against the first flywheel objective of keeping a wide funnel. Former CFO Jones reveals the monthly billing retention number is a more important metric than churn and that it is over 100%. This means that as merchants leave, the remaining cohort more than offsets those losses.Ronald Bookbinder from IFS Securities asks about churn in the 2Q18 earnings call. He states that the market may be concerned about churn and the possibility of Shopify running out of merchants. But Bookbinder notes that entrepreneurs experiment frequently such that they can have multiple websites/accounts as they tinker. He asks what the average number of websites is for each entrepreneur on the platform. CEO Lütke gives a telling answer saying that pivots and changes are part of the entrepreneurial process:It is significant that database architecture can affect the unit churn definition such that some discussions are a matter of semantics. Under the old architecture a merchant may have ten accounts and delete nine of them. Under new architecture a merchant may have one account the entire time with ten stores at one time and one store at other times. The number of experiments that are canceled and the number of ""duplicate"" account cancellations don't tell us much. The key number number that matters is the revenue by cohort shown in the above chart.The economy has been doing fine since the Great Recession of 2008 and early 2009. We'll face more recessions in the decades ahead and I like to look back on this last one to think about the ways companies operate under different conditions. For example, CarMax (KMX) reduced capex in 2010 following the Great Recession such that we have insights as to what their maintenance/replacement capex looks like when they aren't investing in growth. Shopify wasn't public around the time of the Great Recession but we can still learn about the way it shaped their history.CEO Lütke talks about migrations in the March 2019 Tim Ferriss podcast. He reveals that around the time of the financial crisis in 2008 or 2009 they had people converting from systems that were around nine hundred thousand dollars a year to the Shopify plan of just $59 per month! 90 minutes into the April 2019 podcast with Shane Parrish, CEO Lütke explains that the Great Recession sort of saved Shopify. He explains that the software was good enough at that point for merchants to replace really expensive e-commerce systems with the cheaper but better Shopify solution. In some respects Shopify is antifragile. GMV will likely decline during the next recession for a year or two but they should add a large number of merchants without additional customer acquisition costs (CACs) whose lifetime values (LTVs) will be substantial.A March 2019 Forbes article talks about the way Kylie Cosmetics uses social media platforms like Instagram powered by Facebook (FB) for marketing along with Shopify for sales and fulfillment. 2018 revenue for Kylie Cosmetics was an estimated $360 million!In the 2018 Code Commerce interview, CEO Lütke says that Facebook and Instagram channels are large drivers of purchasing traffic. He acknowledges that there are some bad Instagram brands but he enthusiastically points out that some of them will be the new Nikes in 20 years. Shopify has removed the intimidating learning curve that was previously required for starting a business:Gross merchandise volume is now massive and the yearly growth rate has been slowly declining every year since 2014 as the base increases. In 2014 the GMV y/y growth rate was 133% and by 2018 it was ""only"" 56%:Image Source: Shopify 2018 Year in ReviewWe can see quarterly GMV is now in the big leagues with eBay and estimates for Amazon 3P:Image Source: Quarterly results filings from Shopify, eBay and Amazon*The Amazon 2018 annual report disclosed that 3P GMV for the year was $160 billion but on a quarterly level we make rough estimates based on a multiple of 3P sales.There is a small amount of overlap with the GMV above. In the 4Q16 earnings call, Shopify said they didn't count Amazon marketplace GMV in their total at first. Per Investor Relations, Shopify began including GMV from Amazon marketplace in the GMV they report in the second half of 2017. I'm guessing eBay GMV is included in the Shopify GMV figure as well.Shopify has grown quarterly GMV from $5.8 billion to $13.8 billion in just 2 years while the quarterly GMV for eBay has hovered near $23 billion. If we conducted a facile analysis and looked at things through the GMV lens alone then maybe there wouldn't be much outcry about the fact that Shopify has higher market cap and enterprise values than eBay. Of course we have to look at more than just GMV but the growth here on the part of Shopify has been impressive and their flywheel remains strong such that GMV growth should continue for the foreseeable future.Shopify shows some global e-commerce statistics that are eye opening:Image Source: Shopify global e-commerce statisticsI haven't been able to find Shopify GMV by geography but the 2018 annual report does show revenue by geography (in thousands $):Image Source: Shopify 2018 annual reportWe see that four English speaking countries account for 88% of the 2018 revenue. One would think there is an opportunity to expand GMV and revenue in places like Japan and Germany seeing as the 4Q18 earnings release says they have launched Shopify Payments in those countries.In the 4Q17 earnings call, CEO Lütke says that the combination of Advanced Marchants and Shopify Plus merchants accounts for over 50% of the GMV. I haven't found a chart that explicitly breaks GMV down with Advanced Merchants but they are probably most of the Plus Upgrade group and a substantial part of the Core group. Shopify does have a chart showing GMV by Core, Plus Upgrade and Plus New Business:Image Source: CFO Amy Shapero from the 2019 Investor Day SlidesThe 2018 annual report says there are only about 5,300 Plus merchants which makes their large contribution above impressive.Looking at the Booking Holdings (BKNG) 10-K along with the Expedia (EXPE) 10-K, we see that more than GMV is needed in order to value a company. Concentrating on the fragmented European market with the agency model, Booking Holdings had 2018 gross bookings of $92.7 billion and top line revenue of $14.5 billion for a 15.6% take rate. Adjusted free cash flow (FCF) was $4.6 billion. Meanwhile, Expedia had gross bookings of $99.7 billion and top line revenue of $11.2 billion for a take rate of 11.2%. Adjusted FCF was $0.9 billion. Booking Holdings was able to monetize GMV better with a higher take rate to the top line and they have higher FCF margins on top line revenue. Their take rate was 15.6% vs 11.2% and their adjusted FCF margin was 32% vs just 8%. Considering other factors apart from GMV, we begin to see why the market cap of Booking Holdings is over four times higher than the market cap of Expedia despite the fact that Expedia has higher GMV (note that adjusted FCF treats stock based compensation like cash and deducts it from net cash provided by operating activities).Revenue by stream is shown at the June 2019 Investor Day:Image Source: CFO Amy Shapero from the June 2019 Investor Day SlidesThe two revenue buckets above are subscription solutions and merchant solutions.Starting from the bottom of the chart, the subscription solutions bucket is made up of subscriptions in red and apps/themes/domains/platform fees in orange. The plans for subscriptions in red are shown on the Shopify pricing page where we have monthly plans including Basic Shopify for $29, Shopify for $79 and Advanced Shopify for $299. Things get more complicated with the Shopify Plus plan that starts with a monthly fee of $2,000 per month. This $2,000 goes in the red subscriptions stream above. The 2Q19 earnings call reveals that the fixed $2,000 component of Shopify Plus has ranged from 23% to 26% of MRR (the red subscription stream above) over the last year.Shopify Plus also has a monthly variable component which is 25 basis points of GMV up to $40,000 per month. This variable component is also referred to as platform fees and it is in the orange revenue stream above which is still inside the subscription solutions bucket but outside of the red MRR/subscriptions area. A January 2019 Magento 2 Commerce vs Shopify Plus analysis implies that Shopify Plus is under-monetized. It shows that the three year cost of ownership for Magento can be over two times more expensive than the Shopify Plus cost.The merchant solutions bucket is made up of financial services in green, shipping in dark green and transaction/partner referral/other in yellow. Shopify principally generates financial services revenues via payment processing fees from Shopify Payments. Looking at the 2018 annual report, Shopify Payments revenue grew by $176 million or 64.4% from 2017. Doing a little algebra, that means Shopify Payments revenue was about $273 million in 2017 and $449 in 2018. Merchant solutions revenues were $363 million in 2017 and $608 million in 2018 so Shopify Payments makes up about 3/4ths of merchant solutions revenue.Merchants are highly incentivized to use Shopify Payments, it is required for options like Fraud Protect and Shopify Capital. There is a fee of 15 basis points for merchants who do not use Shopify Payments. Like Shopify Payments, this fee of 15 basis points is part of merchant solutions revenue. The 2Q19 financial statements show that quarterly Shopify Payments penetration was 42% or $5.8 billion GMV out of $13.8 billion total quarterly GMV. Merchants using Shopify Payments often have a smoother experience than if they were to outsource this process. And Shopify has economies of scale when it comes to negotiating on behalf of their Shopify Payments merchants. This space should continue to evolve, in the 3Q18 earnings call COO Harley Finkelstein said it is estimated that by 2021 most online transactions won't use a credit card.Regarding the timing of these revenue streams, the 4Q18 earnings call reveals that they launched Shopify Plus in 2014, Shopify Shipping in 2015 and Shopify Capital in 2016. A smooth merchant experience, economies of scale and product integration are key factors that have made Shopify Payments and Shopify Shipping successful.At the June 2019 Investor Day, COO Finkelstein talks about the fact that Shopify Plus can be better monetized in the future:CEO Lütke makes some points about being under-monetized at the June 2019 Investor Day:Looking at the Shopify 2Q19 financial statements and the eBay 2Q19 10-Q, we see that the 2Q19 quarterly revenue is $362 million for Shopify and $2,687 million for eBay. Obviously this is a huge difference but Shopify GMV is growing rapidly and over time they should increase the percentage of revenue relative to GMV.We have to talk about the disparate types of top line revenue before we work our way down to the bottom line. The subscription solutions revenue bucket has high gross profit margins. Some parts of the merchant solutions revenue bucket have high gross profit margins and others do not. Specifically, the Shopify Payments revenue does not have high gross profit margins, especially in North America where interchange fees are high (Stripe gets the headlines but the bulk of the cost is interchange). Shopify is the merchant acquirer with Shopify Payments so revenue is recorded on a gross basis. The Capital and Shipping revenues in merchant solutions are recorded on a net revenue basis so they have high gross profit margins.The 2Q19 financial statements explain that despite Shopify Payments not having great gross margins (especially in North America), this revenue requires little in the way of sales and marketing or research and development:At the June 2019 Investor Day, CEO Lütke brings up the point that the incremental cost of adding a new merchant is practically zero:In the 2Q17 earnings call, Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays notes that gross profit is around 1.5% of GMV and he asks if it will increase given the value proposition to large merchants with cloud infrastructure and payment processing. He also asks about the percentage of Plus merchants on Shopify Payments. Former CFO Jones doesn't give an exact percentage for the second question but he notes that merchants including Shopify Plus merchants sometimes move to Shopify Payments in order to be eligible for Shopify Capital. As for the first question, he says there are good opportunities ahead. CEO Lütke comes back to the flywheel in his response:The question above was about gross profit so it hadn't even explored what happens further down on the way to the bottom line. But the answer tells us that massive growth investments are being made inside income statement expense lines such that net earnings are much lower than they would be if growth was absent. In this sense Shopify has similarities to Amazon.We see amazing growth in the quarterly income statements:Image Source: Shopify 2018 annual reportGross profit grew from $100 million in 3Q17 to $205 million in 2Q19. Meanwhile, sales and marketing expenses grew from $58 million to $119 million. At this point in time I think gross profit is more instructive than net loss. The CAC spend in sales and marketing will be a smaller percentage of revenue in the future when the company is no longer in rapid growth mode. As such, the bottom line economics will be completely different.The qualitative considerations of having Lütke as CEO are enormous.In a perfect world we'd know what the per-share economics will look like in five or ten years and then discount that back to today. In the real world there are many things that are unknowable. Shopify is a wonderful company but there are many unknowns on the valuation side.This is what I get for enterprise value:$40,400 million market cap [1]$109 million lease liabilities$6 million current lease liabilities$(669) million cash$(1,344) million marketable securities------------------$38,502 million[1] The 2Q19 financial statements show that as of July 26, 2019 there were 100,335,518 Class A shares along with 12,231,344 Class B for 112.6 million total. Multiplying this by the September 9th share price of $358.67 gives us a total of $40.4 billion.The Shopify flywheel has been a wonder the last five years and it should continue to bear fruit in the years ahead. Shopify is clearly a wonderful company but it isn't easy to answer the question as to whether or not the price is fair. The actionable information here is to study Shopify deeply even though it appears to be expensive based on standard metrics like price to sales.At the time of this writing Shopify is just a library card ""position"" for me consisting of one share. They are an amazing company led by a special CEO but it is difficult to know what the per-share economics will look like five or ten years from now."

In Denmark, Shopify Payments will support Visa Dankort's debit payments. Shopify Payments is now available in 13 countries. Shopify Admin is available in 18 languages with the launch of native language capabilities in 11 more languages including Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Hindi, Malay, Norwegian, Swedish, Korean and Thai.Shopify is also launching a next generation Shopify POS software, which is faster, more intuitive, and more scalable. Shopify launched a new integration for Shopify Ping with Apple Business Chat as a new way for merchants to talk to, support, and create a personal connection with customers, increasing trust and conversion to sales.Last quarter, Shopify announced that it is planning to invest $1 billion to set up a network of fulfillment centers in the US. Shopify Fulfillment Network is now available for early access. The fulfillment service will utilize machine learning to ensure timely deliveries and lower shipping costs, putting their brand and customer experience front and center. I think it is just following a very capital-intensive strategy to meet an unrealistic objective of scaling to the level of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Another focus area for Shopify has been its Shopify Plus platform that is meant for larger sellers. During the second quarter, Shopify Plus grew 53% to $12.4 million, accounting for 26% of the total MRR. The company is revamping it to meet the needs of businesses with multiple locations in multiple countries selling merchandise in multiple currencies. Client list for Shopify Plus includes names like Sony, Dolby, and Heineken as well as celebrity-driven brands like Katy Perry Collection and Kylie's Skin.Earlier in May this year, Shopify acquired New York-based Handshake, a B2B e-commerce platform founded in 2011. Its team is now functioning as part of Shopify Plus. The terms of the deal were not disclosed but its value is estimated to be less than $100 million.

Seeking Alpha contributors, who tend to be value-focused are lukewarm (""Neutral"") on it, in aggregate, but Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating is ""Very Bullish"" on it.Screen capture via Seeking Alpha.The screen capture above explains why: value is only one of five components considered by the Quant Rating, and it's the one where SHOP gets the lowest grade. In contrast, it gets the best possible grade, an A+, on the momentum component, which makes sense when you consider the stock has more than doubled over the last six months.Data by YChartsIn the event Shopify shares suffer a steep decline over the next several months, let's look at ways you can stay long while limiting your downside risk.Up to recently when I've posted hedges for securities, I've used expiration dates approximately six months out. That's been my system's default for years, partly out of convenience for investors and partly for the reason Riskalyze CEO Aaron Klein explained here: Investors seem to be better able to conceptualize risk over six-month periods than longer ones. That's still our default, but we've added a new feature that lets users select their own expiration dates.This raises an interesting question: What's the cheaper way to hedge if you adjust for the different times to expiration? To enable an apples-to-apples comparison, I've highlighted the annualized cost of each SHOP hedge below, two of which expire in November and two of which expire in February. Each of these hedges is designed for an investor unwilling to risk a decline of more than 20% in his SHOP shares.Uncapped Upside, Expires in NovemberThese were the optimal, or least expensive, puts, as of Friday's close, to hedge 200 shares of SHOP against a >20% decline by mid-November of this year.The cost here was $3,460 or 4.68% of position value (the cost of the puts in all of these examples was calculated conservatively, using the ask price - in practice, you can often buy puts at some price between the bid and ask). That works out to 17.97% of position value annualized.Uncapped Upside, Expires in FebruaryThis hedge uses the same parameters as above, except the expiration date is in February of 2020.The annualized cost is lower here, as you can see: 16.51% of position value.Capped Upside, Expires In NovemberThis was the optimal, or least expensive, collar to hedge 200 shares of SHOP against a >20% decline by mid-November if you were willing to cap your possible upside at 20% by then. The income generated from the short calls for this collar and the next one was calculated conservatively, assuming you sold them at the bid.Here, you would have had a net cost of $120 when opening the hedge, which worked out to a cost of 0.16% of position value or 0.62% of position value annualized.Uncapped Upside, Expires in FebruaryThis optimal collar uses the same parameters as the one above, except it expires in February of 2020.Here, you would have collected a net credit of $860 when opening the hedge, which worked out to a cost of -1.16% of position value or -2.2% of position value annualized.For readers wondering why I have given SHOP a ""bullish"" rating here, I have done so because in addition to passing my site's two preliminary screens on Friday, the site's potential return estimate for it was higher than that for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Of the 1,680 securities that passed both of our initial screens on Friday, SHOP ranked #107 out of them in terms of the site's potential return estimate for it over the next six months, as you can see below.Screen capture via Portfolio Armor's admin panel.In the event my site's bullish take on SHOP is wrong, one of the hedges above may prove helpful."
4281627,105186,2019-08-05T10:20:54-04:00,"Shopify offers an intriguing proposition to merchants as opposed to Amazon, primarily the enabling of brand identity; but challenges persist.My DCF indicates shares are worth $191.85, indicating 43% downside, yet I'm hesitant to call shares overvalued.Shopify's vision, strong management, and superior financials make for a plausible scenario in which huge gains lie ahead.Those buying shares at these levels must be acutely aware that 90%+ drawdowns are possible, yet should the vision come through, Amazon like rewards are possible. I remain neutral.","Investors can't seem to get enough of e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP), which is defying gravity with a $37 billion market cap. The company is losing money and trades at 33x sales. While there is no chance I will be buying shares here, don't call it a bubble. Shopify has created a unique platform that tailors to the needs of small e-commerce merchants. Shopify has given small businesses the opportunity to compete in the digital world. While Amazon (AMZN) has been terrorizing smaller retailers with one day shipping on a huge selection of merchandise, Shopify is attempting to give the smaller players a fighting chance. This strategy was made clear when Shopify began adding fulfillment and distribution. While this makes the Shopify ecosystem more complete, it comes with enormous costs. Shopify isn't turning a profit with its asset-light tech business, adding the cost of physical warehousing and distribution will weigh on the bottom line. This speaks to how early we are in the Shopify story. While the market is optimistic, we must not fall victim to euphoria, and realize this could still go horribly wrong. Transportation and logistics is a slugfest, Shopify could be biting off more than it can chew. But, this big vision is what has made shareholders very happy so far. The Shopify story can draw parallels to Amazon. The company's small-business centric model is more attractive to merchants than being a minuscule part of the Amazon ecosystem. There are also drawdowns as the small retailers will be forced to advertise and drive traffic to their stores, a challenge Amazon partners do not face.These big ideas have not been backed up by big cash flows yet. A changing Shopify narrative would be disastrous for shareholders. But, should the story stay intact, Shopify investors will see further gains ahead.No one knows what the future holds, particularly with a high growth company like Shopify. We can do are best to project future cash flows, but Shopify's story could change tomorrow. This could cause a waterfall-like capitulation because the valuation is illogical based on current measures. The valuation is currently narrative driven.Source: Estimize.comThere's no way around the valuation. The stock is very expensive and aggressively priced. Wall Street's nonsensical forecasts do little to add clarity to the picture. Analysts expect a huge slowdown from 48% y/y growth down to 38% next quarter. Yet, price targets are north of $350 for the most part. This is contradictory, and should this type of slowdown take place, investors will feel the pain next time the company reports. It is no surprise Shopify has beaten on revenue and EPS 100% of the time the past two years. The bar is incredibly low.The most important observation I take away from the chart above is the steadily declining revenue growth. While I don't believe that growth is subject to perpetual deceleration, attempting to modestly forecast what will happen requires inclusion of such. This is the most important element of my discounted cash flow below. With technology companies I generally equate net income to cash flow as depreciation and CapEx expenses generally don't have a huge effect.Source: AuthorOn average, growth has been decelerating by about 3 percentage points per quarter. In adjusting for the potential that this trend does not continue, I choose to model revenue in decline by about 4% per year over the next decade. I modeled faster deceleration of both S&M and G&A expenses in the beginning of the forecast as the company gains scale. I did the opposite for R&D expenses as the business should be able to cut this spending as the company's competitive position is bolster.With growth slowing to just 11% in the final year of the forecast, I would expect shares to only be trading at the market average of about 15x earnings. I discounted cash flows by just 5% to compensate for a low rate environment along with Shopify's strong balance sheet and low risk to potential creditors, as the company has no debts. All said and done, I reach a fair value of $19 billion, or $191.85 per share. This indicates that shares are 43% overvalued at current levels.Making sense of Shopify's valuation requires investors to think to the far distance future, a decade isn't enough time. It will be years before Shopify has any semblance of cash flows to justify the current valuation. Shopify has shades of Amazon, but sometimes looks can be deceiving. I suspect Shopify investors have an eye to Amazon's 3P revenues when valuing the company. Amazon's 3P service revenue climbed 34% in 2018 to $42.8 billion. Shopify offers a much different service to merchants than Amazon. Amazon is a marketplace where merchants have the benefit of the popularity of Amazon's platform, but the drawdowns of marketplace competition. Shopify enables these merchants to create and express their own brand as opposed to merely being a part of the Amazon machine. While its never a good idea to shout about TAM from the rooftops as apart of a quality investment thesis, the TAM is incredibly large. Amazon's marketplace is one large conflict of interest. It's discouraging for smaller competitors to compete against Amazon's in-house products. With even mattress brands creating exclusive lines for Amazon, navigating Amazon is indeed a jungle for small players.WebsiteBuilderExpert named Shopify as its top pick for best all-around e-commerce platform. When looking at the company through an opportunistic lens, we can begin to rationalize why investors are paying up for Shopify. Yet, there will be challenges catering to smaller retailers. The biggest bear thesis is Shopify's churn. Shopify makes it so easy to start a business, yet it aids little in helping that business succeed. This makes the business a risky bet over the long term. But, perhaps the bears are wrong and churn is not an issue. Amazon's 3P business is quite prosperous considering it has the same underlying principle. I believe this is the primary reason for the Shopify optimism.Source: FactSetIf you were to pull a valuation expert out from under a rock that knew nothing of Amazon, at no point over Amazon's 20 year history could you rationalize a market cap of 900 million dollars. Yet, here we sit with those early investors reaping incredible rewards. This vision is what has made Jeff Bezos the richest man in the world. While I haven't done a deep enough dive to give a confident valuation of Amazon, it appears like shares are fairly valued at worse as the profit machine starts rolling. Data by YChartsIt was June 2009 when Amazon traded for $37 billion like Shopify does now. At that time, during the height of the recession, most investors could not have dreamed what the next 10 years would entail for the e-commerce giant. While Shopify could indeed have a meltdown of epic proportions should the narrative change, the possibility in which the company does become a major player in commerce is possible.As investors, we look for insights that enable us to see the future unravel before it does. While the precursor to a great investment is a solid thesis, events are going to unfold that we have no foresight of whatsoever. To believe that Shopify is overvalued and that the market is completely wrong appears to be too simplistic, and possibly naive. But, the contrary is simplistic as well. Investing in hope doesn't work, and shares are indeed expensive. But, I think Shopify differs from stocks like Tilray (TLRY) and Beyond Meat (BYND) that have much less substance behind the optimism.While I believe my forecast is an accurate assessment of cash flows, the valuation could very well be neglecting unforeseen positive events that warrant Shopify achieving such an astronomical valuation as Amazon has. The management team under Tobi Lutke is brilliant, and the vision of this almost collective conscious of small retailers fighting back against the mighty Amazon is certainly compelling. Not to mention, Shopify is still attractive to large brands. Shopify powers websites for large brands such as Tesla (TSLA), Budweiser (BUD), Red Bull, and Kylie Cosmetics. Only true believers in the vision are buying Shopify shares at these levels. If an investor has any inclination at doing so, he or she must be willing to forget about it for a decade or two and ride the roller coaster. Amazon investors who bought at the height of the tech bubble would have seen their investment crash by over 90%. I don't think we're in the same environment today, but anything is possible.If you were to have had an iron stomach and held on after buying the top, you would have realized a 20x return, just under 20 years later. It would take a very special type of active investor could handle that type of psychological stress to see an investment go from -90% to +2,000% over a 20 year period. Yet, that will be what it takes should that scenario play out. Shopify has big potential and big risk."
4271578,104302,2019-06-21T18:05:07-04:00,"Amazon and Shopify both provide a venue for retailers to sell their products.While there is direct competition between Amazon Marketplace and Shopify for retailers, the real competition is happening between Amazon and Shopify smaller drop-shipping clients.Both Amazon and Shopify are exhibiting very similar stock price movements, but at different times (before the .com bubble burst for Amazon and now for Shopify).Amazon has the ability to resolve the retail challenges in a much better manner than smaller drop shippers who constitute the vast majority of Shopify clients.Amazon is properly valued while Shopify is very expensive.","Over the last few months, Shopify's (SHOP) stock price increased quite dramatically. This increase prompted many commentators to draw a comparison between Shopify and Amazon (AMZN). Through the comments I have been reading, I realized that there are many people who do not fully understand this relationship and how both companies are interacting with each other. In addition, I also noticed that many people did not take into consideration the severe fluctuation in Amazon's stock price (where it dropped by around 95% after the burst of the .com bubble), and whether it is valid to assume that the Shopify stock may suffer the same fate.This paper tries to demystify the relationship between both companies and shows the similarities, differences and competitive advantage of both company as it relates to the business of the other.While Amazon and Shopify are drastically different in terms of their size and breadth of services, they effectively address the same market. Amazon Marketplace competes with Shopify for the retailers, and Amazon itself (retailing business) competes with Shopify clients for product sales.Despite this serious competition, the paper shows that there are distinct differences between both organizations (Amazon versus Shopify Clients, and Amazon Marketplace versus Shopify), and that each organization has its own distinct competitive advantages that are hard for the other to overcome.The paper comes to the conclusion that Shopify has a very unique offering that Amazon Marketplace will find very hard compete with. At the same time, the paper will show that Shopify clients will have a very hard time competing with Amazon (and larger e-commerce retailers) and that this competitive disadvantage will eventually result in a decline in Shopify's number of clients, revenue and net income.In September 30, 1999, Amazon started Amazon Marketplace. According to CNN, ""Originally cast as a way for shoppers to find rare and collectible books and other specialty items, Amazon allows third-party sellers to hawk used merchandise in what it called zShops (now known as the Marketplace). That sparks a huge increase in the volume of transactions on Amazon.com. Over the first four months, a quarter of a million customers bought something using the service.""Jay Goldberg published a comprehensive article titled: ""What is Amazon Marketplace? Everything you need to know about the platform."" in which he states that ""Amazon Marketplace is an online network of third-party sellers permitted to use Amazon.com as a platform to sell their products for a percentage of the profits. It also allows sellers to resell used and new items, with a cut of the sales going to Amazon.""In 2010, Amazon started offering the capability for retailers to create their own online stores (Amazon Webstores) and they used to charge a fee of $78 per month plus sales charges between 2.1 and 2.9%. Over five years, they succeeded in getting several hundred active users on the platform, whilst other Amazon Webstore alternatives had tens of thousands of customers. This was an almost identical offering to that of Shopify.In March 2015, Amazon shut down the services with the following notice on its web site:Source: Cart2CartWhen the Amazon Webstores closed in July 2016, most of the Amazon Webstores owners moved their services to other platforms like Shopify and its competitors, and almost all of them continued selling through Amazon Marketplace.In 2017 Shopify created ""Amazon Sales Channel"" to make it easier to list Shopify's merchant products on Amazon. Through a few clicks, Shopify store owners are now able to list their products on Amazon Marketplace. Historically, Shopify store owners were able to guide the buyers back to their site to fulfill the order, thereby avoiding Amazon's fees. This is no longer available as Amazon is now disallowing store owners to direct the customers to their sites through Amazon marketplace.As shown in the following two charts, Amazon and Shopify exhibited an amazing similarity in their stock price movements from the period from October 1997 to April 1999 for Amazon (just before the .com bubble burst) against the period from November 2017 to May 2019 for Shopify (the time I started writing this report). This high correlation can either be a simple coincidence, or it can be a repeating pattern in the stock market and there is an opportunity to learn from it.Amazon stock Price from October 1997 through April 1999; Source: TD Waterhouse ChartsShopify stock Price from November 2017 through May 2019; Source: TD Waterhouse ChartsAfter the burst of the [.com] bubble in 2000, Amazon's price suffered quite dramatically, and dropped about 95% within a relatively short period of time. Will the same thing potentially happen to Shopify? I do not believe so, and the next section tries to explain the differences in the rationale for the growth of the stock price of both Amazon and Shopify and why it is unlikely for the Shopify stock to drop by 95%.From the above graphs, we can see that both Amazon and Shopify experienced an amazing growth in the stock price over a period of 18 months. I personally believe that this price growth is emanating from distinctly different reasons, of course in addition to the standard stock hype from retail investors and inexperienced sell-side analysts.Why did Amazon's price increase?Amazon was not the first company to come up with an e-commerce retail solution, and many other companies had similar solutions. However, Amazon exhibited the best vision among its peers at the end of the last century and showed a clear path to what they wanted to do. Over 20 years ago, when Jeff Bezos was asked about which product Amazon would not sell, he indicated that it is probably cement, given that the cost of cement transportation renders its sale door-to-door to be non-competitive for small volumes. Up till now, Amazon only sells cement additives, decorative cement and quick setting cement as shown in this Amazon search. This demonstrates that Jeff Bezos had the vision of where the e-commerce market was going.At the same time, Amazon was growing during the .com bubble together with every other "".com"" company; At that time, any company would increase its ability to raise capital by just adding a [.com] to its name. I recollect that during that time, it was rare to hear a presentation about the Internet without hearing a mention of Amazon.In addition, Amazon maintained a steady consistent flow of positive announcements during this period including acquisitions, new services and accelerating growth of their merchandising volume compared to its competitors. The plug was pulled out of many of the Amazon services and products, but they served their purpose in hyping the price of the stock.Why is Shopify's price rising?Source: TD Waterhouse ChartsLooking at Shopify's stock price and how it compares to the TSX, you will notice that it is not as highly correlated to the overall stock market. This means that we are not experiencing an overall market hype similar to the [.com] era which contributed to Amazon's stock price increase.I think there are two reasons for the increase in the price of Shopify: First, the company is commanding a leading position in the area of providing e-commerce web stores with a fully integrated solution that has multi-channel advertising venues and an automation of the billing and delivery. Second, and more importantly, Shopify has a huge partners network that is receiving perpetual referral fees. This network is practically an extension of Shopify's marketing arm. If we take all the 20,000 Shopify partners, earning over $800,000 annually from Shopify, and some of which are virtually working full-time on recruiting potential Shopify customers, you will find that there are no other companies with this marketing strength.This partner network is the main source of replenishing the lost Shopify customers despite the large churn that can be estimated at over 50% according to this spreadsheet that is basing its calculations on the statistics from Builtwith.com; The spreadsheet shows a 76% of Shopify clients abandon their store within one year; Even with 50%, the churn rate is very high.Based on the above analysis, if history is anything to take into consideration, the Shopify stock is due for a serious correction, but I do not expect it to be as severe as the 95% drop that Amazon experienced with the burst of the .com bubble.Will Shopify follow Amazon's stock trend?Amazon stock Price from October 1997 through October 2001; Source: TD Waterhouse ChartsAs shown in the above graph, the Amazon stock price crashed from a high of $113 to $6 after the burst of the .com bubble. Some analysts expect this 95% drop to happen to Shopify, and are indicating the that history is bound to repeat itself. While I believe that the Shopify stock price will drop, I do not expect this drop to be as significant as the 95% drop we saw with Amazon. As will be shown later in the article, the drop in the Shopify stock price should not exceed 70%.The other important factor is the impetus for the decline. For Amazon, it was the burst of the .com bubble, an overall global event that caused the over-reaction from the investors. For Shopify, there are two events that may result in the start of the stock price decline:Both Amazon and smaller Shopify clients sell products directly to end customers, and they both operate in an environment that is almost a pure competition environment. The competition is also fierce among the Shopify clients in addition to the competition between the smaller Shopify clients on one hand and the larger e-commerce retailers (like Amazon and Walmart (WMT), for example). According to the following points, smaller Shopify clients, who are mostly drop-shippers, are not operating a sustainable business and have limited chances of surviving; in this analysis I will be using smaller Shopify clients and drop-shippers synonymously; these are the Shopify clients who are using ""Basic Shopify""The above factors show that smaller Shopify clients that rely on drop-shipping have virtually no hope against Amazon or any of the larger e-commerce retailers.But the story does not end here. Shopify has larger stores like Proctor & Gamble, Johnson and Johnson, most of Canada's cannabis industry players, Unilever, Louis Vuitton, Budweiser, Donald Trump, Tesla, … who are considered the flagship clients for Shopify. These are mostly manufacturers who do not have the same problems that smaller Shopify clients have. The above competitive points should not have an impact on their operations, although they will still continue to face a fierce competition from Amazon and the larger e-commerce retailers.There is another level of competition that is not associated with the end buyers. This competition is for smaller retailers (mostly manufacturers) to list their products with Amazon Marketplace (or other marketplaces) and/or to open a Shopify store. The following points explain the key competitive factors that would help customers make a decision.Based on the above points, using Amazon Marketplace is a no-brainer for most companies. The decision that needs to be made related to Amazon Marketplace is whether to use FBA or not; this depends on the volume of sales together with the level of administration that the e-retails want to undertake related to the delivery and returns. While using Amazon Marketplace, e-retailers can still establish their Shopify stores; the decision to establish a Shopify store or not depends on whether it is cost justifiable, and whether they are ready to deal directly with the end customers in terms of delivery and returns.Amazon's business is not only on the retail side, and it has many other businesses that would significantly impact its valuation. According to Wikipedia and my personal research, these businesses include:As a result, the valuation of Amazon deserves a separate paper that looks into each of these businesses almost independently, which I can undertake at a later stage in another article. Meanwhile, please review the following articles from Seeking Alpha in 2019 that address the valuation of Amazon; the list is sorted chronologically with the earlier articles at the top:Shopify, on the other hand, is a much less diversified company, and its valuation can be broken down into two key components: Subscriber Services and Merchandising Services.This section will look at each of these components separately, and provide a valuation for each depending on the on-going multiples in the market. Given that I personally expect Shopify's business to be growing at a faster rate than its competitors in certain areas of their business, I will multiply the valuation that I come up with by 2, which is an overly optimistic number.Let's first start with the subscriber services valuation. Unfortunately, Shopify does not disclose the exact numbers, so I have to rely on my best guess. I will assume that Shopify has 7,000 Plus subscribers, 30,000 Advanced Shopify subscribers, 30,000 Shopify Subscribers and the rest are low-end Basic Shopify drop-shippers. These numbers were estimated according to Shopify's last quarter financial results and conference call. Other assumptions coming in the valuation model include:Except for monthly fee, all other dollar figures are in thousandsAccording to the above calculations which are extracted from the parametrized spreadsheet, the subscriber valuation is measured at $3.80B. I encourage you to download the spreadsheet, play with the numbers to get your appropriate estimate, and post your findings in the comments below.The merchandising volume valuation is relatively simple and the only assumption is that the Gross Merchandising Volume (GMV) multiple; this emanates from the third worksheet that holds the listing of the top four e-commerce retailers whose business is based on the Gross Merchandising Volume. I excluded Amazon from this list because it has many diversified SaaS businesses other than the retail business. Shopify discloses its total GMV ($41B), and it is entered on the spreadsheet.All dollar figures are in thousands.The above calculations will render the GMV valuation to be $1.57B and the overall Shopify valuation to be $5.37B ($3.80B + $1.57B).What about Shopify growth?The next step is to come up with a multiple that would assume that Shopify will grow at a rate higher than its competition. I struggled with this, as the only moat that I see with Shopify is its incredible partner network, the extension of its marketing and support arm.The Shopify technology is relatively simple for any software company to replicate. In addition, competitors who do virtually the same thing, and sometimes with a more flexible platform, already exist. The multi-channels Shopify has for advertising and driving eyeballs to the Shopify stores are easily replicated and many competitors already have them.Shopify haters may choose to put a number lower than 100% here. While I am short on Shopify, I strongly believe that they have a great chance to excel with manufacturers and larger retailers, and I will assume a multiple of 200% (that is, roughly, Shopify will grow twice as fast as its competitors). I would consider this as a highly optimistic number, but then again, I would prefer to err towards the side of the existing valuations.This means that the best-case scenario for the Shopify valuation should be $5.37B * 200% = $10.74B.Based on the analysis above, the current valuation of Shopify cannot be justified through standard fundamental financial analysis, even with very highly optimistic estimates like the ones I included above. Amazon on the other hand is a very solid company, and I personally believe that its current valuation is fully justified.Most of Shopify clients will be strongly challenged by Amazon and the larger e-commerce retailers. Many of these clients will close their Shopify stores and potentially go out of business; this will eventually result in a severe decline in the Shopify stock price.Amazon and Shopify are competitive on two fronts:(1) Amazon is competing directly with Shopify clients for end buyers,and(2) Amazon Marketplace is competing directly with Shopify for providing the platform for retailers to sell their productsAmazon and Shopify are also cooperating as Shopify is providing the ability for their customers to list their products directly on the Amazon platform.The Amazon valuation is fairly complex and it is beyond the scope of this article.Shopify valuation is relatively easy, and based on the optimistic analysis performed above should not exceed $10.74B, while the current market valuation is pegging it at higher than $30B. The calculations to derive this valuation is available in the parameterized spreadsheet provided here."
4281022,24634,2019-08-02T18:55:52-04:00,Shopify is now up 150% since my purchase earlier this year.Shopify is one of the 18 stocks that I currently own in my Ultra Growth Portfolio.This portfolio is up just over 39% YTD.,"I am now in my 22nd year as a professional money manager. I was there in 1999-2000 when many tech stocks were trading at triple-digit multiples. Many of these companies had very little in the way of earnings growth however to warrant these kinds of PE ratios.But, from time to time companies come along with a business plan that turns into an earnings growth monster.Apple was one of those stocks. I just wrote about Apple and my current opinion of it. Hint: I still own it.Amazon is also currently one of those stocks.Is Shopify worth of a 300-plus PE ratio at the current time?Shopify (SHOP) is becoming one of the great IPO’s in recent years. The company went public back on April 29, 2015, at $25 per share and today it is trading just over $340 per share. That is a meteoric rise of 1,260% in just over 4 years.A $10,000 investment in SHOP back then would be worth $126,000 today. A $3B small-cap company has become a $38B large-cap company. Is it on its way to join the $100 billion-plus club?Here is what its chart looks like since the company went public.As I mentioned previously, some have called this company the next Amazon (AMZN). Amazon is currently a $915B mega-cap company. If Shopify is the next Amazon, then it still has a lot more upside potential.Is this the next Amazon? Well, let’s take a look at what they do, how fast they are growing, the current valuation on the shares, and a five-year target price based on its current trajectory.Shopify provides a cloud-based commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses via subscription and merchant solution. It is based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.A merchant can start their own shop on their online mall without incurring all the overhead of opening a traditional bricks and mortar retail store. You can check out their website here. What will you sell in their mall? Is there a food court?Revenues at Shopify have grown 5-fold over the last four-plus years.Annual Revenues:Shopify has also reached profitability much faster than Amazon. Here is what their earnings growth looks like.Annual Revenues:Thompson Reuters is showing a consensus 5 yr. annual growth rate estimate of 56.8% per year going forward. Zacks Research is showing 23.70%.Using Zack’s numbers, here is what Shopify’s earnings would like in the future.Now let’s use Thompson Reuters growth rate and see what those numbers would look likeYou can see what a difference compound interest makes over a four-year period of time! Zack’s number five-years from now is $2.19, while Thompson Reuters number is $5.66.Frankly, I like the higher number of the two. I believe that Zack’s number is way too conservative. Thompson Reuter’s may be a bit optimistic, but in this case, I believe it is more possible to achieve.Now, what kind of target price can we currently place on the stock? I like to use 5-year target prices and update them on a regular basis. Using a 5-yr target price takes a lot of emotion out of the investingI know what you are thinking, a lot can happen over the next five years. We will get to that in a moment, but for now, the stock is going to trade on these future expectations that I outlined above.So, let’s use the Thompson Reuter’s number of $5.66 of earnings per share by the year 2023. This is the first half of the target price equation.Now, what kind of a multiple are we going to assign to go along with those earnings?The current PE ratio (multiple) of SHOP is 600X. I don’t think that will work going forward. SHOP will not be a $3,600 stock 3-5 years from now.The current forward PE ratio of SHOP is currently 338X. I don’t think that SHOP will be trading at the kind of multiple 3-5 years from now either.If Shopify is being compared with Amazon, let’s check and see where it’s PE ratio currently is at.Amazon’s current PE ratio is 77X but, SHOP is much earlier in its growth phase than Amazon is right now. Amazon is now almost a $1 trillion-dollar company while SHOP is tiny in comparison at just $38 billion. In other words, Shopify has a lot more growth potential right now than Amazon has.Therefore, it deserves a higher multiple than Amazon is currently trading at.You are not going to buy Shopify at a GM like multiple of 6X. Shopify is one of the premier growth stocks in the market today.Shopify has started to turn a profit much sooner than Amazon and they don’t have the same kind of overhead that Amazon has either.Shopify has a business model more like ETSY, but it is growing much faster than ETSY. Etsy’s PE ratio is currently 91X.I am going to use a premium on Etsy’s multiple to come up with the multiple that I am going to assign Shopify, so that I can come up with its current 3-5 year target price.Here is what my equation looks like:$5.66 X 112= $635 per share.Data from Best Stocks Now database.I am sure that many will argue with my calculations, but at the beginning of the year, my target price was over $300 per share when the shares were trading at $135. I was right, the stock has hit that target price and I am up 150% on shares since January 1 of this year.In my view, with the stock trading at about $342 today, it still has significant upside potential from here. My current price target could also higher after this big beat by Shopify on Wednesday.There are obviously all kinds of risk to these numbers over the next 3-5 years. The U.S. economy could go into recession. I would not want to own a stock like SHOP during a recession. I would rather own an inverse fund like QID, which is an inverse ETF on the tech sector.Another company like SHOP may come along and take away market share. This is the nature of the beast in the market. Competition is always going after the leader. Look at that market share that Apple has lost to its competitors over the last several years.Shopify could fall significantly short of its earnings and growth estimates. This a very aggressive projection for this company. It is up to management to continue to execute so that they can continue to achieve the kind of success that they have produced so far.My ranking system of stocks also looks at momentum along with valuation. I consider these two factors to be the most important criteria in my stock selection process.Shopify is currently dripping with momentum. Let me just whet your appetite a bit for a high-growth stock like Shopify.Data from Best Stocks Now database.The stock has delivered an average annual return of 110% per year over the last three years. During that same period of time, the market has delivered just 11% per year. Now that is some alpha!Over the last twelve months, the stock is up 130% while the market is up just 5.8%. Once again, that is a lot of alpha.When I combine those two metrics of value and momentum, Shopify comes in with an overall rank of 78 out 5,318 in my proprietary system of ranking stocks. Data from Best Stocks Now database.Everyone is looking to find the next Amazon. Maybe you just did!"
4282597,102646,2019-08-07T11:31:37-04:00,"Shopify stock climbed after the company reported its Q2 results.
        The company is estimated to generate revenues of $2.7 billion in 2021 but is valued at almost $40 billion.
        I explain why long-term investors should stay in the sidelines for now.","I have been covering Shopify (SHOP) since the company became a public company. As I have documented before, I bought the stock shortly after the company went public. I exited my investment in December last year with a solid return. Looking at the YTD performance, it seems like I exited my investment at the wrong time because the stock has gone up by almost 140% this year. In the past few months, I have published a number of reports warning that the stock does not warrant the current valuation. In this article, I will look at the company’s Q2 performance and then recommend what long-term investors should do going forward.On Thursday, SHOP’s stock rose by 6% after the company reported better-than-expected results. In the quarter, the company reported that the adjusted net income rose to $15.8 million compared to $2.5 million a year ago. Revenue rose by 47.7% to $361 million in the quarte while the EPS of $0.14 beat the consensus estimate by $0.10.The merchant solutions segment revenue of $208.8 million grew by 56% while the subscription solutions revenue increased by 38% to $153 million. This was driven by the monthly recurring revenue growth of 34%. The Gross Merchandise Value increased to more than $1 billion per week, which is an impressive figure. For the year, the company expects to make between $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion. In 2020 and 2021, analysts expect the company to make $2.05 billion and $2.77 billion respectively.Everyone, including the company’s critics agree that Shopify is a good company that targets a large and expanding market. Over the years, the company has continued to improve its products with the goal of increasing the average revenue per user. Some of those products are added by the company itself while others are added by third-parties. These investments have made the company’s users love the company as evidenced by the recent Unite Partner Conference. More than 1,500 partners and developers attended the event. No other company in the software space can attract such a large number of people.There are a number of reasons why I love Shopify. First, it is a company that has a sustainable competitive advantage against its closest peers. The most popular competitors to SHOP are companies like BigCommerce, Volusion, Prestashop, WooCommerce, and Magento. Other companies like Square (SQ) – through Weebly –, Wix (WIX), Adobe (ADBE) – through Magento - and GoDaddy (GDDY) have also entered the business. Micrososft (MSFT) too is said to be interested in getting into the industry as it tries to expand its cloud services. The chart below shows the Google Trends interest for SHOP against its peers in the past ten years.Source: GoogleSecond, Shopify business model is an excellent one in that it does not hold any retail inventories. This is left to the individual shop owners. The company makes money through the subscription fees that the shop owners pay. It only makes money from the additional charges the company generates such as when the users pay for individual apps within the ecosystem. In the most recent quarterly results, the company announced that it had a gross profit margin of 56%. The EBITDA and operating margins were -6.94% and -8.97% respectively. In future, the company will start seeing better margins. In a recent note, Tom Forte of D.A Davidson said that the long-term EBITDA margin could reach 40%.Third, there is a large Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Shopify. There are millions of businesses around the world. Most of these businesses are being disrupted by their peers who are in the internet. To compete, most of the companies are moving online. However, since most of them don’t have an IT team or the expertise to build online stores, SHOP becomes an ideal partner.In the most-recent annual report, the company announced that it had more than 820k customers. Of these, 55% of them (450k) are from the United States while 8% of them (65k) are from the United Kingdom. It has 114,800k customers from Australia and Canada respectively. With millions of small businesses around the world, these numbers show that the company has a large TAM. In the US alone, there are more than 22 million small companies.As I have written before, my main concern with Shopify is not about the company. In fact, my wife uses it for her small e-commerce business and she loves it. Still, long-term investors should be interested in the price of the companies they invest in. As of this writing, the company has a market value of more than $37 billion. This is pricey, for a loss-making company that is expected to generate $2.77 billion in 2021. The company will likely hit $5 billion in annual revenue in 2025. At the current market value, investors are paying 7.5x 2025 revenue. This is a bit pricey even for a fast-growing SAAS company.To bring the point home, the chart below compares the forward EV to EBITDA ratio of the company with that of Wix and Square.Source: YChartsI believe that there is absolutely no way to justify the current valuation. Assuming that the company is able to achieve the long-term EBITDA target of 40% at $5 billion, its EBITDA will be $2 billion per year. At the current valuation, this is valuation is 19x the EBITDA, which is a bit pricey for me. The forward PS ratio of 18x is more than double that of Wix and Square, which have a forward PS ratio of 7.7 and 9.6. Obviously, SHOP should have a higher multiple than Square and Wix because their quarterly growth rate of 43% and 26% is relatively slower.In the most recent quarter, the company had a free cash flow of more than $10 million. In 2020, 2021, and 2022, analysts expect the company to have a levered free cash flow of more than $58 million, $122 million, and $382 million. A DCF analysis, which looks at the future cash flows shows that the stock should be trading at about $210 as shown below.Source: Simply Wall StreetSurprisingly, this is level is similar with the stock’s 200-day moving averages as shown below.Source: YChartsTo many longs, the valuation does not matter provided that the company can sustain the growth. However, I forecast a situation where the company’s growth slows down if Donald Trump moves ahead with his threat to add tariffs on China. The recently announced $300 billion tariffs would hit the consumer segment and possibly slow the growth in the near term.Another concern is on saturation and the recent trends in the e-commerce industry. Today, most large consumer-facing companies have e-commerce stores. In the US, companies like Nordstrom (JWN), Macy’s (M), and Apple (AAPL) have their e-commerce stores. The same is true with most Canadian retailers like Lululemon (LULU), Winners, and Hudson Bays have their e-commerce platforms. These large companies are the ones that pay for Shopify’s Advanced tier that costs $300 a month. Therefore, I expect that growth in onboarding such large companies will be a bit slow. Further, as more consumer-facing companies fail, the company could start seeing increased churn.Shopify is a good company with a solid management team. In fact, there is nothing much to dislike about the company. In fact, as I have written before, my wife has been a user of Shopify for the past three years and she likes it. However, from an investment standpoint, I believe that the company is priced to perfection. Investors believe that the growth will never end. However, as history has taught us, this never happens. Therefore, I recommend that long-term investors should wait before they invest in SHOP."
4282285,25047,2019-08-06T17:28:13-04:00,The market seems to believe Shopify is like Amazon.com (specifically the 3P marketplace).There are similarities.But the differences are much more relevant and structural.,"Recently, the euphoria in Shopify (SHOP) seems to stem from the thesis that it's the next Amazon.com (AMZN). This is amplified by the large GMV (gross merchandise values) Shopify reports. This article will very quickly show why Shopify is not Amazon.com.Shopify makes available a cloud-enabled solution for independent merchants and companies to implement their own e-commerce websites. Furthermore, increasingly Shopify is offering these merchants additional services, including payments services, credit, and now even fulfillment capacity.This activity might seem superficially like what Amazon does. Most specifically, what Amazon.com does in its very profitable 3P (third party) marketplace. After all, in that marketplace Amazon.com makes available a giant store where merchants can offer their wares to consumers, and then also turns and offers them fulfillment services (FBA – Fulfilled By Amazon.com).That’s where the similarities end, though. You see, there's a key difference:This key difference has tremendous consequences for Shopify’s economics.This is obvious. Amazon.com is a destination. It’s like a hugely popular online department store. The more popular Amazon.com is, the more merchants want to be there selling to the huge public. The more merchants and deals exist on Amazon.com, the more popular it becomes. This reinforces itself and constitutes a network effect where the size of the network adds value to those participating in it.Like prized high-traffic real estate, this phenomenon means Amazon.com can set onerous trading terms. If Amazon.com was selling physical space, it would be charging very high rents to the merchants wanting to access that rich consumer pool. Amazon.com is an online retailer, and does one better: it charges onerous commissions on each good sold (typically 8-15%, plus other fees). Shopify, by and large, doesn’t. It just charges a small fee for your ability to open a store there.This reality is at the core of why Shopify neither is, nor can aspire to be, Amazon.com. Building stores doesn’t guarantee them a huge consumer pool. Building physical stores is a low margin business as well … having premium high-traffic real estate is where the value is.Furthermore, the value of what Amazon.com provides is highly disconnected from what it costs to provide. The value is entirely tied to the pool of consumers it can deliver to the merchant. Shopify, on the other hand, has the value of what it provides tied to the cost of alternatives, to the cost of “doing one’s own,” etc. This ensures a structurally low margin.Another thing showing the value to the merchant, and Amazon.com’s superior bargaining position, is what would happen if the merchant was to leave Amazon.com: The related sales would collapse, since the consumer is owned by Amazon.com, not the merchant.Now, what would happen if a merchant using Shopify for his store was to migrate to another solution? The whole thing would be transparent - the consumer would remain with the merchant. This might seem like an advantage for the merchant (and it is), but it’s a massive disadvantage for Shopify, its bargaining power and thus, the economics of its business.At this point, you might think this is all hand waving. It’s not. This translates directly into cold hard numbers. For instance:These differences are critical and structural. For instance, eBay's gross margin is 77.8% of sales, whereas Shopify’s is around 56% (a one-off effect inflated things slightly in Q2 2019 to 57.2%). Down the P&L things get ever more complicated because of the structurally poorer business model, so if we use a similar base to eBay (not removing stock-based compensation), Shopify runs at a -10.9% operating margin (compared to eBay's +20.7%).We already saw why Shopify is no Amazon.com. Its business is intrinsically worse because of the lack of network effects and Amazon.com providing the consumer pool, which makes Amazon.com massively more valuable for the merchant.We saw that such translates into radically different commissions charged by Amazon.com (and eBay) vs. Shopify. We also saw that such translates into massively different economics (with eBay being a much better business, and Amazon.com 3P marketplace likely even better).That said, the kind of thing Shopify provides does make it something of a threat for Amazon.com. It’s much cheaper for the merchants to sell through a Shopify-enabled store, so this can enable merchants to also practice lower prices. Over time, this might result in a level of erosion of the very expensive marketplaces (such as Amazon.com’s). This is reinforced by payment protection schemes which remove the risk of buying through “unknown” merchants (versus in a well-known marketplace).However, even if this threat were to materialize, it would not really improve Shopify’s economics. It would only serve as a brake to the much superior Amazon.com / eBay economics.Although the market wants to believe Shopify is the next Amazon.com, it very obviously isn’t. Shopify doesn’t bring a massive pool of consumers to the merchant’s door, and that’s the most critical aspect in adding value to a merchant (and thus being able to charge him significant commissions).As a result, Amazon.com collects ten times more commissions from the same GMV dollar as does Shopify. Even if Shopify’s merchants were to add up to the same GMV as Amazon.com’s 3P marketplace, Shopify would still be a business massively less worthy than Amazon.com’s 3P marketplace. Much worse than the mere “10x difference” would seem to entail, since being able to charge much higher commission rates also enables much higher margins on the same dollar (several times the 10x ...).In short, Shopify is no Amazon.com."

(SHOP) has been in hyperdrive this year, with its stock price up 175% YTD, outdistancing the Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (PSJ) by far. PSJ is up 31% this year and provides a good benchmark for the general software industry.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Shopify has pulled back the last 1½ weeks. Based on the stock chart technicals, it could fall to approximately $340 in the near future, a point where support level and trend line converge.Shopify’s superb stock performance has been fueled by 50%+ annual revenue growth and free cash flow that has recently turned positive. And based on recent announcements, it appears that Shopify has no intentions of slowing down. I don’t intend to review all of these announcements, as they have already been covered by Sramana Mitra in Shopify Soars To New Highs.I am however going to spend some time discussing one initiative, and that is the $1 Billion budget for setting up a network of fulfillment centers.(Source: Shopify)As far as assigning a rating to Shopify, there are two reasons why I am hesitant about giving Shopify a buy rating. The first reason pertains to management's decision to expand into fulfillment centers. The second reason is that Shopify’s stock price is quite overvalued at this time. Therefore, I am giving Shopify a neutral rating.On one hand, I am happy that Shopify intends to put its stockpile of cash to work. On the other hand, I’m not sure that expanding into fulfillment centers makes sense. Shopify appears to be following the lead of Amazon.com (AMZN), a company that is intent on being the e-Commerce leader in fast delivery. The problem with the head-on competition with Amazon.com is economy of scale. By my calculation, Shopify has 1/200th the revenue of Amazon.com. Shopify doesn’t move anywhere near as much product and can’t compete on pricing or delivery speed.If Shopify deems that expansion into fulfillment centers is critical to its future, then why not invest in or buy outright a company already in the business of fulfillment centers? A billion dollars goes a long way. There are several fulfillment companies that already integrate with Shopify. Here are five companies that could get them up and going fast:However, Shopify appears to be developing its own network from scratch. In my day, this was called the NIH factor, with the acronym NIH standing for “Not Invented Here”.I have to wonder what Shopify’s objective is. Operating a fulfillment center is cash-intensive and requires some demanding logistics. Ultimately this activity will defocus management when perhaps they could be better put to use on expanding into other high margin software-based applications.If Shopify is serious about competing at the same level as Amazon.com then it should consider partnering with a company such as FedEx (FDX). FedEx has an established fulfillment capability and the combination of Shopify and Fedex would make a pretty powerful combination. Add in a few large retailers and this would give Amazon.com some competition.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 89 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Shopify is significantly above the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Shopify is overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe. And it gets worse. More than half of Shopify’s revenues are transactional, not recurring. Some believe that transaction-based models should not command the premium valuation that SaaS-based companies do. In that case, Shopify is even more overvalued than the scatter plot shows.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate, plus profit, adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin. Other analysts use operating cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.Shopify's revenue grew by 51.9% for the most recent 12 months, down from 105% in 2015.(Source: Portfolio123)Shopify had a free cash flow margin of 1.3% for the most recent 12-month period. (Source: Portfolio123)Shopify's revenue growth was 51.9%, while free cash flow margin was 1.3%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 51.9% + 1.3% = 53.2%The Rule of 40% calculation comes out much higher than 40%, I conclude that the company is very financially healthy.I love the company fundamentals. High revenue growth and positive free cash flow are a very enviable position to be in. Despite the great fundamentals, I view the stock price to be substantially overvalued. Additionally, I don’t understand the company’s expansion into fulfillment centers. This is a completely different business and business model, capital and logistics-intensive. There are plenty of companies already doing this and some of them are already integrated with Shopify.Instead of starting from scratch which takes time, why not invest in a company already in the business and integrated with Shopify? Time is the most important factor when you are fighting for market share.If Shopify is serious about competing directly with Amazon.com, then they should be partnering with a company like FedEx and perhaps some large retail outfits as well, giving them enough economy of scale to be competitive on cost.Based on the company’s decision to grow into fulfillment centers, and an overvalued stock price, I am giving Shopify a neutral rating."
4271566,23903,2019-06-22T09:30:06-04:00,"Wall Street's average price target for SHOP increased disproportionately to its Q1 earnings surprise.Wall Street's average price targets continued to increase after Shopify's fulfillment vertical news despite its likely dilutive effect on earnings.Valuations continue to surge disproportionate to Shopify's growth prospects, reaching as high as 35x TTM revenues.","(image source: Shopify Investor Day press release)It seems about every decade investor sentiment turns euphoric due to lax monetary policy. It happened in 1998-1999 and again in 2007-2008. In 2018 it was with FAANG stocks and in 2019 momentum seems to be shifting to MVP type stocks. Why not after the Federal Reserve signaled for possible rate cuts off historically low levels despite unemployment nearing half century low levels. Shopify (SHOP) has been right in the middle of it as revenues soared by 59% in 2018 leading analysts to trip over themselves hiking prices targets after every move up. Targets continued to be upgraded after Shopify announced an in house fulfillment vertical on June 19, 2019 and caused its market cap to soar to $38 billion, nearing one of the largest delivery services in the world, Fedex (FDX) at $44 billion market cap. Interestingly, some of the price target highs imply Shopify will be larger than Fedex in market cap. However, actual incremental increases in Shopify's earnings and guidance do not justify the magnitude of recent analysts price target hikes.Shopify did report good first quarter 2019 results. Revenues continued to grow by 50% year over year and adjusted EPS (excluding non-cash stock compensation) came in at $0.04, beating Wall Street estimates which called for a -$0.09 EPS loss. Revenues also beat analyst consensus of $310 million by $10.5 million, or a 3.4% surprise. At the midpoint guidance, SHOP expects revenues to be around $347.5 million in Q2 and $1.49 billion in 2019. This compares to Wall Street average estimates of $347 million and $1.47 billion, respectively.So how did Wall Street analysts react to a 3.4% reported revenue beat and forward guidance increases of 1-2%? The following table shows twelve firms that increased SHOP's price target the following day after earnings. The average price target increase was 31%.(Canadian dollar price target converted to USD at 1.32 exchange rate)What appears to be happening is Wall Street and investors are getting caught up with talking points rather than actual numbers. Remember the dotcom bubble days in 1998? Books-A-Million announces an online website and its stock surges 1200% in a matter of weeks. Brick and mortar A buys dotcom B causing A to soar on the announcement even though the actual financial impact wasn't clear. To be fair, three firms did sound valuation caution recently:Sure bulls will say “but EPS beat estimates by 300%!” Yes a $0.04 EPS 'adjusted' EPS profit is nice when everyone was expecting a -$0.09 loss, but to keep things in perspective Shopify is a multi-hundred dollar stock. Stripping non-operational benefits such as interest income and marked to market hedging adjustments which totaled a combined $20.9 million, Q1 EPS would have been lowered by $0.19 leading to an earnings miss. I wonder how many analysts actually factored in increased interest income from the $400 million secondary in late December last year or knew exact details of currency hedging effects?The headline is very striking – “Shopify Is Setting Up Fulfillment Network in U.S., Just Like Amazon” as reported by Bloomberg. Back in bubble days, a headline like that would have caused a 20% stock spike. I guess 2019 isn't exactly like 1999 since SHOP only surged by 10% following the announcement. Analysts, like clockwork, raised price targets by over 33% on average as the following table shows.But is this actually good news to earnings? Yes of course a new vertical will increase revenues but last mile delivery services are not a high margin business even for high volume global leaders. The following table shows three of the top listed last mile delivery companies with services in the US.(Data based on the latest annual report figures for each respective company)Now Shopify is entering into a lower margin business that likely won't reach revenues anywhere near XPO Logistics in its first four years. As the table shows, XPO posted 14.7% gross margin last fiscal year compared to Shopify's 55.6% in 2018. Shopify admits the “bulk of net return expected beyond 2023” in an investor day presentation and by implying the new vertical is “expected to be largely cash neutral over five years”, investors should expect losses for this segment.The good news is Shopify has been very good at keeping their cash flow levels neutral to slightly positive despite posting GAAP losses. Their staggered approached to building this vertical which will cost up to $1 billion over the next few years should keep cash flows from going negative by too much. After raising over $1 billion last year, investors hopefully shouldn't fear additional secondaries with their current $2 billion cash position.(source: Shopify Investor Day presentation)The big mistake investors can make is comparing Shopify's new fulfillment service to Amazon's FBA. There are major reasons why FBA offers so much more of a competitive advantage for Amazon's merchants than self fulfillment:Since Shopify's volumes will only be a fraction of Amazon's, it's unlikely pricing will be anywhere near FBA levels. I noticed a figure at $5.20 in a promo gif but it's unclear the exact cost structure. A high fixed base cost will likely limit the service to higher ticket sales and/or shipments over 1 lb. in weight since sub-pound postage costs between $2.50-$3.50 even for lower volume merchants.Since Amazon's customer base is much larger than Shopify's, merchants would limit outsourced fulfillment to high turnover products. There will obviously be some storage/handling fee so the cost benefits wouldn't justify potential long term storage costs for slow moving merchandise. This factor will likely keep the service to Shopify Plus merchants who deal in much higher volumes. Smaller merchants who might be able to get away with lower turnover items on FBA would unlikely be able to do the same on Shopify given its smaller marketplace.While the headlines make it seem an additional fulfillment vertical is a major next step, it likely will be dilutive to earnings for the next few years until Shopify scale the service revenues up significantly. The service will also not apply to all merchants although initial ramps may appear impressive due to smaller numbers of Shopify Plus merchants signing on.Unlike Shopify's subscription revenues and merchant services revenues where the company merely acts as a middleman, building a fulfillment vertical increases the risk for loss immensely due to high initial capex and fixed operating costs. An economic slowdown would only translate to lower revenues at roughly the same margin levels for their core businesses but could lead to negative margins due to lower shipment levels for the new fulfillment vertical.For these reasons I do not see the fulfillment vertical as an incremental benefit at least for the next 3-4 years. Thus my forward earnings projections assuming optimistic conditions haven't changed and should be revised lower due to the dilutive nature of this new business segment which incurs greater operational risks. Nevertheless SHOP continues to surge into stratospheric valuations but in today's market valuations simply do not matter.I made a mistake by not listening to one of my rules of not shorting bubbles until they burst and shorted a small 100 share position recently at an effective $301 cost (sold a covered put) 'just for kicks'. Looks like I'm the one who got kicked so I suggest against shorting some of these high valuation sectors unless you can endure a lot of potential pain and the short position is just a small portion of your portfolio. History is repeating itself as analysts are continuing to raise valuation targets that are simply not justified by smaller levels of incremental improvements in Shopify's financials. We'll have to see if history continues to repeat itself when valuations do matter and analysts start tripping over themselves with downward revisions."
4270912,102646,2019-06-19T10:00:07-04:00,"Shopify is an excellent SAAS company with a great business model.
        The company continues to grow but as with all companies, the growth will not last forever.
        At $31 billion market cap there are inherent risks for being long the company.","IntroductionSAAS companies have been on fire in the past few years. Just last week, Salesforce (CRM) bought a highly overvalued Tableau (DATA) for more than $15 billion. This came a week after Google (GOOGL) purchased loss-making Looker for $2.6 billion. In the public markets, SAAS companies like Square (SQ), Wix (WIX), and Hubspot (HUBS) are trading at forward PE ratios above 90. This article will provide a continued coverage of Shopify (SHOP), which I believe is one of the most overvalued public SAAS company.A Good CompanyI have written about Shopify before. In May, I wrote about how the company’s valuation did not make sense. This was shortly after the company released its Q1’19 results, which showed impressive revenue growth of 50% YoY. The company had revenue of $320 million. Merchant solutions revenue was $180 million while subscription revenue was $140 million. On its guidance, the company expects revenue of between $1.48 billion and $1.5 billion. Investors expect annual revenue of $1.51 billion. Adjusted net income is expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.Shopify has an enviable business model. It enables small and large companies launch and run their e-commerce companies. Within a few minutes, a retailer can create their shopping platforms without hiring a large team of developers. Once signed in, the customers pay a small monthly fee to keep their shops running. They also buy additional apps like Oberlo, Kit, and Privy within the Shopify ecosystem to simplify their operations. As such, the company operates in an asset-lite, high-margin, and predictable business model.In addition, the company has a strong brand name in a relatively competitive industry. This brand name enables it to outcompete with other companies like Wix, Weebly, Big Commerce, and Magento. Further, the company has a strong balance sheet, with more than $2 billion and no debt. This gives it room to invest in research and development and make meaningful acquisitions. In May, the company did just that after acquiring Handshake, a B2B ecommerce platform that brings manufacturers and distributors close to their customers.Richly ValuedAs I argued before, Shopify is incredibly overvalued. As of this writing, the company has a market capitalization of more than $31 billion. I believe that this is a relatively high valuation for a company that is expected to generate revenue of $1.5 billion this year and $2.6 billion in 2021. In 2021, it is estimated to have an EBITDA of $260 million. At the current valuation, it is trading at 120x 2021 EBITDA.This year, investors expect the company to have an EPS of $0.57. At the current valuation, investors are paying 318x the estimated earnings for this year. The forward PS ratio for the year is 17. These numbers are significantly above those of the peer companies. Wix, which is an incredible company that competes with Shopify has a forward PE multiple if 93 and a forward PS ratio of 7.4. That SHOP is highly valued than Wix is not a surprise because it has a faster growth rate. In the most recent quarter, SHOP had a YoY growth rate of 50% compared to Wix 26.5%. Still, the difference in the earnings multiples is significant. Hubspot on the other hand had a growth rate of 32.5% and has a forward PE ratio of 100. More mature and fast growing SAAS companies like Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), and Salesforce (CRM) have a forward PE ratio of 28, 26, and 44. The chart below compares the forward PE multiples of SHOP and these peers.Against SHOP’s FY20 revenue estimate of $2 billion, the company is valued at 21.32x EV/FY20 revenues. While an EV to forward revenues of mid to high teens is usually justifiable for rapidly growing companies, a multiple that exceeds 20x is hardly justifiable. The chart below compares this ratio between SHOP and other fast-growing SAAS companies.Source: YChartsWith some of these SAAS companies continually making losses, the PS ratio is a good one to assess whether SHOP is overvalued. As shown below, based on the estimated $2 billion sales of 2020, the company has a forward PS ratio of 22.74. This is more than double that of its closest SAAS peers.Based on forward PE, PS, and EV to revenue multiples, there is no argument that SHOP is an overvalued company. Indeed it is. The question going forward is whether the company’s growth will continue to support the pricey valuation. History tells us that growth can last for an extended period of time, but it is never permanent. A good example of this is what happened with Tesla (TSLA), which reached an all-time high of almost $370 in 2017. As the company’s growth rate started to weaken, its stock started to decline and is currently at $215. This year, the company’s stock has declined by 35%. Another good example is Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock is down by more than 45% in the past one year. In other words, even in the fastest growing industries, euphoria does not last forever. Further, while we would expect the margins to improve as sales grow, the chart below shows that the key margins have been softening.With this in mind, let us travel to the future and assume that the company’s strong growth continues. Analysts expect the revenue will hit $2.6 billion in 2021 and be more than $3 billion in 2022. This means that by 2025, the company’s revenue will be approximate $5 billion. SAAS companies like Adobe, Intuit (INTU), and Salesforce have net profit margins of 25%, 42%, and 10%. Therefore, if we give SHOP a 30% profit margin, it will have a net profit if $1.5 billion when it reaches annual revenue of $5 billion. At the current $31 billion valuation, it means the company is trading at 20x the estimated 2025 net income. This is relatively pricey. The chart below shows that the revenue growth is slowing.While SHOP has an incredible business model, it will also face a number of challenges. First, with more than 500K Shopify stores, it means that the room for growth will be minimal. This is because many large companies like Nike (NIKE), Adidas, and Lululemon (LULU) already have their own e-commerce platforms. Since migrating to SHOP will be time consuming and unnecessary, the company will miss out on mature and highly-predictable companies.Another challenge is that of the 500k companies that use SHOP, most of them are small and medium enterprises. The challenge with these small companies is that most of them tend to fail. While SHOP does not disclose the customer churn, it is easy to see why most companies that create their SHOP accounts don’t renew them after one year. A model by Jan Barta found that 77% of the customers leave before their first anniversary. I know this first-hand because I know friends who created their SHOP stores only to abandon them because of slow sales.In addition, while SHOP is the best e-commerce software provider, we cannot continue to ignore the competition. If you listen to podcasts, watch TV, and read magazines, you have likely seen the increased spend by SHOP’s rivals like SquareSpace and Wix. While these companies focused on bloggers, they are now diversifying by adding e-commerce capabilities. While these companies will not become big e-commerce players, they will indeed take a few potential customers from SHOP because of the low price.Final ThoughtsSHOP is an excellent company that will continue to grow in future. The company’s platform is excellent and reasonably priced especially for small and medium-sized companies. However, as an investment, I believe that investors are paying a hefty valuation for the company. Therefore, for anyone in the sidelines, I would recommend waiting until the hysteria is over before initiating a long position. Ideally, I would recommend waiting until the price reaches the 50-day moving average of $254 before initiating a long position."

This return is calculated against the margin impact and not against the value of the underlying - i.e., 200 shares of Shopify at the respective strike prices.The intention of this trade is to generate short term cash flow while I wait for an entry price for Shopify.My desired entry value of Shopify is $195. I approached this with a simplified set of assumptions and I am appreciative to have more inputs from the readers in the comments regarding this set of assumptions.5th year price to sales of 8x and sales per share of $49 would result in a 2024 share price of $392. This reflects a 29% CAGR in sales per share but a reduction in relative valuation on a price to sales basis. My minimum expected return on a growth company is 15% yearly which means Shopify would make sense to me as a long investment at $195. This is 33% below the current trading price.Hence I may wait for the price to come down (or it may never happen) before I make a purchase, but I would like to earn some cash flow.Shopify is adequately capitalized and has no debt. At the same time gross profit margins have held stable despite competition in this e-commerce marketplace and other companies like GoDaddy.com also offering add-on services like website builders with e-commerce functionality.My view is that the company will continue to grow its sales and eventually turn profitable despite competition and is a stock to own for the future. The ecosystem that both Shopify and Square are building around merchants is phenomenal.Although the company does not report customer retention rates or churn statistics, I am using web traffic and Google Trends to compare popularity of Shopify with its competition.Source: Similarweb.comDo note that Wix offers free websites on its wixsites.com domain and Shopify allows merchants the same on the myshopify.com.

For a company that offers mundane services that include web hosting and merchant support, Shopify (SHOP) has defied the odds and reached a market valuation in excess of $31.5 billion this week despite having trailing twelve month revenues of just $1.18 billion. During Shopify's extraordinary rise, the bull and bear debate intensified, but I have not seen detailed analysis of the company's operating metrics to help justify its current valuations. This article will examine numbers beyond headline figures to give a more detailed prediction of the company's future earnings power. Even after making generous assumptions and ignoring risk factors, Shopify's potential earnings as far out as 2022 still do not justify the stock's current high market capitalization.In a broad market decline on May 28, 2019 due to US China trade tensions, companies that offer merchant payment processing rose in tandem on the backs of Global Payments' (GPN) purchase of Total Systems Services (TSS) for $21.5 billion in stock. Two months prior, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) offered $35 billion for Worldpay (WP) which followed Fiserv's (FISV) $22 billion all stock offer for First Data (FDC) in January. It's not unreasonable to assume these buyouts played some part in Shopify's 85% rally since First Data's announcement five months ago. After all, merchant solutions represented almost 57% of Shopify's revenues in fiscal 2018.If we examine the purchase prices of FDC, TSS, and WP along with PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Square (SQ), which are more closely aligned with Shopify's online businesses, one can instantly conclude SHOP is not cheap.The following table shows Wall Street's estimated 2019 EPS (non-GAAP excluding stock compensation) for these companies. From this, their 2019 forward PE, 2019 annual growth over 2018, and price to earnings growth, or PEG, can be calculated based on the closing prices on May 28, 2019. A PEG of 1.0 is considered fair value for a mature company while higher PEG values indicate potential market overvaluation.(All data taken from each company's respective 2018 annual report and is linked to each symbol in the table.)Since FDC, TSS, and WP are traditional payment processing and merchant support companies that have much larger debt loads than SHOP, SQ and PYPL, their enterprise value (market capitalization combined with net cash/debt) would give a more fair comparison. The last column in the table below shows the enterprise value to fiscal 2018 adjusted net income (non-GAAP excluding non-cash items as reported by their respective companies), which is similar to PE and helpful in determining the actual buyout valuation where debt is considered. From this table, we can see FDC, TSS, and WP were all purchased at roughly 30-36x last year's adjusted net income.(All data taken from each company's respective 2018 annual report, and all dollar figures in billions.)Trailing and current valuations show Shopify is not cheap and far from the valuations its traditional peers were recently bought out. While it's unlikely SHOP would get purchased at current relatively higher valuations, the simple bear conclusion that the stock is too expensive based on trailing and current earnings wouldn't be accurate either.Presumably those who are buying SHOP at current valuations believe the company has the ability to produce strong earnings at some point in the future. Without detailed analysis, this bull thesis can be a fallacy that results from generalized extrapolation of recent growth trends.For example, I've seen revenue extrapolations that based on Shopify's current metrics imply the company's merchants would produce more than $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume (GMV), or double Amazon's (AMZN) e-commerce market share last year. Total retail sales in the US were $5.3 trillion in 2018 according to the US Census Bureau.Other extrapolations imply Shopify's subscription base would reach over 250,000 Shopify Plus (larger merchants) and over 8 million regular subscribers; at the end of 2018 Shopify had 820,000 subscriptions including 5300 Shopify Plus accounts. These numbers, based on where Shopify is today and compared to the overall market potential, just do not make sense.To avoid potential extrapolation fallacies, I will only analyze SHOP's potential earnings power for a period four years ahead. I believe this is long enough to allow most companies to execute their growth strategies but not excessively long in a fluid technology-driven industry where business models could be broken overnight.Shopify's subscription revenue comes from online hosting services for its merchants. Monthly rates range from $29 to $299 for regular merchants and $2000 per month for Shopify Plus, which caters to larger businesses. The table below shows the company's subscription growth and monthly recurring revenues (MRR).We can see that the company's regular merchant subscriptions has already slowed due to the law of large numbers. In 2018, Shopify added a net 211,000 regular subscriptions which translated to a 34.7% annual growth. This is down from 231,500 additions in 2017. Thus it would be more accurate to project future growth using additions instead of growth rates. Compounding growth rates on top of already large numbers can easily result in an extrapolation error described above. In order to give an optimistic projection, I will assume annual additions stay level at 211,000. This takes regular merchant subscriptions to 1.66 million by the end of 2022.Shopify Plus subscriptions are still growing rapidly at an annual mid- to high-40s percentile rate. Since the base is very low and because growth rates actually increased slightly last year, I will use a slightly higher 50% compounded annual growth rate to determine subscription levels four years out. This takes Shopify Plus subscription levels to 26,800 ending 2022.(All data taken from Q4 2017 and Q4 2018 reports. MRR dollar amounts in millions.)From the table above, average MRR for regular subscribers was at $37.44 at the end of last year, down slightly on an annual basis. This tells us that the majority of regular merchant subscribers chose the lowest basic subscription service. The drop indicates the ratio of subscription plans might not change moving forward, but again to achieve an optimistic estimate, I will assume the average monthly subscriber revenue grows by 3% matching inflation to reach $43.00 at the end of 2022.Shopify Plus average monthly subscriber revenue actually increased by 12% in 2018 to $1962. This suggest the company has been able to attract a slightly higher ratio of larger clients. Assuming this trend continues, we arrive at a monthly Shopify Plus subscription rate of $3087 in the same four-fiscal-year time frame.2020 Subscriber Revenue Projection:By the end of 2022, these projections estimate Shopify's annual subscription revenue to be $1.85 billion (total MRR x 12 months).Shopify's merchant solutions revenue are mostly derived from payment processing for their merchant subscribers. This segment also includes other services such as shipping and cash advances. To reach a future revenues estimate, we need to estimate the company's gross payment volume (GPV) relative to its merchants' gross merchandise volume (GMV). GPV is the revenue Shopify can generate from their merchants' gross sales.(Data is taken from SHOP's 2018 annual report. All dollar figures in millions.)The table above shows SHOP's GPV penetration of GMV and has ranged between 38-41%. The inability of the company to break out of this range suggests some merchants, such as larger retail brands, process payments themselves. The slight 5% annual penetration growth may suggest other non-payment processing services are accounting for this segment's revenues. If we assume annual penetration growth rates can remain at 5% over the next four fiscal years, penetration levels will reach roughly 50% by the end of 2022.Despite a fairly optimistic rise in GPV penetration, the table also shows derived revenue as a percentage of GPV hasn't changed much at all in the past two years and hovered around 3.7%. This makes sense because in a highly competitive payment processing industry, it's unlikely companies can raise their commission rates. 3.7% is actually a very high number and almost double the industry. The only explanation is the inclusion of other services such as shipping and financing.Finally, we need to estimate GMV, or the gross sales of Shopify's merchants. Since the company doesn't break into exact details the ratio of GMV from regular subscribers and Shopify Plus subscribers, it's impossible to estimate future GMV from subscriber growth, which we already looked into above.Instead we need to apply the GMV growth trend which is clearly decelerating on a sequentially basis due to the law of large numbers. The GMV annual growth rate fell from 71% in 2017 to 56% in 2018 and currently stood at 48.8% in the first quarter of 2019. Applying the same growth rate deceleration, we reach 2022 GMV of $125.2 billion and at an annual growth rate of 21.8% for that year.(Dollar figures in billions.)In this example we can estimate Shopify's 2020 merchant solutions segment to reach $2.32 billion in revenues.(Dollar figures in billions.)From the segment revenues arrived at above, Shopify's 2022 total revenues would reach $4.17 billion. The revenue mix in this estimate of 45% subscription and 55% merchant solutions is not far off the 44/56% mix in the first quarter of 2019. Since the revenue mix is about the same, we can apply a 56% gross margin to the 2022 revenue estimate and reach a gross profit estimate of $2.34 billion. I believe this is a fair gross margin assumption since SHOP's gross margin has ranged tightly between 54% and 58% in the past 8 quarters; the slight variation correlated with the company's revenue mix in any given quarter.Shopify's operating expenses are more tricky to estimate because it's ranged between a wide band from 57% to 69% of revenues and have not decreased with scale evident in the 67.4% level for Q1 2019. The percentages have been fairly consistent in the past 8 quarters, and the only area we can safely assume could be lowered are sales/marketing and research/development costs. A third reduction in S&M and R&D at its lowest ratio to revenues in the past two years would bring total operating costs to around 40% of revenues. Stock-based compensation, which was a hefty 6% of operating expenses based on 2018 figures, will be stripped out at the end to reach non-GAAP adjusted earnings.We can now arrive at an estimate GAAP net income level for 2022 if we assume non-operational line items remain neutral and a tax rate of 21%:With Shopify's share count increasing by at least 10 million shares annually for the past 3 years and is currently on track for a 12 million share increase in 2019, I think it's reasonable to assume the diluted share count will hit 150 million shares by the end of 2022 from the current 110.9 million share level. This would put 2022 GAAP EPS at $3.53.From the table below, we can see Shopify has a very generous stock based compensation plan for its employees:(All data taken from 2018 annual reports of their respective companies. Dollar figures for the Stock Compensation column are in millions.)Share-based compensation was 8.9% of revenues in 2018 and based on the company's 2019 guidance will increase further to $160 million or 10.7% of revenues at the top end of its 2019 revenue guidance. If we assume stock-based compensation doesn't increase further on an absolute basis at $160 million:This compares to a non-GAAP analyst's average EPS estimate of $0.94 in 2020 and implies a two year annual compound growth rate of 121% to reach the $4.59 2022 non-GAAP EPS. Based on the most recent closing price of $282, SHOP would be trading at about 61x 2022 earnings when annual revenue growth rates would drop close to 20% using the metrics described above.Shopify does have a very good business that helps small and individual retailers compete on a more level playing field with larger retailers, but the company also operates in a very competitive industry with players much larger and more established. This will likely keep margins for the industry very competitive and the arrival of new players already eyeing e-commerce could further put pressure on future margins.There is really nothing stopping a new competitor from taking subscriptions away from Shopify since websites can be ported without too much difficulty. This is very different from Amazon, for example, which operates a proprietary marketplace ecosystem and offers instant benefits to any new merchant reseller.In addition, over half of Shopify's revenues come from merchant solutions such as payment processing. Given the very fluid evolution of non-cash payment options, new technological trends could render this revenue stream void very quickly. I don't think it will be too long before large companies leverage their platforms and user bases to create an online shopping experience that completely bypasses Shopify's payment solutions. For example, instead of shopping at a website of yesteryear, customers would shop and pay for an item through large social media platforms.This doesn't mean online stores won't exist, nor invalidate Shopify's business model, but I do believe the scale to which Shopify can grow in its current form is heavily exaggerated by Wall Street firms who currently have high price targets on the stock. I'm sure we all remember how many dotcoms completely vanished two decades ago despite glowing analyst projections of hundreds or thousand dollar price targets. Momentum trading could boost SHOP near term, but investors who pin their hopes on growth and valuations should take caution with Shopify."
4292438,100666,2019-09-19T07:10:29-04:00,"I picked Shopify in May 2017 and it has been a huge performer since then.We assess Shopify by looking at its history, looking at revenue growth versus price appreciation and the historical P/S ratio. Both seem to point to overvaluation.We also assess Shopify by comparing it to Amazon's history.As I did before, I look at Shopify's valuation with a '10-year forward P/E' and a 'virtual P/E'.","In Assessing SaaS, I look at SaaS stocks in the light of their huge rise and their sudden fall. In part 1 I looked at Okta, in this article, I will assess Shopify in several ways. Shopify (SHOP) was the first stock I picked in my series of Potential Multibaggers. It has been an outstanding performer since that day, May 2, 2017, beating the S&P 500 by 260%:YChartsBut just as most other SaaS stocks, Shopify is down quite a bit over the last weeks:YChartsIn this article, I want to assess Shopify. Is it still a good buy? What should you do if you have outsized returns? How should you evaluate the stock? I want to show the reader the only valuation method that makes sense to me. Therefore, I return to what I have called before the 'virtual PEG'. (Source)I think there is no discussion about the quality of Shopify. Tobi Lütke has built out his company from a small provider of software that makes it easy to set up an online shop to an omnichannel solution for small, medium and big businesses.While a lot of investors see the long-term bull case for Shopify from a qualitative side by acknowledging that it is an exceptional company with top-tier management and outstanding execution, there is often one big hurdle. A lot of investors stumble and fall over that hurdle: its valuation. Shopify has been called overvalued since it shot up 51% on the day of its IPO in May 2015, according to the experts.The revenue growth of Shopify testifies that the company is really growing like a beanstalk:YChartsWhen I saw this graph, there is already something that struck me. There are a lot of investors and pundits who claim that Shopify is in dotcom bubble territory. But the company's revenue has grown as much as the stock has since the IPO. If you look at the comparison between the revenue growth and the stock price appreciation over the last year, there seems to be a disconnection, though:YChartsThe first graph also contained the revenue from the quarter before the IPO, pulled from the S-1. If you take the same chart, but with the start date for revenue at May 21, 2015, the day of Shopify's IPO, you see that the tiny revenue pre-IPO also plays a role for Shopify:YChartsHere you can see that Shopify's stock price and revenue growth were more or less in line, with small undervaluations and a few temporary overvaluations, for about its whole time on the public market until recently. Or to put it more precise: until somewhere in April of this year. If Shopify would be around its normal price of following its revenue growth, it would be somewhere around the neighborhood of $200-$220. That means that the stock is overvalued by about 35% to 40% if you take this metric.Of course, if you look at the classic ratios, you cannot justify Shopify's stock price at all. But that has been the case since its IPO. At the current price, it has a negative P/E and a forward P/E of 350. But these numbers don't really mean anything on themselves. Shopify has such high growth that these metrics are very poor scales to value the stock against.If we look at Shopify's P/S ratio, though, we see that the company has been overvalued versus its historical P/S ratio since around April of this year too:YChartsBoth on a P/S ratio and from a stock price/revenue growth perspective, Shopify seems overvalued since April-May. I can stand a bit of overvaluation, especially in stocks that I have a low cost basis for, as with Shopify ($81). But nevertheless, I sold first a third of my shares and later even about 60%:(Source: From the author's Twitter page)The stock has continued its upward climb since I sold my first batch of shares and it was up almost 40% at a certain moment, although it has come down considerably since that peak:YChartsI don't mind that I have lost some upside, though. It had become a large percentage of my portfolio. If I feel comfortable with the price, I can stand up to a 20% allocation for a stock, but in this case, I thought I had to sell. Long-term I still believe in Shopify, but its price has to come down before I would consider investing again. The reason I don't sell all of my shares? Well, a stock can be overvalued for a very, very long time or could go sideways and grow into its valuation. Besides that, with my cost base of $81, I don't see Shopify drop below that.The story of Amazon (AMZN) has always been that the company could be profitable anytime it wanted. It just needed scale and therefore it kept investing. And investors who have kept beating this drum have been proven right: as we all know, Amazon has been an amazing investment. The question is in this context of course if Shopify is like Amazon at this point.We'll have a look at Amazon's revenue and expenses over the last decade:YChartsRevenue and expenses are completely in sync with each other. But if you look at profitability, you see a different picture:YChartsThe earnings growth number was very close to zero percent until very recently. A lot of investors will point to AWS as Amazon's big source of earnings growth and, of course, they are right. But at the same time, AWS is just a consequence of Amazon's business model. The company noted that it had excess capacity in cloud storage and, voilà, a new source of income, and a very profitable one, was born.At the same time, AWS is still a smaller contributor to Amazon's total revenue:(Source)But of course, AWS is a big source of operating income, almost as big as Amazon's North American business:(Source: Amazon's most recent Form-10Q)Amazon is the example here. Let's look at what Shopify has done.You can see that Shopify's revenue and expenses walk in lockstep exactly the way Amazon's has done:YChartsNow if you look at the expenses, you see that most of them are because of sales and marketing:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Of all the expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 (the third column), almost exactly half ($224,232M out of $460,466M) was for sales and marketing. R&D also took a big chunk with about 35% of the total expenses. These expenses are typically very high for companies that are in high-growth. If the company becomes more mature and the revenue growth slows down, these are the first things management looks at to cut costs. For now, we want Shopify to do these expenses.Let's have a look at Amazon's numbers around the year 2000, for example. We see that the sales and marketing expenses of Amazon as a percentage of its revenue dropped significantly during the dotcom drop:These expenses are both necessary and adaptable. I think it is fair to say here that Shopify could cut them anytime it wanted and be much more profitable. Of course, that would come at the expense of growth and that would not be a good thing at this point.For the third assessment of Shopify, let's look at it from another point of view again, from the perspective that Shopify has become a mature company. This may take a decade and probably even longer, but I always invest for the very long term.At this moment, Shopify projects revenue between $1.51B and $1.53B. Mostly Shopify beats expectations, so let's take the higher point here: $1.53B. There are 112,013,409M shares outstanding, according to the last 6-K. But, as most will know, Shopify has announced an offering of 1.9M shares to raise capital a few days ago. So, the number will be approximately 114M shares outstanding. 12.3M of these are B shares, with multiple votes, which are reserved for insiders. But we won't take this fact into account and just follow the rules.With a revenue of $1.53B, that means a revenue of $13.42 per share. The gross profit margin of Shopify was 56.6% in Q2 2019. Gross margins will never be net profit margins, of course. But Shopify's gross margin (or net profit margin) will never be like Amazon's, because Amazon is a 1P seller, which means it has a huge revenue for this, but a very low profit margin. Shopify's will be much higher.So, how high will the profit margin of Shopify be once it is (more) mature? That is always a guess, of course, but you can make it a guesstimate by looking at more mature SaaS companies like Adobe (ADBE) and Intuit (INTU). Adobe's operating margin came in at 27.4% last quarter and that of Intuit was 27.3% for its last fiscal year.If you project Shopify's revenue growth of the next decade, which will inevitably decrease as the numbers grow, this could give us a guesstimate for the next decade:(compiled by the author)Suppose Shopify has a profit margin of 25% by 2028, this would add up to earnings of $4.24B. We don't know how many shares will be outstanding by then. But let's take a yearly growth of 2%. Although I certainly hope it is less, but I think this is more or less realistic. That would add up to about 140M shares. $4.24B of operating income could translate in about $3.2B of net income (depending on a whole lot of elements, of course). That would add up to EPS of $22.86. With Shopify's current stock price of $328.82 (at the close of Tuesday, September 17), that is a 10-year forward P/E of 14.38.When I did this exercise less than a year ago, in November 2018, when I wrote my article Shopify: A Valuation Guide, the 10-year forward P/E came in at just 6.31. That means that Shopify has become a lot more expensive versus its intrinsic value. I think this comes as no big surprise to those who follow the stock.Just as a reference: Coca-Cola (KO) is expected to have earnings of $2.29 next year and is projected to grow by 5.20% over the next five years, according to finviz.com. If you stretch that to 10 years, EPS will be $3.80 in a decade, which, with a price of $54.24, adds up to a 10-year forward P/E of 14.27. McDonald's (MCD)? 12.48. Procter & Gamble (PG)? 11.60.Now I know that there are a lot of ifs and assumptions here, on all sides of the equation. For example, I think that the revenue growth I used is very optimistic. Next year, analysts expect 35% growth instead of 43%. But I have taken higher numbers because Shopify is a serial overdeliverer. Companies as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Proctor & Gamble are much more predictable, though, and therefore they deserve a premium valuation. If you pay the current price of $328 for Shopify, you should believe that the company can either keep up a premium valuation for a very long time (which is not unreasonable as long as the results keep coming) or that the company will have higher revenue or higher EPS.When Shopify's 10-year forward P/E came in at 6.31 in my last valuation, I called it cheap and I was happy to buy, although back then, there were lots of investors and pundits calling out that it was so overvalued. It was at $141 then, almost 60% lower than now.Let's assess Shopify differently in one other way, which I have dubbed the 'virtual PEG' last year. It has fewer assumptions: let's take the final net profit margin of 25% and apply it to the revenue projection of 2019: $1.53B. That would add up to $382.5 in profits. With the future number of outstanding shares (after the sale of the additional shares) of 114M, that would be EPS of $3.36. With the current stock price of about $328.82, this would mean a P/E ratio of 97.9. This is still very high. But let's look at the virtual PEG by adding the growth of Shopify to the equation. That growth is expected at about 35%. That means that the 'virtual PEG' comes in at 2.8, which is overvalued by any measure. In November 2018, it was just 1.In my first article on Shopify, dating back to May 2017, when I introduced the stock in my series of Potential Multibaggers, I said that high growth companies need to be looked at from a qualitative point of view.In my second article on Shopify, I connected the company with a trend in society: rising rates of entrepreneurship as a reaction to the outsourcing of more and more jobs, not only industrial, but also in services.In my third article, Shopify: A Valuation Guide, I tried to pierce through the curtain to the numbers. The curtain, in this case, is that Shopify is growing so fast that it is impossible to apply traditional metrics, just as it has been impossible for Amazon or Netflix (NFLX) for a very long time. My conclusion then was that the company was still cheap for its growth at $141.In this article, I did this exercise again. But while my conclusion in November 2018 was that Shopify was still cheap, my conclusion is now that it is too expensive. With a 'virtual PEG' of 2.8, versus 1 in November 2018, and a '10-year forward P/E' of 14.38, versus 6.31 in November 2018, I think it is fair to say that Shopify's shares are overvalued now.Valuation is always a guessing game, no matter what some believe. That also means that I leave room for rounding errors of 25%, even with optimistic assumptions. But Shopify is overvalued by 35% to 40% at least at this point, in my opinion. That is why I have reduced my stake by 60%.Now, of course, it is not possible to predict the future accurately. But I wanted to present a more accurate valuation for Shopify than the traditional ratios, which have been proven wrong again and again. I hope I have succeeded in my attempt.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective and updates about Shopify, please hit the follow button next to my name.In the meantime: keep growing!P.S.

4264278,86786,2019-05-15T12:27:04-04:00,"Shopify's growth story is one without a bleeding balance sheet, yet investors are asking when this growth story will become an earnings story.Despite astounding merchant acquisition success, Morgan Stanley downgraded SHOP, causing the stock to dip.My statistical analysis on the stock's price action and my sentiment analysis on management's forward-looking statements show that the stock should continue upward over the next quarter, at least.","Shopify (SHOP) has undergone a great rally over the past four months, to the tune of 76%, and many are asking when the top will be in. From a business cycle perspective, as we near the end of the expansion phase, tech stocks such as SHOP should begin to slightly underperform. From this perspective, and with SHOP’s rally seemingly overdone, we should be eyeing that top:But SHOP’s revenue growth is showing no sign of slowing. With the company’s strong customer acquisition results, SHOP has now a total of 800,000 vendors, an increase of 25% over the past year. That increase in vendor numbers correlates exactly with the company’s yearly revenue increase: 25%, beating the IT market by 15%.Growth stocks like these typically grow via debt. Yet, the company has under $300M in long-term and short-term liabilities. Its assets are 21x its debt:(Source: Simply Wall St)The company’s growth in terms of client acquisition and revenue is indisputably astounding. Yet, this room has an elephant. Investors are concerned with SHOP’s ability to convert this into profitability.This is where the SHOP bulls and bears hit a real division. One outlook is that SHOP is digging itself a hole: The company might be growing its base, but that base contains considerable churn, which does not result in profit but does come at a cost, namely marketing and commissions. The other outlook is that SHOP is acting like a venture capitalist: Many of its acquired shops will fail, but those that do find success will be producing revenue according to a power law (or Pareto distribution – think fat tails), thus justifying the large expense to acquire these clients.I am not about to tell you which way of thinking is correct; only future earnings will answer that. For now, your choice is to hang on and wait or to get out while SHOP is at or near its top. I prefer the statistical method, which is to convert the data I have available into a prediction.With SHOP’s volatility spiking, especially after yesterday’s downgrade from Morgan Stanley, I think we should start with an analysis of SHOP’s price action. I ran a Markov chain model over the stock’s price movement to find that the best time to buy is on down gaps, as these produce an expected return of $2.87 during the day after the gap. Down gaps fill 80% of the time.Up gaps are the next best, but they lead to reversals almost half of the time (reward is still higher than the risk). This is because the “dumb money” tends to buy SHOP when it opens higher. The smart money tends to sell SHOP after the stock overextends itself during the day:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)The obvious day-trading strategy here is to buy SHOP on down gaps and hold until the first white candlestick, at which point you take your profit, waiting for the next down gap. Overall, the price action shows a strong dip-buying habit in SHOP traders and investors. Profit-taking tends to occur only on big jumps.For a longer-term analysis, SHOP seems to be moving in line with its management sentiment. SHOP’s management has shown slightly below-average (roughly one-third below the market average) sentiment up to Q4, 2018, at which point, sentiment jumped 160%. Sentiment remained the same quarter over quarter, as per my financial lexical analysis of the company’s earnings calls:(Source: Stockcharts.com)The recent earnings call shows that management sentiment is still highly positive. This predicts excess returns over the coming quarter. For some insight into management optimism, we check some of the statements flagged by my sentiment analysis:(Source: Shopify)Overall, SHOP’s sentiment shift seems to be one of excitement in a new growth phase. As its US side of the business is streamlined, the company can repeat its growth phase abroad. This would give us a “phase 2” of the growth we have seen over the past few years, supporting the bullish thesis.The main fears at present are the same fears for any growth stock: Is growth enough? Will the company be able to convert that growth into real earnings? In addition, some are fearful of the US-China trade war, and with a large proportion of Shopify merchants sourcing from the Chinese manufacturing sector, this could be a legitimate fear.However, these fears are currently unquantifiable, while the growth trends are quantifiable. At least for the coming quarter, SHOP should see continued growth, especially abroad. I do not think the growth story is in trouble, at least for the next couple quarters, analyst downgrades be damned.If you are to ask “long/short” at this point, most signs point to “long.” If you really think SHOP is overextended, perhaps buy carefully. Options can help here; I recommend a broken wing butterfly with puts, with a long call tagged on for a conservative way to play SHOP in the long direction:This strategy is of roughly 100 delta. However, the strategy is opened at parity (roughly); the broken wing butterfly spread finances the long call. Essentially, you are mimicking holding 100 shares of SHOP at no cost and lowered risk.You can roll the long call over weekly, and depending on market conditions.

Source: CrunchbaseAccording to a market research report by Forrester Research, the B2B market in the US was valued at $5.1 trillion in 2012 and expected to reach $9 trillion by 2018.This represents a CAGR of 9.8% between 2012 and 2018, as shown by the graphic below:The segment of SaaS e-procurement systems that operate outside of a network was expected to reach $834 billion, growing at the fastest CAGR of 37.7% during the same period.Shopify didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms, didn’t publish a regulatory filing or provide a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent financial filing indicates that as of March 31, 2019, SHOP had $2.0 billion in cash and marketable securities and $275 million in total liabilities.Free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was $14.8 million.In the past 12 months, SHOP’s stock price has risen 72.26% vs. Square’s (SQ) rise of 2.67%, as the chart below indicates:Source: SentieoEarnings surprises have been positive in all of the last 12 quarters as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst sentiment in recent earnings calls has been reversing its previous downward trend:Source: SentieoSHOP acquired Handshake to bolster its wholesale B2B offering.As the Techcrunch report stated,Shopify Plus is the firm’s offering to create a ‘seamless, buy anywhere’ platform for small and medium businesses to handle a variety of sourcing and marketing under one system.The Handshake deal should fit nicely into that system and add wholesale-specific capabilities. I imagine the deal was valued on a ‘buy vs. build’ analysis and was likely for well under $100 million in consideration.SHOP acquiring Handshake is part of an ongoing trend that I’m seeing in enterprise ecommerce, that of software providers seeking to operate more of the value stack, whether through building or buying.As enterprise IT becomes more complex and global, buyers are seeking more integrated systems to reduce that complexity as much as possible. Many small and mid-sized firms have dozens of IT vendors and the ability to provide an integrated system is an important selling point.Additionally, having multiple capabilities enables vendors to retain pricing power against larger players who can bundle solutions into a larger relationship.I expect more deals like these as enterprise e-commerce continues to gain a larger share of the total commerce market in the years ahead."
4259026,102646,2019-05-02T11:06:01-04:00,"Shopify is the best e-commerce platform in the world with 800K+ users.
        Stock has gained by 600%+ since its IPO.
        Room for more growth is limited.","Shopify (SHOP) has been one of the best-performing stock in the past few years. YTD, the stock has gained by 63%, which is much higher than the growth of its closest peers. Since its IPO, the stock has gained by more than 600% and the company’s valuation stands at more than $25 billion. Investors have cheered the company’s record of beating earnings and revenues and also the growth of its users. It is also a well-run company, with the CEO being the founder. While there is a lot of good things happening with SHOP, I believe that the company is now priced to perfection. As such, the risks for being long the company at the current valuations outweigh the rewards.To starters, Shopify is a Canadian technology company that allows people from around the world to create powerful e-commerce websites and apps. The company charges these customers a monthly fee that starts at $29. Its most advanced suite costs $299 a month. In addition to these charges, the company generates revenues from the payment processing service and the theme marketplace. To date, more than 800K companies use Shopify’s products.The value offered by Shopify is immense, especially to small companies that don’t have the budget of hiring a large team of developers. For $29 a month, the people can run their e-commerce stores without caring about the backend. Instead, they can focus on developing their products and serving their customers. For Shopify, the value is that once a customer subscribes, it will be almost impossible to switch to other platforms like those offered by Adobe (ADBE), Square (SQ), SquareSpace, and Wix (WIX) among others.In a recent presentation, Andrew Left wrote about the key challenges he believes will affect the company. He talked about the planned entry by Microsoft (MSFT) in the space, the Instagram buy button, and the end of its relationship with MailChimp. I don’t believe that these reasons are good enough. For example, I found the reports that Microsoft was considering a competing product a bit laughable because I don’t believe it will succeed. The market is already mature and has decided that SHOP is the way to go. Similarly, I don’t believe that Instagram’s button will have any negative implication on the company because the two products can supplement one another.My only issue with SHOP is that it is currently priced to perfection. While this happens to all fast-growing SAAS companies, I believe that SHOP has gone too far. Consider this, in the past 12 months, the company reported revenues of $1.07 billion. This revenue has grown from just $205 million in 2015. This year, it is expected to grow to $1.4 billion. This is a very good growth rate, and one that warrants a premium valuation. The growth in revenues has also happened at a time when the net losses have been increasing. Last year, it reported a total net loss of $64 million, which was higher than the $18 million it generated in 2015.The lack of present profitability is an issue that investors should not ignore. The same is true with the future profitability. In 2018, the company had gross profit margins of 55.5%, which was lower than the 2017 margin of 56%. In future, as the company becomes a more mature, the profit margin could match that of Adobe (ADBE), which is at 25%. According to Dilantha De Silva, it could take at least ten years before the company’s margins get to this level. If it’s revenue will have reached $3 billion in the next ten years, its net income – based on a 25% profit margin – will be $750 million. By dividing this with the current valuation of $25 billion, you get that the company is trading at 33x the net income of the next ten years. This is based on a best-case scenario that it can more than double its revenues in this period.When you compare the company’s forward EV to EBITDA, you find that it is trading at 426x. This is much higher than that of the other fast-growing SAAS companies like Etsy (ETSY), Veeva (VEEV), ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLNK), and Square (SQ).Its forward PS ratio is also higher than that of its closest SAAS peers.This pricey valuation even as its revenue growth continues to decline as shown below.When companies get this overvalued, bad things do happen in future when this growth ends. Other than valuation, I believe that the company faces two big challenges.First, I believe that the increased competition in the industry will prevent many new customers from using SHOP’s products. As mentioned, the pricing of SHOP starts at $29. On the other hand, the e-commerce products of Wix (WIX) starts at just $17 while that of Weebly, which is owned by Square starts at just $25. This means that SHOP will have a challenge increasing prices as it has done before.Second, I believe that the runway for growth for SHOP’s products is short. This is because most large companies like Nike (NIKE) and Budweiser (BUD) already use Shopify. Other large brands like Adidas, Lululemon (LULU) already use other platforms for their e-commerce solutions. These large brands are much better than small startups because they tend to spend more and their businesses have less chances of failing. In fact, since most companies that use SHOP are relatively new and tend to fail. A previous report showed that this churn is about 77%.Similarly, many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that don’t use SHOP already use other companies like Woocommerce, BigCommerce, and Wix. Therefore, since it has taken 15 years to get to more than 700k users, I see the path to doubling this number being significantly long especially at a time when competition is increasing.TakeawayMy wife, who runs a small e-commerce company, has been a Shopify user for more than three years. She is among the thousands of users who have been pleased using the platform and has resisted jumping ship to other cheaper alternatives. Based on her reviews and those of the other users, I believe that the product is genuinely good. As explained above, the biggest issue right now is that its valuation has been a bit stretched. As a growth company, investors might ignore the valuation for now, but in future they will. For these reasons, I recommend avoiding the company for now."

Now at $260 it is, but it is not out of whack as some seem to think.This continues to be one of the best stocks to hold for the very long term.","On April 30, 2019, Shopify (SHOP) announced its Q1 2019 earnings pre-market.(Image Source)The company is a serial over-deliverer, with positive earnings surprises in every quarter. You can see this on the chart provided by Zacks: every single arrow is green, indicating beats.And yes, a new green arrow could be added to the graph: the company did it again, beating the expectations on all metrics. The non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.09, beating estimates by a whopping $0.14. Revenue in Q1 2019 was $320.48 million, up 49.5% YoY, also beating estimates, by $10.37 million.The stock price shot up after the earnings:Data by YChartsAnd yes, there were many discussions again about the valuation of Shopify. These two comments on the article of my fellow Contributor Crispus Nyaga sum the two sides up:In May 2017, I added Shopify as the first stock to my Potential Multibaggers - a series that still runs - and for a first pick, it couldn't have done better, since it has gone from a Potential Multibagger to a real multibagger in just two years:Data by YChartsI remember that Shopify was called a bubble stock too back then. And that is still the case.In this article, I will give a closer look at the earnings and why the stock appears more expensive than it is. I also explain why the most-cited bear argument, churn really doesn't matter. The key? To make my own variation on that famous quote: it's the ecosystem, stupid! That is the real power of Shopify. But before we go into that, we start with a quick take on the Q1 2019 earnings.Shopify has had a huge run-up year to date:Data by YChartsThe company announced its Q1 2019 earnings before the market opened on April 30, 2019. And again, as I have become accustomed to from Shopify, the results were great, blowing expectations out of the water. Revenue grew by 49.5% YoY to $320.48 million, a beat by $10.37 million. This was a great result, since bears had been pounding on the table for continuing slowdown of revenue growth.The operating loss was just $1.4 million, versus the expected $13 million the company guided for at the low end. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.09 beat by a whopping $0.14 (the analysts' consensus was a loss of $0.05) and were up 125% YoY.Shopify was able to grow both of its businesses: the subscription revenue and merchant solutions. The subscription revenue is what merchants pay to be able to use Shopify's platform in the form of a monthly fee, starting at $29 per month for a basic plan. Those subscriptions' revenue was up 40% YoY. The MRR (monthly recurring revenue) is up 36%. This is a very important business because the margins are extremely high. But the merchant business grew a lot more, and it is the future of Shopify. More about that later.I see a lot of head-scratching when it comes to Shopify. A lot of investors don't seem to understand the story. Shopify is not just a platform. It has transformed into a whole ecosystem.There are literally thousands of apps that can help you build out your Shopify store. 200 were added in Q1 2019 alone. Those apps really lift the Shopify experience. About a quarter of them are free, the rest are paying. They fall into several categories, of which the most popular are store design, sales and conversion, marketing, orders and shipping and customer support:(Source: Indie Hackers, November 5, 2018)On each sale of an app, Shopify takes a 20% or 30% cut (depending on the location). And the average prices are higher than you probably think:(Source: Indie Hackers, November 5, 2018) On the Q1 2019 earnings call, Harley Finkelstein, Shopify's COO, explained how fast this app store is developing:And that is just one part of merchant solutions. The whole system is growing like a weed. This is what Amy Shapiro, Shopify's CFO, had to say on the call about merchant solutions:But she started with this statement:And indeed, Shopify is diversifying away from a platform to a whole ecosystem in which a merchant has all the solutions he or she can dream of. If you are not convinced that there is a huge opportunity in this area, just look at the growth rates. Again, Amy Shapiro on the Q1 2019 earnings call:Shopify's COO, Harley Finkelstein, added:Shopify Shipping could offer lower prices in Q1, which boosted its use, of course, and Shopify Capital reached a milestone: $500 million in accumulative loans have been granted to merchants now. Shopify Capital is a new system, and I think it is very promising. Unlike for a traditional banking loan, for Shopify Capital you don't have to pay monthly installments. You pay a percentage of your store’s future daily sales until you have paid off the total amount that you have received from Shopify. Your risk level is calculated to grant the loan.All of these merchant solutions have huge growth left. They all contribute to the ecosystem that the company is building. Too many investors still think that Shopify is only about subscription, and that is the reason it keeps talking about churn. I think that discussion is outdated by the constant innovations that Shopify keeps adding to the ecosystem.And the pace of innovation isn't slowing down. Besides the software, the Shopify Shipping, Shopify Payments, Shopify Studios and Shopify Capital, the Canadian company also added point-of-sale hardware to better support its merchants. (Shopify's Tap & Chip reader)Shopify has seen what Amazon (AMZN) has seen too. The future of retail is not purely online e-commerce, it is multichannel. That is one of the reasons that Amazon has bought Whole Foods.Since traditional retail is not going anywhere soon, but is rather becoming a sort of central hub for the multi-platform selling strategy, the company introduced the Shopify Tap & Chip Reader at the end of 2018. The Shopify reader accepts contactless ""tap"" payments (for example, Apple Pay or Google Pay) and chip credit cards.While that may be the most visible new feature for customers, for merchants there have been introduced a wide range of new features over the last years: new multi-location inventory features (Shopify Locations), Shopify Returns and Exchanges (which deals with cheap returns and exchanges of products bought at a Shopify POS), Store Switcher (to handle multiple stores easier), Shopify Flow (an integration tool to connect apps and automate repetitive tasks), Fraud Protect, a tipping feature, new marketing capabilities, a retargeting tool, iPad stands etc. Shopify keeps rolling out new solutions for merchants at an unseen pace.All of these solutions tie the merchants to Shopify's ecosystem, and they strengthen one another. And exactly that is the power that the company has. I think that in the future there will only be three big platforms for independent sellers, apart from niches such as Etsy's (ETSY). The other two will be Adobe's Magento (ADBE) and Square (SQ), which is building out its merchant solutions at a very high pace too, apart from Shopify. Of those three, I would argue that Shopify clearly has the lead in terms of the ecosystem at this moment. You also see that Square and Shopify start to come closer to each other: Shopify with its reader, Square with its acquisition of Weebly. I am a proud shareholder of both, since I think the market opportunity is more than big enough to make both very big. Square has been a recent pick in the Potential Multibaggers series too.There is no doubt that Shopify is on a winning streak in the scaling game. Once a customer is into the Shopify environment, the upscaling cycle can take place, although you don't want to do that too bluntly. You have to look at Customer Lifetime Value, or CLV. Once somebody deserves money with Shopify, he or she will be open to upgrade to a more expensive product and earn even more or have more services. And that is the reason why the whole discussion about ""churn"" (the number of clients that leave because they have an unsuccessful shop) is futile.The high growth of all of Shopify's metrics burns bears and their ""churn"" refrain. To make it clear: Shopify doesn't make churn figures publicly, but there is a lot of chitchat about churn. A lot of Shopify bears claim that the number of merchants that give up prematurely is a huge problem for Shopify. I don't think it is a problem at all.Suppose you have 10 merchants and you can only keep 5, but those 5 do not only stay very loyal clients but buy upscale after upscale and they make more and more money, of which you can take a share, can you explain the problem exactly? The ones that fall out of the boat are the ones you don't want, since they are not monetizable. It is as if the weeding of the garden is done automatically. Who wouldn't want that?Oh, and just for the record, I think the churn is actually a lot less than 5 out of 10. I think 2 or 3 out of 10 will be closer to the real number. But my point is: it's not the number of customers that counts, it's the money that they bring in. Just look at the names that were added to Shopify Plus in the first quarter of this year alone:I think it is time for bears to ditch the churn argument. It has been proven wrong again and again. The discussion between bears and bull often turns around Shopify's churn, but I think this is a really sterile discussion. It is the money that is brought in by those who don't leave that counts, not the academic discussion about churn. Churn numbers are very important for businesses that don't offer extra products to existing clients. Clearly, that is not Shopify.What is often overlooked by investors is that management is a force that is extremely important in any company. And I think that it is not stressed enough in analysis of stocks. A visionary CEO, like Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Howard Schultz and many others, is an element that you cannot put into numbers but that is so important in investing.Shopify has got a great management team. There is, of course, the visionary leader Tobi Lütke, who founded Shopify because he was not satisfied with the existing solutions. He wanted to sell his snowboards online and developed a solution which he thought was better than the existing ones. And Lütke is a great leader, both hyper-focused and laidback at the same time. You should hear him talking about gathering money from venture capitalists riding his bike from one posh VC office to the next on The Tim Ferriss Show.(Source)In the podcast, you get to hear Lütke when he is at ease. After all, he is still the nerdy programmer who is rather shy and was more or less forced to become the CEO of his own company. But he has known Ferriss for quite a few years, and here he is less shy because of that. Recommendable!For most companies, a visionary CEO is enough to have great success. But often, there is a second person. Steve Jobs had Steve Wozniak and later Tim Cooke, Mark Zuckerberg has Sheryl Sandberg, Warren Buffett has Charlie Munger. In Shopify, Lütke has his COO, Harley Finkelstein.(Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein, Source)He is an entrepreneur and lawyer. He's Canadian, and at 17 founded his first company - a T-shirt company - while he was at university. But he himself talks about DJing as his first streak of entrepreneurship.First he got a degree in economics, and then went on to study for his MBA and Juris Doctor. He had worked for a law firm for one year when he met Tobi Lütke in 2009, and soon joined Shopify as its Chief Platform Officer. Since January 2016, he has been the COO of Shopify. He is also on the Board of Directors of the Canadian television channel CBC, after he was one of the Dragons in Dragon's Den, the Canadian version of Shark Tank.Unlike Tobi Lütke, who is shy of nature, Finkelstein is a more outgoing speaker. If you want to see him in action, I would advise you to take a look at this interview.I think Finkelstein a great complimentary force for Lütke. Their personalities differ enough to have a broader perspective and to get Shopify where it wants to be. It is no coincidence that Finkelstein, and not Lütke, does most of the conference calls. Only if there is a technical question or something about the future of Shopify, Lütke joins in.In April 2018, Amy Shapero became Shopify's Chief Financial Officer. Before Shopify, she already had ample experience as CFO in several other companies. I really like women in top management functions, and particularly as CFOs. In general, women are a little bit less risk-prone than men, a bit more cautious, and I think that is mostly a very good thing, especially when finances are in the picture.The most important thing is that management has instilled a clear purpose instilled in the company. The mission was spoken out by CFO Amy Shapero on the Q1 2019 earnings call:Purpose-driven companies always outperform, in my experience.A lot of investors seem to have difficulties with the company's valuation. I have argued before (when the price was $141) that it was not overvalued. If you look at the classic ratios, you cannot justify Shopify's stock price, of course. $261.51 (at the moment of writing, before the markets open on, Thursday, May 9): a negative P/E, a forward P/E of 310 and a P/S of 26.5. Now, I won't argue that the company is not fully valued now, unlike just half a year ago.But let's look at it from another point of view, from the perspective that Shopify has become a mature company. This may take a decade, and maybe more, since the company plows back all the money it earns back into the business to continue the ultra-high growth. But I always invest for the very long term, so I don't mind.At this moment, Shopify projects revenue of around $1.5 billion for this fiscal year. Mostly Shopify beats expectations, but let's just take that $1.5 billion. There are 108.99 million shares outstanding. That is a revenue of $13.76 per share.The gross profit margins are around 55%. Once the company becomes mature, net profit margins will rise too. Bigger SaaS companies like Adobe and Intuit (INTU) have net profit margins of 20-30%. Suppose Shopify would have a net profit margin of 25% now. 25% of $13.76 equals EPS of $3.44. That would give Shopify a virtual P/E ratio of 74. High, but don't forget that the company is expected to grow at 40-45% next year too. When I wrote my Shopify valuation guide, that kind of ""virtual P/E"" was around 40. That was a ""virtual PEG"" of just 1. Now it is closer to 2, which means more growth has been priced into the stock. A bit expensive, but not as crazily overvalued as some investors believe. And yes, I know, there are a lot of assumptions here (whether Shopify will get to a 25% net margin, for example), but it makes more sense than judging such an ultra-growth stock by its (forward) P/E ratio.Put it in another light: e-commerce. The TAM (total addressable market) is expected to be $4,878 billion in 2021.(Source: Statista)I believe that more and more of what is now FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) will go to Shopify (and other independent platforms). Amazon (AMZN) uses the data of its users to compete against them and sell products itself if they do well.Suppose you create a new product - something that is not earth-moving, but new nonetheless. Let's say a new design for baby potties. The process of creating this is often quite expensive, complicated and time-consuming. You have to find a manufacturer, make dummies, organize the production line, pay for marketing, travel, etc.After the whole process, you start selling on Amazon (FBA). And yes, your product sells like hotcakes. Amazon sees that, and before you can say FBA, the company starts selling its own product - not similar enough to your product to sue the company, but similar enough for people to buy it. And it undercuts your price by 25% or so. If it is not Amazon itself, it will be someone else. And what do people do when they come to Amazon? They select to display the items from cheapest to more expensive. Your precious product? Forget your margins.Now, don't get me wrong. I am not an Amazon hater. To the contrary. Just as so many people, I enjoy its services and am Prime member, I have had a subscription for Audible for quite a while now (and am enjoying it!) and I am a stockholder of that great company. But from the point of view of an entrepreneur, I know which platform to choose. I think there is still an enormous margin of growth for Shopify.Internationally, the company is really only starting and has a lot of ground it can still cover. Six new languages were added in Q1 2019, including simplified Chinese and Dutch. CFO Amy Shapero said that Shopify is still in learning mode for international locations, having only started a year ago. But already more than 100,000 merchants use the platform in another language, including Chinese brands to sell internationally. To put that into perspective: that is on a total of 800,000. As a funny aside: Tobi Lütke now uses Shopify in German, sending notes to the team every now and then if some translation is not 100% natural native German. That is involvement!Shopify has delivered another whopping quarter and keeps adding more and more brands and merchants, both big and small. Shopify Plus keeps expanding. But the most important element of Shopify is the sum of its parts. The ecosystem that the company is building out more and more is unmatched, and it is the real power of Shopify. While it is fully valued after the recent run-up, I don't think it is as crazily valued as some seem to think. You just have to look at the situation of every company in detail and not apply metrics blindly for all stocks. For long-term investors, Shopify remains one of the best holdings to set and forget.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective and updates about Shopify, please hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"

However, the non-profitability of Shopify has never really waned the belief of investors who continue to bank on Shopify's ability to not only change the way retailers operate online stores forever, but also become a brand to reckon with on a global basis. Shopify has transformed itself to a billion dollar company from humble beginnings, and early investors of the company were rewarded with unbeatable returns. Shopify shares have gained more than 595% since its IPO in 2015, and is expected by many investors to perform even better in the future.(Source - Morningstar)Valuing a non-profitable company is a tricky task, as this involves a significant number of assumptions. As such, investors need to leave a handsome margin of safety when investing in companies that are being valued purely on growth prospects. Even though I find Shopify an attractive company with great growth potential, I find shares overvalued to my fair value estimate. In my opinion, the current share price of Shopify reflects the underlying growth opportunities of the company, and fails to provide a meaningful margin of safety to growth investors.Shopify is a cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform designed for small and medium enterprises. Shopify enables entrepreneurs to design, set up, and manage their stores across multiple sales channels including web, mobile, social media, marketplaces such as Amazon, and brick & motor stores. (Source - Company presentation)Shopify operates under 2 business segments.One of the key business strategies of the firm is to expand internationally, and acquire a merchant base spread across the world. This strategy can be passed on as a viable strategy moving on, as online marketplaces are gaining traction quickly in the international space, and internet penetration rates in emerging countries are expected to rise in the next several years. The absolute majority of Shopify merchants are small & medium businesses at the moment, but the company has already laid out plans to acquire enterprises into its platform. I believe Shopify's ability to attract an enterprise level customer base will be a key growth driver, as these merchants will bring millions of dollars in revenue to the company, and will improve the brand awareness of Shopify.Shopify has introduced subscription plans that suit everyone from SMBs to large retailers, and the company is dynamically changing the way it operates to support the acquisition of enterprise level merchants.(Source - Company presentation)To the credit of the management, they have identified and implemented clear strategies to acquire merchants from all levels of the business spectrum, which has already helped Shopify grow in the recent past.(Source - Company presentation)Initiatives taken by Shopify to increase the number of larger brands who partner with the company has already paid off, as several large companies have been brought on-board over the last couple of years.(Source - Company presentation)Building on its brand value is another key business strategy of the company, as a higher brand value is critical to acquire enterprise level merchants. On the other hand, this helps build competitive advantages for Shopify, as the company can slowly but surely increase its subscription rates to account for the higher brand value and brand awareness.Continuing to innovate will be a key factor that will shape the future of Shopify, as the competition in the e-commerce software industry is expected to heat up. Therefore, Shopify will have to incur millions of dollars in R&D costs over the next couple of years to ensure their market leading position remains the same, which should help sustainability of revenue and eventually profits. I expect to see high-tech driven innovative features to be added to Shopify's platforms over the next few years, and the company will probably focus on providing more automated solutions to ensure switching costs rise for merchants.A major strength of Shopify is the convenience it provides merchants by enabling sales through multi-channels, and this will remain to be a key driver of revenue growth for Shopify in the next couple of years. In order to provide a more streamlined service to both merchants and customers, Shopify has continued to invest in businesses that add value to the platform. These inorganic growth measures have boosted the appeal of Shopify as a sales platform, and the company will continue to look for such opportunities in the future.(Source - Crunchbase)The retail e-commerce sales are expected to grow over the next couple of years as well, on the backdrop of strong growth seen over the last 5 years. The stellar growth expected in e-commerce sales will boost the growth of the industry, and the market share of online sales is expected to gain on a global basis.Retail e-commerce sales projection(Source - Statista)Research & Development (R&D) spending is expected to grow on an industry-wide basis, which will remain a feature of the e-commerce industry as industry players are always on the lookout to improve the online buying and selling experience of customers and merchants. Failure to develop innovative, time-saving products will result in a loss of market share for e-commerce players. As such, I expect a ramp up in R&D spending across all major players of the industry in the next couple of years, as competition levels increase and companies try to hold on to their market share.Mobile payments are also gaining traction in the online payment space, and providing a robust experience to both shoppers and merchants to complete mobile payments will be a key development in 2019 and beyond in the e-commerce industry.If we consider the retail industry as a whole, 2019 is set to become a transitional year for many players in the industry, as strong growth is expected in online retail activities. Acquiring a customer base on an international basis will remain a driver of the industry, as regions outside the U.S. are expected to show strong growth in 2019 and beyond, as many emerging countries are experiencing growth in internet penetration and average wealth is on the rise.(Source - Internet World Stats)As internet users grow on a global basis, e-commerce will gain more traction as consumers would be inclined to purchase from online stores more, which would drive the demand for goods and services on online platforms.The rise of digital entrepreneurs and the work-from-home culture is also a driving force behind the growth of the e-commerce industry. Unlike a couple of decades back, many entrepreneurs are focused on digital start-ups, and the costs involved to become a digital entrepreneur is considerably lower than to become a traditional entrepreneur.Concepts such as dropshipping has already taken entrepreneurship to another level in the last several years, and is expected to disrupt the investment space for many years to come. Dropshipping basically allows individuals to start a profitable business within a few hours, and it takes a very small investment to get started with the business venture.The rate of self-employment has improved over the last several years, and I believe this is a secular trend that will continue to drive the e-commerce industry forward, as more and more professionals are looking for ways to retire on self-made income.Self-employed rate as a percentage of total employed(Source - World Bank)A slowdown in global economic growth will have adverse effects on the e-commerce industry, but I believe industry growth prospects far outweigh the risks, and is set to continue its growth for many more years to come.Overall, the industry outlook for e-commerce is promising, and growth opportunities will be readily available for companies in this space. Even though the industry has come a long way since its humble beginnings a couple of decades back, I believe there is a long way for the industry to go.2018 marked another important year for Shopify as the company crossed $1 billion in revenue in FY2018. (Source - Author prepared based on data from company filings)Not only has the subscription base grown exponentially over the last 5 years, but merchant solutions segment has also reported stellar performance over the same period. Shopify offers services such as payment solutions (Shopify Payments), shipping (Shopify Shipping), and working capital financing solutions (Shopify Capital), which have all given a boost to its revenue generated from the merchant solutions segment. Revenue breakdown by segment(Source - Company filings)Shopify is focused on building its eco-system further by introducing more apps, themes, and other options to improve the functionality of the platform, which is expected to drive the user experience, and along with it, company revenues.Profit margins of the company has remained flat over the last several years, and gross margins from the subscription solutions segment is expected to grow in FY2019, as the cloud migration was successfully completed in 2018.Profit margins (%)(Source - Author prepared based on data from company filings)However, margins might come under pressure as the lower margin merchant solutions segment gains traction and contributes more to company revenues.Research and Development (R&D) costs are expected to rise in the future, as the company invests for its future. As Shopify plans to expand internationally, costs will remain higher throughout the next couple of years, and will put further pressure on margins.As total revenues increase at a spectacular rate in the next couple of years, I believe in the possibility of an uptick in operating leverage stemming from sales and marketing activities.Free cash flow remains negative at this point in time, as Shopify is failing to generate sufficient operating cash flow to support its growth plans. However, an important consideration is the fact that the company carries no debt in its balance sheet, which opens many doors for the company to grow in the future. On top of this, the massive cash balance on its balance sheet is proof of the financial strength of the company. As a growth investor, nothing is more attractive than seeing a robust balance sheet in a company that is expected to grow double-digits in the near future.(Source - Author prepared based on data from company filings)There is no doubt regarding the growth potential of the company, but as investors, a fair value estimate should be arrived at to determine whether the current market price represents an accurate picture of the underlying growth expectations of Shopify.In order to arrive at a fair value estimate for Shopify, I have used a discounted cash flow model. Even though the company is making negative free cash flow at present, I believe this valuation technique provides a more conservative estimate of the fair value for Shopify.Major assumptions used in this analysis are listed below.With these assumptions, I arrive at a fair value estimate of $146.99 for Shopify, which represents a downside risk of 22% from the current market price of $189.(Source - Author's calculations)The consensus average price target for Shopify is $191.47, which is much higher than my fair value estimate, but is still failing to provide an attractive investment opportunity.(Source - Tip Ranks)The major risk that I see of investing in Shopify comes in a scenario where the company fails to attract enterprise level customers meaningfully. Even though the company has been able to gain traction by targeting small & medium businesses, this strategy would not be sufficient for the company to become a highly profitable venture.Secondly, a global economic slowdown will prompt many merchants on the platform to close-down their stores, which would lead to a massive loss in subscription revenue. On the other hand, millions of dollars spent on improving technological developments will fail to drive company revenues higher, if a global economic slowdown persists for a prolonged time period.Thirdly, many stores operating on Shopify are relying on the concept of dropshipping, and particular regulations against dropshipping or other related concepts will make it very difficult for Shopify to bear in the short-term. Lastly, Shopify share price has consistently hit new highs based on high growth expectations. A failure to maintain such a rosy outlook for future periods will result in a massive decline of share price, which might take many years to recover. Shopify has remained a massive growth story over the last half a decade, and is poised to grow exponentially over the next decade. However, I find Shopify shares representing the underlying growth opportunities at the current market price, and believe growth investors should wait for a better margin of safety, even if the best case scenario is expected to unveil."

However, this booming growth is already incorporated into market expectations, and the stock looks aggressively valued at current prices. Shopify is a great business, but the stock is not a good purchase right now.The business world is going through a massive digital transformation, and Shopify is both a major driving force in this transformation and one of the leading beneficiaries from it. The company provides an e-commerce platform that allows businesses to set up online stores to sell products through different channels.Shopify is well integrated with leading marketplaces and social media companies such as Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Facebook (FB), Instagram, Twitter (TWTR), and Pinterest (PINS). The company is also increasingly expanding into back-end services such as inventory management, shipping, and payments.This growth strategy has important benefits for Shopify. To begin with, it allows the company to generate more revenue per customer, which is a cost-efficient way to increase sales. Such as important, as Shopify gets more entrenched into its customers' operations, it increases customer loyalty and makes the company stronger from a competitive perspective.Financial performance for the first quarter of 2019 confirms that the business is firing on all cylinders.It's not just that Shopify is growing at full speed, the company is also outperforming market expectations, which is a powerful tailwind for the stock price. Current market prices are reflecting a particular set of expectations about the future of a business. If the company can significantly outperform those expectations, this generally means that the stock price will tend to rise in order to reflect rising expectations about performance going forward.Shopify has exceeded revenue expectations in each and every quarter since the second quarter of 2015.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialLooking at earnings numbers, Shopify has also consistently outperformed expectations over time.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialShopify's impeccable track record of performance is quite extraordinary, especially since the company operates in a very dynamic and always-changing industry. This clearly speaks well about management and its ability to underpromise and overdeliver consistently.On the other hand, a high bar is hard to beat. As earnings expectations continue raising for Shopify, it will be increasingly difficult for the company to continue beating those expectations by a wide margin in the future.Valuation can be complicated for a high growth business such as Shopify. Since the company is aggressively reinvesting for growth, current earnings numbers are underestimating the company's long-term earnings generation capabilities. Nevertheless, the stock still looks quite expensive when looking at metrics such as revenue.At a price to sales ratio above 25, Shopify is trading at a massive valuation premium. As a reference, the average company in the sector trades at a much lower price to sales ratio of 2.72. Shopify obviously deserves an above-average valuation because of the company's superior growth rates, but the magnitude of the valuation premium looks concerning.The chart below compares the price to sales ratio of Shopify versus other successful high growth companies in software and business services such as Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM), Square (SQ), and Workday (WDAY). Even amongst the most successful companies in related industries, it's hard to find stocks carrying a price to sales ratio above 20.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialShopify stock also looks quite expensive by historical standards, as the price to sales ratio is currently at record levels. In most cases, valuation levels tend to decline as a company gains size over the years, because growth decelerates as the business matures.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialShopify's performance is impressive for a company of its size, but this does not change the fact that revenue growth rates are decelerating. This is perfectly natural and even to be expected, but it's still concerning to see the price to sales ratio expanding while revenue growth is slowing down.Data by YChartsWhen it comes to valuing a high growth company such as Shopify, it makes sense to consider growth in the valuation equation. The price to earnings growth (PEG) ratio, which is calculated by taking the traditional PE ratio and dividing it by expected earnings growth rates, can be particularly valuable in these cases.Shopify is currently trading at an adjusted PEG ratio of 13.18 versus 1.67 for the average company in the sector, so including growth expectations in the valuation ratios does not change the fact that the stock is priced at very demanding levels.A company with strong financial performance and accelerating momentum obviously deserves a higher valuation than a business producing mediocre performance and declining momentum. This is beyond discussion, but sometimes, it can be challenging to incorporate the multiple factors into the analysis in order to see the complete picture from a quantitative perspective.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative investing system available to members in The Data Driven Investor. This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to a combination of factors such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength. The backtested performance numbers show that companies with high PowerFactors rankings tend to deliver superior returns over the long term.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123Shopify has a PowerFactors ranking of 67.59 as of the time of this writing. This is above average, but still not particularly high. In general, focusing on companies with a PowerFactors ranking above 80 provides a stronger edge for investors.Shopify looks mostly strong in terms of financial quality (56.56), fundamental momentum (94.79), and relative strength (97.57). However, the stock has a notoriously low ranking in terms of valuation at 1.03, which means that Shopify is in the bottom 1% of stocks in the US market when considering valuation attractiveness. Even for such a strong business, valuation is a major red flag when considering a position in Shopify stock.Shopify is a spectacular growth business and a great name to follow closely. If the stock pulls back in the middle term, this could present a buying opportunity for investors. However, at current prices, valuation is just too aggressive. Patience is not only a virtue, but sometimes even a necessity, and the risk versus reward trade-off in Shopify stock does not look particularly attractive right now."
4240472,100666,2019-02-13T06:41:05-05:00,"Shopify reported earnings premarket on Tuesday February 12, and the company beat all expectations again.The stock price fell considerably, but then ended in the green at the end of the day.The company is just in the first innings of its story. It invests in future growth and does all the right things to keep doing that.","Introduction(Image Source)On February 12, 2019, Shopify (SHOP) announced its Q4 2018 earnings pre-market. The company is a serial over-deliverer, with positive earnings surprises in every quarter. You can see this on the chart provided by Zacks: all the lines are green, indicating beats.And yes, a new green arrow can be added to the graph: the company did it again, beating the expectations on all metrics. The Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.26 beat by $0.05, an outperformance of 24%. The GAAP EPS of -$0.01 beat by $0.07 too, beating the consensus out of the park. Revenue came in at $343.86 million, beating the consensus by $16.43 million (almost 5%) and growing 54.3% YoY. Great results, in my book.But still, at a certain moment, the shares were down by almost 10% pre-market. I want investors to hold their eyes on the road and ignore the multi-colored naysayers that try to distract you from the path to a multibagger.Shopify has been quite a volatile stock over the last year or so, as you can see from this graph:The reason is that the stock has become the target of traders. As you all know, traders play on short-term price moves, and there are enough to let Shopify jump up and down like a young mountain goat.But why has it become a favorite playtoy of traders? As often, there are several reasons, but let's highlight the two most important ones.The first reason is that Shopify is, of course, highly valued. With a forward P/E of 251 (according to Finviz), there is no doubt that it is priced for perfection. But a lot of people forget that this is a company in the technology sector. There are a lot of front-loaded costs, and once you have the scale, you become more and more profitable.I don't think there is any doubt that Shopify is on a winning streak in the scaling game. Once a customer is into the Shopify environment, the upscaling cycle can take place, although you don't want to do that too bluntly. You have to look at Customer Lifetime Value, or CLV. Once somebody deserves money with Shopify, she will be open to upgrade to a more expensive product and earn even more or have more services. Shopify bears get it all wrong, in my opinion, by emphasizing the churn (which, by the way, is completely unknown to them too). If you have 10 clients and you can only keep 5, but those 5 do not only stay very loyal clients but buy upscale after upscale, what's the problem exactly? Oh, and I think the churn is actually a lot less than 5 out of 10.The second reason is that a few high-profile shorters have taken aim at Shopify. Most notably is, of course, the case of Andrew Left of Citron Research. I still wonder where his ""smoking gun"" is that Shopify is a pyramid scheme. Or where the ""Big Facebook Problem"" is that Shopify was supposed to have. If there is a Facebook (FB) problem, it is within Facebook itself, not for Shopify.Anyway, what I mean is that more shorters followed these kinds of calls, and despite the big surge in the stock price of Shopify lately (ouch, shorters!), there are still 8% to 10% of the shares short (the sources vary). So, if the stock goes down again, you know that new shorters may have jumped in. Mind you, this is not aimed at shorters - I like those guys! They are the ones who bring prices down and bring liquidity in the markets. They should be the best friends of long-term investors, in my opinion.Despite the beats on all metrics, Shopify shares dropped by as much as 10% pre-market. Shorters trying to bring the stock down? Traders taking profit? It doesn't matter in the end. Because in the end, if you look at the company, it performs well on every metric. As CEO Tobi Lütke announced:I think this says something about Shopify's strength. The CEO added:Indeed, results are much better than words.On the Q4 2018 earnings call, a proud COO Harley Finkelstein first looked back on 2018 and was very pleased with the company's new products:Finkelstein followed that pride with some namedropping: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Unilever (UL), Procter & Gamble (PG), and General Mills (GIS) are all Shopify Plus clients, just as the Obama Foundation, Tom Brady's brand TB12, and Ladder, founded by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cindy Crawford, Lindsey Vonn, and LeBron James.But probably much more important is that Shopify was launched in extra languages in 2018, so the total stands at seven now. Finkelstein again on the Q4 2018 earnings call:The core geographies are, of course, the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia. This shows that there are huge international growth opportunities left for the company.Shopify has accumulated $2.13 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on its balance sheet, which makes it look like it could be eyeing an acquisition or that the company is hoarding cash for a market downturn to buy on the cheap. And the company has no debt, so it could take on credit to make a splash acquisition. Or a few smaller acquisitions, of course. The most extra cash (some $390 million) came from a share offering in December 2018. CFO Amy Shapero said on the Q4 2018 earnings call about the big cash stash:A small part of the earnings surprise can certainly be attributed to cannabis sales now that Canada has allowed the trade of recreational cannabis. This will have resulted in more subscriptions and GMV growth for Shopify. But the full effect of cannabis is not into the company's numbers yet, since there is a serious shortage of cannabis, and that shortage could be for years. But Shopify has the strong will to be the most dominant player in Canada and to be the logical choice for other countries too once cannabis is legalized there. COO Harley Finkelstein on the Q4 2018 earnings call:The company’s revenue grew by 54.3% YoY versus Q4 2018. Some analysts might use that to conclude that Shopify will drop because the revenue growth declined. But I don't agree. For a company with a market cap of $19 billion, 54% revenue growth is enormous. The law of large numbers says that big companies cannot keep up that growth pace forever. But I think even a lot of start-ups would sign any time if promised to have 54% YoY growth even for a few years. I expect the growth to come down in percentages, but that doesn't matter all too much at this point.Some analysts ascribed the drop after earnings to a miss on operating income, but I think this is just looking for a reason, since the results overall were very strong. Besides that, operating income was up 72% YoY, nothing to sneeze at. The main reason for the small miss in operating income is the heavy spending the company does for innovation and product development. This is, for example, the R&D spending evolution in millions:(Source: Shopify Q4 and FY 2018 press release)As you can see, the R&D budget is up by 70% YoY. I think R&D is one of the best costs any company can make, since it is often the motor for innovations that generate returns for the future. Shopify's CFO Amy Shapero said on the Q4 2018 earnings call:Subscription solutions revenue grew strongly again, by 42% to $133.6 million, driven by new merchants. There was a total of more than 820,000 merchants on the Shopify Platform at the end of 2018. There were 5300 merchants on Shopify Plus, the premium version of Shopify, up 47% from 3600 at the end of 2017. It now contributes 25% to the monthly recurring revenue.Monthly recurring revenue grew 37% YoY, a very respectable number, in my opinion. The main reason: new merchants. GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume, the total amount in money that is sold on the platform) grew by 54% YoY to $14 billion. A further growth in the company payments, shipping and capital also made this grow.These numbers are all very impressive, in my opinion. Monthly recurring revenues are one of the most stable sources of income. That is the very reason Amazon (AMZN) introduced its Prime service. And the Plus clients are big spenders, adding much value to Shopify's revenue, so this is all good news.The guidance Shopify gave was mostly in line with what the analysts had expected, but we know that the company guides very conservatively.Company management stressed on the earnings call that it will continue to innovate and has a few new developments in the pipeline, but they didn't want to get into the specifics. CEO Tobi Lütke talked about some initiatives in augmented reality, like placing a sofa in your own living room (virtually, of course), stressing the fact that Shopify has developed the platform, but he also insisted that it is very early for AR and that it needs a lot of work.This was my fourth article on Shopify, or my fifth if you include my participation in the podcast ""Behind the Idea"" about Shopify. I highly recommend you to subscribe to that podcast series on iTunes or whatever podcast player you use - always highly informative for everyone who loves an in-depth analysis of stocks, with the great hosts Seeking Alpha editors Daniel Shvartsman and Mike Taylor.In my first article on Shopify, dating back to May 2017, when I introduced the stock in my series of Potential Multibaggers, I said that high-growth companies need to be looked at from a qualitative point of view.In my second article, I connected the company with a trend in society: rising rates of entrepreneurship as a reaction to the outsourcing of more and more jobs, not only industrial but also in services.In my third article, I tried to pierce through the curtain to the numbers and provide a valuation guide. The curtain in this case is that Shopify is growing so fast that it is impossible to apply traditional metrics, just as it has been impossible for Amazon or Netflix (NFLX) for a very long time.In this fourth article, I looked at Shopify's Q4 and FY 2018 earnings to check if the company is still on the right track. And I am very confident that it is. The company keeps firing on all cylinders. The earnings were great again, and Shopify keeps doing all the right things to keep growing at a high pace. The fact that the stock went down considerably pre-market, was down 4-5% most of the day but ended in the green at the end of the day says to me that most investors have recognized that too. Shopify is in the first innings of its story. Don't judge it as a fully-grown company, but as a high-growth stock that keeps gobbling up more and more market share.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective and updates about Shopify, please hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4238385,104947,2019-02-06T09:15:09-05:00,Shopify's valuation is too high.Recent capital raise seems to be a move to take advantage of the elevated valuations.Shopify is growing but majority of that growth is coming from the lower margin business.I am concerned about Shopify Capital.,"IntroductionShopify (SHOP) is a provider of cloud-based multi-channel commerce platform. Merchants use Shopify's platform to manage their business across all of their sales channel, including web and mobile storefronts, physical retail locations, social media storefronts, and marketplaces.Shopify generates revenue through the sale of subscriptions to their platform, as well as through the sale of themes, apps, registration of domain names, and the collection of variable platform fees. Revenue generated from these services is recognized as subscription solutions revenue.Shopify also offers a variety of merchant solutions that are designed to add value to their merchants and augment subscription solutions. Revenue generated from payment processing fees from Shopify Payments, transaction fees, Shopify Capital, Shopify Shipping, referral fees from partners, and sales of point-of-sales hardware is recognized as merchant solutions revenue.ValuationFor growth companies that are not reporting profit, I like to value them by assuming base year EPS and then applying expected growth rate to see what is the forward P/E ratio after five years. For illustrative purposes, let us assume Shopify's FY 2018 EPS is a generous $1 per share, a figure which is clearly optimistic given that their TTM CFO per share figure runs at ~$0.18 per share. Another method I used to base my assumption of $1 EPS is by taking away the R&D expense and calculating the TTM EBIT per share, which comes out to ~$1 per share. Now assuming 50% growth rate in the EPS for next five years, we get $1 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 = $7.59. This gives us EPS of $7.59 for FY 2023. At the current price of ~$170, the forward P/E ratio for year 2023 is 22.39. This is a very optimistic scenario, where Shopify is able to grow EPS at 50% for five years. Also, this assumes that Shopify can continue to grow without spending significantly on marketing and promotions and hence turn a profit. Considering all this, I see Shopify as overvalued. Recent Capital RaiseIn December 2018, Shopify decided to raise capital by offering 2.6M Class A subordinate voting shares at $154 per share, for an estimated gross proceeds of $400.4M. This is despite Shopify having ~$1.58B in Cash & Short Term Investments on its balance sheet as of 09/30/2018. On the other hand, Shopify had total liabilities of only ~$170M as of 09/30/2018.Source: Shopify Q3 2018 Financial ResultsShopify had enough cash to carry out its day to day activities and support its growth. Hence, the recent capital raise makes me think that the Shopify management sees the stock price as overvalued and is making most of the opportunity to raise additional capital for future use. A smart move by the management.Growth but from Lower Margin BusinessShopify's Q3 2018 Management's discussion and analysis reported:Source: Shopify Q3 2018 Financial ResultsLooking at the above revenue breakdown, we can see that the growth in subscription solutions revenue is lower compared to the growth in merchant solutions revenue.Source: Shopify Q3 2018 Financial ResultsBased on the above cost of revenues table, we can calculate the gross margins of subscription solution and merchant solution business. For the three month ended September 2018, gross margin for subscription solution business is ~78% and the gross margin for the merchant solution business is ~37%. This shows that merchant solution business is a lower margin business. And majority of Shopify's growth coming from the lower margin business is a concern.Shopify CapitalIn order to support the businesses that subscribe to Shopify's services, Shopify in 2016 started providing loan/cash advance to those merchants that are in need of capital. Source: Shopify Q3 2018 Financial ResultsFrom the above table, we can see that merchant cash advance (NYSE:MCA) receivable has grown by 295% from December 2016 to December 2017 and by 111% from December 2017 to September 2018.There is a potential conflict of interest here, where in the merchant could use the cash advance provided by Shopify to pay Shopify for its services. There is a chance that Shopify's growth numbers could be inflated by adding merchant's in this manner. This is a red flag for me.Macro Economic EnvironmentThe macro economic environment, where the Chinese economy is slowing down, the interest rates in the US are rising, and there is no end to the US-China trade war, is not favorable for investment in overvalued high growth companies. Also, when the economy takes the turn for the worse, the smaller merchants who need cash advances, are the ones that get affected the most. I fear Shopify's MCA receivable turning into a non-performing asset during such times.ConclusionConsidering all the above information, the risk reward ratio does not seem to be favorable for an investment in Shopify. It may be beneficial to go over your investment thesis for Shopify once again and act accordingly."
4234676,25047,2019-01-22T10:12:33-05:00,"The tired, old, valuation angle.The bullish thesis, why people buy this in spite of the valuation angle.The challenges which are about to hit Shopify.","First of all, I must say I was set to write a purely negative article on Shopify (SHOP). That would have been an article focusing on valuation and the significant challenge that Shopify is about to experience.However, upon further research, the article will instead have three angles:In my view, given the lack of data regarding the potential impact of the challenges, this article can no longer be considered “entirely negative”. So let’s start.There’s no doubt Shopify is an amazingly expensive stock. Shopify has that in common with many other cloud stocks.This happens because investors rightfully believe the “cloud wave” (moving from in-house IT solutions to third party cloud solutions) is the way of the future. In this mega change, old suppliers are the losers, and new cloud providers are the winners.So, on a simple multiples approach, Shopify trades for:There isn’t much to argue when it comes to valuation. Obviously, investors expect a much brighter future which sits slightly outside the immediate vicinity.As I said, it’s obvious that investors expect an extremely favorable future for Shopify, and don’t care about immediate financial metrics. So what does this extremely favorable future consist in?The bullish thesis is more or less as follows:Central to the above, is the certainty that the cloud (SaaS) will win over the in-house solutions. Central to this are the following advantages:It’s not a stretch to expect the cloud approach to continue winning converts up until the point where all firms rely on it for most of their IT needs, except for the very largest of players.One can say there are countless Shopify competitors, as there are countless ways to establish your online presence. However, fully-featured and integrated competitors are much fewer. Arguably, Shopify faces only Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) Magento and BigCommerce Enterprise, still a private company.When I say “fully integrated,” I mean:Again, there are many more “limited” eCommerce solutions, but they don’t generally provide the full spectrum of abilities which large companies would require. Shopify does, through its Shopify Plus offering.Shopify being a leader, of course, reinforces its own leadership through network effects. The network effects come through a more robust and extensive ecosystem. Developers want to be where the customers are, and customers want to be where the developers are.Thus, to sum it up, for a growth investor:Remember, at first I thought on writing just on a couple of particular challenges.So here goes. The bullish thesis is all true. However, as of the last quarter:So if 24% of monthly recurring revenues are from Shopify Plus, what might the other 76% encompass?They encompass an extremely large number of small web merchants. And this extremely large number then encompasses an indeterminate number of merchants that are attracted by an originally good idea, that has now turned into a “get rich quick” scheme.I am talking about dropshipping. Dropshipping is the practice of a merchant selling products, but then having its suppliers ship the products individually to the end customers.Dropshipping naturally grew very popular, because a business can be started with extremely low capital and quickly offer countless products for sale, without holding inventory in any of them. As a result, dropshipping is a type of arbitrage between what a customer is willing to pay for a product, and the all-in cost your supplier will quote you to ship that product directly to the customer.Fast forward a bit and we live in a world of millions of Chinese suppliers and billions of Amazon.com, eBay, Facebook and Instagram consumers, all at a distance of a single listing/ad. Shopify plugs that distance. It allows you to set up a cheap store, carry no inventory, have no knowledge of payment systems or shipping or whatever, and just list items (even automatically) and rake in the price differentials.It’s not a coincidence that Shopify carries an entire “how to” tutorial for dropshipping. Dropshipping has been on fire, and remains on fire. For instance, the most recent Google Trends' numbers on dropshipping look like this (worldwide):Source: Google TrendsWith Shopify being a leader in providing a quick, cheap and easy way to open your eCommerce dropshipping mine, it’s thus no surprise that Shopify itself posts extremely good growth numbers.Since interest is still growing, you might be tempted to say “so what’s the problem?”The problem is twofold.The Nature Of DropshippingFirst, lies with the nature of dropshipping. As with any arbitrage, taking advantage of it tends to eliminate it. The returns drop for all players until first growth ceases, and then it goes into reverse.Moreover, the Chinese (and other) suppliers aren’t all that dumb. If someone can sit in the middle and take a cut, they can easily eliminate the middleman themselves. Hence, you start seeing Facebook and Google ads from Chinese wholesalers and suppliers, crowding out the dropshipping arbitrageurs.Emerging Challenges To The Gold RushBut then there’s something else. A true challenge, which is to hit in the next couple of years. Remember what dropshipping is. It’s all about having the supplier ship individual products to the consumer.Now, with most suppliers which have prices low enough to arbitrage being in China, it becomes a question of “how is it possible to ship individual products to the consumer, from China?” That’s an even more pressing question when it comes to low-priced goods.For a long time, and even now, that was possible due to how international mail rates are calculated, namely from China to the U.S. and other developed countries. Those rates are set by the UPU (Universal Postal Union), and are called “terminal dues.” These are the rates one country’s mail operator pays to another country’s mail operator, so as to deliver a package originated in the first country.The rules for establishing the rates are extremely complex. In the end, however, they result in an environment where it’s often cheaper for a supplier in China to ship goods directly to a U.S. customer, versus a supplier in the U.S. doing the same from the U.S.This state of things clearly favors dropshipping, since it favors shipping directly to the consumer from the supplier, on individual packages.However, this state of things is challenged in two ways:Either way, in the next 2-3 years “retail” dropshipping will be increasingly challenged by an attack on a central piece of the activity: the ability to economically send individual packages from low-cost suppliers to individual U.S. customers. The ability to dropship will tend to live on, though, for larger operations able to aggregate and disaggregate shipments as needed.This is an obvious challenge to the dropshipping gold mine that’s likely making Shopify attract hundreds of thousands of retailers to its lower-priced subscriptions.However:Thus, while the challenge is clear, the impact on Shopify is not. And further still, even if the impact is large, it:It’s hard to be positive on a company carrying the kind of valuation multiples as Shopify does, while facing obvious challenges over the medium-term future. However, at the same time the trends supporting Shopify in the short term are as strong as they've ever been.I hope this article was clear in showing why the bullish thesis is so alluring. I also hope it was clear in showing that a likely large contributor to Shopify’s ongoing success, dropshipping:"

And the company has more than $1.5 billion of cash.Yet, the company recently announced a share offering of about $400 million without providing any specific explanation.Despite the drop of the stock price following the pricing of the offering, the market still values the company at a high EV/sales ratio.","One more time, Shopify (SHOP) released results above expectations. The company delivered a 58% YoY revenue growth and smaller-than-expected losses.Also, management raised the outlook for the FY 2018. And with a cash position above $1.5 billion, the company has ample reserves to fund the growth over many years.But despite previous communications, the company announced a share offering to raise an extra $400 million. Before analyzing this surprising move, let's have a closer look at the latest earnings.Image source: geralt via Pixabay The table below compares the better-than-expected Q3 results against the outlook from the previous quarter. Source: author, based on company reportsBesides the 58% total revenue growth YoY, the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and the gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew by 41% and 55% YoY. The lower MRR growth is due to a pricing change around the point-of-sale product.Source: Q3 2018 MD&ATo support the growth, the company keeps on developing more features like multi-location inventory, augmented reality, etc.As a result of the positive results, management updated the outlook for the FY 2018 as shown in the table below.Source: author, based on company reportsManagement will provide 2019 goals during the next earnings release.Despite the better-than-expected results, the company keeps on increasing losses. The higher operating expenses and the lower gross margin explain this trend.The GAAP operating expenses represented 67% of revenue against 66% during Q3 2017. A part of the expenses is related to the transition of the infrastructure from Shopify's cloud to a third-party cloud. Management indicated this migration was over and the costs related to the cloud would decrease from now on.Also, the gross margin decreased YoY from 58.3% to 55.4%.Source: Q3 2018 MD&A This evolution is due to the higher growth from merchant solutions compared with subscription solutions.Source: Q3 2018 MD&A As shown in the table below, merchant solutions generate lower margins than subscription solutions.Source: Q3 2018 MD&A Shopify is growing revenue while generating losses. But with previous equity offerings, the company has plenty of cash to fund many years of growth. The cash position now exceeds $1.5 billion. Source: Q3 2018 MD&AAnd in the Q3 2018 MD&A, management highlighted:And speaking about short-form-based shelf prospectus filed on July 31, management stated:Yet, on December 13, management announced an offering of 2,600,000 class A shares. The price of $154 per share corresponds to total gross proceeds of $400.4 million.Management justified this offering with the following statement:This decision, going against previous management statements, is surprising. With more than $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, the need to strengthen the balance sheet seems odd.Thus, without any extra information from management, I see a few possible explanations:But all these explanations contradict the previous management's statements about a possible offering.In any case, I interpret this decision as a way to raise cheap capital at an opportunistic moment. Considering the different organic growth initiatives, I don't see the need for an acquisition for the sake of growing revenue.As shown in the table below, the price of the offering values the company at an EV/sales ratio above 15.Following the announcement, the stock price dropped by more than 12%. The reasons listed above and the lack of transparency explain this reaction from the market. But despite the drop of the stock price and taking the offering into account, the market still values the company at a high EV/sales ratio, close to 14.The impressive Q3 revenue growth exceeded the outlook. Also, with lower-than-expected losses, the outlook for the FY 2018 improved.But the biggest surprise comes from the recent share offering. With a previous offering this year, the cash position exceeds $1.5 billion. Also, over the last few months, management stated a new offering was not likely. And management didn't provide a specific reason for this new offering. As I consider the company overvalued, I interpret this move as a cheap way to raise capital.Other reasons like preparing for an important acquisition or protect the company against more important long-term losses are also valid possibilities, though.Due to the confusion, the stock price dropped by more than 12% following the announcement of the price of the offering. But despite this drop, the market still values the company at an EV/revenue close ratio 14."
4222480,101927,2018-11-15T11:06:57-05:00,"Shopify has deals with Canadian provinces and private producers of cannabis.Growing sales after legalization will have a noticeable impact on the bottomline.The stock seems a little overvalued, but worth a closer look for investors.","It’s been barely a month since Canada legalized recreational marijuana and weed stocks are still sucking all the air out of the investor room. Canopy Growth (CGC), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), and Aphria (APH), are simply so volatile they’re bound to make headlines every two weeks till weed becomes boring (presumably never).What seems to be flying under the radar is the the fact that legalization doesn’t just mean companies can launch consumer products and partner with celebrities to promote new brands, they can also sell online. That’s what puts Canada’s ecommerce darling Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) in the right place at the right time.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Monika Garg recently told her clients that several key Canadian provinces, including Ontario and British Columbia, have picked Shopify’s platform to run their e-commerce websites and in-store point of sale solutions. She also said that the company had managed to strike deals with the largest cannabis producers in North America, including Canopy Growth and Aurora.I’m digging into this further to see what impact these exclusive deals and the growing wave of marijuana legalization will have on Shopify’s bottomline in a few years.Shopify is probably well known by most investors watching this space. It’s not easy flying under the radar when you’ve managed to take your stock from $17 to $138 in merely three years.If you’ve never heard of it, Shopify offers ecommerce merchant solutions to businesses. Basically, it helps supply the online infrastructure people need to sell stuff digitally. Nearly half the business (47% of revenue) is subscription-based. The other half comes from merchant services like shipping, payments solutions, and financing.If that sounds like Amazon (AMZN) territory, you’re right. The difference is Shopify allows merchants to control the online shopping experience, which is essential for any business person who’s not just trying to sell, but also trying to build a brand.While companies such as Salesforce and Facebook could be nipping at its heels, Amazon, the trillion-dollar gorilla, remains the biggest threat. However, Shopify CEO Toby Lütke remains confident the company can attract the sort of online sellers who know Amazon uses sales data to launch competing products on their platform and squeezes them out.For more information on this, watch Amazon | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | NetflixWhile investors are justifiably afraid of Amazon’s recent Storefronts launch, most people forget the fact that Shopify defeated Amazon on its home turf back in 2015.So that’s a brief overview of the business. Now to talk about its marijuana ambitions.Source: Author's original artwork (let me know what you think)Shopify is in a unique space that puts it in the perfect position to capture part of the value from cannabis legalization. North America is the largest market for the substance. The black market here is estimated to be worth $45 billion right now. Medical marijuana could be worth nearly as much if not more.Canada is the only G7 country where recreational marijuana is legal. The way this legalization is structured gives companies like Aphria, Canopy Growth, and Aurora an edge. These companies have managed to get their provincial sales agreements based on their track record of medical research. Canopy has nearly $4.5 billion in cash after its deal with Constellation Brands, while the other two are on track to dramatically increase sales and launch branded consumer products soon.With the government giving out licenses to only a handful of players and billions pouring into this market at the top-end, it’s likely that Canada’s cannabis industry will evolve into an oligopoly like Big Tobacco.However, Canada’s market isn’t where the action is. The domestic market is worth just over $4.5 to $5 billion, which is barely bigger than the potential market in the state of Colorado. Meanwhile the global market for medical and recreational marijuana is estimated to be worth $200 billion by 2030.Half of that will be recreational and half of recreational will be concentrated in North America. So assuming the market is worth $50 billion, and a mere 10% of that is online sales, Shopify has access to upside worth nearly one-third of its current market cap.The potential size of the market doesn’t tell you the full story. Shopify’s business model gives it access to all of the upside from this wave of legalization without any of the downside. It doesn’t need to invest in production facilities, seek out medical research licenses, pay hefty sin taxes, or spend a ton on marketing brands. Instead, the company just needs to apply the same magic that helped it get these online sales deals with Canadian provinces and large private producers.Don’t just take my word for it, here’s an excerpt of a speech from the company’s COO Harley Finkelstein:The metric to watch is gross merchandise value, and according to KeyBanc’s Monika Garg, the potential GMV from cannabis sales in Canada could be as high as $10 billion annually. To put that in perspective, the company’s reported GMV of $10 billion in Q3 2018. So the incremental GMV is worth 25% of current GMV.That’s just in Canada. With 71,579 US ecommerce businesses using Shopify, it’s already a key player in the North American market. Shopify also has a presence in other key markets where legalization is a possibility, such as the UK, South Africa and Germany.I’m not saying SHOP is a marijuana stock, but it’s hard to deny the fact that the growing global sales of recreational weed will have a noticeable impact on its topline over the next decade.The only question left for investors is the valuation.It’s no surprise that SHOP is making a loss. It’s too early in its growth cycle to start making profits and investors seem to know this. The stock is valued purely on the basis of its potential growth, which has been astounding overall but has slowed down in recent years.Last year, the company delivered 71% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth driven by a 67% jump in subscription sales and 74% rise in merchant-solutions revenue. This year the company expects sales to grow by just 45%.Although 45% annual growth is nothing to scoff at, investors need to consider this growth rate against the company’s $14.5 billion market cap. Shopify is on track to deliver $1.05 billion in sales this year, which means it trades at a forward P/S ratio of 14x. That ratio is higher than some competitors like Wix (8.3x) and Square (10x) but lower than others like Atlassian (18x).A recent article on Seeking Alpha tried to estimate the company’s PEG ratio by assuming a net margin of 25% and a growth rate of nearly 60%. By that measure the stock trades at a PEG ratio roughly 1x. If you take the company’s estimate of 45% growth this year, the PEG ratio moves up to 1.34x, which is an indication of overvaluation.However, a 1.34x PEG ratio is nothing compared to the 100x and more price-to-sales ratios most marijuana stocks trade at. If you’re an investor looking for a cannabis play, SHOP might be a great bet. But if you’re looking for growth at a reasonable price, perhaps it’s better to wait and watch."
4217152,104556,2018-11-01T14:50:44-04:00,"Shopify reported solid earnings last week but investors were unimpressed.
        On a relative basis, Shopify is seeing some slowing, but the financials look great on an absolute basis.
        The company is still a great long-term tech holding.","As of writing this, Shopify (SHOP), the Canadian e-commerce software darling, is down 25% from highs. But then again, so are a lot of tech stocks. The company reported earnings last week and investors yawned at the results, but all in all, for patient investors, Shopify is still a solid holding.Source: ShopifyThough Shopify’s quarterly financials are not as pristine as they once were, it is becoming more and more important in the world of e-commerce. Taking a long-term view, it is likely the company will be much more valuable in the future.For those of you not familiar with Shopify, go read this. The company sells software that helps entrepreneurs focus on their businesses, not the infrastructure around it. For instance, the software functions as a website builder, a payment gateway, a CRM, and a ton more. If you want to sell products and services online, Shopify is the way to go; 600,000 merchants, at latest count, would vouch for that statement too.For the last few years, the company was infamous for being one of the fastest growing public companies. Now that the Law of Large Numbers has caught up to it and a flurry of new IPO’s has shown up on the block…well, actually, Shopify is still holding its ground. While it may be true that sales aren’t doubling every year, like they once were, 58% growth ain’t nothing to sneeze at.The company’s earnings report left investors wanting more though. The combination of slowing growth and widening losses, is the likely culprit. Growth dipped from an astounding 72% last year to 58% and operating income went from -7% of sales to -12%. On an absolute basis, 58% growth and a somewhat narrow operating loss margin, is impressive. But the stock market doesn’t work on an absolute basis, but rather a relative one. The market quickly becomes acclimated to success and will only be satisfied with more and better, when gravity and competition are the graver reality.With that said, here’s how more of the numbers broke out. Subscription sales were $120.5 million, slowing from 65% growth to 46%. And merchant solutions revenue stayed strong with 68% growth to $149.5 million on the quarter.Moving down the income statement, gross profit grew 50% to $150 million, signifying a slight compression in gross margins, from 58% to 55%. The big story, and one I’m sure investors are aware of, was the slowdown in Shopify Plus. Growth went from 116% to 74%. Looking further under the hood though, management had a reasonable explanation.Last year, the company raised prices in this category and changed how they recognize sales. Rather than focusing on a higher subscription rate, Shopify wanted to participate in the upside of these larger clients. Therefore, it will be taking a higher platform fee, correlated to GMV growth. This also explains the slowdown in subscription revenue relative to the merchants solutions operating segment.The move is a long-term play, which is consistent with CEO, Tobi Lutke’s vision for Shopify to be around in a century.While Wall Street is always hard to please, Shopify is still executing. Management made it clear their next area of attack is in international markets. Just last month, Shopify Payments was launched in Germany, making bank account transfers possible rather than solely credit transactions. Speaking of Shopify Payments, the company also rolled out a Fraud Protection program. To incentivize merchants to onboard with Shopify Payments, only current users will be able to buy Fraud Protection. Lutke inserted a poignant quote on this point, “We want Shopify Payments to be too good not to use.”Another interesting highlight from the conference call was about the legalization of marijuana in Canada. Shopify has been in the news a lot for its support of cannabis-selling merchants. However, Lutke re-framed the suspicion. He spoke to the validation of Shopify as a trusted brand, since it was the first choice for this regulated industry.In the past few years, Shopify, along with the title of “fastest growing” was also known as one of the most “highly valued” companies. The new IPOs on the block have knocked Shopify off both pedestals but the company is still not cheap. On a trailing basis, the company trades for over 15x sales. After backing out cash of $1.6 billion from the latest market cap of $14.5 billion, the enterprise value is about $12.9 billion. We get the final answer by dividing that by trailing 12 months sales of $952 million.On a forward basis, however, if Shopify can grow at least 44% in the next year, which is the fourth quarter’s guidance, the EV/sales comes out to be about 9.5. While EV/sales is sometimes a superfluous number, without cash flows and real earnings, it becomes a proxy for rough valuation. A 10x EV/sales ratio can mean an eventual 40 PE and a 25% net margin or a 50 PE and a 20% net margin. It’s just a short-cut of getting to those ballparks.Here’s how Shopify stacks up to some of its software peers in terms of valuation.Of course, Shopify has risks also. For one, while the valuation is still pretty high, the market will be relentless for any signs of the company not executing. In the short term, paying too much is often a very real risk, in the way of volatility at least.Second, an economic slowdown would surely disfigured Shopify’s results. While I do not like to comment on macroeconomics much, it seems certain that the company’s smaller merchants would likely go out of business.Flush with cash, Shopify has no real solvency risk, but it seems likely an economic slowdown would do some damage.And as always, competition is an issue. Magento, acquired by Adobe (ADBE), could make some waves and Wix (WIX) is slowly but surely solidifying its e-commerce offerings. All of these risks are something to keep in mind if you’re serious about owning or already hold Shopify shares.Though Shopify is not “performing well” is a relative basis, on an absolute basis, it is just fine. With strong revenue growth, an expanding total addressable market from international development, and visionary leadership, Shopify is still a great company.Author’s Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

It reported total liabilities of $169.7 million, of which deferred revenue accounted for $39 million.Free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was a negative ($20.4 million).SHOP likely acquired Tictail for access to its community of emerging consumer brands.Independent consumer brands are a hot area of activity due to the confluence of younger demographics wanting different brand experiences than their parent combined with the use of online and mobile data to optimize go-to-market and operations.In the past 12 months, SHOP’s stock price has risen 53% vs. the S&P 500 Index’ drop of a negative ( 0.6%), as the chart below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaNotably, during the recent market volatility, SHOP is still within 10% of its 52-week high, indicating stronger resilience to market downdrafts when compared to the larger technology stock universe.Maybe it's because over the past 12 quarters, SHOP has consistently beaten analyst estimates of earnings per share, as the chart shows below,Source: Seeking AlphaI view the deal for Tictail as likely one where Shopify management acquired Tictail’s brand community and users, rather than any specific technology, so the deal was probably valued on a price per user or brand.SHOP will need to work to keep the brands engaged, but with its greater reach and technology offerings, I expect that to not be a major challenge.With the rise in new consumer brands focused on the next generation of consumers, SHOP’s decision to acquire Tictail is a smart move."

Shopify is a serial overdeliverer, with positive earning surprises in every quarter. You can see this on the chart provided by Zacks:And yes, Shopify did it again, beating the expectations on all metrics. The Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.04 beat by $0.07, GAAP EPS of -$0.22 beat by $0.09 and revenue of $270.06M (+57.5% Y/Y) beat by $11.84M.But still, a lot of analysts talk the company down. They say that the company is too richly valued and Andrew Left of Citron Research and others have published several short recommendations.In this article, I want to show why Shopify is down some 20% from its 52-week high, what the Q3 2018 earnings highlights were and I want to put the spotlight on the new initiatives of the company. But most of all, I want to show the reader the only valuation method that makes sense to me. Therefore, I introduce the 'virtual PEG'.Shopify is down almost 20% from its highs set at the end of July:SHOP data by YChartsA lot of bears will point at the high valuation of Shopify and the fact that it is mentioned will already play a role for some investors. But more on this further on in the article. If you are curious, you can jump to that part and come back to the rest later.The recent market pullback is also a cause for Shopify's fall. Growth stocks are generally more volatile in such circumstances. But it is not just a general market fall and the supposed high valuation that has caused Shopify's stock price to drop. Investors are concerned about competition as well.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is developing products for small businesses to market their products better. It launched Storefront, which could be a direct competitor to Shopify. This has worried investors, but a bit too much in my opinion.They shouldn't forget history. Amazon tried to compete with Shopify before by creating web shops of its own. But Shopify won the battle convincingly and Amazon had to shut down its Amazon Web Stores in 2015 due to lack of success. Instead of its own product, it integrated Shopify in its services.Toby Lütke, Shopify's CEO, is confident that the company will prevail again, since Amazon, unlike Shopify, uses the data that it collects from its merchants to compete with them if they are successful. He thinks Amazon's merchants will feel like they were lured into a trap:(Source: recode)(Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke, source: Financial Post)There is also more Instagram competition talk. Instagram wants to expand its marketing, but I think that Shopify has such a long history of Instagram integration that I can't imagine that Shopify users would completely switch to Instagram. It is, I think, better to combine both services, for both the merchant and the platforms.And then there is the Magento threat. Magento is a competitor and was bought by Adobe (ADBE) in July of this year for $1.68B. There has been a lot of talk by Shopify bears that this could be the pole through Shopify's heart, but I don't think so. I think Adobe is more interested in using Magento to enhance its customer experience loop (implementing feedback from customers) to compete with Salesforce (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL).The interest in search for Shopify and Magento shows a very interesting picture: Shopify dwarfs Magento.(Source)Besides that, Shopify has a much better platform, in which you don't have to be able to program or develop at all, unlike Magento. Magento has been around for a long time alongside Shopify, and Shopify keeps expanding while Magento has been stalling for years now. It is still very uncertain if Adobe can revitalize Magento as a general e-commerce play.The earnings news has not been that good for a lot of companies lately, which also explains the market drop of the recent weeks. But Shopify did very well again. Shopify's non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.04, beating the consensus by $0.08. The GAAP EPS of -$0.22 beat by $0.09, both very positive results.Besides that, the company has $1.58 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on its balance sheet, which makes it look like Shopify could be eyeing an acquisition or that the company is hoarding cash for a market downturn to buy on the cheap. And the company has no debt, so that could be an extra leverage.Part of the earnings surprise can certainly be attributed to cannabis sales, now that Canada has allowed the trade of recreational cannabis. This will have resulted in more subscriptions for Shopify.Shopify’s revenue grew by 58% YoY versus Q3 2017. Some analysts and fellow contributors here on Seeking Alpha were using this to conclude that Shopify will drop, because the revenue growth declines. But I don't agree here. For a company with a market cap of $15B, a 57% revenue growth is enormous. The law of large numbers says that big companies cannot keep up that growth pace forever. But I think even a lot of start-ups would sign any time if promised to have 57% YoY growth even for a few years. I expect the growth to come down in percentages, but that doesn't matter all too much at this point.Subscription solutions revenue grew by 46% YoY to $120.5 million. Monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, grew by 41% to $37.9 million, mostly by adding merchant. Shopify Plus, the premium service, grew 24% YoY, accelerating from the 20% of last year. This is news that I like a lot. Monthly recurring revenues are one of the most stable sources of income. That is the very reason Amazon introduced its Prime service. And the Plus clients are big spenders, adding much value to Shopify's revenue.Merchant solutions revenue grew by 68% to $149.5 million. This growth was mainly the result of GMV growth. GMV is gross merchandize volume, the total amount of money of sold goods on an e-commerce platform. The GMV for Shopify increased by 55% versus Q3 2017 to $10 billion. Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital also helped to grow the merchant solution department. $4.1 billion of GMV was processed on Shopify Payments, 71% more than Q3 2017. This is an area that I expect to continue growing. The integration of a total solution is a very strong selling point for Shopify. And Capital and Shipping both have higher margins. These sections grew revenue with more than 100% YoY. Gross profits grew by 50% to $149.7 million.Some analysts pointed out that the operating loss was bigger than in Q3 2017. And that is true as you can see it on the chart:SHOP Operating Income (TTM) data by YChartsBut still, Shopify expects to have a positive operating income for Q4 between $16M and $18M, which would bring the operating income of the full year to $8M to $10M. The reason that the company grows its expenses so much is because it invests in growth. This is for example the R&D spending evolution over the last quarters:As you can see, the R&D budget is up by 70% YoY. I think R&D is one of the best costs any company can make, since it is often the motor for innovations that generate returns for the future.Shopify also raised its expectations for the full year and expects to grow revenue at over 55% to between $1.045 billion and $1.055 billion, slightly up from a previous estimate of $1.015 billion to $1.025 billion.Shopify has announced that it will occupy a new HQ in Toronto which costs $500M. This will bring the opportunity to add thousands of new employees necessary for further growth.On October 12th, just a month ago, Shopify also opened its first brick-and-mortar service center in LA.(Source)It is designed to have face-to-face contact with Shopify employees and a space to interact with successful Shopify entrepreneurs. The company is very enthusiastic about this new landmark, as you can see in the words of Shopify's COO Harley Finkelstein on the Q3 2018 earnings call:These physical places will drive revenue growth, because the strength of networking and because merchants will learn more of the tips-and-tricks that will drive the growth of their shops.Shopify also added quite a lot of new services over the last couple of months. Multi-location inventory was launched to improve the efficiency of Shopify's shipping service. And there was also an insurance for merchants under the name Fraud Protect, which shelters them from scams. The advantage of these services is that they will grow together with the GMV: the more you sell, the higher your premium.A new App Store and a marketing dashboard were launched too. About these, COO Harvey Finkelstein said:While a lot of investors see the long-term bull case for Shopify from a qualitative side by acknowledging that it is an exceptional company with a top tier management and outstanding execution, there is often one big hurdle. A lot of investors stumble and fall over that hurdle: its valuation. Shopify has been called overvalued since it shot up 51% on the day of its IPO in May 2015, if we would believe the experts.And if you look at the classic ratios, you cannot justify Shopify's stock price of $141.03 (at the moment of writing, after the market's close on Monday): a negative P/E, a forward P/E of 210 and a P/S of 10.But let's look at it from another point of view, from the perspective that Shopify has become a mature company. This may take a decade and maybe more, but I always invest for the very long term.At this moment, Shopify projects revenue between $1.045B and $1.055B. Mostly Shopify beats expectations, but let's take the middle point here: $1.05B. There are 105.38M shares outstanding. That is a revenue of $9.96 per share. The gross profit margin of Shopify is more than 55%: $149.73M on a total revenue of $270.06M in Q3 2018.Once the company becomes mature, net profit margins will rise too. Bigger SaaS companies like Adobe and Intuit (INTU) have net profit margins of 20% to 30%. If you project the revenue growth of the next decade, which will inevitably decrease as the numbers grow, this could give us a guesstimate for the next decade:(compiled by the author)Suppose Shopify has a profit margin of 25% by 2028, this would add up to earnings of $5.89B. We don't know how many shares will be outstanding by then. But let's take a total growth of 150% (although I certainly hope it is less, but I want to be conservative) which would add up to 263.45M shares. That would add up to EPS of $22.36. That is a 10-year forward PE of just 6.31.Just as a reference: Coca-Cola (KO) is expected to have earnings of $2.23 next year and is projected to grow by 6.72% over the next five years, according to finviz.com. If you stretch that to 10 years, EPS will be $4.26 in a decade, which adds up to a 10-year forward P/E of 11.27. McDonald's (MCD)? 11.19. Procter & Gamble (PG)? 10.97.Now I know that there are a lot of ifs and assumptions here, but I think these projections show that investors are not crazy to pay up for Shopify. If Shopify is able to live up to the expectations, it is actually cheap compared to what are generally accepted as more attractively valued companies, of which I hear little investors scream that they are Ponzi schemes or bubbles. Investing is forward looking, and if you look forward, Shopify is not expensive at all.But let's do it differently, with less assumptions: let's take the final net profit margin of 25% and apply it to the revenue projection of 2018: $1.05B. That would add up to $251M in profits. With the current 105.38M shares, that would be EPS of $2.38. With the current stock price of about $141, this would mean a P/E ratio of 59. This still sounds very high, but that comes about down to the revenue growth. You could call this the 'virtual PEG' and it is about 1, which is fair by all means.In my first article on Shopify, dating back to May 2017, when I introduced the stock in my series of Potential Multibaggers, I said that high growth companies need to be looked at from a qualitative point of view.In my second article on Shopify, I connected the company with a trend in society: rising rates of entrepreneurship as a reaction to the outsourcing of more and more jobs, not only industrial, but also in services.In this article, I tried to pierce through the curtain to the numbers. The curtain in this case is that Shopify is growing so fast that it is impossible to apply traditional metrics, just as it has been impossible for Amazon or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for a very long time.Now, of course, it is not possible to predict the future accurately. But I wanted to present a more accurate valuation for Shopify than the traditional ratios, which have been proven wrong again and again for growth companies.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective and updates about Shopify, please hit the follow button next to my name.In the meantime: keep growing!"
4205490,104586,2018-09-11T08:06:29-04:00,"Shopify has expanded its offerings from software to build a website to credit offerings for working capital management.As the growth in the software business has come down from the elevated levels of the past, merchant services business has picked up the mantle of growth.While Shopify Capital is a high margin merchant service, it also entails considerable credit risk.As Shopify continues to focus on merchant advances, the company will need to reduce the cost of capital to grow margins.Despite the company becoming profitable, Shopify's stock looks grossly overvalued and is thus best avoided.","Shopify (SHOP) has successfully built an ecosystem of businesses on top of its core software offering for customers. SHOP’s entry into the lending business to support the working capital requirements of customers has increased the risk in the business model. Even on valuing the company on a segmental basis, with the most premium multiples, the stock price seems to have run much ahead of fundamentals. Thus, it would be prudent to steer clear of SHOP.SHOP has two major segments – Subscription Solutions and Merchant Services.Subscription SolutionsThis segment houses SHOP's platform subscription business. The pricing plans are designed to capture businesses of all sizes - from startups to established firms.Source: ShopifyShopify Plus is the company's highest tier plan. It is aimed at enterprise-level businesses and includes a dedicated relationship manager. Owing to the utility of the product and attractiveness to business owners looking for a one-stop shop, the revenue growth and gross margins have been stellar.Source: SHOP Financial Model. Note: The SHOP Financial Model has been built by the author using SEC filings, investor presentations, and competitor analysis.Management expects margins to grow to 80%+ levels on the back of efficiency measures, Shopify Plus and growing customers trading for higher plans.Merchant servicesThis business is built around the core software business. The services offered in the segment include payment processing (Shopify Payments, based on the gross merchandise volume or GMV), shipping support (Shopify Shipping), and working capital support (Shopify Capital). While the bulk of the segment revenue is derived from the payments business, shipping and working capital programs have been growing much faster than the overall segment.Source: SHOP Financial ModelAlthough services are typically a lower margin business than software, the merchant services segment has seen an increase in gross margins on the back of valued-added services of shipping and working capital support. SHOP has also been investing significantly in Shopify Capital – at the end of 2Q18, the ‘Merchant cash advances (MCA) receivable’ has increased to ~$80 mn from ~$6 mn at the end of 1Q16. Also, SHOP has been steadily increasing provisions for MCA receivables.If the gross margin is adjusted for the cost of capital blocked, the effective gross margin comes out lower than what is reported. (Since the provision for uncollectible MCA has been made at the cash flow level, this item has not been adjusted at the gross margin level.) Source: SHOP Financial ModelAt the end of 2Q18, SHOP had no debt. This implies that the company is deploying equity capital for the purposes of lending cash advances to merchants.MCASHOP discloses limited information about its MCA business. In addition to MCA's algorithmic selection process for disbursement, only the following has been disclosed by the company:Source: 1Q18 Earnings CallSource: 2Q18 Earnings CallUsing company disclosures and SEC filings, the impact of MCA to cash flow is summarized as follows:Source: SHOP Financial ModelWhile SHOP’s FCF had bottomed out in F2015, the investment in MCA was responsible for the subsequent negative FCFs. Since MCA was financed by equity, the impact to cash flows was negative. If SHOP has to grow the MCA business profitably, the company must raise debt to finance it. Since the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity, raising debt to finance MCA should help improve margins for Shopify Capital and also the overall FCF.SHOP seems to be following in the footsteps of Amazon (AMZN) - one business generates money, the other consumes it. For AMZN, AWS is the cash cow and e-commerce business is the drain. For SHOP, both the segments (excluding MCA) had started making money, until SHOP started investing in Shopify Capital. Given the mix of business models, SHOP is best valued on a sum of the part (SOTP) method. Since cash flow linearity has been impacted by the introduction of the lending business, each segment has been valued using a P/S approach.Source: SHOP Financial ModelWhile the stock has run up quite a bit, the intrinsic value of the company is at a steep discount to the current stock price.YChartsRisksWhile SHOP had become cash positive, the decision to enter the lending business has extended the cash burn. While SHOP had significant cash reserves (over $1.5 billion at the end of 2Q18), financing the MCA's growing cash burn can quickly drain these resources. While the growth of the overall business from lending is likely to be significant, the market seems to be overestimating the growth potential for SHOP. This has led to a significant run-up in the stock, stretching the stock's valuations beyond fundamentals. On top of this, the incremental risk from the credit business does not justify a bet on SHOP.Notes:"
4240981,104905,2019-02-14T10:33:32-05:00,"The company reported another great quarter in Q4 2018, reaching the milestone of $1 billion in TTM revenue.
        Growth remained very strong, although it continues to decelerate, which is a small yellow flag.
        Guidance was, as always, conservative and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Expect another year of 45%-50% revenue growth in 2019.
        Many of Shopify's newer growth initiatives still show very high growth rates while the main business is also growing strong. The long-term growth story is very much intact.
        Valuation seems a bit streched at the moment but shares are still a buy for long-term oriented investors.","This is why you should invest in Shopify (SHOP) in a nutshell: It is operating in a very important growth market, cloud-based e-commerce, that has a huge total addressable market and a very long growth trajectory. Their solutions are considered the best in the business which is why the company has been growing revenue at very high rates. Shopify's founder-CEO Tobi Lütke is considered a visionary by many and the company is attracting the best talents in the industry, which will keep them a step ahead of competition going forward. Gross margins in the mid-50s suggest high profitability potential in the future. Valuation has never been cheap but at these growth rates, valuation multiples tend to contract very quickly.In Q4 2018 Shopify's revenue came in at $343.9 million after guiding for $325 million in revenue (top range of guidance) in Q3, resulting in a 5.8% guidance beat. By increasing revenue by 54% yoy and 27.4% sequentially they finally passed the $1 billion TTM revenue milestone.Shopify’s number one growth driver remains Merchant Solutions. While this part of the business is lower margin than its other part, Subscription Solutions, it is also what will keep the company growing at high rates for a very long time. Trough Merchant Solutions, Shopify aligns themselves with customers’ interests which is: Selling more stuff. As investors, we should always be looking for businesses that genuinely want to improve their customers’ lives because this will drive business success in the long-term. In Shopify’s case intense customer focus is inherent to their business model, so give yourself a slap on the back if you are a shareholder.This alignment of interests is paying off handsomely: Merchants selling on the Shopify platform for 12 months or more grew their Gross Merchandise Volume (or “GMV”) at an average monthly rate of 24% yoy in 2018. Also, the number of merchants on the Shopify platform achieving over $1 million in GMV grew by 58% in 2018.At the same time, Shopify’s Merchant Solutions grew 63% and now represents 61% of Shopify’s total revenue. Subscription Solutions revenue grew ""only"" 42% but what really stands out to me is Shopify's strong GMV numbers. GMV amounted to $14 billion in the fourth quarter (up 54% yoy and 40% sequentially) and totaled more than $41 billion in the full year 2018.While Shopify's business is undoubtedly getting stronger each quarter, it is a fact that growth has been coming down gradually over the years and this trend will most likely continue:Much of that deceleration can be attributed to Subscription Solutions or Monthly Recurring Revenue (“MRR”). While MRR consistently grew above 60% throughout the whole year in 2017, in 2018 growth has gradually decelerated from 57% in Q1 to 37% in Q4.In the conference call, management revealed that Shopify now has approximately 820,000 active merchants and 5,300 Shopify Plus subscribers; that’s up 37% and 47% yoy respectively. These growth numbers, while they obviously have been much higher in past years, are impressive if you consider the scale of the company. Then again, the company added fewer merchants on a per capita basis in 2018 than in 2017 (211,000 in 2018 vs. 232,000 in 2017).Also Shopify Plus, their higher priced enterprise solution, saw some serious growth deceleration in 2018. Shopify Plus accounted for 25% of MRR in 2018, up from 21% in 2017 and 17% in 2016. That means that their growth rate came down from 100% in 2017 to 63% in 2018.Even Merchant Solutions, which grew 74% in Q4 2017, has seen slight growth deceleration in 2018.Growth deceleration looks like a dangerous trend but at the same time, its implications shouldn’t be overestimated.First of all, there is the law of large numbers. Shopify just reached $1 billion TTM revenue this quarter. Naturally, you will see some deceleration percentage-wise, especially if you come off ultra-high growth rates as Shopify has in previous years.Second, the company is still growing at a very high rate, above 50%, and guidance doesn't look like growth will slow down considerably in 2019. For the first quarter of 2019, the company expects revenue of $310 million (top range of guidance), which would translate to roughly 45% growth yoy. That’s in line with the growth guidance given in the last quarter and, if history is any guide, Shopify should beat that guidance. For the full year 2019, the company expects $1.48 billion revenues, which implies only 38% yoy growth. However, this guidance number surely will be updated and raised in every quarterly report in 2019. If they only increased their full-year guidance by 2% each quarter in 2019 they would land at $1.6 billion at the end of the year, which would translate to 50% yoy growth. Thus, it would be very surprising if Shopify didn't grow 45%-50% in 2019.Third, the company still has an enormous total addressable market to grow into. It's no coincidence that Shopify is often compared to Amazon (AMZN). Their growth trajectories simply seem to be endless. Shopify has done a great job so far of grabbing those opportunities. They launched Shopify Plus in 2014 (which now makes up a quarter of their MRR), Shipping in 2015 and Capital in 2016 (which both doubled their revenue in 2018). While they were busy in 2017 and 2018 to build out these major new products and also started serious efforts to expand internationally (three of their four focus countries more than doubled their GMV yoy), they promised some new product announcements later in the year.Interestingly, the company also stated in the conference call that they will invest more in the Shopify brand in 2019. It is impossible to say what the growth impact of these efforts will be. What this shows, however, is that growth will not come as ""easy"" anymore and Shopify is entering into a new, slightly lower growth phase. It's good to see that Shopify is proactively addressing this.Lower growth is probably the reason why shares have been basically trading sideways since growth deceleration became stronger in Q2 2018. That leaves the question of which valuation multiple should be attributed to the shares now?I haven't talked about margins and income yet but that is simply because at this point the company isn't trying to optimize the bottom line. When asked about operating leverage in the conference call, CFO Amy Shapero literally said that they are investing for the ""longtime long term"". Now, I don't know if there is a better way of communicating ""we don't care about profitability in the foreseeable future"" but it's certainly up there.The point is that you can't value this company based on earnings. Looking at profitability, the only metric to really watch right now is gross margin, which came in at 54%, slightly lower than last year and the previous quarters, but as expected since Merchant Solutions are lower margin than Subscriptions and are becoming a bigger portion of the overall business.Apart from that, it is all about the top line. The only sensible way to value this company is based on PS or EV/S ratios:Right now, shares are trading at a historically high PS multiple which, honestly, is a bit puzzling since the company's growth rate has come down considerably and also margins haven't moved much. Could this be because of overly optimistic growth projections for their Marijuana-business? It's hard to say, but just for the protocol, I don't believe it is sound investing to put money into Shopify's stock only because of their potential Marijuana-business. While this could become an interesting vertical for the company I don't think it will substantially move the needle for the whole business – certainly not anytime soon.In closing, it is impossible to say that shares are a bargain right now. So if you find pleasure in trying to time short-term share price movements this might not be the ideal time to enter this stock. However, since I don't believe that market timing really works I think it would be a shame if you missed this long-term investment opportunity because of valuation concerns. Fortunately, high growth is one of the best cures against high valuations. If you assume close to 50% revenue growth in 2019, which seems very realistic, the forward PS ratio drops under 13. Add 40% growth in 2020 and the ratio drops to 9. Add another 30% growth in 2021 and the PS is below 7. You get the idea.I'm confident that Shopify's business is as strong as ever and that shares will beat the market in the next 5 years and beyond which is why I think they are a buy right now. Still, it probably is a good idea to not allocate too much of your portfolio to this name at the moment and try to add on price volatility.If you like what you just read, click the like-button and consider following me so you can read my future articles before they hit the paywall.

4215764,94986,2018-10-30T09:37:35-04:00,"Shopify's stock price has fallen significantly since its peak in July 2018.However, the company is shaping up to become the primary software for powering the omnichannel economy.The valuation is also no longer expensive beyond reason.While competition risk remains, the future is bright.","Tomorrow is a word that can be defined from both a literal and figurative perspective. Taken on a literal basis it is the day ahead. Hence, tomorrow could be four or seventeen hours away, but never more than twenty-four hours. On a figurative basis, it can be taken to mean the future, whether four years or seven years away. This article's title refers to the latter interpretation.Shopify (SHOP) is most definitely currently facing its dark days as news of competition from not just Amazon, the previously $1 trillion e-commerce giant, has intertwined with news of competition from Facebook's Instagram and Adobe's Magento. This together with a general market crash has weighed heavily on the company's stock price. Shopify is now down 24.7% from its 52-week high of $176.60. The selling seems to have followed strong results for the third quarter of 2018. However, Shopify has seen rapid rises dissipate in the weeks following, hence, the stock could very well fall further.This fall from its all-time high opens up a few important questions to bulls and bears alike. Shopify's fundamentals remain sound, and most importantly, the macro tailwinds remain intact. This is a company operating within a TAM relatively unhindered in its growth. Much has been said about the rise of e-commerce. Some have commented on how it has decimated the great American malls and British high street, how it's democratized entrepreneurship, and how its fast growth and competitive standing has helped usher in a new digital age. In this new age, capital is digital and successful businesses built from the bedroom. However, e-commerce is still only 11.9% of retail sales, up from 3.5% in 2008. Extrapolating this over the next 10 years to 2028 would put the e-commerce market share at a potential value of 40.5%. However, it has become increasingly clear that omnichannel retailing, a ""fully-integrated approach to commerce that provides shoppers with a unified experience across online and offline channels,"" will become increasingly important.Shopify 2016 Investor DeckSoftware, like Shopify, that enables entrepreneurs to have a presence in all relevant consumer touchpoints will become integral in driving sales for both large and small merchants. Hence, it would be prudent to slightly tilt the narrative away from Shopify's just being just a platform to create a website to sell products. The company will increasingly become the backend software for large companies to manage all their consumer touchpoints. Deloitte, in a 2014 report, describes the omnichannel potential for retailers as offering a ""potential extension of sales"" and increased ""brand awareness and loyalty.""Source: Deloitte ""Unlocking the power of the connected consumer."" The report further goes on to state that omnichannel retailing has the potential to reshape retail markets, describing this ""revolution"" as the next platform to unlock growth and benefits for retailers and consumers alike. Shopify 2016 Investor DeckAs per results from the third quarter of 2018, Shopify is also still spending heavily on research and development ($61.63 million). E-commerce commands a comparatively small share of total retail sales, hence, new innovative solutions for its merchants like 'AR quick look' help build out and maintain a strong economic moat. Shopify Quick Look, an AR shopping support As e-commerce is still such a small part of overall retail sales, it would be prudent to state that the company is still in the very early stages of the maturity cycle. Five to ten years from now the global e-commerce TAM will have ramped up, and current R&D spend will have entrenched Shopify as the most superior platform for the omnichannel economy. When I last covered Shopify in August, the company was trading at a trailing twelve months P/S ratio of 21.54. This entrenched the company solidly amongst the upper echelons of the SaaS sector in terms of valuation.Shopify's current TTM P/S stands at 14.92, use the company's enterprise value to TTM sales and this ratio drops to 13.26. However, these figures are not forward-looking. Shopify will likely grow sales by 40% - 50% over the next twelve months. Using the mid-range of this estimate the company's 1-year forward EV/TTM sales ratio stands at 9.14. This is a significant discount to the level the company was trading at just a few months ago. As a result, I have been accumulating shares at a rate supported by my portfolio. Shopify's result for the third quarter of 2018 also allows for the creation of a more accurate 'what if' model of revenue growth over the next five years to 2023. I do not think the company is going to be materially profitable by 2023, so did not include a profit model. However, and as evidenced by its latest quarterly results, Shopify has intermittently achieved operational cash flow and is very close to positive FCF so I do not think this should be a cause of concern. The model shows the potential of strong returns if Shopify is able to grow revenue in 2023 to $5.47 billion, assuming a 5-year CAGR of 39.30%. Further, if Shopify is able to maintain a healthy 34.35% CAGR over the next decade, revenue will grow to $20 billion a year. Hence, it is not hard to see a 10-year what-if model with the scope of 12 figure market cap. Shopify opens its first brick-and-mortar space in Los AngelesIt is also important to note that competition risks to Shopify are not totally unfounded. And while Amazon has tried and failed before to compete with Shopify, the behemoth is still expected to control 50% of online sales in 2021. Hence, Amazon will always be a specter hanging over this company. However, Shopify continues to remain one of the best ways to invest in the global paradigm shift to online retailing and its subsequent omnichannel opportunities. And the company is increasingly complementary to Amazon as it moves into what will be a more prevalent role as software to manage touchpoints for merchants. Yes, these are dark days for shareholders of a stock which has fallen out of the positive limelight from fear of competition, slowing growth, and revenue mix. But these fears are not reflective of Shopify's truly bright future and its prime status. As the saying goes, it is always the darkest just before the day dawneth. We will likely see sustained share price weakness going into the new year, but some positive near-term news will likely come from a possible boost to GMV as Canada's recreational cannabis market ramps up, as well as what will be the strongest Christmas trading period in the company's history. I continue to be positive that investors will begin to see GMV and the subsequent revenue Shopify gains from it in a more optimistic light. Shopify Capital is also a dark horse that will play a larger part in Shopify's future profitability and free cash flow profile. While a lot of bearish commentaries has focused on the risk it poses, Shopify has continued to ramp up lending to its lowest risk merchants. The company has access to more data points than a traditional bank will, and as a result, will likely see lower rates of default."
4215851,103480,2018-10-30T12:38:18-04:00,"Shopify, the e-commerce solutions company, reported strong Q3 results that beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom line.Revenues grew 58% y/y, extending an impressive run from the company whose scale hasn't slowed down its growth.Despite widespread concerns that continued malaise from Facebook would begin to impact Shopify's growth, the company continues to top estimates.In particular, Shopify's nascent merchant solutions offerings are powering more of the company's growth. More and ore services are being added to the platform, opening new revenue opportunities.The recent stock downturn has rendered Shopfiy less expensive than usual, but the stock isn't a buy quite yet.","With each passing quarter, online e-commerce technology giant Shopify (SHOP) continues to defy Wall Street's growth expectations. Shopify is perhaps the only company at a >$1 billion revenue run rate to manage growth at a ~60% y/y pace. The sheer implication of this growth at scale is enormous - in the nine months year-to-date alone, Shopify has tacked on roughly $300 million of incremental revenues that did not exist last year.Trading for Shopify's stock has been choppy this year - particularly in the spring, when Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Cambridge Analytica scandal led to widespread fears that Facebook's user base would shrink, and Shopify's revenue growth would contract. (As most Shopify followers know, the majority of Shopify sellers advertise their wares via Facebook ads - traffic volumes between the two companies are heavily interlinked). Yet, even as Facebook's user base has modestly slowed down its pace of growth, overall MAUs and DAUs remain in positive y/y territory, and Shopify's revenue streams appear safe.Shopify's revenue growth has come both from an influx of successful net new customer additions as well as a broad introduction of new services. You'll notice this quarter that revenue growth grew much faster than either subscription revenues or GMV - powering Shopify's growth of late has been its merchant solutions, which are Shopify's value-added services that it provides to sellers for a fee. Payment processing has historically been a strong revenue driver, but recently, Shopify has also introduced a varied suite of new tools. In the third quarter alone, Shopify announced the following updates:Figure 1. New Shopify offeringsSource: Shopify investor relationsThrough the launch of various new services, Shopify is fulfilling its promise of being an out-of-the-box e-commerce solution that can support not just payments and shipping, but also credit (via Shopify Capital) and advanced business management features such as Shopify Locations that help entrepreneurs expand their operations.There's little doubt that Shopify has become a much more ambitious company of late. In fact, in a rare move for internet and software businesses, Shopify even launched a physical retail presence in Los Angeles this quarter, stepping up its marketing presence via a brick-and-mortar outpost that can reel in potential clients that go untargeted in Shopify's traditional digital advertising channels.Shopify appears to be one of the only large-cap internet/software companies to have posted a positive earnings reaction this quarter, though its stock is still down ~25% from its peak:Though it's true that Shopify is now much cheaper than usual, it's still quite richly valued from a revenue multiple standpoint. Companies with double-digit revenue valuations have become targets in the recent pullback, with stocks like Zuora (ZUO), DocuSign (DOCU), Atlassian (TEAM), and Twilio (TWLO) all suffering dizzying falls from their all-time highs. Shopify's strong third quarter will shield it, to some degree, from the negativity cast upon companies that have not yet reported earnings (it seems so far that earnings is a 50/50 coin toss this quarter), but a ~12x forward revenue multiple will still make it a target.The bottom line on Shopify: I'm impressed with all the advances that Shopify is making in diversifying its revenue streams and chasing growth via untraditional marketing channels. The company's efforts shine through in a revenue growth rate that nearly exceeds the realm of possibility on a company of this size. Amid extreme pessimism for growth stocks, however, Shopify is likely to continue trading in an extremely volatile fashion. I'd put Shopify on a wish list for now, targeting a price in the $110-$120 range before exploring a long position.Here's a look at Shopify's third quarter results:Figure 2. Shopify 3Q18 resultsSource: Shopify investor relationsThe company grew revenues at a 58% y/y pace to $270.1 million, putting its year-to-date revenue growth at a staggering 62% y/y. Analysts were expecting much steeper deceleration, with a consensus target of $258.2 million (+52% y/y) for the quarter. This implies a six-point beat to Shopify's top line estimates.You'll note as well that, continuing a trend in the year to date, merchant solutions growth contributed the lion's share of Shopify's incremental revenues, thanks in part to the introduction of new seller services. Growth in services, too, has been key to Etsy's (ETSY) success in accelerating its revenue growth. This quarter, Shopify's merchant solutions revenues grew 68% y/y to $149.5 million, capturing a 55% mix of total revenues (three points higher than the 52% mix in the year-ago quarter), while subscription revenues lagged behind with 46% y/y growth.GMV, meanwhile (the measure of the dollar volume of products purchased via Shopify stores), rose 55% y/y to $10.0 billion - an impressive figure and a record-topper for Shopify (the prior high quarter for GMV being the holiday quarter in 2017), but paling in importance to services growth.Shopify's press release also indicates that Shopify Payments and Shopify Capital doubled over 3Q17. This is startup-like growth for these products under the umbrella of a much larger company. Shopfiy's COO, Harley Finkelstein, also noted improvements underway for Shopify Shipping that will further deepen its market traction.The one disappointing result this quarter, however, was on gross margins. Pro forma gross margins, as shown in the chart below, fell three points year over year to 56%. Shopify already struggles with being on the lower end of the margin spectrum among SaaS companies, thanks to its reliance on relatively lower-margin payment processing revenues - the three-point dip this quarter certainly doesn't help to justify Shopify's high revenue valuation.Figure 3. Shopify 3Q18 margin trendSource: Shopify investor relationsThe company has a plausible excuse for the margin drop, however - a cloud migration with temporary margin headwinds. Amy Shapero, Shopify's CFO, commented as follows on the earnings call:Moving forward, margins should improve as this project moves into the rear view mirror. Still, the impact on profits this quarter is noticeable - pro forma operating losses fell to a loss of -$3.6 million, or a pro forma operating margin of -1%, two points worse than +1% in the year-ago quarter. Shopify managed to beat Wall Street's pro forma EPS expectations anyway, with EPS of $0.04 blasting past consensus estimates of -$0.03.Shopify has certainly posted good results on almost all fronts (with the exception of gross margin, which should self-correct in future quarters), but investors shouldn't rush into buying Shopify. The correction in Shopify shares was long overdue, and still Shopify has not fallen as much as other high-growth tech shares despite its relatively high valuation. And with few positive catalysts on the horizon until next quarter's earnings, I find it difficult to believe that Shopify's shares can advance meaningfully from current levels, if at all.In the long run, increased customer signups and a plethora of revenue-generating services will continue to drive Shopify's growth and shepherd it to profitability (note that in the year-to-date, Shopify is already break-even from an operating cash flow perspective). Investors should be prepared to buy if shares fall dramatically further."
4198491,98236,2018-08-13T09:57:47-04:00,"Shopify reported the results of its fiscal Q2 a few days ago.While the results were a beat and raise quarter, the magnitude of both was not satisfactory to investors, at least initially.The company saw some deceleration in the growth of its MRR metric.The company's guidance has been set such that operating expense growth will be greater than the growth forecast in revenues.The company has a number of demand drivers that seem likely to sustain growth at levels significantly greater than that guided in the earnings release or in the First Call consensus.","Shopify (SHOP) reported the results of its fiscal Q2 last week. For some companies, growth of 62% would be considered exciting. For some companies, reporting a profit, albeit a negligible one as opposed to a loss might be considered a positive development.Shopify increased its revenue guidance marginally for the coming quarter. The company increased its revenue forecast compared to the First Call consensus levels by about 2%. The company is forecasting a non-GAAP operating loss of about $10 million. That works out to a loss of about $.02-$.03/share consistent with prior estimates. The company announced a mixed shelf filing but it also said it had no current plans to sell debt or equity; in the wake of its convertible offering, the balance sheet has cash and equivalents of $1.6 billion.In the wake of the earnings announcement, SHOP shares sold off noticeably, reaching as low as $136. Overall, the shares are down by about 16% since July 25th, a pretty significant under-performance in a period in which many high-growth names have been setting new highs, with the IGV down about 2%. Should investors take advantage of this price break, and the rather substantial compression in valuation? SHOP shares are now at the price they first reached back in March, reacting both to current earnings, but to a sense that the company's salad days were in the past. (Salad days refers to a Shakespearean turn of phrase that was more popular in the past. It most commonly means heyday).My investment thesis suggests that this sense is totally misplaced. I believe that SHOP has a long-term future of strong growth and profitability. I think its opportunity still is very significant and far from saturated. I believe the international opportunity for SHOP is substantially underrated. I think some of the enhancements it is making to its offering will appeal to many users. Shopify Payments, Shipping and Capital remain growth drivers. And the opportunities that the company has been developing with its Plus offering remain under appreciated.On a quantitative basis, I think that the current First Call consensus estimate which calls for top-line growth to compress to below 40% next year, down from current levels of 60% is based on flawed assumptions. At this point, SHOP shares have an EV/S, based on 12 month forward estimated revenues of $1.25 billion, of about 11X. No one is suggesting that is a bargain basement valuation. On the other hand, if the company can maintain a growth rate of above 40% for a couple of years, and start to show leverage at scale, this is a modest valuation. I think looking at the drivers of such a scenario suggest that it is capable of being fulfilled.As is the case for many high growth companies, the issue troubling investors is that of falling growth rates and of declines in second derivative metrics. Shopify has been and remains the dominant player in its space. And it is developing a new space, that of developing micro stores for very large sellers, the essence of Shopify +. It has significant non-core products with which it is achieving significant success including Payments, Shipping and Capital. Given that the categories that SHOP dominates are ones it in essence created, no one can realistically claim to know the potential or the TAM of the company's opportunities. Personally, I had no idea that the opportunity of creating micro-stores for large vendors - part of the concept behind SHOP + could have the potential that the company has achieved. This past quarter proved to be a record for Plus, both in terms of additions to the platform and in revenues with new users such as DeBeers, Sodastream, Reckitt - the maker of Lysol and Clearasil - and new shops from current client Unilever. While SHOP reports the proportion of MRR contributed by Plus, it has not released the statistics with regards to the Plus proportion of GMV. Some Plus merchants are spending as much as $40k/month on SHOP. SHOP has removed the cap it had set on monthly payments as of 1/1/18, and it is certainly possible that some users will reach new monthly revenue levels. It should be noted that these overage payments do not count for MRR as they are not guaranteed.Shopify is in the process of localizing Shopify (for Brazilian Portuguese, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Japanese) so that it can effectively enter new markets in many geos where its offering has not been a viable competitor. The company has announced local payment options using country specific cashless payment options. The company has announced a fraud protection solution, an offering that is almost certain to be important for many SHOP merchants. The way the offering is priced is such that it will lead to growth of merchant services revenue. That said, the gross margins on the fraud prevention service will inevitably be close to 100% - certainly on an incremental basis.The company has announced an app it calls Ping, which will include Kit, a virtual assistant. Ping is essentially a form of CRM for SHOP merchants. Kit is designed to proactively suggest and automate social media campaigns. I am not sure just how differentiated Ping is from a host of other work-flow/CRM apps that one can acquire from many vendors who have offerings specialized for CRM; on the hand, having a base of 600,000 potential users for the service is something that most competitors can only dream about.The company has announced major enhancements to its marketplace/app store and it has developed connectors for its Flow offering. I don't propose to put down here all of the technology that SHOP has and is making available. But one thing of note for investors is that this company is not the one trick pony they may think about. And another thing to consider is that SHOP's strategy of developing tools for online merchants is a factor that can differentiate its offering from other solutions in the market.I think when analysts write about this company, they ignore the potential for these kinds of add-ons and geographic expansions in estimating growth. I have been asked about the phenomenal growth of Square, and why it is showing accelerating growth at some considerable scale. The answer is self-evidently the add-on apps its offers its clients. Its growth in GMV is half that of SHOP, but the 127% growth in subscription revenues which emanate from the ancillary products that SHOP sells its base is the key to its success.One piece of SHOP's future as a hyper-growth company will be selling its user base more of the products it has had and is now making available. Shopify is already showing some trends in that regard - the 100%+ revenue growth in Shipping and Capital is significant, and Pay is also growing at above the corporate average. I suspect that these products will enjoy the kind of success Square is achieving with its add on offerings over some time period. So far Capital has been more of an after-thought than a real offering; the opportunity SHOP has with Capital is huge.SHOP is a product company. By that I mean that at this point with a customer count in the hundreds of thousands, its growth is a function of developing more ""things"" to sell to its users. The Left thesis, that this company's success is a function of both the use of FB data, no longer accessible, and the accession of low quality merchants to the platform whose businesses are doomed to failure, is seemingly belied both by numbers, but also by the offerings this company is now bringing to market.One recent cavil regarding growth and valuation has been that SHOP is no longer a SaaS vendor because it receives about 55% of its revenues from merchant solutions, based on Gross Merchandise Value, as opposed to subscriptions solutions. The theory is that merchant solutions revenue, which has much lower gross margins than subscription revenues, will prevent SHOP from reaching robust levels of profitability. I think that this belief labors under several misapprehensions. SHOP customers do not sign up for two service offerings, one called subscription and the other called merchant services. The base cost of Shopify is $29.95/month. Then there are charges related to volume, and depending on the user, there are charges relating to shipping, payments and to loans. There is no isolated cost bucket related to costs related to merchant services. Shopify has chosen to segment its costs such that most of the costs of its network are assigned to subscription services, but it could logically have assigned some of those costs to merchant services.Shopify Shipping and Capital are both included as contributors to Merchant Services revenues and those two offerings grew by more than 100% year on year last quarter. Needless to say the margins on shipping are far lower than the margins on software. That said, the net margins for shipping and payments as well is quite high and rising as these offerings require far less research and development when compared to the company's elaborate network and sales and marketing costs are lower as well as they do not involve locating new users.At the moment, Shopify is incurring duplicate costs for its network as it transitions its solutions to AWS. It is just in the process of decommissioning its own data centers. So, looking at gross margins at this point is basically an exercise with no value; the metrics will change substantially next year. Given that most of the network costs are assigned to subscription services, the current weakness in that metric is transitory, and should substantially reverse next year.One aspect of the SHOP story that continues to get short shrift, at least from my perspective, is the company's great success with SHOP plus. A consistent theme in the broadly defined space of web site construction technology is the emphasis that the successful vendors place on moving their revenue source up-market. That is true of Square (although obviously Square, even in the wake of its recent acquisition is not really a set of web-site development tools), Wix and this company. To be simplistic about it, the Willie Sutton quote about bank robbing is apt ""it is where the money is."" Shopify Plus starts at $2000/month - which is almost 70X what the typical SHOP user pays for their basic service. Plus plans have much lower transaction charges than the other tiers of the offering, and they offer lots more support. Last quarter was a record quarter in terms of onboarding new Plus users. Overall, Plus accounted for 23% of the MRR of the company last quarter, up from 18% in the past year. That increases computes to year on year growth of 95%. In this last quarter, Plus revenues increased by 14% sequentially. Those are impressive numbers, but nonetheless understate the contribution of Plus as a revenue growth driver in that each Plus store is going to contribute a disproportionate level of Merchant Services revenue and is likely to buy more add-on modules than regular Shopify clients.Another issue in terms of valuation is that related to the proportion of SaaS revenues that SHOP reports. SaaS revenues are thought to be more profitable and to be less cyclically sensitive than merchant services revenues. Those are twin canards that do not stand up to rigorous analysis. For example, SHOP is sometimes compared to Square (SQ), although there are significant differences in the offerings of both. But by current definitions, most of Square's revenue is not based on subscription and that is by design. Square's latest earnings report was stellar, to be sure, and the growth of its subscription offerings was in well into triple digits while the growth of its transaction revenue was just greater than 30%. The shares have performed very strongly, overall, and at this point, after appreciating in the wake of its just announced quarter, the forward EV/S ratio is more than 14X. I am not suggesting that the shares of Square are overvalued - I own them now and have done so for quite some time. But I simply don't think that SHOP shares have limited upside because the company derives 55% of its revenue from merchant services. As a SHOP shareholder, I would be happy if the company continued to grow what it calls merchant services revenues by a rate of above 65%, and I feel very confident that if it could do so, its gross margins would rise quite noticeably.How fast can Shopify grow? I recently spoke with the IR Director on estimates for 2019. I could add up all of the initiatives mentioned above, and I think the answer would likely be well above 38%. The extension of SHOP into new geos is a substantial opportunity that can't be quantified but is almost certainly substantial although the cadence of growth is not readily knowable. And while I didn't mention the opportunities in detail, like many other companies, SHOP has a platform offering that is starting to achieve noticeable growth. Again, the growth here is something that will be ongoing for years into the future, but I also think it is underestimated in most models.Overall, I believe that the case for SHOP sustaining rapid growth rests on a solid foundation including both a high growth market space and a strategy designed to put more products into the base it has created.SHOP did report profits last quarter on a non-GAAP basis, but its overall margin profile is something that seems to be something that some investors find troublesome. Overall, gross margins came to 56% on a GAAP basis this past quarter, compared to 57.4% in the year earlier period. That downturn is, as mentioned earlier, entirely a function of the costs associated with the move to the AWS platform. It is not, as has been suggested, a function of a switch to lower margined revenues. Gross margins on subscription solutions, which bear the brunt of the cost of the expenses from the transition, fell from 81% to 78% during the quarter, gross margins on merchant solutions went from 36% to 38%. That ought to suggest that when the transition is over, the trend of gross margins will be noticeably higher. Shopify has a business model that is likely to prove highly profitable at scale; but like many other companies with hyper-growth aspirations its investments in research and development and sales and marketing are such that the realization of significant profits will await far slower growth.On a GAAP basis, operating expenses grew by 65% last quarter, a bit faster than the 62% expansion of revenue. The company has put a stake into the ground regarding its commitment to growth - one that not all investors look at with favor. In particular, opening a spate of new geos is costing a substantial level of expense both in terms sales and marketing and research and development and last quarter also saw a sharp increase in general and administrative costs connected with opening new locations.The investment in opex is just that - an investment. There is no real way to for this company to maintain hyper-growth without both expanding its geographic footprint and by localizing its offerings and doubling down on ancillary services. And doing that requires sustained investment, that has not allowed much operating leverage at scale. Earlier in this current earnings season, Square announced a similar trade off and upped its revenue forecast while leaving its profit projection unchanged. I think the issue for Shopify is probably with its revenue growth forecast more than with the company's margin opportunity. Overall, operating expense was 69% of revenues last quarter, up from 67.7% of revenues in the prior year.SHOP has sized itself for rapid growth - and I imagine its internal projections are significantly greater than those it articulated as part of the current earnings release.SHOP is not a company that has a business model designed to produce substantial cash flow in excess of non-GAAP profits. It is possible that as SHOP Plus expands and is offered to larger enterprises, deferred revenues will start to grow - but at the moment, the increase in the deferred revenue balance is negligible. Currently, what cash generation there is, is being used to fund merchant cash advances. That cash use is recorded in operating cash flow and has been rising at a quarterly rate of $18 million so far this year. In all, Merchant cash advances have now reached $80 million, up by 71% from the year earlier level. The opportunity for SHOP Capital is far greater than the level of financing it has provided thus far. While the returns on merchant cash advances are very high, and the company has more than enough cash to fund any conceivable level of increase it might make in cash advances, the IR Director suggested that the company might go to third party financing sources at some point to accelerate the growth of its merchant loan portfolio.I haven't mentioned competition but an article about Shopify at this point would not be complete without a mention of Adobe's (ADBE) recent purchase of Magento. Succinctly put, Magento has not been an effective competitor of Shopify because of it does not offer hosting and a raft of features that users take for granted when creating a store using SHOP.Weebly was recently bought by Square. At the moment Weebly is for a tier of potential users even below that targeted by SHOP in the past. Wix (WIX) does offer an e-commerce platform, but it is not really trying to create web stores for its users. I would be surprised to see competition as a major impediment to SHOP's growth, but with Adobe and Square now in the space, it is certainly a factor to be considered.I suppose a writer trying to be objective and inclusive has to consider the fact that SHOP has lots of churn in its small merchant base. That is nothing new, to be sure. The cost of setting up a store using SHOP is negligible and as the saying goes, ""hopes spring eternal."" Some SHOP sellers have opened as many as 10 store sites on the platform - and that is never going to cease as long as SHOP offers a product for as little as $9/month - the cost of a lite version in which sellers use Facebook (FB) as their platform. Further to that, is the phenomenon where some merchants have opened as many as 250 stores on SHOP before consolidating their offerings. The argument with regards to churn has been eloquently stated on the SA site in the linked article. The riposte is far better stated by the company CEO, Tobi Lutke during the last conference call. I suggest to readers taking a look at the colloquy between Lutke and the analyst which more or less suggests why using the data presented in the SA article will lead one to an inappropriate conclusion.I do not wish to engage in a sterile debate about the Citron articles that have buffeted these shares in the recent past. Some of the more sensational claims have been debunked - but SHOP's business is certainly influenced by the success of their promotional activity. Again, for those wishing to evaluate their validity, appropriate dialogue may be found both in the conference call this quarter and in the conference call from May.To my mind, the risks to the Shopify story relate very much to sales execution, and the ability to convert the opportunities the company has from enlarging its geographic footprint, continuing to penetrate the large merchant market with Shopify Plus and its ability to drive volumes from offerings on its platforms. These are not inconsequential challenges, but the men at the top of SHOP are surely amongst the best and the brightest in this space.Shopify shares have languished for some time now and are down noticeably since late July. The shares may not be in bargain or GARP territory, but they are far cheaper than they have been in some time - and an EV/S of 11X for a company growing at 40% or 50% is not an outlier.The past quarter was not well received, at least initially, as some analysts focused on declines in 2nd derivative growth metrics and the company delivered guidance that seem disjointed with strong growth in operating expenses and slowing growth in revenues.I am inclined to believe that most is well at Shopify and that negative commentators are either wrong footed or have accentuated the negative, to turn an old song title on its head. I think SHOP has many levers to pull to sustain growth above 40%. I think the company is not engaged in chasing its tail with regards to margins. Competition remains below the horizon and the company has been successful for sure in selling ancillary services to its base. I think the shares offer significant positive alpha over the next year or more as the success of some of its initiatives become visible."
4200654,22148,2018-08-20T16:03:15-04:00,Shopify recently hit a double top around $175.Adobe Systems entered the sector with the purchase of Magento to compete for the e-commerce platform of large brands.The alarming rate of sales deceleration is a major red flag for an expensive stock trading at a forward P/S multiple of 10x.,"One of the ramifications of a massive market valuation is that competitors want a piece of the action. Shopify (SHOP) faces this exact scenario as investors rewarded the company with P/S multiple of 10x '19 revenue estimates. The large valuation likely attracted Adobe Systems (ADBE) to purchase Magento that competes for the cloud commerce plans of large brands. The deal is a big problem for a stock trading at a rich multiple despite the management writing off the competitive threat. Shopify has interestingly not held a couple of attempts to breakout above $170 while actually forming a double top. The prime focus on the bearish thesis of Citron Research that was highlighted in my previous research was that the e-commerce platform focused too much on ""entrepreneurs"" and not real merchants. The thesis is that the stock is overvalued and should be based solely on the now estimated 4,000 Shopify Plus customers and not the small resellers. The $1.68 billion Adobe Systems paid for the cloud-based e-commerce solutions of Magento is to target the large brands and potential Shopify Plus customers. Magento specifically listed Coca-Cola Co (KO) as a customer while Shopify called out business with Pepsi (PEP) in the recent Q1 earnings release. The reason to remain negative due to this deal are that the customers needed by Shopify to become a highly profitable business now face a massive threat from Adobe Systems. The moves could leave the $14 billion Shopify with the small mom and pop stores. Management blew off the competitive threat from Magento on the Q2 earnings call. COO Harley Finkelstein, though, suggested that Shopify has already migrated the low-hanging fruit from the Magento platform:These statements actually support my thesis that Adobe Systems will make Magento a more competitive threat for the large brands. As well, the deceleration in the monthly recurring revenues (MRR) suggests the data privacy issues on Facebook (FB) and other social media platforms is slowing down the growth of new merchants. The Q2 results support that thesis as MRR only grew by 49%, down from 57% in the prior quarter. Sequentially, MRR only grew by $2.8 million to $35.3 million. Shopify Plus grew to $8.1 million of MMR actually contributing $1.1 million of the quarterly increase. Last Q3, MRR was $26.8 million. If MRR was to only grow at a similar $2.8 million sequential rate, growth would decelerate again to only 42%.Clearly, revenue growth in the 60% range isn't supportable as a company reaches the $1 billion run rate. The company though is facing growth falling off a cliff as growth rates have already dipped from levels above 100% to end 2015. SHOP Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsThe company largely beats conservative revenue estimates, but the Q3 revenue estimate of $253 million has growth dip below 50%. Another typical $10 million beat would still leave the YoY growth rate below 55%. The 2019 growth rate according to analyst estimates is down at only 39%. The quickest way to crush a stock trading at 10x '19 sales estimates is to watch the growth rate decelerate. Even worse, the upside isn't that great as the two quarterly beats since my original article have done nothing for the stock that recently hit a double top.The Adobe Systems deal to purchase Magento hasn't closed yet, but any disruption in signing up new customers would have huge ramifications for Shopify's stock. The new combination provides an interesting marriage of digital content creation, commerce platform and the ability to monetize traffic.What really hurts the story is that the addition of a large competitor for key customers before Shopify has even turned meaningfully profitable. EPS estimates were already reduced and one can't envision the numbers improving under the new competitive landscape. SHOP EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe stock trades at an incredible $14 billion valuation and will no doubt garner market justification such as the bullish coverage from Guggenheim in a wide open sector looking for a market share consolidator. With Salesforce (CRM) already owning Demandware in the SMB segment and Adobe Systems now focused on the large merchants, the market is already segmented with deep-pocketed companies that won't likely cede market share to Shopify. The key investor takeaway is that Shopify may become a victim of its own success. Building up Facebook focused ""entrepreneurs"" may backfire due to data privacy issues while the large stock valuation is attracting big competitors to the sector. The stock remains far too rich with sales and crucial recurring revenues decelerating at alarming rates."

So far, the story has been very positive for the bulls as Shopify's revenue and stock price has soared over the past 2 years, constantly squeezing out shorts that have gathered at each peak:SHOP data by YChartsHowever, with this valuation comes the expectation of consistently strong guidance, and unfortunately for investors, the market perceived Shopify's deceleration in gross merchandise volume growth (to 56% from 64% y/y) and its fall in quarterly gross margins as not good enough to justify the stock's current price:However, one quarter's downgraded guidance does not define a stock's future, and in this article, I will examine both the bull's and the bear's arguments and provide a thesis on how I would personally approach the story of Shopify's stock.Both the bulls and the bears took key points away from Shopify's Q2 release, with continued strong growth displayed despite the lower than expected GMV guidance. Shopify grew its revenue in the second quarter by 62% to $245 million, with merchant solutions revenue expanding 68% y/y and revenue from subscription solutions growing 55% y/y.

Citron's argument was that Shopify's methods used to attract merchants was in breach of FTC regulations, and that the FTC was likely to hold Shopify to account:While some time has passed and the FTC is yet to intervene in Shopify's marketing strategies, there is a legitimate point to be made regarding the quality/longevity of the merchants that Shopify is attracting and the marketing practices it uses to acquire them. Some of Seeking Alpha's contributors have published fantastic in depth research pieces on the quality of Shopify's merchants and the concerning level of merchant churn including Jan Barta, who investigated Shopify's merchant churn using domain registration statistics (I highly recommend you read his article in its entirety):These bearish arguments have merit, and if they prove to be definitive, Shopify's stock will fall significantly (both authors estimate a price of $60). However, if the bulls are correct, shorts will continue to be squeezed by Shopify's strong upwards momentum. I would personally look to profit on a move in either direction by using a straddle trade formed with options.As it is highly likely that Shopify's stock price will make significant gains or losses over this quarter as its story matures and investors have a clearer picture regarding user churn and future growth potential, investors have the opportunity to enter a straddle trade using options (a trade in which profits depend on volatility). As Shopify's Implied Volatility (IV) heads towards the lower bound of its 2017 range, a straddle trade becomes more viable:(Source: Market Chameleon)As a simplified example on how a straddle trade on Shopify options would work, simultaneously buying both an out of the money call and put provides investors with the ability to profit from the stock's volatility.

This stock fundamentally evolved my stock investing strategy and ushered in a new age of unchecked alpha for my portfolio. At one point, I was 100% SHOP. I held the stock through the ups and downs, through the citrus calamity and watched as it approached newer highs. I had invested in a multi-bagger and with this came not only the confidence boost but the pride in a portfolio that two years ago was on the verge of surrendering to passive ETFs following a substantial rout. I once considered SHOP to be a bulwark of my portfolio's alpha, indeed in the original article, I triumphantly described the company as ""a unique opportunity to invest in the determination of man to succeed in the advent of the internet"", and the facilitator of a means to a ""prosperous more independent future"".I sold my full position in SHOP a few weeks ago, wondering what changed when the order to buy medium-term puts was executed. This article intends to spell out my analysis in the days leading up to exiting SHOP. It also manages to be relatively retrospective as it was being drafted in the days leading up to SHOP's large fall and Q2 earnings results.As per Q2 2018 results, SHOP currently trades on a forward price to sales ratio of 14.39. I went short on the 25th July when SHOP was one of the highest valued SaaS stock. On the comparative chart below, TEAM, the second highest valued stock traded on a P/S of 21.04. However, it generated $184 million in FCF during the 2017 financial year and is forecast to generate over $300 million in FCF during the 2018 FY.SHOP PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsOn the other hand, SHOP had a negative FCF of $12.4 million during the 2017 FY and is forecast to still be FCF negative during the 2018 FY. But to an extent, this could be considered a flawed comparison as SHOP is at the forefront of the rise in e-commerce, and recently, the legalization of cannabis in Canada.Hence, there were two factors that were underlying Shopify's excessive valuation.(1) A fast-growing SaaS stock operating within the e-commerce space.(2) The platform of choice for a number of significant players in the Canadian cannabis market.The first of factors will be explored in relative depth.SaaS stocks are highly valued because of their recurring high-margin revenue with built-in growth. Shopify is increasingly not a SaaS company.During the second quarter of 2018, SHOP generated $245 million in revenue. This figure constituted of 45.2% subscription revenue of $110.7 million and 54.8% merchant solution revenue of $134.2 million.Source: SHOP's Q2 2018 results.During Q1 2018, SHOP's subscription revenue was 46.8% of revenue, while merchant solutions revenue was 53.2%. I expect this percentage mix to increasingly shift towards merchants solutions in the quarters and years ahead. The result of this will be two-fold.Firstly, Shopify's gross margin will decline sequentially for the foreseeable future. Gross profit margin during Q2 2018 dropped to 55.9% from 57.3% in Q2 2017. Secondly, the intrinsic SaaS premium given to SHOP will begin to degrade as the market prices in a lower margin business with slowing growth.Exacerbating this decline will be the increase in marketing spend as a percentage of subscription revenue.Source: SHOP's quarterly reports from Q1 2017 to Q2 2018.Marketing costs as a percentage of subscription solutions revenue are increasing, the opposite trend SHOP requires to reach profitability. And while total marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue have stayed relatively flat year-on-year at 35%, the revenue from merchant solutions will be valued on a lower multiple by the market versus the revenue from subscriptions.Adyen, the Dutch payment processing firm launched its IPO a few weeks ago on Amsterdam's Euronext stock market. The company processes payment for a plethora of attractive fast-growing technology companies such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Uber (NYSE:UBER), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). This is the type of technology company the market likes and gives a lofty premium. Adyen currently has a market of $18.07bn (using the FX rates on 01/08) and has a payment volume of $122bn. This is a gross payment volume (GPV)/market cap of 6.75. The company also realized revenue of $1.14 billion in FY 2017, a YoY revenue growth rate of 54% when compared to revenue of $740 million from FY 2016.Shopify's gross merchant volume (GMV) for FY 2018 is expected to be around $50 billion, of which GPV will be $20 billion or 40%. For some added clarity, GPV is the amount processed through Shopify payments, while GMV is the total dollar value of orders processed on the Shopify platform in the period, net of refunds. Shopify's market cap should reflect the fundamentals of its underlying business.Assuming a higher GMV/market cap of 8, the upper limit for half of Shopify's market cap (in the unlikely scenario merchant solutions revenue declines to 50% of total revenue) should be $6.25 billion for the 2018 FY. Hence, $8.36 billion in market cap (current market cap minus $6.25 billion) will be attributed to its subscription revenue. Shopify also guided for FY 2018 revenue in the range of $1.015 billion to $1.025 billion.8.36 / (1.025*50%) = 16.31So, Shopify's valuation is being held up by its materially highly valued SaaS business even though this is declining as a percentage of total revenue, has worsening economics, and slowing growth. At a 16.31 market cap/sales ratio for FY 2018, the market is still attaching a substantially high premium to SHOP. Of course, this is lower when EV is considered (cash raised from share offerings as the company is still FCF negative).I sold my puts a few days ago for a slightly greater than 100% gain. I will sit on the sidelines for a while, watching and waiting to see if the stock I fell in love with comes back down or at least start to trade in line with reality.Shopify still fundamentally reflects the entrepreneur, the sleepless nights and early mornings. It represents hope for a better more economically secure future for all. Against this backdrop, it's not impossible to see the company once again becoming a bulwark of my portfolio."

Update fair value.MRR, Shopify Plus uncovered.Shopify's ecosystem is growing.Is there an upper limit of viable “quality” ecommerce stores?In 10 years, can you imagine any business not being online?","We recommend owning Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) for the long term below our fair value. With MRR coming in lower than expected in 2Q18, the growth trajectory shifts down slightly.The 2Q18 earnings report was both good and bad. GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) was good, GPV (Gross Payments Volume) was good, revenue was good, but MRR came up short of our expectations, and full-year guidance was revised up but a little less than we had hoped. The bottom line is our fair value drops to US$157/share from US$164/share based on our 10-year Discounted Cash Flow model. The main culprit for the decrease was the slower-than-expected MRR growth in 2Q18. We will present the 2Q18 results compared to our expectations and then dive into a few talking points from the conference call that we think were important.*SMRE = Save Money Retire Early’s Forecast2Q18(+) Revenue of $245 million vs. SMRE of $239 million(-) GAAP Operating Loss of -$30.8 million vs. SMRE of -$16 million(+) Adjusted Net Income of $2.5 million vs. SMRE of $1.8 million(+) GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume - total sales of all merchants through Shopify) of $9.1 billion vs. SMRE at $8.9 billion(+) GPV (Gross Payment Volume - sales by merchants using Shopify Payments instead of a third party like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), etc.) $3.6 billion vs. SMRE of $3.4 billion(-) MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) of $35.3 million vs. SMRE of $36.8 million2018(-/=) Revenue guidance increased $15 million to $1,015-1,025 million (previously $1,000-1,010 million), $5 million short of where we expected Shopify to revise guidance (SMRE expected guidance to be revised to $1,020-1,030 million)(=) GAAP Operating Loss unchanged at -$105 million to -$110 million vs. SMRE at -$52 million3Q18(-/=) Revenue guidance of $253-257 million vs. SMRE expected guidance between $255 million and $260 million4Q18(=) Implied 4Q18 revenue is $299-313 million vs. previous SMRE forecast of $340 million (new SMRE forecast for 4Q18 is $350 million)Keep in mind that full-year guidance will likely increase by $15-20 million next quarter, and the final reported revenue is expected to beat by another $10-15 million, as historically the company has provided conservative guidance. This puts our expectations right in line with the implied 4Q18 revenue guidance.Prior to January 1, 2018, Shopify Plus merchants had a capped monthly subscription fee based on their GMV transacted on Shopify. This was 0.15% of GMV, with a minimum of $2,000/month and up to a maximum of $40,000/month. We learned that the cap was removed for renewals and new contracts as of January 1, 2018. This means Shopify will get a share of the growth of big revenue-generating merchants. The first place I see a benefit is with the new cannabis merchants in Canada. Ontario and BC governments in the old model would have likely capped out at $40,000/month ($480,000/year) each, but without the cap, the subscription revenue could be substantially larger. As an example, $2 billion in GMV would generate $3 million/year in high-margin subscription revenue. Recall from the article ""Shopify: Cannabis Timing - Part 2,"" we suggested that the cannabis market in Canada could be $8.7 billion, which would translate into $13 million of high-margin subscription revenue.We also learned that the Shopify Plus MRR contribution only consists of the minimum subscription revenue of $2,000 a month. This implies that there are 4,050 Shopify Plus merchants. This is an increase from the end of 2017, when the company reported 3,600 Shopify Plus merchants.As Shopify Plus contracts get renewed without the capped subscription, there is going to be a bigger discrepancy between the reported subscription solutions revenue and the quarterly MRR. For example, in 2Q18, end-of-quarter MRR was $35.3 million. Since this is the monthly number, we multiply by 3 to get the quarterly run rate of $105.9 million. Reported Subscription revenue was $110.7 million. If we consider the $105.9 million as the peak or near the peak of MRR during the quarter, there is at least $4.8 million of recurring revenue that is not classified as MRR. This $4.8 million includes ""above cap"" Shopify Plus revenue, as well as Apps, Themes and domain registration revenue.For very large merchants that consistently generate over $1.3 million GMV per month, the added Shopify Plus subscriptions are reasonably considered recurring.If Kylie Cosmetics generated an estimated $386 million in revenue (GMV) in 2017, that would be $32 million per month, well over the $1.3 million required to reach the minimum Shopify Plus cost included in MRR. That’s an extra $0.5 million/year of subscription revenue for Shopify from just one merchant that isn’t counted in the MRR. With over 3,600 reported Shopify Plus merchants, if we assume the average Shopify Plus merchant pays $250/month in additional subscriptions (i.e., $2,250/month total), then $0.9 million/month is excluded from the MRR.What’s more, App revenue more than doubled year over year and contributed more to revenue growth than the incremental revenue Shopify Plus generates above the minimum $2,000/month. This fact should seem obvious, since the apps are sold across the entire merchant base of over 600,000, while Shopify Plus only takes from a small subset of 3,600+ merchants. For example, $2/month from 600,000 is greater than $250/month from 3,600.Shopify’s app installs (a proxy for app sales) are growing at a blistering pace. In 2017, it had 7 million app installs, an increase over 2016 by 180%, an increased pace over 2016 which grew by 127%. And these are not all free apps. The company paid out $47.2 million to app developers in 2017, an increase of 136% from 2016. Shopify pays out 80% of app revenue to developers, but the company also brings app development in-house when it sees the benefit of those apps for a wide base of merchants. This is evident from its acquisition of Kit CRM in 2016.With App revenue more than doubling y/y in 2Q18, if this rate of growth continues through the end of 2018, App revenue could contribute double the revenue of 2017 - in other words, $25 million of high-margin revenue in 2018.(Source: Shopify)(Source: Shopify)With Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) seeing slowing revenue growth, we thought there could be an impact on Shopify, however, GMV grew faster than we had expected. Shopify merchants use Facebook but apparently don’t rely on it as much as “advertised”. Shopify provides many sales channels for merchants to find consumers.In the Fall of 2017, Shopify added eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) as a sales channel for US merchants. The eBay channel was touted as having a massive audience of 169 million active buyers. Shopify has many integrations powered by the Shopify Sales Channel Platform, “a collection of APIs that can be used to add commerce to any site, app, or platform. Sales channels are an important part of a Shopify merchant’s business strategy, and more than 60% of merchants sell in two or more channels.”Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal with Facebook, there were concerns that Shopify merchants rely too heavily on Facebook advertising as a sales channel. The reality is that merchants and consumers will find each other, whether Facebook exists or not. E-commerce isn’t stopping for a sales tax or any individual sales channel. The most we would expect to see is a transition period in the short term as merchants discover where consumers are “hanging out”. Long term, e-commerce is the trend that is causing a disruption in retail. If one sales channel becomes obsolete, another will become relevant. (Source: Shopify)This seems to be a concern that continues to be brought up in almost every short report on Shopify these days. I’m paraphrasing: “The churn of Shopify merchants is high”, “the number of e-commerce businesses is already too many to serve the population”, “the quality of every new merchant is getting worse.” We know that not everyone is cut out to be an entrepreneur. Many will try, many will fail. The easier Shopify makes it to “try” to start a business, the easier it will be for entrepreneurs to “try and fail,” or in other words, the churn rate will accelerate as it becomes easier and cheaper to start a business. It’s what we should expect.There is nothing wrong with churn. It’s a natural course of business because of the lower barriers to entry. Unsuccessful entrepreneurs today might be successful in the future. No one is successful on day one. Shopify has created a platform where entrepreneurs can try a hundred times for the cost of trying one brick-and-mortar store. Think about it. You can have a Shopify store for a year and it will only cost you about $400. You can dropship, which would minimize inventory. Your first-month rent for a brick-and-mortar store would cost you more than $400 in most cities. That’s without any renovations or inventory. This is pretty simplified, but I think the point is clear. Entrepreneurs can try and try and try and never really break the bank on Shopify. But ultimately, those that have the persistence to keep trying and failing could be the Shopify Plus merchants of the future, or at least a regular Shopify merchant.We previously referred to the churn as a big sifter where the company attracts many merchants, ultimately to capture the good ones that will be Shopify Advanced and Plus merchants. But that analogy needs to be updated. Shopify is more like a school. Stage 1 is learning how to dropship, where you learn the mechanics of selling other people's products online. Some people spend more time than others at this stage and some quit before they make it out of this stage. If you graduate to stage 2, you can become a “maker” and design your own products to sell online. Stage 3 is learning to scale up your production and become a Shopify Advanced or Plus merchant. Not everyone graduates high school, not everyone gets a post-secondary degree, and not everyone gets a Master's degree or a PhD. It’s the same expectation we should consider when looking at Shopify’s merchants. What we should consider is this...Shopify has said the total addressable market of merchants is 47 million in the SMB (small-medium sized businesses) space. Total global retail sales in 2018 are estimated to be $25 trillion.In 2012, the US had 27.9 million small businesses and 18,500 businesses with 500 employees or more. This is one business for every 11 people. But 73%, or 20 million, of those businesses are sole proprietorships, perfect for Shopify. With 7.6 billion people in the world, this would mean 500 million sole proprietors might need an online platform for their business. The company is conservatively only identifying less than 10% of this estimate as its total addressable market. Whether it is providing a product or service, online or offline, Shopify’s platform has something. The Point of Sale (POS) system can replace the need to get clunky hardware commonly used in restaurants and brick-and-mortar retailers. Shopify can be the access point for credit transactions for these sole proprietors and also for restaurants that haven’t yet moved online. Every business will need an online presence, and Shopify is becoming the first name on the list of whom to turn to. With only ~600,000 merchants, Shopify has only captured a fraction of its stated total addressable market - just over 1% of 47 million SMBs. And when we look more globally, its 600,000 merchants are really an insignificant fraction of the total market of potentially 500 million businesses that will eventually need an online presence.The reality is that the world is moving online. It’s the same trend we saw in smartphones. 10 years ago, the world was buying 122 million smartphones a year. That’s no small number, but only 10 years later, now we are buying 1,536 million smartphones a year. And Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) only sold 15% of those. So, while Shopify's 600,000 merchants might seem like a lot, 6 million merchants might be just as likely in 10 years, and that would be about 15% of its total addressable market of 47 million SMBs.In 10 years, if you search for a restaurant or retail store, you won’t be met with a blank page like you can sometimes still see today. Everyone will be online, whether Shopify is providing that service to them or someone else. We are investing for the next 10 years. E-commerce already seems like it is everywhere, but it’s just getting started. In 10 years, can you imagine any business not being online? Our 10-year revenue model gives us a fair value of US$157/share (down from US$164/share).

This happened while there has been no fundamental change in the business or no news leading to such a rise. While growth has been nothing but pleasant, we are seeing a deceleration in the pace of revenue growth. I believe the company has a great story, but am only willing to pay so much for it.On the heels of some very strong growth, Shopify shares are outperforming the market by a large margin.SHOP data by YChartsYear to date, the shares are up over 75%, and in the past month, after a brief pullback, they are up 22%. The stock has performed greatly over the past 3 years as the company continues to grow. However, the value has risen so quickly that it is starting to outgrow its fundamentals, especially compared to peers.SHOP data by YChartsAs I believe the closest competitor may be Wix.com (WIX), I chose to compare some basic metrics of the two companies. We see that Shopify trades at a P/E of almost 6x that of Wix. This would be justified if we saw growth that was significantly higher than that of Wix. However, as we can see below, the revenue growth is not that much greater than Wix.WIX data by YChartsFor the past 3 years, we have seen Wix maintain a healthy level of growth and actually grow revenue at a faster pace. Shopify has actually seen a deceleration in growth year over year. As we can also see from the prior chart, both companies had about the same revenue when they started 3 years ago. However, due to Shopify's greater growth, in general, it does now generate more revenue. While greater revenue is great, it has not generated greater profitability. Due to high stock-based employee compensation, Shopify has given up much of its profitability. There is actually a 30% difference in profit margin between the two companies. Due to this, Wix is able to generate almost as much profit as Shopify with $250 million less in revenue. Below, we can see the slowdown in percentage growth from Shopify.Source: Shopify Investor RelationsAs an investor, I always view my investment as purchasing a small stake of a company. When doing so, I look at it as being the same as a private company and am looking for the highest profit generated from the investment prospects. A higher profit means a higher return for my stake. Thus, in this case, Wix is certainly more interesting due to the accelerating revenue growth and higher profitability.Next, I would like to try to find what a fair price actually is for Shopify.The most valuable part of its business is the recurring monthly revenue. As this is of great value, I would like to see what other companies generating monthly recurring revenue trade for.Source: Shopify Investor RelationsShopify generated a rounded up $33 million per month in recurring revenue. This is up from a rounded up $21 million in the first quarter of 2017. Great growth when compared year over year. Taking a look at the Q4 of 2017 to Q1 of 2018, we see a smaller growth rate of 10% in the MRR. This is a sign of the slowdown in growth. If we continue to see 10% growth per quarter for the next 3 quarters, then we only see an MRR of about $43 million. Now, these numbers are just a forecast and are not necessarily going to be the actual results. Should the MRR rise above this, then the value we find would be higher.We looked to see what values are applied to companies with a large monthly recurring revenue stream and found the following.Source: VeeceeThe average multiple paid for companies with recurring revenue on average is 6.7x. This is an average between the higher multiple for private companies and the lower multiple for public companies. The ARRG is the annual recurring revenue to growth factor. In our calculation, we apply the 6.7x to a yearly average recurring revenue stream of $480 million or $40 million a month. This is about 30% higher than the recurring monthly revenue reported last quarter. Taking the $480 and multiplying by 6.7, we are given a value of $3.2 billion. If we even assigned a premium of 7.6, then we have a value of $3.66 billion. Add in the cash factor for Shopify and we have a market value of over $5 billion. Taking that amount and dividing by shares outstanding of 105 million, we are given a per share value of around $47.Shopify, being classified as a software as a service company, could be valued similarly to other companies in the space. The below graph is found to help us find a possible valuation on total revenues.Source: SaastrAccording to the multiples above, SHOP should trade right around 8x revenue.SHOP PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAnd, as we can see, Shopify trades at a forward price to sales ratio of almost 18x. Competitor WIX trades more in line with the valuation method we have found.The valuations we have found above puts the value of the stock between 50% and 75% lower than current levels. Depending on which method you want to value the company with, it is obvious shares are overpriced. So, for what reason should shares trade at such a premium to competitors? The possible large runway for growth already seems to be slowing down. It also is why we assigned a premium multiple to the valuation. However, investors should prefer to pay a premium for a company generating profits. There is no reason Shopify should sell above peers considering it is no more profitable than anyone else. Because of this, we could see shares come back to a more in-line valuation if and when results disappoint.The hard part is figuring out when they will be able to drive profitability. Based on the last few years of the income statement, it seems the larger they grow, the less profit they make.Source: Seeking AlphaSo, when SHOP could actually produce profits like other large tech companies is the question. Below, I try to estimate this the best I can.Looking at the current size of the market is important to realize what we could see in the future.Source: digitalcommerce360While the U.S. e-commerce market continues to see growth, Amazon (AMZN) makes up for practically half of this with $190 billion in transactions in 2017.Amazon also continues to take most of the growth in the online space.Shopify merchants that actually drive items sold will continue to compete against a behemoth entering every part of the retail sector. Besides hand-crafted items, any item that produces enough profitability to sustain an investment in an e-commerce-only company will see competition from Amazon.Time will tell how this affects growth. What we can estimate is about $40-50 billion this year in GMV and, going forward, close to $100 billion in 5 years or less. This would be great, but if we need to wait until 2023 to see GMV of $100 billion, we may be better off elsewhere. Since revenue is about 2% of the GMV for this year, we can presume the same at $100 billion. That would mean once we see GMV of $100 billion, even if in 3 years, revenue would then only quadruple to $4 billion.To estimate profitability the best we can, we know that Shopify saw an operating loss of 9% of revenues compared to 11% in the year ago quarter. If we see an accelerated 3% reduction in operating loss as a percentage of revenue, it would take 3 years for the company to become breakeven.If this were to change, then the story may be different in terms of investing in Shopify. We prefer to stick to traditional tech giants as they are producing profits and are still growing at very attractive rates.Additionally, many companies like service companies prefer companies like WIX, due to the ease of use and lower cost, or even free platform it offers. Service companies also face less or even no competition from other merchants like Amazon. Because of this, we could see customer churn on the Shopify platform, more so than on the Wix platform.I do personally run a business through Shopify. It is a great platform. It integrates extremely well with social media sites and other sales channels. The support has been exceptional, and the guides to doing certain tasks, even better. I can say I also have a site built through WIX for my service business. The two don't really compare. However, due to a higher cost for Shopify, I wouldn't expect them to. My WIX site costs about $140 for the year, Shopify cost me $70 a month. My Wix site does have the ability to sell product. However, I keep the operating businesses separate. I believe Shopify is continuing to integrate, update, and establish new ways for its customers to expand sales, which ultimately helps itself. It will create a more stable customer base as well as a high GMV number. I will continue to use Shopify until I find it is not worth the investment. The point I am trying to drive as a user is that the market may be limited by those who don't look for all the options Shopify offers. For a business that sells a product customers need to seek, multiple channels of sales are still possible without Shopify. They also could greatly reduce their cost with platforms such as WIX. Should WIX continue to improve its platform and not raise prices, we could see customers diverge to WIX to save money. It will be important for investors to keep an eye on competitor offerings for this reason. Should a competitor introduce a technology that Shopify does not have, this could also cause an exodus of users.While I know there are many Shopify bulls, I believe the valuation is quite a bit ahead of itself. From an acquisition perspective, if the company could be bought in whole, it would currently cost someone at no premium $19.2 billion after accounting for cash on hand for a company with no profit. The return on actual investment would take years of growth and sustainability before we could see a measurable ROI. If I had the choice to invest to own a small piece of a company at the same valuation, I would look for more profitable entities at this time. We did estimate where the value should lie based on peer comparisons and can only assume the stock might trade there in time once the growth slows. The stock at a bare minimum should be trading 50% lower and could trade down further should it fall in line with peers. At this time, I prefer to steer clear of Shopify shares until a better opportunity presents itself. This is not to say I don't believe in the company. I do just believe its shares offer no value at any price above $75."
4189326,103149,2018-07-24T00:00:17-04:00,We recommend owning Shopify for the long term.We discuss the future of Shopify and Cannabis.Cannabis + Shopify adds to the long thesis on Shopify.,"We recommend owning Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) for the long term. There hasn't been a lot of discussion around the future of the company and cannabis merchants. The impact of cannabis on Shopify is long term, and while potentially significant, we believe it proves a very important investment thesis.Cannabis will be legalized in Canada on October 17, 2018, according to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. October 17, 2018, is 2 weeks into Shopify’s 4Q18. This means the first impact to GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) and revenue will be in mid-February 2019, when the company usually reports 4Q results. And the first full-quarter impact won’t be coming out until the 1Q19 earnings results, expected in early May 2019.We wouldn't expect recreational users of cannabis to be 100% legal buyers in the first quarter. So, expect 4Q18 to be a break-in period where purchases are less than forecasts. 1Q19 may give a better picture, especially as the harsh Canadian winter rolls in and the option for delivery to your door becomes much more desirable.So, while many investors are jumping into Shopify stock on news that the company will be handling the e-commerce side of many major cannabis retailers (Ontario, British Columbia, Aurora Cannabis (OTC:ACB)), the paper impact won’t be seen for 7-10 months from now.Key Dates:We expect Shopify's total GMV to be over $40 billion in 2018 and $58 billion in 2019. These forecasts are the pre-cannabis contributions. Keep these numbers in mind when comparing the size of the cannabis market in Canada.In Canada, “Deloitte estimates the base retail market value of recreational marijuana could be up to $8.7 billion.” If we assume that 100% of Canadian recreational cannabis sales go through Shopify, a full-year impact in 2019 could make up 13% of the company’s GMV.13% is pretty huge. But the question becomes, what is the take rate for Shopify on these big cannabis deals. The provinces being such big suppliers must be getting a deal on the credit card interchange either with Shopify Payments or with their own payment provider.If a third-party payment provider is used, then Shopify will just take 0.15% as a fee. Which would make the $8.7 billion GMV convert to $13 million of almost pure margin revenue.If GMV is processed through Shopify Payments, then the revenue impact will be much higher due to the full credit card interchange being recorded as merchant solutions revenue. We estimate the revenue impact could be $230 million, with the gross profit being around $28 million in the first year. At the very least, we would expect the company to capture the full Shopify Plus subscription solution revenue of $480,000 a year.Taking these numbers in total, for 2019, cannabis could contribute as much as 3% to total gross profit for the company.Key points to look out for:Thesis: Shopify is a diversified business, and its customers are diversified in industry, size, level of success, and geography. Diversity reduces risk. Lower risk is good.3% impact might seem big to some, but to others it might seem small. Shopify has grown so rapidly that even merchants of this scale seem to have a small impact.The takeaway is that the strength of the company’s diversified business model means no individual merchant or industry is so big or so small that they will be a risk to its success. Shopify can grow with or without these mega-merchants.But, of course, it’s better to have them than not.ConclusionWe recommend owning Shopify for the long term. Shopify will be the e-commerce solution for a number of large Cannabis merchants in Canada, including Aurora Cannabis, and the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario.This will provide upside to our Shopify forecast model, which we will update when we have more clarity on the impact in the next 7-10 months. In the meantime, take the news as a positive.Make sure you check out our previous article, ""Shopify + Cannabis = Upside.""UpcomingShopify reports 2Q18 earnings results on July 31, 2018, before the market opens with a conference call at 8:30 AM EST.

The company is well-diversified by merchant size, geography, success level, and industry, as well as providing a diverse line of complementary products and services for e-commerce and physical merchants. And above all that, its proven rapid growth since its IPO as it aims to make taking new business ideas to market easier and cheaper.The three keys in our expectations to look for in Shopify's 2Q18 results:Shopify will release 2Q18 earnings results before the market opens on July 31, 2018, with a conference call at 8:30 AM EST.In a previous article, we presented our fair value price per share for Shopify of US$164 per share, derived from our 10-year forecast model. Despite shares currently trading above our fair value, we continue to recommend being owners of Shopify stock for the long term.Management guidance provided for 2Q18 is as follows:Revenue of $230 million to $235 million.GAAP operating loss of $32 million to $34 million.Adjusted operating loss* of $5 million to $7 million.*The difference between the GAAP and the adjusted number is an exclusion of stock-based compensation expenses and payroll taxes of $27 million.Additionally, the full-year 2018 guidance was provided as follows:Revenue of $1,000 million to $1,010 million.GAAP operating loss of $105 million to $110 million.Adjusted operating income* of $0 to $5 million.*The difference between the GAAP and the adjusted number is an exclusion of stock-based compensation expenses and payroll taxes of $110 millionRevenue of $239 million versus guidance of $230 million to $235 million.Revenue of $265 million. We expect guidance to fall short of our expectation as Shopify tends to provide more conservative guidance. Expect 3Q18 revenue guidance of $255 million to $260 millionRevenue of $1,058 million versus guidance of $1,000 million to $1,010 million.Revenue of $340 million.When Shopify provides the revised full-year 2018 guidance and 3Q18 guidance we will be able to get an implied 4Q18 guidance to compare.There are a lot of moving parts, so what should you be looking for in making a buy or sell decision?Given that our expectations result in a fair value of US$164/share and the current stock price is higher, our model suggests that if we buy today, we would expect less than a 10% annual return on average for the next 10 years. We recommend buying stocks below fair value with some margin of safety.However, we believe Shopify has the potential to benefit from some known and unknown factors such as wider market adoption (Early Majority Phase), which could accelerate merchant growth as already established businesses without an online presence move online more and more, this could contribute more to Shopify Plus. We also could expect GMV growth to increase as consumers become more comfortable to buy online as their first choice, where currently less than 10% of retail is transacted online.2Q1820183Q184Q18We recommend owning Shopify at or below our fair value of US$164/share before the 2Q18 results on July 31, 2018.The three keys in our expectations to look for in Shopify's 2Q18 results:The upside result: Shopify continues its streak of beating and raising guidance. Recent Seeking Alpha contributors have provided an indication of the increased Short Interest in Shopify, strong earnings and guidance could create a short squeeze. Hold your position, or buy more as the stock moves up.The downside result: If Shopify misses its guidance or provides weak 3Q18/2018 guidance, we would consider selling some of our position on the initial reaction. A miss would likely create a pile of short articles on Seeking Alpha and other financial news sources in the following days. A first-ever earnings miss would especially not be taken well by the market. As investors have seen the impact of the Citron Report, when a negative catalyst takes hold of a stock like Shopify, it can take a while for the dust to settle. Any indication that the growth train has slowed significantly is reason enough for short-term investors to flee the stock.In the longer term, I would reassess the situation within a few days in preparation to buy the stock back cheaper.Shopify reports 2Q18 results on July 31, 2018, before the market opens with a conference call at 8:30 AM EST.

4189260,35801,2018-07-24T06:30:00-04:00,"We followed up on Shopify by talking to three different Seeking Alpha authors about the stock - one bull and two bears.While their points of emphasis don't always line up, the different ways they look at the same facts can be instructive.I don't expect bulls or bears to be persuaded, but hopefully each side will have better understanding of who they're trading against.","At a time where the Tesla (TSLA) story appears to be reaching a critical juncture, not long after Theranos (THERA) got the long read treatment, and with electric scooter start-ups earning venture funding left and right, it would seem we don't lack examples of the current bull market reaching its frothy stage. But at the same time, the FANG companies are earning healthy multiples and also running healthy businesses, and maybe value investors are throwing stones because they can't afford diamonds any more.I am not saying that Shopify (SHOP) fits into this pattern neatly, because which pattern it fits into is up for debate. What I am saying is that it is a surprisingly good example of the current market climate, where on the one side there are bears saying that the valuation is crazy and the fundamentals matter, and the bulls are saying 'show me the growth, baby', and the profit comes later. We began to discover this dynamic in our first podcast on Shopify, a review of recent bull and bear coverage, and wanted to dig deeper.For this week's Behind the Idea, I spoke to From Growth To Value (a bull), Ramy Taraboulsi, CFA (a bear), and Jan Barta (a bear) about the company and their individual theses. Even though the calls happened one at a time, you'll hear the various authors quietly rebuking or building on one another's work. I often find that stock battlegrounds see the two sides talk right past each other - I'm not sure that exactly happened here, but I think the way the conversation runs from author to author will be interesting.I have the full notes on the podcast below, and I encourage you to listen to the whole thing, even though it's our longest episode yet. But I wanted to call out two things that I found really interesting in light of the conversations:Valuation - This is the primary sticking point. Bears say it's crazy - Ramy Taraboulsi is especially emotional about the 40x revenue valuation, per his estimates. From Growth To Value says, on the other hand, that investing doesn't even come down to numbers. I can see both sides rolling their eyes.I think there's a little bit more nuance here. It's fair to say that, as FGTV does, Booking Holdings (BKNG) or Amazon (AMZN) have never been cheap. The author makes the same point Professor Aswath Damodaran did on our Facebook (FB) podcast, namely that by the book value investing can be replicated by computers, so to add value the investor has to go beyond that. But still, the numbers have to make sense at some point.At the same time, to be short a name like Shopify you either have to be ahead of the crowd on the rate of revenue growth slowing, or you have to know what the market is focused on beyond the top line. I like that both Jan Barta and Ramy call out metrics they're watching - subscription revenue growth and # of users, respectively - but it's not clear whether they're right about those being the key metrics.Does churn matter? - The basic SaaS (software as a service) business model entails recurring revenue. The business wants to acquire customers relatively cheaply (cost of acquisition), but if the average customer has a long lifetime, the lifetime value of that customer is going to be high. So churn is a key ingredient in the equation, and I agree that as a bear you should be thinking about that.What I would at least make as an argument for the bull side, which wasn't quite spelled out here, is that churn is hard to measure. If I imagine that 50% of Shopify's new clients are destined to fail (to peg an arbitrary number), I don't actually care about the churn on that side of the business as long as either a) the lifetime value of the other 50% is high enough to outweigh that, or b) my cost of acquiring those doomed small business owners is negligible. This is a reductive take - it may not be good for me if 1 out of every 2 customers fails and many of those customers then blame it on my business at Shopify, for example - but I think it gets at the counterargument to churn is a problem. Churn can be a problem, but it matters among which users.Of course, even that can be flipped - if SHOP is valued on a total addressable market that includes that hypothetical 50% of sure busts, then the valuation should be evaluated in light of these numbers.Your outlook - I'm not sure I subscribe to the right brain/left brain point From Growth To Value makes at the end of his interview. But I do believe that the way one invests is tied to their mindset and outlook. More skeptical people are more likely to suit one style of investing than another, I'd say. I think this ties with optimism vs. pessimism, with how you evaluate news sources, and so forth. I don't know what is actionable about this, except as always it's good to know what works best for yourself.In any case, there are a lot of different ways to look at this high-growing tech company. Here are three:Topics covered:Introduction – 1:253:45-46:00 – From Growth To Value interview47:00-1:36 – Ramy Taraboulsi, CFA interview1:37-2:05 – Jan Barta - interviewWe hope you enjoy the podcast.

4188024,101356,2018-07-18T10:54:26-04:00,"Our research shows the quality of new Shopify merchants significantly deteriorating.Sales & marketing spend as percentage of subscription revenue is increasing.Growth in subscription revenue, the most valuable type, will continue to slow.Shopify's growth based on acquiring large numbers of low-quality merchants will come to haunt Shopify in the coming quarters.","We had a lot of success with our initial Shopify report, and we believe we significantly advanced the short case, initially put forward by Citron Research. We provided hard data to back up claims about customer churn and added much more. Since we published the initial report, we have uncovered something worthwhile for a follow-up report. Very worthwhile.We believe we have found evidence that clearly shows the quality of Shopify (SHOP) new customer adds is significantly deteriorating and the most recently acquired cohorts of customers will show much larger churn and shorter customer lifetimes. This will catch up with Shopify very soon and will have a very serious detrimental effect on growth in its subscription solutions segment and its sky-high valuation currently sitting at $17.5 billion as of July 16, according to Yahoo Finance.In our initial report, we described how Shopify caught the Wall Street bug and became completely addicted to its constantly rising valuation attained because of its hyper growth (almost 1,000% return since IPO). This hyper-growth was made possible by Shopify significantly expanding its total addressable market by pitching its solution as a make money online scheme (an easy way to make money online with little effort - by becoming a drop shipper and peddling items from AliExpress.com with a 5x markup) as opposed to targeting standard online merchants. Shopify's massive revenue growth was/is heavily reliant on acquiring very large amounts of low-quality customers that have very short customer lifetimes, as our previous research has shown (Shopify doesn't disclose customer churn numbers, for good reason). For Wall Street to take the bait, Shopify had to/has to keep on increasing the number of new customer additions, otherwise, the huge churn of its customer base would catch up with them and Wall Street would instantly realize this is no standard SaaS business with very long customer lifetimes.We believe Shopify has reached a point where its race to add more and more new customers is becoming increasingly more difficult, more expensive, and what is most important, the quality of the newly added merchants is significantly deteriorating in comparison to the quality of merchants signed up in prior quarters.How have we come to this conclusion?In our initial report, we came up with a very novel approach to analyze Shopify churn by analyzing the dot-com zone file, essentially a list of all active domains (with information where they are pointing) in the dot-com universe. We identified all domains hosted by Shopify and analyzed domains that churned off or were added to Shopify. This is how we were able to make conclusions on Shopify customer churn rates and customer lifetimes.After the publishing of our initial report, we stumbled onto something very interesting. We were taking a look at where the domains hosted by Shopify are registered (all domains have to be registered at domain registrars, GoDaddy (GDDY) being the most notable example). As of July 7, 2018, there was a total of 778,511 dot-com domains hosted by Shopify. This is how they were split between registrars:Source: Our analysis of the dot-com zone file.GoDaddy, Tucows (TCX), and Namecheap are where over 79% of all dot-com domains hosted by Shopify are registered. We will focus our analysis on these three registrars. The Other category encompasses all the remaining registrars in the world. The largest in the Other category were Google (GOOG, GOOGL), 1&1 Internet, Network Solutions, Public Domain Registry, and eNom.Through our tests, we found out that when somebody sets up a store at Shopify and doesn't have a domain name and wishes to register one through Shopify.com, Shopify registers this domain name through Tucows. Shopify is a Tucows domain reseller (it outsources domain registration to Tucows).For some reason, we then thought it might be a good idea to see if customer churn differs by registrar. It did. Significantly.By observing changes in domains hosted by Shopify on a day to day basis, we counted the number of unique domains that cease to be hosted by Shopify (i.e. churn off) by registrar across a 27-day period. These were the results:Source: Our analysis of the dot-com zone file.The average number of domains per day churning off by registrar were as follows:Source: Our analysis of the dot-com zone file.Now, we obviously have to take into account the total number of domains hosted by each registrar in combination with the number of domains churning off to determine the churn rate per registrar. We divide the total number of domains per registrar by the average number of domains churning off per day to get a Days To Churn number. Days To Churn is a hypothetical number that shows how long it would take for all domains to churn off if no new domains would be added to Shopify. Here are the results:Source: Our analysis of the dot-com zone file, with our calculations.As you can see, the churn is massively worse for domains registered with Tucows than with GoDaddy, Other registrars, and Namecheap. When comparing Tucows to GoDaddy, Tucows domains have a 2.68x larger churn rate. In comparison to Other domain registrars, Tucows is 2.07x worse. In comparison to Namecheap, Tucows is 1.57x worse.How is it possible that the domains registered at Tucows churn so much worse? We think that the people registering domains through Shopify.com (=Tucows) are very different to the people registering domains through GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Other registrars.Our belief is that the people registering domains via the Shopify website (=Tucows) are much more likely to be of the sort that has been driven there with a promise of becoming rich in drop shipping by one of Shopify's affiliate partners or by Shopify's own marketing targeting these individuals (push marketing). Often, it's also the first domain they have registered in their life. On the contrary, we think that people registering their domain with GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Other registrars have a higher likelihood of actually being a serious merchant, already having an existing business, having more technical skills, probably having more experience with running a website etc. This determines their higher quality (much less likely to churn, longer customer lifetime). The explanation why Namecheap comes relatively closest to Tucows we believe is that it is a discount registrar and that determines the quality of merchants with domains registered there (smaller percentage of businesses etc.)An obvious next step in our investigation was to analyze changes in the number of new registrations (that started being hosted by Shopify) at each domain registrar over time. We did this by looking at all domains currently hosted by Shopify that were 1 year or younger, as per their registration date, and grouping them by their month of registration. We looked at domains registered for the date range July 7, 2017, to July 7, 2018. A chart is worth a thousand words:Source: Our analysis of the dot-com zone file.As you can see, up to September 2017, there were more domains being registered at GoDaddy than at Tucows that were pointed to Shopify. But from October 2017 onwards, Tucows overtakes GoDaddy. Starting from January 2017, the numbers being registered at Tucows start massively accelerating.This is the basis for our argument that the quality of newly signed up Shopify merchants is significantly deteriorating because the registrar mix is massively tilting in favor to Tucows. We know customer churn is significantly higher at Tucows than at other registrars. This will come to haunt Shopify in future quarters when the churn of these very low-quality customers starts catching up.We believe Shopify management made a conscious decision to seriously step up marketing spend in the beginning of 2018 to try to keep showing large top-line growth in subscription solutions revenue (the most coveted type of revenue with high gross margin) because its growth in this revenue segment was showing signs of deceleration. Even after significantly increasing the number of new domains that Shopify began newly hosting in Q1 in comparison to Q4, y-o-y subscription revenue still managed to decelerate 6 percentage points from 67% in Q4 2017 to 61% in Q1 2018. Sales & marketing spend as a percentage of subscription solutions revenue, on the other hand, increased from 71.52% in Q4 to 75.63% in Q1 2018! We expect this revenue deceleration to continue in coming quarters with sales & marketing spend staying very high.We even think that Shopify may be hitting a limit on the number of new domains that it can add, at least in the dot-com universe. Here is the breakdown of 1 year and younger dot-com domains hosted by Shopify split by the month of their registration (we include only 11 full months since our data set is for July 7, 2017, to July 7, 2018):Source: Our analysis of the dot-com zone file.As you can see, the total number is actually slightly smaller in Q2 2017 than in Q1 2017 - 111,474 domains to 113,450. The customer quality continues to deteriorate with Tucows share hitting a record of 55% in June 2018. Compare that to 36% in August 2017.At the same time, sales & marketing spend as percentage of subscription solutions revenue has been edging up:Source: Shopify quarterly fillings. Expressed in thousands of USD.It's also pretty obvious that buying this marginal growth is becoming very expensive as diminishing returns of marketing and churn of the customer base are kicking in. For example, the absolute gain of subscription solutions revenue from Q4 2016 to Q1 2017 is pretty similar to the gain from Q4 2017 to Q1 2018: $5,693 to $6,280. But sales & marketing spend was incomparable: $75,784 in Q1 2018 compared to $45,334 in Q1 2017! Yet, Wall Street doesn't seem to care. Yet.We believe our research of the dot-com zone file clearly shows that the quality of newly acquired Shopify merchants is significantly deteriorating. Shopify is doing whatever it can to keep showing steep growth in its subscription solutions segment at all cost because growth in this segment is significantly decelerating (6 percentage points between Q4 and Q1) as opposed to Merchant solutions revenue, which is not. This is very important because Subscription solutions revenue carries a high gross margin (76.9% in Q1 2018) in comparison to Merchant solutions, which have a much lower gross margin (41% in Q1 2018). Shopify is resorting to acquiring increasingly larger numbers of customers we wouldn't be ashamed of classing junk, just to fuel its addiction of a constantly rising share price. Our research also shows that acquiring new customers is becoming increasingly costlier with sales & marketing spend as a percentage of subscription revenue edging higher over the last 8 quarters.We think that Shopify is in the final innings of its game with Wall Street. This is what happens when your growth is based on steroids - they come to collect their dues. Subscription revenue is set to decelerate further even with sales and marketing spending staying stubbornly high. It will become increasingly obvious Shopify will never be able to show any significant operating leverage and become wildly profitable unless it turns itself into a payday lender (Shopify Capital tripled its outstanding merchant cash advances in Q1 2018 y-o-y to $60.4 million) making loans with 30-50% APRs. Even if it does, we still don't think investors would be willing to value this kind of revenue at 16.5x 2018 expected revenue, which is the revenue multiple Shopify is trading at, as of July 16, per Bloomberg.Our one-year price target is $60-65, equalling more than 60% downside."
4186183,103174,2018-07-10T08:15:00-04:00,"Shopify is a unique business model benefiting from the shift to e-commerce and the rising importance of SaaS.Citron Research presented an intriguing bear case on Shopify in October 2017 - the market seems to have wisely ignored this thesis.While Shopify's current valuation is rich, it will be an interesting long candidate if it sells off either on its merits or because of a sector or market-wide sell-off.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has long been a darling of the stock market, given its position at the intersection of two trends that have been dramatically reshaping the economy in the past decade: e-commerce and SaaS. Simply put, Shopify provides the tools necessary for a small to medium sized business to build an e-commerce presence without the burden, expense, or time required to build a custom e-commerce website. This is a very valuable tool for many small businesses - in the current economic environment, it is basically a requirement to have an e-commerce store, but the onerous cost of several hundred thousand dollars of development expense is too high for most small to medium sized businesses.Shopify offers an excellent entree into e-commerce: for relatively little expense, a store can set up an online store front and start accepting orders and payments. Shopify offers a fully integrated solution, allowing you to accept orders, accept payments, and manage inventory and shipments. Additionally, Shopify offers a merchant cash advance platform through Shopify Capital, which provides much needed working capital to many of these small businesses which have difficulty getting financing from traditional banks; Shopify does this by securitizing the loans against future revenue the store expects to earn. This portion of the business is actually quite interesting as it is like an OnDeck 2.0: Shopify has access to all of the data and KPIs that are key to the store's performance given the services it provides so it has great data and historical patterns to contextualize the performance of a given storefront.Shopify's revenue is roughly a 50/50 split between subscription revenues (the monthly fee to use the core platform) and revenues tied to auxiliary services (i.e., payments, Shopify Capital, etc.).In October 2017, Citron Research presented a short thesis which sent the stock tumbling by over 20 percent in just a few days.The crux of the short thesis was that Shopify has a good software platform, but much of its revenues are tied to new sign-ups linked to affiliate marketers selling online business opportunities. Said another way, Citron uncovered different videos online and promotions for services offering people instruction on how to set up online businesses, and Shopify was the preferred provider of software enabling the online store front. Citron compared these advertisements to MLM marketing schemes whereby the primary source of revenue is new sign ups - where the primary business is selling the opportunity because the actual opportunity itself is not profitable. After the initial fall in Shopify stock, the stock has since recovered substantially: the stock is up more than 50 percent in 2018 alone.While the videos Citron uncovered are cause for concern, the data suggest that it is unlikely Shopify could be producing the kinds of numbers it is producing solely through new sign ups that don't produce viable businesses. It is certainly possible some of the growth has been due to business schemes being pitched, and Shopify should certainly do more to police those, but the KPIs suggest there are a lot of businesses doing very well on the Shopify platform. The most important component of Shopify's platform is its ability to track click through conversion of digital ads; given the importance of Advertising on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram for many consumer-oriented businesses, the ability to follow through the conversion from advertising all the way to purchase is immensely valuable. Additionally, the Facebook lookalike tool actually allows you to try to target your ads to people demographically similar to your existing customer base.There was a great article in the NY Times that expounded on this. One interesting takeaway from the article is that Hubble is built on the Shopify platform; it is one of the biggest success stories given it was entirely built on Facebook and Shopify. Hubble has raised millions of dollars in VC funding and has a valuation that is in the hundreds of millions, if not billions, all thanks to the potent combination of Facebook and Shopify. In many ways, Facebook and Shopify are to the digital economy what landlords of expensive retail store fronts were in the retail heydays before the onslaught of e-commerce. Facebook and Shopify are now able to extract sizable rents from small and medium-sized businesses due to the fact that they provide the critical gateway to selling goods online to the millions of online consumers.Source: Shopify 2017 40-F, $ in MillionsWhile the valuation of Shopify is certainly daunting and does not leave a ton of room for error if the company were to have any issues executing on the market opportunity, the platform is an essential component of the e-commerce landscape and will likely continue growing rapidly for the years to come. On any pullback in the broader market or Shopify in particular (i.e., if there is another short campaign or earnings miss estimates one quarter), one would do well to revisit Shopify as a long.Note: If you enjoy my analysis, please go ahead and click the orange follow button to get updates on future articles."
4187235,104302,2018-07-14T00:05:11-04:00,"Shopify is claiming to have 600,000 merchants, mostly smaller online stores.Most online customers buy from e-commerce giants.The number of online shoppers buying from smaller online stores, Shopify’s target market, is limited.Even if Shopify dominates the e-commerce platforms (currently only about 10%), the number of smaller online stores based on the needs of our planet will be a fraction of the 600,000.The article provides a spreadsheet that you can download to assess the number of realistic long-term customers for Shopify.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) claims to have over 600,000 online merchants, the vast majority of which are smaller online stores. While this number may be correct as of today, it is not sustainable for the long term, and this number is bound to drop significantly.This article looks more into the macro side of the number of smaller online stores that our planet can sustain and comes to the conclusion that the number of Shopify customers is unrealistic for the medium/long term.With the rise in Shopify's price, and the many positive comments about the company's future prospects from some commentators and analysts, I started to review my position and objectively assess whether my short position is justifiable or not. The analysis that I conducted initially, literally on the back of an envelope, indicated to me that the number of Shopify customers is questionable and not sustainable for the long term. This prompted me to conduct further research and publish the results of my analysis.Having run a SaaS company in the past, I know that 600,000 customers is a massive number, and managing it is an extremely challenging task with less than 4,000 employees. To put this in perspective, one of the largest SaaS companies in the world is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and it has (only) 150,000 customers and about 30,000 employees. This simple comparison against Salesforce's number of customers and employees made me start questioning the quality and sustainability of the 600,000 Shopify customers.The following sections of the report show the calculations that I conducted and the references for every number presented or assumed which led to the conclusion that the 600,000 customers is not a sustainable customer base that Shopify can rely on.This makes the total addressable market equal to about 580 million people (7.6B * 51% * 15%); this number is expected to increase by no more than single-digit increments on an annual basis, and then again, the growth will mostly go to the e-commerce giants.Most of these 580 million customers make their purchases from large e-commerce giants like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Flipkart (FPKT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)... rather than smaller online stores. Amazon, alone, accounts for nearly half of the e-commerce market in the US. Now, take into consideration that Alibaba is shipping four times as much packages as Amazon, Walmart e-commerce business is growing at a 40% annual rate and JD.com is relentlessly investing in its infrastructure operations, you get the picture of the prospects that smaller online stores have in the global e-commerce market.Coming up with an exact percentage of customers who are buying from smaller online stores is not easy, and some assumptions must be made. I did a simple survey of about 100 people that I know and found that over 98% of them never buy from any online store other than the big e-commerce giants, even if the prices are lower in the smaller online stores. Their rationale is simply that the delivery speed, the service and the return policy of larger e-commerce giants are better and more reliable compared to smaller online stores, and that the price difference does not justify the risk of buying from a smaller online store.I realize that this is not a scientific method for conducting statistical analysis, but it still provides a rough indication of the scope of market share available for smaller online stores.Knowing that my survey is not very accurate, let's conservatively change the 2% of people willing to use smaller online stores 10-fold to 20%. This would take the 580 million in the previous section down to 116 million users as the addressable market for smaller online stores.Please note that there will always be a need for niche players and brick-and-mortar stores with an online presence. However, these online stores are significantly larger than the traditional smaller online stores that constitute the vast majority of Shopify's clients and are more suited to the Shopify Plus platform (Shopify indicates that it has less than 4,000 Shopify Plus customers on its web site).Now that we have a total of 116 million online buyers from smaller online stores as shown in the prior section, let's make some conservative assumptions to come at a total potential number of smaller online stores needed to serve our planet. By conservative assumptions, I do not mean low or high, but I rather mean assumptions that would take the far end of the spectrum ""against"" this article's thesis.We will start by the revenue required to sustain the survival of these stores. Assume that the online store owner needs a $70,000 annual income, and that the profit margin is 15%. This is a far stretch from the ""getting rich soon"" messages that some Shopify partners are promoting in their advertisements and videos.This would require sales of about $467,000 ($70,000 / 15%). Assume that every customer will make five purchases per month at $20 each for a total of $100 monthly or $1,200 annually. This means that every store will require about 390 (467,000 / 1,200) customers with $1,200 annual revenue from each to sustain an acceptable compensation for their efforts.The number of smaller online stores that need to serve 116 million online shoppers would then be about 300,000 worldwide.Based on my experience with Shopify, it certainly has a good product for anyone who wants to start a small online store in a fast manner, and the requirements are fairly limited; as the needs become more complex, Shopify users would need to use its programming language Liquid, which is generally more difficult to use compared to other platforms that are designed from the ground up for customization (like Magento and WooCommerce).Shopify holds the third position after WooCommerce and Magento as shown in the diagram below. At this stage, market research shows that Shopify holds about 10% of the overall market.Source: Cloudways: Top Ecommerce Platform Market Share in 2017, updated April 13, 2018In the prior section, we came to the conclusion that the total number of small online stores that could profitably serve our planet is 300,000 stores. 10% of this number is 30,000 smaller online stores, and based on my calculations, this is the sustainable number of profitable stores that Shopify should be serving.As I came to the number of sustainable Shopify stores (initially, I came up with a smaller number than 30,000), I thought that I had done something wrong with my calculations: 30,000 is just 5% of the reported 600,000. This prompted me to review the calculations over and over again, and try to change the assumptions to be more conservative, but I still could not confidently get the numbers much higher than the 30,000 mark. Please note that 30,000 quality customers is still a sizable operation, but it is far stretch from the reported 600,000 customers.I would suspect that the 600,000 is the correct number that Shopify has; if it is not, the company will be subject to a very serious class action lawsuit. So, based on this, either my calculations are flawed or the 600,000 number will be dropping significantly, and very soon. I am leaning towards the second alternative.So, why is there a disconnect and the numbers that are drastically different? My speculation is that this ""disconnect"" is the result of the vast majority of Shopify's smaller online stores being unprofitable and that they will go out of business very soon because of their flawed business model.I am providing a spreadsheet that you can download, review, edit, come up with your own assumption, and determine the total number of profitable customers that Shopify would have.Much of the theories about the growth of Shopify and its current valuation are dependent on the number of customers that the company is serving and the potential growth of this number. While the e-commerce market is poised for growth, the domination of the e-commerce giants does not leave enough customers for the smaller online stores to sustain a profitable operation. As a result, the total number of smaller online stores that can profitably operate in our world cannot explain the 600,000 online merchants that Shopify claims to have.Regarding Shopify's stock price, I do not want to make any predictions of how much it is worth at this stage. There are many factors that contribute to the stock price, and the number of customers is only one of them.Every reader needs to make an informed, objective assessment of how the Shopify stock price would be affected if the number of Shopify merchants drops from 600,000 by an order of magnitude."
4192775,104537,2018-07-31T20:06:47-04:00,"Shopify has announced Q2 2018 results above guidance.Due to some areas of concern, the market reacted negatively.The impressive growth is partly due to some factors that are not sustainable.The market still prices the company for success.","Shopify (SHOP) announced Q2 2018 results above guidance and raised the outlook for FY 2018. But the share price dropped by about 8%, as the market is paying attention to some drivers of the revenue growth.Among them, elevated marketing expenses and cash advances don't give me confidence. The company should focus on its strength: the quality of its platform.Yes, the market is pricing the company for a rosy future, not considering all the risks.Revenue grew 62%, thanks to a 55% increase in subscriptions and a 68% growth in merchant solutions.This type of growth shows the importance of merchant solutions for Shopify's success. The drawback of this success comes from the lower margin of merchant solutions, as shown in the table below.(Source: Q2 2018 MD&A)As a result, gross profit margin dropped to 55.9% from 57.3% last year.A part of the depressed margin is due to the migration of the infrastructure to the cloud, though.(Source: Q2 2018 MD&A)With such a growth, the company should start benefiting from scale economies, but it does not seem to be the case. Also, GMV growth decelerated at 56% from 64% last year.We see here a similar pattern with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). A deceleration of growth and a decrease of margins triggers a negative market reaction.Shopify is driving growth, thanks to its efforts developing the platform. But the company is also using high marketing expenses and ""Shopify Capital"".Marketing expenses raised to $87 million but still represent approximately 35% of revenues.(Source: Author, based on Shopify reports)The company will have to decrease these expenses to become profitable. I am not convinced that Shopify can maintain this growth, should it cut the marketing expenses.The other lever the company is using consists of cash advances to customers. This is what management calls ""Shopify Capital"". These advances are not loans, and customers use this cash for inventory and marketing. Advancing cash to low-margin customers facing intense competition is a risky proposition. Uncollectible amounts raised to 4.7% of the cash advances in Q1 2018, as shown on the table below. Monitoring this figure will help in estimating the quality of the business.(Source: Q2 2018 MD&A )Cash advances are growing and represent about 8% of expected annual revenues for 2018.As a consequence of the cash advances, the company does not generate any cash flow. And cash flow from operations ignores the $42 million share-based compensation. Moreover, the company capitalizes some contract costs, inflating the cash flow from operations.Marketing expenses and cash advances favors growth, but they come with some risks.Shopify is more than a drop shipping business. It proposes integrated solutions for Internet merchants.As confirmed during the Q2 2018 conference call, the company is also exploring B2B with some vendors. Although it's still early days, it could represent a long-term growth opportunity.Besides, the company is developing its international presence. It is proposing more languages, payments methods, and drop shipping solutions.With more than $1.5 billion in cash, Shopify can still lose money at this rate for the next 10 years. Management issued shares when the price was high, and it has confirmed having no intentions of initiating a new offering.The table below summarizes the valuation of the company based on EV/Sales:(Source: Author, based on Seeking Alpha and Q2 2018 MD&A)The market still values the company at 13x revenues. This price assumes sustained profitable growth for the years to come. Considering the growth levers I have listed, the company will still increase its revenues. But I am not confident that the marketing expenses and the cash advances constitute a healthy way to grow.Shopify has been building a platform at an impressive growth rate. The company delivered Q2 2018 results above guidance and raised its outlook for FY 2018. Yet, marketing expenses and cash advances counterbalance the healthy organic growth.Despite the share price action, the market still estimates that the company will grow fast. I agree that the company will grow its revenues, thanks to the potential of the platform. But with the risks and some drivers of growth I have listed, I am not confident in paying 12x revenues.Note: To receive real-time alerts about my articles, click on the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4184416,23998,2018-06-28T05:06:45-04:00,"Seeking Alpha contributor Jan Barta warned recently that SHOP shares could fall by more than 50% based on concerns about churn.In in the event Barta is proved right, I show a couple of ways bullish SHOP shareholders can stay long while limiting their risk.I also offer my system's current take on SHOP, and briefly discuss its track record with SHOP and with its top names.","Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke on stage with Canada PM Justin Trudeau (via Shopify)That was the price target for shares of Shopify (SHOP) presented by Seeking Alpha contributor Jan Barta in his article on Wednesday. In the event Barta ends up being right over the next six months, I present a couple of ways SHOP longs can limit their risk below. Following that, I offer my system's current take on SHOP, and discuss its track record with SHOP in particular, and more broadly with its top names. First, a brief comment about Barta's short thesis.Barta notes that Shopify's churn rate is a lot higher than other SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies such as Salesforce (CRM), but of course, this is to be expected given the difference in the companies' respective customer bases. Salesforce's customer base includes large enterprises, such as Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services subsidiary.Credit: Salesforce.Chances are, Amazon Web Services will still be in business in a couple of years, but according to Barta's analysis, the lifetime of an average Shopify customer, usually a small business, is 14 months. If that's true, it wouldn't surprise me. Most small businesses struggle, and it's probably worse for online merchants, who have to compete with giants like Amazon, without the benefit of pedestrian traffic that a small bricks & mortar business might have.Barta extrapolates doom from this by arguing that, because of high churn, Shopify won't be able to improve its margins by cutting the money it spends to acquire new small business customers as it loses current ones to churn. That sounds reasonable, as far as it goes, but my system's approach is to assume that savvy market participants have already weighed these considerations, so it looks at underlying price history and forward-looking options market sentiment to get a sense of what might come next for the stock.I'll show my system's current take on SHOP in a moment. First, in the event that Barta's bearishness ends up being right, here are a couple of ways to limit your risk.Let's assume you're long 500 shares of SHOP and are unwilling to risk a decline of more than 19% over the next several months. Here are two ways of hedging it (screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app).Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Wednesday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge 500 shares of SHOP against a >19% decline by late January.As you can see above, the cost here was $6,050, or 8.36% of position value, calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts. Before you ask why I'm ""recommending"" a hedge that's this expensive, note that I am not recommending it. I am showing you the least expensive put option hedge to protect against a >19% decline over this time period. If it's too expensive for you, you might consider the next hedge. If your risk tolerance is higher or lower than this, you can adjust your decline threshold accordingly, and scan for optimal hedges that meet your parameters.Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your upside at 20%, this was the optimal collar to hedge 500 shares of SHOP against the same >19% decline over the same time frame.You may have noticed two things different about this hedge. The first is that, after an iterative process taking into account its net cost, the hedging algorithm was able to find a less expensive put strike, one that lowered the cost of the put leg to $3,700 or 5.11% of position value (calculated conservatively again, using the ask price of the puts). The second is that cost was more than offset by the income of $4,900 or 6.77% of position value, generated from selling the call leg (calculated conservatively, at the bid).So the net cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $1,200 when opening this hedge, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads.This screen capture from my site's admin panel shows its current take on Shopify.In a nutshell, it's moderately bullish on Shopify, estimating a potential return for it of about 20% over the next 6 months (historically, actual returns average about 0.3x my site's potential return estimates). That made SHOP the 129th name in my site's daily ranking on Wednesday, as you can see below.Shopify hasn't been a top 10 Portfolio Armor name since last August, when I presented the top 10 names below to subscribers of my Marketplace service at the time (Bulletproof Investing subscribers can click here to see the original post; that link will take non-subscribers to the information page for my service). The potential returns below are shown in the ""Adj. Exp Return"" column. Each of my site's top names is based on their anticipated performance over the next 6 months. Note that SHOP's potential return was 28% in the table above. Let's look at how the cohort including Shopify did, and how the rest of them did as well.Here's how that August 24th top names cohort including SHOP did over the next 6 months:We nearly hit the bullseye with SHOP: it was up 28.6%, versus our potential return estimate above of 28%. It's not often Portfolio Armor pins a potential return like that, but it does happen sometimes.I've been posting the top 10 names for subscribers each week since June 8th of last year. Here's the 6-month performance for all of the ones posted up until December 21st of last year:So the top ten names I've presented averaged 16.73% over the average of these 29 6-month periods, versus SPY's average of 9.07%, an average outperformance of 7.66% over 6 months.I'm not a fan of shorting stocks based on valuation, but Jan Barta raises reasonable questions about Shopify's churn. If you decide to exit now based on that, unless you bought it within the last week, you'll be taking profits. That's an excellent way of reducing risk. But if you're still bullish and would rather stay long, but are worried Barta might be proved right, hedging is worth considering here."
4185535,47521,2018-07-05T10:32:22-04:00,This is the only thing that will slow Shopify down when it happens.Market overreacted to Supreme Court decision.Company fundamentals remain strong.Bears and shorts trying to change the narrative.,"source: shopifyIt wasn't surprising to see the shorts and bears jump on the Supreme Court decision in favor of South Dakota in its battle against Wayfair, in regard to its perceived impact on Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).In a decision that will probably include all the states in the future, the Supreme Court ruled that e-commerce retailers will have to collect sales tax from people residing in South Dakota.The market reaction in regard to Shopify was for many to sell-off shares, which pushed the share price down 18 percent. The reason for that was the faulty assumption it will change the competitive landscape of retailing; as if the major reason consumers buy stuff online is because of the price differential coming from sales taxes, or lack of them.Another tactic used by bears and shorts has been to cherry pick a few of the perceived weaknesses or theoretical risks associated with its business model. Among them are Citron's theory that Shopify will eventually run into problems with the FTC because of it allegedly taking advantage of customers, high churn, and the latest one, the possible risk it has in relationship to new Facebook policy changes in response to its Cambridge Analytica scandal.The problem with much of the negative coverage is it primarily focuses only on one business of the company, which is the designing and hosting of digital storefronts, which is its subscription business, which receives the most attacks. Its other business is merchant solutions, which generates a little over 50 percent of its revenue. That receives much less focus from shorts and bears because it has what appears to be a much more sustainable business model.In my view the critics are getting it wrong because an e-commerce company like Shopify can't be evaluated in the same way other companies and sectors are. This is why the company continues to outperform, even as shorts try to convince the market the business model of Shopify isn't sustainable.The major data point to consider with Shopify is revenue. As long as it continues to grow in that area, it's going to find share price support. Even after a slight decline in reported revenue growth trajectory in the last reporting period, after a brief correction, the share price once again, took off.For this reason, I see Shopify being a bargain at its temporarily corrected price, even though it has already made a nice upward move since the overreaction by the market to the Supreme Court decision.When Internet e-commerce emerged, primarily represented by Amazon, retailers and states tried to immediately push the narrative that Amazon had a competitive advantage from it not having to pay taxes in states it had no physical presence in, suggesting the reason people shopped on Amazon was the tax advantage.With the decision by the Supreme Court that favored South Dakota, the obvious implication is it set a precedent that will inevitably result in most, if not all states requiring e-commerce companies to collect sales taxes.The initial market response hit the e-commerce complex as a whole, including Shopify, which took about an 18 percent hit. Since then the sector has started to rebound, and should return back to where it was trading before the court decision.As it relates to Shopify, this isn't going to have much if any impact on the long-term performance of the company. After all, does any thinking person really believe the main reason for the success of e-commerce came from tax avoidance at the state level?The key reasons for the ongoing embracing of e-commerce is because of convenience, selection and competitive pricing. Those have always been the catalysts, and they will continue to be. This plays very well into the strengths of Shopify, and will continue to do so.Since the 2nd quarter of 2015, Shopify has beaten every quarter with revenue and earnings per share. These have been the main catalysts for the company, with revenue being the more weighty of the two. In the early growth stages of Internet companies, the market rewards consistent revenue growth far more than any other factor, and also punishes them based upon the same criteria.The idea is investors want to see the company investing in scaling first, and eventually look at widening margins and boosting earnings afterwards. So the fact Shopify has been able to do both while growing exponentially, is a powerful testimony to its business model. Part of that is probably because it has been able to do this while having zero debt; an unusual element in this market sector.In the last reporting period Shopify generated $214.3 million in revenue, up 68 percent year-over-year. Leading the way was Merchants Solutions revenue, which accounted for $114.1 million, up 75 percent. It also accounted for more than half the overall revenue of the company, and that should continue in the future, which is a more favorable mix if you believe the negative sentiment of the bears concerning its subscription service revenue.The strong performance of the Merchants Solutions segment came from the increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which climbed to $8 billion, a gain of 64 percent. Both Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital grew by over 50 percent year-over-year.While Merchants Revenue was strong, revenue growth in Subscription Solutions was robust as well, generating $100 million in the quarter, up 61 percent year-over-year. Recurring revenue came in at $32.5 million, a gain of 57 percent. Shopify Plus accounted for 22 percent of MRR, up 5 percent from the 1st quarter of 2017.Net income in the quarter was $4.2 million, or $0.04 per share. Last year in the same reporting period it was a net loss of $3.5 million, or ($0.04).Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion, approximately $650 million above where it stood at the close of 2017.Until a significant change in the revenue growth numbers in particular happens, I don't see Shopify going through any long-term correction.For full-year 2018, the company raised its outlook for revenue to a range of $1-$1.01 billion, up from the previous guidance of $970-$990 million. If it reaches the upper end of the range, it would result in revenue climbing about 51 percent for the year. I think that may be a modest outlook, but we'll have to wait and see.My reason for thinking guidance is conservative is the company has integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay services within its ecosystem, and combined with its Instagram channel, has resulted in Shopify's user base expanding. That should continue for some time.In the case of Instagram, it has expanded its shopping reach to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. in March of 2018. These are significant markets that could surprise to the upside in overall sales, increasing its top line.As for growth in mobile sales, merchants using Shopify enjoyed a 75 percent boost in traffic, along with an increase of 64 percent in orders in the quarter. In the same reporting period of 2017, mobile traffic was up 69 percent, and orders climbed 59 percent.In regard to its merchant base, its partner referral program will grow the number of merchants in its system going forward, which will also add to revenue.Over the last five years Shopify revenue as soared at a compounded rate of about 95 percent annually. With almost doubling sales every year, it's highly disingenuous for shorts and bears to suggest the company is going to implode and the share price plunge.Shopify won't have to grow at those past rates to maintain momentum, but it will need to show it can continue to grow even if it starts to slowly decelerate. I'm not convinced that will necessarily happen in the near term, but with the company as it is, it's a possibility.The major weakness in the bear case for Shopify is the targeting of its subscription service, with little to say about its merchant solutions business.That's interesting in that merchant solutions accounts for over 50 percent of Shopify's revenue, as it continues to grow at a pace of well over 70 percent annually.The merchant business of Shopify, even if I were to cede the point of the bears that its subscription service is subject to a lot of risk, is a very sustainable business, as it serves in the picks-and-shovels part of business, including a variety of payment systems, shipping and inventory management, among other services. It not only competes in the e-commerce sector here, but also provides services for physical stores.Shopify has also been working on building out its cannabis business, first winning a deal to run cannabis sales in Ontario, and recently to do the same in British Columbia.It's also entering into the private side of the business in Canada, entering into deals with Canopy Growth Corp. and The Hydropothecary Corp.How it works in each market will be different, as some of the deals are centralized and others decentralized. Ontario is an example of the industry in the province being run centrally.Taking into account the centralized and decentralized nature of the cannabis industry in Canada, as it relates to each Province, it's impossible to know at this time how much this will add to the top and bottom lines of Shopify, as in some cases it'll have to make deals from vendor to vendor, in case of the private sector.Being based in Canada, and including the existing trade differences, it's difficult to know whether or not Shopify will win business in the U.S., but if it gains more clients in Canada alone, it could be another meaningful revenue stream that would at least partially mitigate some of the perceived risk associated with its subscription business.At this time the market isn't pricing in potential cannabis sales for Shopify, which provides another opportunity to surprise in the quarters ahead, once recreational sales begin in Canada.There have been other concerns raised by shorts concerning Shopify, including the impact of Facebook changing its policies in relationship to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The problem there is analysts with a bearish outlook assume many of the leading stores within Shopify's ecosystem will be negatively impacted by Facebook, even though there is no factual basis in that assumption; it's simply a theory thrown about that lacks credibility at this time.After all, who knows how Facebook will differentiate quality stores from dubious stores. I don't think Shopify's stores operating on Facebook's platform will be hit hard by the policy changes. I think Facebook is thinking differently in that regard. This goes back to those that don't like Shopify's business model on the subscription side, where the assertions by Citron of it taking advantage of customers, which will lead it to conflict with the FTC.My advice to Citron would be to stop trying to creatively find issues with Shopify, stop shorting the company, and enjoy the ride by taking a position in it. After all, they have surely heard of stop losses, haven't they? The same is of course true with individual investors.If you like the potential of Shopify, but are concerned about their long-term prospects, put a stop loss in place, and as the share price continues to rise, if it appears valuations aren't sustainable, just tighten up your stop losses. How hard is that to do?As for my conclusion, I don't see the market punishing Shopify as long as it continues to grow revenue. This is what the market looks for in an e-commerce company as it scales, and it will continue to reward shareholders as long as it continues.It's probable, based upon the performance over the last few years, and the guidance of the company, that revenue growth, while remaining strong, is likely to pull back some over the next couple of quarters. That could push the share price temporarily downward, but I don't see it having a long-term impact if the fundamentals remain in place, which I believe they will.In the short term Shopify remains a great trade. Further out, it could experience a season of slowing revenue growth, even though it could remain at about an annual 50 percent pace. I think that's a conservative estimate.When considering Gross Merchandise Volume was only $8 billion, there is an enormous amount of potential to increase that well beyond that figure in the years ahead.I think there is a lot of upward movement left in the share price of Shopify, and even though it has recovered some of the 18 percent in share price it recently lost, it's still a good entry point.Just be sure if you place a stop loss on your shares that you don't have it so tight at this time that it can be relatively easily triggered. You don't want to sell yourself out of some good gains.Finally, there are some things to watch with Shopify, including the already-mentioned slowdown in growth, along with the GAAP increase in loss per share, and the operating loss in 2018 on a GAAP basis.These aren't to be neglected, but they aren't what will determining the performance of this e-commerce company. Revenue will remain the key catalyst until it isn't. That day isn't here yet, and shareholders should still enjoy growth from Shopify for some time."
4182450,104556,2018-06-18T20:21:08-04:00,"Shopify has an incredible CEO and company culture.The company is extremely innovative which has translated into hyper-growth for some time now.Though it trades somewhat expensively today, this company has room to run.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is an absolute firecracker and the stock has quintupled in the past few years. But the journey for this company is only beginning. This article will be a deep dive into the qualitative aspects of Shopify and why it looks to be a fantastic business for many years to come. First, we will take a brief look at the CEO, then dive into the details of the business, looking at its innovation and company culture, moving on to risks and ending with a look at the financials.The story of how Shopify got to where it stands today is fascinating. If you want to explore it more in-depth, this article is a must-read. But to sum it up, most of the credit can be due to Tobi Lutke, the 37-year-old billionaire programming-genius CEO.Tobi makes it a point to make those around him uncomfortable. He is constantly pushing his employees to push the boundaries of what they think is possible. Apparently, working for him is difficult, but he gets the best out of people. He is a crucial part of why Shopify is winning and will continue to do so.In 2015, the company IPO’d at $17 per share. A little more than three years later, Shopify is almost a ten-bagger. In three years! The growth of the company has been nothing less than breath-taking. But our job isn’t to dwell on the past if we so-called “missed the boat,” our job is to examine the facts of the present and see if it makes sense to invest in a company for the future. Dwelling on the past is terribly easy, but it’s also useless.Shopify does just what its name implies. The suffix -ify means, “to make.” Essentially, Shopify makes shops for businesses, online shops that is.Subscriptions start at $29 per month for the basic plan and it breaks into three tiers with the next level at $79/month, and $299/month for the Advanced plan. Subscriptions made up 47% of total sales in the latest quarter. The other 53% is made up of merchant solutions. This consists of all the other add-ons, including Shopify Payments, Shipping, and Capital amongst other capabilities.Source: Investor Slide DeckIn a nutshell, Shopify offers anything an entrepreneur could need, even bricks-and-mortar competencies like point-of-sale hardware and inventory management. The company’s mission is to make commerce better for everyone. Notice there is no ‘e’ in front of the commerce. Shopify believes that multi-channel selling is necessary in today’s environment and it is consistently ahead of the curve when it comes to enabling businesses to thrive with technology.The latest count for total merchants is over 609,000 from 175 countries, with the U.S. accounting for 56% of that total. But a lot of those 609,000 customers are small operations that do not provide much fire power for Shopify. Where it gets really interesting is Shopify Plus, a $2,000/month subscription offered for high volume customers including Red Bull, Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY), Budweiser (NYSE:BUD), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The majority of GMV (gross merchandise volume) comes from these bigger customers. One might think that big players like this might do everything in-house for selling, but it turns out that it is just so much easier using Shopify. Now there are over 3,600 Shopify Plus subscribers.At a yearly subscription of $24,000 that yields revenue of $86.4 million. Shopify will probably reach somewhere around $450 in subscription revenues for 2018. This means that .6% of the total merchants (3,600/609,000) make up nearly 20% of the subscription revenues. So this category of Shopify Plus is really important to the business.Naturally, the company is servicing the bigger merchants really well. B2B (business-to-business) operations and other ways to improve the Plus experience were discussed at length on the last call. And get this, Shopify Plus was only started in 2014. Going forward it will be important for investors to monitor the development of this aspect of the business.Source: Investor Slide DeckWhen your CEO is a programming wizard, it’s likely your organization will be fairly innovative. This is the case at Shopify. Press releases resemble Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) where the latest advances go on for more paragraphs than one thinks is possible. This section will explore the latest of Shopify’s innovation because, at the end of the day, the most innovative companies usually win.Below is an aggregation of the most important innovations since the company went public.(source: press releases for the past three years)Source: Investor Slide DeckThe point is: Shopify is innovative and it is working.The company culture he has built is one of the main reasons Shopify has been so successful. Let’s look at the core values to get started…The Core Values:1. Get sh*t done2. Build for the long term3. Focus on simple solutions4. Act like owners5. Thrive on changeTo follow that up, here is a blurb from the annual report,As we have established, there is a huge focus on innovation. But even with great innovations, the company is not without risks….Shopify, like any other business, has risks. But here are the main risks to look for to determine if Shopify is on the right track to continue winning.Risk #1: CompetitionThe e-commerce software is decently crowded. There are really a few main players besides Shopify.Big Commerce is publicly held company based out of Texas that sells multi-channel e-commerce solutions. The company’s website looks fairly similar to Shopify’s, but I guess how much can you differentiate the website when you basically do the same thing. The pricing is also nearly identical, but the Pro edition is $50 cheaper per month. It also has a section for enterprise, which is point out cheaper than Shopify Plus and Magento. Speaking of Magento…2. MagentoMagento was recently bought out for almost $1.7 billion by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company is obviously smaller than Shopify but it will be interesting to see how Adobe can leverage its technology.3. Woo CommerceWoo Commerce is owned by the famous WordPress blogging site. Interestingly, the company seemed to do some backwards vertical integration to e-commerce from blogging. It was a smart way to do it since there are so many WordPress blogs out there. But I am not sure a lot of them started a blog to sell products. Anyways, that is similar to the next competitor.4. Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX)Wix is the master of website building. The company boasts over 110 million users. Most of those being freely built websites. However, it does include e-commerce capabilities, albeit the depth of multi-channel offerings is slimmer than Shopify.5. Square (NYSE:SQ)Square looks to be formidable. The payments processor specialist has really expanded its multi-channel presence, it even bought Weebly, a big competitor to Wix, for $365 million recently. Square has a stronger hold on the physical retail presence with the infamous Square POS (point-of-sale) system but it is quickly building out stronger online capabilities. However, I do think this space is big enough for a couple big fish. In the US alone, there are 28 million small businesses.This is a very rough calculation, but if there are 3,600 Shopify Plus customers out of 609,000, that still leaves 605,400 normal customers. If Shopify does $450 million in subscription revenue and $86.4 of that is from Plus, $363.6 million is left over. That comes out to $600 of subscription sales per customer annually. If we multiply that number by 29 million small business, we get a total addressable market of nearly $17 billion. That means Shopify has less than 3% of the e-commerce subscription market. This isn’t even counting Shopify Plus opportunities. So with that said, there looks to be enough market to go around between Shopify and Square. Below are Shopify’s own estimates.Source: Investor Slide DeckRisk #2: Shopify Plus ProblemsLike mentioned before, Shopify Plus is key for the business. If enterprises think they can do the e-commerce operations on their own, then that becomes a problem. Granted, the biggest businesses will most likely have the resources to do this but a lot of the second tier firms, will choose Shopify. It kind of reminds me of the Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) situation where Uber (NYSE:UBER) was paying so much that it decided to take the communications platform in-house. The essential question is: is the value proposition so great and simple, that firms would be dumb to choose in-house?Here, there are a few reasons in favor of Shopify Plus. For one, the model is not based on consumption as much as Twilio’s. As UBER became bigger and scaled, it had to pay proportionally more for Twilio’s services. Shopify does, of course, have the merchant side of the business but most of those options require fees wherever you go. For instance, if you want to sell online, you will have to pay credit card fees no matter what. Shopify’s model is therefore more sustainable.Second, Shopify has a broad customer offering. Once you run your whole business through Shopify and realize how simple it is, switching everything over would be a nightmare.Third, in the latest quarter, over 50% of new Plus member were new logos, meaning that they didn’t “graduate” from the Advanced level. Typically, Shopify users scale up their business to Plus, but this latest quarter was a strong sign that isn’t the norm nowadays. Here’s a quote from Harvey Finkelstein, the COO on the last call,Moreover, the company added Plus merchants at an accelerated rate compared to last year. Here is more from Mr. Finkelstein,So Shopify Plus looks to be in a good position right now. Included below, are the monthly recurring revenues (MRR) for Plus since 2016. This number is smaller than the $86.4 number because it is as a percentage of MRR. MRR for Shopify is typically one-third of total subscription numbers because it is broken down into months of the quarter. But it is helpful to look at the growth rates of these numbers as it shows you just how powerful this segment can become.Shopify Plus Sales(Source: Author’s calculations, in millions, based on % of MRR cited in every earnings call)Year-over-Year Growth Rates(Source: Author’s calculations)Sequential, Quarter-over-Quarter Growth(Source: Author’s calculations)Risk #3: Valuation ConcernsThe market cap for Shopify is around $17.4 billion with cash of $1.6 billion. So the enterprise value comes out to be around $15.8 billion. Forward guidance is $1 billion for the year. Shopify almost always under-promises and over-delivers on the revenue front so it is likely that the number will come in higher, probably around 1.05 billion, meaning low 50% year-over-year growth.So that comes out to 15x forward sales. Definitely not cheap, but Shopify has never been cheap. A few years of 50% growth would bring that EV/sales ratio way down. If the company can produce 50% growth two years out, it brings that ratio down to 7x. But at the end of the day, a company is valued based on cash flows, but investors are not buying this name for cash flow strength. It is on the assumption that hyper-growth will continue to take market share and then operating leverage in the future. It is easy to value slow-growing companies but hyper-growth, not so much.Could 15x sales be expensive? Sure. Is it? I’m not convinced. If you plan on holding this company for more than 3-5 years, with the growth it has achieved and its competitive positioning in the market, it is likely to eclipse a higher enterprise value than $16 billion. Shopify has been one of the higher valued names in the technology space, going for 20x sales during some periods. But the business has not slowed down. It is still performing excellently.In the last quarter, total revenue grew 68%. 68%! Down from 75% posted in last year’s first quarter. Gross margins ticked up to 58%, even in the face of rapid 75% growth in lower margin Merchant Solutions. The CFO noted,Clearly, Shopify Shipping and Capital are also ramping up as part of the Merchant Solutions. However, the company isn’t quite profitable. On an adjusted basis, it barely broke even but it is still in the phase of rapidly spending to grow market share. With such a big opportunity in front of it, it would probably be irresponsible to not re-invest into the business. With plenty of cash on hand, a -3% free cash flow margin isn’t too worrisome.The company has gone from 800 to 3,200 employees in only a couple years, so stock-based compensation has risen considerably, expected to be $110 million for the full year. So it comes out to be about 11% of revenue, which is high but not outlandish in today’s tech scene. Especially considering how hard it is to recruit great R&D talent in today’s marketplace, that number isn’t too bad when you expand your workforce by a multiple of 4. Here is a word on that from the COO,If Shopify can continue this ridiculous reign of growth and show some additional operating leverage, this company’s valuation today might not be all too bad.Shopify is the leader in e-commerce software. Growth has been nothing short of incredible and so investors have seen the stock up ever since the IPO. However, the company keeps executing and so, in a few years’ time, some people may be looking back and saying, “I wish I had started a position in Shopify even though it had already gone up so much.” Only, mediocre companies revert to the mean, excellent companies keep on running.To end, here is a quote to chew on from Amy Shapero, the new CFO, who replaced Russ Jones after he retired,Go ahead, SHOP till you drop…Source: Investor Slide Deck"

Otherwise, growth would grind to a halt.Facebook is going after low-quality stores advertising in its news feed, and we believe this will have a significant impact on Shopify's GMV and revenue.","[Update - July 1, 2018]: On Friday June 29, we discovered a mistake in the second of the two churn models we used in this report. Because of our conscience we believe it is correct to issue a revision that can be found here. Based on correcting the mistake, we now believe that 77% of customers churn off before reaching their first anniversary as opposed to 85% in the original report. Also, our estimate of customer lifetime of newly acquired customers goes from 14 months to 15.58 months. We also raise our price target from $60 to $65.Shopify (SHOP) is a high-flying SaaS e-commerce company focusing on the SMB segment which floated in May 2015 at $17 and currently trades at $153 as of June 25. It hence boasts a $16.27 billion market cap and an Enterprise Value of $14.77 billion (it has $1.5 billion in cash), according to Yahoo Finance. Shopify has become a Wall Street darling due to its hypergrowth, showing 65% revenue growth as recently as its last quarterly earnings on May 1, 2018. The company is guiding to revenues of $1 billion this year and is trading at a sky-high EV/2018 rev multiple of 14.77x, according to Bloomberg. The majority of Shopify’s revenue is not subscription license revenue but merchant solutions revenue with a much lower gross margin. It isn’t profitable and spends 61% of its gross margin just on sales and marketing. Wall Street expects Shopify to eventually become highly profitable by cutting S&M spend and spreading its R&D and General & Administrative costs across a much larger revenue base with revenue nicely stable and predictable due to its SaaS subscription nature. Shopify management have been very skillful in supporting this picture.In this report, we will attempt to prove that Wall Street has gotten Shopify completely wrong. We think that Andrew Left of Citron Research was right about many of the allegations he made against Shopify in his report. He just really didn’t have the data to back them up to be undisputable (but hats off to his intuition). We think we do, and we will also show much more. We will prove our investment thesis with myriad pieces of data nobody has ever published before and show that Shopify’s true value is nowhere near its current market cap. At this point in time, we are quite in the contrarian camp on Shopify. Out of the 28 analysts covering Shopify, 27 have a BUY or HOLD rating on the stock and only 1 has a SELL. We believe Wall Street will take note of our findings, and the stock should start re-rating very soon. These are our key findings for which we will show evidence further on in the report:Source: SimilarWebThe reason SaaS enterprise companies command very high EV/Revenue multiples is due to the fact that their customer churn rates are remarkably small, their dollar net retention rates most often positive (they manage to expand revenues per client over time), and their customer lifetimes are very long. According to Tomasz Tunguz from RedPoint Ventures, a firm with $3.8 billion assets under management, a typical SaaS enterprise firm has a 6-10% annual customer churn. Think of companies like Salesforce (CRM), WorkDay (WDAY), ServiceNow (NOW) or Ultimate Software (ULTI) in this category. With a 10% annual customer churn rate, the average customer lifetime is 10 years. This comp group currently trades (as of June 21, 2018) at a blended forward 7.1x EV/Revenue multiple according to our Bloomberg terminal. Shopify trades at 13.3x blended forward EV/REV and about 16x 2018 revenues. We assume this is because the market believes that Shopify has to have superior growth rates and similar churn metrics like the comp group.So, in our research on Shopify, we thought a great starting point would be to analyze Shopify customer churn metrics. Typically, with other SaaS companies that is quite simple – you look into their annual reports. With Shopify, it’s different. Shopify only discloses a certain metric it calls Monthly Billings Retention Rate, which it describes as:MBRR is calculated as of the end of each month by considering the cohort of merchants on the Shopify platform as of the beginning of the month and dividing total billings attributable to this cohort in the then - current month by total billings attributable to this cohort in the immediately preceding month. Shopify releases this number once a year in its Full Year results and has always claimed that it is higher than 100%. We think this number is a meaningless metric to describe Shopify’s quality of revenue and customer cohorts because it allows Shopify to cleverly hide customer churn. It covers total Customer Billings – which not only include the most coveted license revenue but also Merchant solutions revenue. This covers up the fact that Shopify loses a ton of clients (and the most valuable Subscription solutions revenue with it) through the fact that the surviving clients start generating much less valuable Merchant solutions revenue with low Gross Margins. The disappearing subscription revenue is replaced essentially with low margin payment revenue. If Shopify would publish a metric called Monthly Gross Margin Retention Rate, it would definitely be negative (i.e. less than 100%). That’s why it invented a metric that isn’t. Since we find the MBRR metric as hiding customer churn, we had to come up with our own way of determining Shopify’s customer churn rates. This was quite a challenge, but in the end, we think we prevailed.So, what did we do? We did a detailed analysis of the .com zone file managed by Verisign (VRSN). The zone file is a list of all registered domains in the .com universe that are active. There obviously are other domains, but .com is by far the most important and most representative. Getting access to the zone file isn’t easy – only domain registrars have access so we partnered up with oneFirst, we downloaded the entire zone file, which is 134,500,000 .com domains. Then we attempted to find all the domains within this universe that are hosted by Shopify. Shopify has this following IP address range: 23.227.32.0/19. We came up with 753,000 domains. That’s a lot of domains running on Shopify, in the perspective of all .com domains in existence that’s 0.56%.The first thing we did was to analyze the age (defined by their creation date) of all these Shopify domains. We came up with this:Source: Our analysis of the zone fileThe fact that domains 1 year or younger comprise 57% of all the domains hosted by Shopify is quite striking. These are all new clients for Shopify less a few that point their domain to Shopify and never start paying after the 14-day free trial. It’s important to note that less serious people starting on Shopify do not even bother to operate on their own domain and select to host on a myshopify.com subdomain. Churn for this group is obviously larger than for clients selecting to operate on their own domain name. We believe that pretty much everyone with their own domain name became a paying Shopify customer. Approximately half of new domains (i.e. freshly registered) are registered through Shopify, so all these are paying customers straight away because they make the payment for the domain to Shopify. Hence, with all likelihood the 405,000 domains represent new Shopify customers or past new Shopify customers (a significant amount of them are already dead).We then proceeded to measure Shopify customer churn using two different methods.In the first, we identified all domains out of these 405,000 that have an expiration date over a 5-day period comprising of June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13, and June 14, 2018, and watched what happened to these domains. We also split these domains into 3 categories according to their age: 1-year old domains (experiencing their first renewal), 2-year-old domains (second renewal) and 3-year-old domains (third renewal). We ignored older domains because the sample sizes were getting small. This is what we found:Source: Our analysis of the zone fileWhen we looked at the 1-year old category, we found that 1 day after the expiration date, only 1,312 out of the total 4,003 had functioning Shopify stores – only 32.78%. The remainder didn’t – the vast majority of these typically showed a parked page (on the expiration date a domain falls into a 40-day redemption period before it is deleted, in which the registrar points the domain to a parking page to make a little revenue from remaining traffic). These are all dead clients for Shopify that churned off within a 1-year time period. Over a 5-day period, the total number of 1-year old domains lost through the expiration process came to 2,691. That’s an average of 538.2 domains per day.In the 2-year-old category, the survival rate was 51.09%, which means a huge 48.91% of domains still churned even in by the end of year 2. In the 3-year-old category, the survival rate goes up only marginally from 51.09% to 57.09% and the third-year churn is still a very high 42.1%.Bottom line: Using this method, we have found that only 32.2% of clients survive their first year at Shopify, implying a 0.678 churn rate in new clients over 1 year. If we would solely rely on this method to measure Shopify churn, we can derive the average customer lifetime, which would be calculated as 1/0.678 = 1.47 years, which is 17.7 months. By itself a very low number in comparison to real SaaS companies.However, we had a hunch that the number of surviving clients might still be too high and the churn too low because we didn’t capture all those domains that were hosted by Shopify and had already left before their expiration date (Us downloading and analyzing the .com zone file just gave us a current snapshot of the situation, not historical data of the past). So, we looked at churn through a second method.Again, we started out with the total number of domains hosted by Shopify (753,000) and watched how many domains stop being hosted by Shopify on a day to day basis – domains that churn off. We did this for a 10-day period between 10 June and 19 June. We have found that, on average, 2,365.8 domain names leave Shopify every day on average (We know this number looks shockingly high, but Shopify still manages to replace them with incoming new domains. This just shows what a churn factory Shopify is) and looked at how many of these were less than 1 year old and it came in as follows:Source: Our analysis of the .com zone fileIf we multiply the average number of domains 1 year and younger leaving Shopify every day by the 365 days, we get 378,140 domains. Now, we know that Shopify has approximately 405,000 domains hosted that are 1 year or younger. If the base of 405,000 domains would be the same over time, this would mean that 93.4% of domains churn off before reaching their first anniversary. However, it is fair to note that this method is vulnerable to changes in the base number. If we would rely on this method to calculate new customer Shopify lifetime, we would come to 1/0.934 = 1.07 years, which is 12.85 months.We think the truth about the churn rate of new customers is somewhere between both methods so between 67.8% and 93.4%, but closer to the higher bound. Let’s assume it is 85%. That would mean the average customer lifetime is 1/0.85, which is 1.17 years, which is a little bit over 14 months. Enterprise grade SaaS companies boast 10-year customer lifetimes.Looking at the number of domains Shopify adds and loses in .com, we obviously also think the total number of Shopify clients is plateauing (in the 10-day period we observed that the number of lost and added domains was basically the same number) and that’s probably why Shopify opted to start disclosing the total number of active merchants only once per year (at year end). The number of clients growing is now very dependent on Shopify’s international expansion. If you would look at the various country code domains of countries Shopify is focusing on, you would see the number of added domains outnumbering the domains lost, we believe we don’t have access to the various country code domain zone files, so we can’t provide exact numbers for that though. But it’s obvious that .com is very dominant for Shopify.What is the really bad news for Shopify’s business model and its investors is the fact that domains that are between 1 year and 2 years are also showing very high churn (i.e. a sizeable chunk leaves Shopify every day). Using the expiration method above, only 51% survive their second-year anniversary. Taking into account that quite a few domains leave before their expiration, this percentage is still higher. Data for domains between 2 years and 3 years old show just relatively marginal improvements in churn than their 1 to 2 year old cousins.Do you seriously still want to pay 16x forecasted 2018 Revenues for Shopify?You may argue that the churn in customers is not necessarily so important if Shopify’s revenue doesn’t churn. Shopify claims that revenue from every cohort of customers they acquire is stable over time, which they illustrate by a metric called Monthly Billings Retention Rate (disclosed once per year) and have always reported this to be over 100%. As we already said, we find this metric a very flawed indicator of the quality of cohorts for one simple reason: It mixes together high value subscription solutions revenue (gross margin 76.9% in Q1 2018) with low value merchant solutions revenue (gross margin 41.1% in Q1 2018). We believe this metric is marketed by Shopify management because it smartly hides the fact that the gross margin contribution from these cohorts declines over time. By how much? It would be nice if management starts disclosing a new metric called Monthly Gross Margin Retention Rate, so we would know.Before Shopify management take us up on this, we have to go for our own estimate. We bring in our customer churn model that shows that 85% of Shopify clients are dead in 1 year or less. So, in an example, let’s assume Shopify signs up 100 new paying customers on Day 1 that pay Shopify $52 a month average subscription (this is roughly the average price Shopify customers pay. We got this number by taking Q4 MRR and dividing by active number of clients). At this point, these are completely new stores that are not doing any revenue so they are not doing any merchant solutions revenue for Shopify (Merchant solution revenue is predominantly revenue generated through payments). At this point, all the revenue Shopify is getting from this cohort of 100 stores is 100% Subscription revenue with a 76.9% Gross Margin. In one year's time we know that Shopify is left with only 15 stores (15% survival rate based on 85% churn rate from our churn model above). Now, the big question is what the subscription revenue from these stores is. Let’s assume 3 different scenarios. One is ultra conservative in which the subscription fee is the same at $52/month per store. In this case, Shopify didn’t manage to move any of these stores to higher paying plans. The second one is optimistic and assumes that Shopify has managed to extract 65% more subscription revenue from these stores so they are paying $85.8/month/average. And then, we also include a super optimistic scenario in which Shopify extracts 130% more so the average subscription is $119.6/month. We also know that Shopify claims a 100% or slightly higher Monthly Billings Retention Rate, which means the remaining revenue has to be coming in as Merchant solutions revenue. So, let’s assume that in 12 months’ time, the revenue from this cohort of stores is 110% of what it was on Day 1. And now look at this table. It says a lot:Source: Our own modelIf we assume that the optimistic scenario with a monthly $85.8 is the most likely, then this shows that the same cohort of stores is contributing 29.6% less Gross Margin than 12 months ago! In our customer churn model above, we have shown how many stores are expected to die over the following 12 and 24 months so you can do the modelling yourself of what gross margin this cohort brings over the next couple of years.In the world of real SaaS companies (We hope that by now you are with us that Shopify isn’t one them), there is this one super important metric called dollar-based net retention rate which is used to measure revenue churn. We’ll borrow AppDynamics’s description:In real SaaS-land, only subscription revenue is counted towards the Dollar based net retention rate. The most successful companies have Dollar based net retention rates of 130% across a 12-month period. This means that the subscription revenue of the cohort actually increases by 30% over a 12-month period – these companies are skilled at moving their clients to higher paying plans, up-selling other SaaS services etc. If we would look at Shopify’s pure subscription revenue, this metric basically turns out terrible for Shopify. If we would take into account new Shopify paying customers and the total subscription revenue of the cohort after 12 months, we would come to these following dollar revenue retention rates using the pessimistic, optimistic and super optimistic scenarios we provided:Source: Our modellingI don’t think it is completely fair to Shopify to completely ignore the merchant solutions revenue because it does behave relatively predictably (however less predictably than the street thinks as we will show further in this report) but is definitely less stable than the subscription revenue so it should have a haircut to its value. Because of the different margins for Subscription and Merchant solutions revenue, we will use the respective gross margins to calculate this Dollar-based retention rate, and we will assign the Merchant solutions gross margin various weightings – we use 30%, 50% and 70% (meaning that Shopify Merchant solutions gross margin is only 30, 50 and 70% as valuable compared to subscription gross margin). For Shopify’s sake, we even include 100%. These are the Dollar based expansion rates we get under the various scenarios and weightings:Source: Our modellingFor the sake of comparison with all the other real SaaS names, let’s settle for the optimistic scenario (Shopify manages to extract 65% more subscription revenue from the stores that survived 1 year) and attributing 50% value to the Merchant solutions gross margin, we get to a Dollar-based retention rate of 47.53%. I am calling this rate Shopify Adjusted in the table below. That is indeed a very very low number. Pacific Crest have put together a fantastic table with the respective Dollar retention rates of various publicly traded SaaS companies at the time of their IPOs.We’ve decided to select a couple of them along with their Dollar based retention rates and we add their 2018 EV/REV multiples using June 21. stock prices.Source: BlueCrest and Bloomberg terminalAs you can see, Shopify’s Adjusted Annual Dollar Retention rate is a paltry 47.53%. On the Pacific Crest list, there isn’t a single SaaS name with a lower dollar retention rate than 80%. In this perspective, it seems absolutely crazy that Shopify is trading at a forecast 2018 EV/REV multiple of 15.83. Since Shopify has lower gross margins than the other SaaS players, the difference would be even more glaring if we would look at 2018 EV/GM multiples. True, Shopify is growing its revenue 68% y-o-y, but this revenue can be classed as absolute garbage compared to the other SaaS players. Okta is growing over 60% y-o-y, but it has a huge dollar retention rate of 123% (and also a better gross margin) and hence trades at a 21.06 multiple. If we would compare Okta and Shopify, Okta could be called a complete bargain. Never in our lives would have we thought that we would be calling a company trading at 21x revenue a bargain. Only next to Shopify!As we have mentioned before, we truly believe that Shopify cannot be compared to other players in the SaaS sector and hence cannot deserve a SaaS multiple. Shopify has made a complete mocking of the term Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). Actually, how can it even be called monthly recurring revenue if it’s clearly not recurring but churning like crazy.Or did Square (SQ) just pay fair value and the market is valuing Shopify at insane levels if we use Weebly as a benchmark? On April 26. Jack Dorsey’s Square announced that it is acquiring Weebly for $365 million in a cash and stock deal. More details about the acquisition such as revenue or EBITDA multiples were scarce. Why was the news scarce? Our belief is that Square was basically arbitraging its own crazy 2018 EV/REV multiple of 18x. But the press release did mention Weebly has 625,000 paying subscribers. That got us thinking and digging.Because 625,000 paying subscribers is quite a lot. Shopify itself claims to have something like 600,000+ clients. Obviously, Weebly is much more of a website builder than a store builder but it does have its own e-commerce offering as well. So, we went searching for a benchmark to Weebly to figure out how much revenue could it possibly be generating per paying subscriber. Fortunately, there is WIX (WIX) which is publicly traded. And it’s exactly and predominantly a website builder that also has an e-commerce solution just like Weebly. Perfect match. In WIX’s Q1 2018 earnings release, we found that WIX had 3,500,000 paying subscribers as of March 31, 2018. They generated $137.77 million of revenue in the quarter. That would be $13.12 per user per month of revenue.If Weebly would generate the same amount per user per month, its 625,000 subscribers would be doing $8.2 million in revenue per month. That comes to $98.4 million annualized. So, we think Jack actually bought Weebly for something like 3.7x annual revenue, and Weebly was also most likely profitable. Not kidding. He just didn’t want to talk about it. So, people would keep on paying that crazy 2018 EV/REV multiple of 18x for Square itself.We understand people look at website builders as a little old school and that website builder valuations cannot be compared to sexy e-commerce SaaS providers like Shopify. But website builder revenues are really recurring license revenue whereas the bigger part of Shopify revenues are Merchant solutions revenues that we argued are less valuable than the subscription sort, right?Since we are a curious bunch we kept on asking ourselves that there must be some kind of catch that would explain why Jack could pick up Weebly so cheap. Well, it’s obvious Shopify is growing its revenue faster than Weebly but maybe the relative cheapness of Weebly could be explained by its subpar churn rates and Dollar-based retention rates. Definitely worse than Shopify’s, right? How could we find out?You guessed it. We did the same analysis of the .com zone file for Weebly just like we did for Shopify. And we were really surprised by the results.On June 25. There were 738,386 .com domains hosted by Weebly (very similar number to Shopify actually) according to our analysis of the .com zone file. This was their age split:Source: Our analysis of .com zone fileSeems like a much healthier split than Shopify. Shopify had 57% of its total domains 1 year or younger. In the case of Weebly, it’s only 21.61%.We also took a look how its domain base is churning. This is the number of domains we observed churning off over a 10-day period:Source: Our analysis of the .com zone fileThe differences in churn were huge. Whereas Weebly was churning off 544 domains average per day from a base of 738,386, Shopify was churning off 2365.8 domains off a base of 765,000 domains. Why is Shopify churning off 4.3x more domains off a portfolio of a very similar size? We think the reason is that people starting stores on Shopify believe they can become rich, as the army of affiliate marketers, or ""partners"" (that's how Shopify calls them), tell them is absolutely possible and just a few clicks away. Whereas when they launch sites or stores on Weebly, they actually start them because they want a nice functioning website or store that they want to keep.The Shopify new born merchants find out the hard way, spending money on Shopify subscriptions, and most of them never even make a sale and leave shortly. That’s why Shopify cohorts churn so bad and Weebly’s don’t, we believe.They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Here are just some examples of how Shopify’s partners are acquiring customers for Shopify on YouTube:Source: YouTube screenshots of videos promoting Shopify as a source of massive incomeShopify simply signed a deal with the devil, and it's going to unravel soon. The devil always wants payback in the end. Shopify became completely addicted to its continuously rising valuation which it was getting for showing hypergrowth. It delivered and is still delivering it by acquiring huge amounts of low quality customers that churn off very quickly. But the problem with this deal with the devil is that it has to keep on increasing the number of new customers it signs up to keep growing because the huge churn of its customer base is catching up with them. And as every online marketer in the world knows, there are diminishing returns on your marketing spend. Each marginal customer you acquire becomes more expensive. And because Shopify has to keep its hyper growth to support its stock price it is trapped with spending a ton of money on sales & marketing. It can’t cut the S&M spend because it’s growth would start grinding to halt and its valuation with it. Actually, as a percentage of revenue, S&M spend is even slightly edging higher year over year as you can see from this table from Shopify’s latest quarterly results:Source: Shopify Q1 2018 earnings releaseLooking at this table, it looks like Shopify overall has very little operating leverage. The roughly 2 percentage point improvement in its loss from operations y-o-y can be explained by the improvement of gross margin in the merchant solutions segment.How was this improvement in Merchant solutions achieved? We don’t really think it came from better terms with card companies, payment providers etc. We think it’s coming from Shopify Capital. Shopify Capital provides Shopify customers with merchant cash advances, which is basically a form of lending, but with a different name (and less regulation). Shopify boasted in its Q1 2018 results that it tripled the amount of cash advances y-o-y to $60.4 million from $18.9 in Q1 2017. The total amount of outstanding cash advances as of March 31 was $63.5 million.Now the question is what kind of Annual Percentage Rate (APR) Shopify is getting on its total outstanding cash advances. Well we think it could be around 30%, possibly even higher. That’s 7.5% a quarter. If we take into account Shopify’s $63.5 million outstanding balance, that would come to $4.76 million of margin per quarter. We think this explains most of the significant improvement of Shopify Merchant solutions gross margin y-o-y from 34.4% to 41%. Shopify did $114.14 million of merchant solutions revenue in Q1 2018.Ethics of lending at high rates aside, it seems like a good business financially. But we know nothing about the credit quality and to what type of customer they are lending. We don’t think the credit quality is very good though. Our hypothesis is that these merchant advances are taken up mostly by the lowest quality Shopify customers – the drop shippers. Genuine businesses don’t borrow for a 30% APR. Drop shippers do because they don’t have a business history and credit history, and that’s the only way they can fund their growth. This whole system works until something changes. Then you’re just left with a toxic non-performing loan portfolio and you’re nursing losses.Well we think this ""something"" will be Facebook cleaning up its advertising feed. These drop shippers are in most cases totally reliant on acquiring traffic through Facebook and Instagram. If this traffic source is cut off, so is their revenue. This affects Shopify significantly through reducing its payment revenue from these clients and also Shopify’s capability to collect its outstanding cash advances because they are taken from the customers' revenue. Typically, 10% of daily revenue. If a drop shippers revenue drops 90% overnight you know what that means to Shopify’s ability to collect these cash advances.We think this cleanup of the advertising feed is just around the corner. On June 12, The WSJ reported that Facebook is offering a new feature that will let users rate shopping that stems from Facebook ads and Facebook will start banning low quality stores. Facebook is obviously acting in its long-term interest here because otherwise it risks that people will click less on the ads in its newsfeed, which is the bread and butter of its business. And we believe blue-chip advertisers also can’t be too happy to appear next to products promoted in the news feed like this:Source: BlueCrate.comThe soap dispenser in the shape of a nose is our team favorite.We think these changes are going to hit Shopify pretty hard. How hard? How possibly could we find out? Well we ran all 765,000 the domains hosted by Shopify through SimilarWeb (expensive!), a service that tracks visitor numbers. We compiled a list of the 250 most visited stores on Shopify within the .com universe (ranked by the amount of monthly desktop visits). We then went through every single one of them, looked at their traffic patterns, categorized them, retrieved total visits for May 2018 (desktop + mobile) and also looked at their Trustpilot and Facebook reviews. A lot of work indeed.This is what we found out…These top250 stores recorded 71.79 million desktop visits in May 2018 according to SimilarWeb. After manually checking these 250 domains on SimilarWeb, we found out that their total visits (desktop + mobile) was 162 million visits (162/71.9 = 2.25).Now how big is this sample in relation to all the stores hosted by Shopify in the .com universe? The total desktop traffic for all 765,000 stores according to SimilarWeb was 371 million and this also includes 40.4 million from MyShopify.com (the domain on which a lot of very small merchants without their own domain run on). If we multiply by 2.25, we get to 835 million visits on desktop and mobile combined for all domains hosted by Shopify in the .com universe.So, these top250 stores we selected represent 19.4% of all Shopify traffic on .com domains.So how much of Shopify traffic could be affected by the Facebook advertising feed clean up? First, we scanned these for stores with suspicious traffic patterns. We classed stores that saw their traffic more than triple in 6 months as suspicious. Most of the stores actually went from zero traffic to hundreds of thousands or even millions. Most of this new traffic pretty much fall into Shopify’s Q2. We found 29 stores with these traffic patterns representing 19 million total visits in May. That’s 11.7% of all the visits of the top250 stores. We find these to be the slice that is almost certain to be chased off by Facebook because it’s basically all drop shippers selling stuff from China or other low-quality impulse buy types of products shipped locally. We include the traffic patterns of all of these 29 stores. Feel free to look at what these stores sell so you get a good idea. And also look at their reviews on Trustpilot or Facebook and make sure to ignore the fake ones. Well, it won’t be that easy on Facebook because, not surprisingly, all these stores have pretty much banned Facebook reviews on their Facebook pages.Source: SimilarWeb screenshots of individual Shopify stores2sbest.com alone goes from absolutely 0 visits in February to almost 3 million in May. As of June 22, it has 54 ratings on Trustpilot with a rating of 1*. People are reporting that the stuff they ordered and paid for never arrived, that they got completely differently looking dresses etc.So that’s 11.7% of traffic from the suspicious looking traffic category. That’s just the beginning.Let’s continue with FashionNova.com, which according to SimilarWeb data is Shopify’s most visited store with 14 million total visits in May. Now FashionNova.com isn’t probably shipping from China like the drop shippers but it gets terrible ratings on Trustpilot – please just ignore the ones that are obviously fake (even Trustpilot tells you that they have detected a large number of fake reviews). So, we think FashionNova is quite at risk and FashionNova itself represents 8.6% of total visits in the top250 category!If we stay in the category of the biggest of the big (top25) with tragic ratings, you have colourpop.com with 4.1 million visits, 2sbest.com with 2.87 million, mvmtwatches.com with 2.15 million, hawkersco.com with 2 million, kyliecosmetics.com with 1.98 million, morphebrushes.com with 1.86 million. This group represents another 14.96 million visits, which is another 9.2% of the top250’s total visits!And we just looked at the 25 biggest out of the top250. It’s true that these stores are not getting 100% of their traffic from Facebook or Instagram but we think around 80% would be a fair estimate. If Facebook cuts them off, they still have their mailing lists and a few other sources of traffic.Taking a quicker look further down the list we come to the conclusion that roughly 50% of Shopify store traffic could be vulnerable to Facebook cleaning up its advertising feed! It’s obviously a question how aggressively Facebook will deal with this issue and that will determine the level of discomfort of Shopify.50% of traffic doesn’t have to necessarily mean 50% of GMV as well because some of the culled traffic could be less valuable traffic than the un-culled etc. But still we think a lot of GMV is at risk here and it will hurt Shopify a lot. Not only in payment revenue. But paradoxically also in subscription revenue. Because Shopify charges Shopify Plus clients 0.25% of each transaction on top of the $2,000 monthly fee for Shopify Plus. The majority of these Shopify top250 stores are Shopify Plus clients we believe. And then don’t forget about that merchant cash advance portfolio turning sour.Doesn’t it all remind you of a company story we all saw play out in the past? Somebody that grew up with Facebook only to be mercilessly executed by Facebook. Yes, we believe Shopify is very similar to Zynga (ZNGA) in this sense. Good luck.As we mentioned above, we ran the entire list of domains hosted by Shopify through SimilarRank to find the top250 largest Shopify stores. This exercise also enabled us to take a look at how the average store is doing. When Tobias Lutke, CEO of Shopify, was responding to some of the accusations Citron Research made against Shopify in the Q3 2017 earnings conference call this is what he said about Shopify’s client base: ""So even though some entrepreneurs have failed and stop paying $29 per month this floor, hundreds of thousands are thriving and we thrive alongside with them.""So, we went looking for these hundreds of thousands of merchants that are thriving on the Shopify platform.We ran all 765,000 .com domains hosted by Shopify through SimilarRank.Out of the 765,000 domains we ran through SimilarWeb, only 123,400 showed any traffic in May 2018. The remainder showed zero. The total amount of desktop visits all 765,000 Shopify stores recorded in May by SimilarWeb was 371 million, but this includes 40.3 million from MyShopify.com (the domain on which a lot of very small merchants without their own domain run on) so we take MyShopify out and we are left with 330.7 million desktop visits, which means 744 million total visits on desktop and mobile combined.So, we find that the average store has 799 visitors per month and the median store has 0. The averages are supported by some very large stores, just the top250 are doing about 20% of total traffic.So, we took a look at the visitor numbers of the 123,000 that showed traffic and split them up into categories based on the amounts of traffic they received in May and found this:Source: Our zone file analysis data combined with SimilarRank dataNow we understand that most people are not versed in the value of a visit to an e-commerce site, neither are we, so we took the amount of GMV Shopify reported in Q1, which was $8,000 million ($8 billion). We divided that by 3, to get to an average monthly GMV for Q1, which is $2,666 million. Well and then we just divided this monthly GMV number by the total amount of visits Shopify stores received (we include MyShopify.com visits this time) in May – 835 million. We got to $3.1 per reported SimilarWeb visit.So, by this logic 1,000 visits would mean $3,100 in GMV for a store. GMV also includes shipping and taxes, so to get to store revenue from sale of products, you would need to deduct this.If we stick to GMV, this logic would mean that only 57,128 stores on .com domains do over $3,100 of GMV per month and 20,499 stores do over $15,500 in GMV/month.We think that $15,500 in GMV per month is a fair level to use to call a merchant as thriving. It is fair to say that the stores receiving less traffic than the stores receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors could have a higher GMV per SimilarWeb visit than $3.1 because the most visited stores focus on cheaper items, but even if it would be double, it doesn’t really change that much.In any case, it seems that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Shopify customers are seriously not thriving, Tobias. We think you should start disclosing the number of customers doing over $10,000 in GMV per month in your regular quarterly filings by the way.Taking into account that 83.9% of 765,000 domains hosted by Shopify didn’t show any visits in May SimilarWeb) we can obviously state that the customer base of Shopify can’t certainly be classed as healthy. And it explains why the churn numbers of Shopify customers are so astronomic.Shopify Plus is spun by Shopify as a premium service for large merchants and brands that comes with more possibilities to customize storefronts, dedicated account management etc.As of December 31. Shopify Plus had 3,600 merchants and generated MRR of $6.3 million according to its Q4 2018 results and accompanying conference call.In the Q1 2018 earnings release, Shopify said Monthly recurring revenue grew 57% and ended the quarter at $32.5 million. Shopify Plus’s share of this ticked up in the quarter to 22% of MRR, compared to 17% in Q1 of last year.Shopify here is spinning the story that Shopify Plus is growing ultra-fast, it’s MRR at a much higher rate that the SMB business. Since Shopify Plus did $3.5 million in MRR in Q1 2017, we can calculate that Shopify Plus MRR grew 100% y-o-y.In every earnings release, Shopify talks about the Shopify merchants it adds. For example, in Q1 2018 they mentioned The UGG Company out of Australia, LeSportsac, Monster Electronics, HarperCollins UK, Vega, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) and some great new shops from the likes of Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGF) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).Shopify is doing all it can to spin Shopify Plus as a service for blue-chip and enterprise grade clients. Because it knows that this kind of revenue is valued by Wall Street differently than SMB revenue. Looking at the way Shopify presents information to investors about Shopify Plus, we feel it really wants you to sort of think that this fast MRR growth is driven by adding new Shopify Plus customers.Well, we think that blue-chip clients are a very small minority of Shopify Plus MRR and the MRR growth has more to do with extracting more money from existing Plus customers (Please note this is the wilder hypothesis we make in this report, the others we are much more certain about). We have quite an interesting hypothesis when it comes to Plus MRR size and growth. In conference calls, Shopify has talked about pricing for Plus. We have learnt the Plus subscription fee is $2,000 per month + 0.25% of revenue (with a cap of $40,000). We think that it is quite possible that Shopify is sort of bending the definition of MRR and counting this variable license revenue towards this Plus MRR. We think that the definition of MRR Shopify uses would enable this (not too many people look into the footnotes):Subscription plan fee could mean the amount a Shopify Plus client paid in total – fixed $2,000 + 0.25% of revenue, not just the $2,000 base.Why is this important? Because if true, Shopify could be growing its Plus MRR mainly through growth of some of the clients we talked about in the section of this report about Shopify’s top250 clients – because it collects 0.25% of their revenues as license revenues.0.25% of revenue can actually be a lot of money for Shopify. We are almost certain that FashionNova.com, a Plus client, is paying Shopify the max cap of $40,000 per month and a couple of other customers are at that level or very close. And possibly up to maybe 200 customers could be paying around $10,000 per month.So, clients where the 0.25% fee of revenues in effect could be doing a very significant chunk of the $7 million of Plus MRR Shopify reported in Q1 2018. If our hypothesis that this revenue is counted towards MRR is true obviously. If not, this revenue is obviously counted towards the subscription solutions revenue.From a previous section of this report, we know that a lot of this revenue is tied to Facebook and its willingness to tolerate low quality stores to freely roam in its news feed via its advertising platform. But we know that the point when Facebook starts cleansing its advertiser feed is most probably just around the corner. This will obviously have a strong negative influence on Shopify licensing solutions revenue (by lowering the revenues of stores on which Shopify charges 0.25% of their revenue) and possibly to Plus MRR (if our hypothesis is correct).At that point Shopify’s investors and Wall Street will learn (the hard way) that Plus revenue was not deserving a higher valuation than its regular SMB revenue.Since Shopify always mentions some of the blue-chip clients it has signed up in its quarterly reports to illustrate how enterprise grade its Plus revenues are, we finish off this part of the report with mentioning some Plus clients which they don’t mention. Fleshlight.com, a peddler of infamous pleasure hardware, is a top10 most visited Shopify store according to our analysis and pays a lot to Shopify for its Plus license (possibly close to the $40,000 cap per month). SiliconWives.comis doing a service to those seeking a replacement to their flesh and bone wives. And HoneyBirdette.com is quite similar.We’ve went through all the arguments we wanted to put forward, so it’s about time we tell you what a fair valuation for Shopify is.But before we do that we would like to acknowledge that there also are real and legitimate businesses that run on Shopify and there is quite a lot of them. Not just drop shippers peddling cheap stuff from Alibaba (BABA). Not a bunch of stores which are almost totally reliant on Facebook advertising. But also, a ton of small stores selling handmade products, cool inventions, specialty foods direct from the producer, interesting online courses, a lot of charity shops, you name it. Often with a vibrant fan base and following. These are all merchants which have a lot of value and the revenue from them could be deserving of something closer to real SaaS company revenue multiple. These are the stores Shopify would normally have been focused on acquiring had it not caught the Wall Street bug.But it did and it signed a deal with the devil. The devil would provide hypergrowth by providing masses of low quality customers with high churn and a constantly growing valuation. Shopify used this constantly rising valuation (up to a 1,000% increase since IPO) to tap the public markets for an unprecedented 3 times since its IPO: in August 2016 (management was happy to sell at $38 here), June 2017 and February 2018 for a total of almost $1.5 billion. Why has management been so keen to raise so much money? We think for two main reasons. Either as some sort of insurance policy if the stock price would collapse (the cash on the balance sheet would be a buffer for the stock to collapse further) or to raise ammunition for acquisitions arbitraging Shopify’s massive valuation multiples (the sort like Square acquiring Weebly), since buyers would probably not be willing to take Shopify stock.But the devil has now come for payback (we apologize to Shopify for maybe wakening him a tad too early) and we think all these facts mean that the stock is worth much less than the public market thinks.We think Shopify is worth about $5.1 billion in today’s market, which is about $60 a share.$1.5 billion is what the cash on the balance sheet is worth. That’s undisputable.We think the operating business itself is worth 4x 2018 revenue, so approximately $4.1 billion.Why only 4x revenue?We acknowledge that we could be wrong with some or all of our allegations and hypotheses we make in this report. A significant portion of them could be disproved by answering these five questions."
4182525,35801,2018-06-19T08:00:56-04:00,"Shopify is growing revenue at a prodigious rate, and is very expensive on any fundamental metric. Those points seem pretty clear.The question is which point is more salient, and which path is Shopify likely to follow - the next dominant platform or the next tech bust?We look at the company's model, moat, and the long and short cases on Seeking Alpha to see what the right pattern might be for investors to consider.","Value investing continues to take hits in the current market. Whether it's Aswath Damodaran calling old-time value investing 'flabby and lazy' or the Wall Street Journal reporting on an existential crisis for the style, the approach seems to belong to a bygone age.The framework of fundamental analysis and buying something for less than it will be worth seems like it should apply even in a market where traditional value as a factor doesn't play out well. Take Warren Buffett's comments on Amazon (AMZN) - ""I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,"" he said. Amazon didn't earn regular accounting profits (net income or free cash flow) but also had no need to raise capital, and were able to build out a competitive moat and model that strikes fear in the heart about just about every consumer-facing industry in the U.S.AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsI take two things from this. One is that investors would do well to ride a growth trend like this. Make one smart decision like buying Amazon out of the crisis and you don't have to make too many more decisions. But the other is that one has to be careful about which pattern to apply to new investments. Not every fast growing company is going to be the next Amazon - the market may not be big enough, the moat may not be wide enough, and the execution may not be good enough.Shopify (SHOP) is in the early stages of what, on the surface, looks like a long growth path. Let's look at the same metrics for Shopify:SHOP Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsIt's a shorter chart, but we see up and to the right for price and revenue, no need to issue debt, and bumpier profit numbers.We don't need to make the argument that you can squint hard enough and see the next Amazon. From Growth To Value makes the case in their recent bullish article: ""I think that Shopify may well be the next Amazon-like investment. All the signs are there: a social trend, constant innovation, users' comfort, facilitating people to make (or save) money and a full integrated system. I could go on, but I think you understand what I mean.""We also don't need to invent the argument that Shopify is more hype than substance. Rational Investing takes the other side, crunching the numbers for Shopify while saying, ""Shopify currently has no major moat, its business has low barriers of entry and its only competitive advantage is scale.""So we've got a battleground on our hands.

4171087,98236,2018-05-08T10:33:20-04:00,"Both Shopify and Square reported the results of their March ending quarter this past week.In both cases, the results were substantially above the consensus and guidance was increased substantially.In both cases, some of the negative buzz that had arisen based on the comments of a professional short seller were proved erroneous by various elements of positive operational performance.In both cases, shares did not experience a substantial increment despite the strong performance and the stronger outlook.In both cases, with the outlook stronger and the share price stable, valuations have become more attractive and can readily generate positive alpha for investors.","This past week was perhaps the apogee of the earnings season, at least in tech. So many companies, so little time. There has been a consistent theme in the plethora of earnings reports that have cascaded endlessly through the ether. Most companies are enjoying their best quarter in years with exceptional revenue growth, strong operating cash flow and rising earnings. The other side of that picture has been the lackluster response to earnings. Just because it's apropos to mention, it seems that Apple (OTC:APPL) shares are seeing a very muted response to its quarter, so much better than feared by so many, so vocally. (Not following Apple in detail, there are some who say the quarter was just good enough-but the quarter was certainly better than some of the negative whispers emanating from brokerages and elsewhere). Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) blowout quarter has been greeted, basically by a yawn. And Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares, despite the best quarter for that company in decades, are actually below where they 2 weeks ago.I don't think writing about the large-cap growth names above at this point is likely to enlighten most readers significantly. There are many articles-too many perhaps-on SA and elsewhere, a host of brokerage commentaries, TV interviews, YouTube presentations and chat board encomiums to enlighten anyone remotely interested in these companies. I could, I suppose write about market dynamics, and indeed in writing the article to follow, I do have to drag in some commentary about the market; stocks do not exist in a vacuum.I was struck a few days past by reading a piece on SA regarding Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). The author recounted many of the metrics that SHOP had achieved this recently past quarter but then concluded he wanted to buy the shares in the low $100 range. The author noted that SHOP's growth has been exemplary, and at its scale, is exceeding growth rates of any other IT vendor, but that wasn't enough. I do think the author missed a couple of salient trends, but then again, I am sure I will as well. But the issue that I found a bit more off-putting than analytical judgements had to do with the commentary that there were plenty of other investment equivalents that have a lower EV/S ratio. And so there are. And of course, the author reprised, at least in part, the issues about our president and his tantrums about Chinese imports, which are certainly a part of the business model for some SHOP customers-the so-called drop-ship paradigm.For some investors, it can be difficult to buy shares in highly valued IT vendors. There is a sign/advertisement that JetBlue Airlines (NASDAQ:JBLU) posts within many web pages and on the TV screens in seatbacks to the effect that no one ever likes to pay full price for an airline ticket. Not much quarrel with that. And, so far as it goes, most investors want to buy the next…well Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) or Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) or Arista (NYSE:ANET) or Shopify or Square (NYSE:SQ) before it becomes recognized as so-called ""growth aristocrat.""The problem with that philosophy is that an emerging growth story often fails at some point along the way. In the venture cap world, a batting average of 20% or 30% is OK because one of those successes can appreciate ten-fold or more, and that makes up for the misses and the also-rans. In the public equity markets, the only way that I know of to have one of those 10-baggers is to buy and hold and not to be fixated by valuation. OK, I do not always follow my own dictum and in another time or place I could share numerous names that I have bought and sold because they spiked higher, or their valuation was too high or…the reasons for disposing of highly valued, high growth names is endless.Over the years, and unlike the JetBlue passenger, I have come to believe that it is far better to pay full-price for my ticket on a growth equity, if that is what it costs, then attempt the feat of trying to find a growth company at some supposed discount that is ""almost as good."" It is worth repeating that time and time again in tech, market share matters and the company with the leading market share will wind up with a disproportionate share of the profits and likely a disproportionate share of the growth in a particular space. No one is going to accuse the valuation of SHOP of being modest. Depending on one's estimates, the shares are perhaps selling now at around 9X or 10X EV/S based on a realistic expectation of revenues most likely to be achieved in 2019. But what is better as an investment-SHOP shares selling at what appears to be a stretched valuation to some now, SHOP shares before the company was recognized as the category killer in its space or shares of a modest growth business such as PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) - just as an example.At the moment, I do not own shares in SHOP or in Square - simply put because I sold them too soon. But while I certainly look for bargains and opportunities, and take them where they exist, I would actually be reluctant to buy SHOP shares if they fell by another 15% to the low $100's range. The reasons for the shares depreciate to that extent would almost certainly be such that either overall stock market valuations were under pressure because of geo-political factors or because the SHOP story, so to speak, was being severely challenged by either competition, a change in the demand picture for the solutions SHOP offers or a failure of the company's business model. I like SHOP shares as they are today; down about 19% since they made an all-time high in March, but still up a healthy 50%+ over the past year.The quarter reported by Shopify this past week, was its 11th quarterly report since going public-and its 11th quarter of beat and raise. It suggests that investors should not put too much stock in what appears to be conservative guidance. This is also the first quarter that guidance was articulated by a new CFO, Amy Shapero. I think it is fair to assume, that Ms. Shapero was even more cautious than the prior CFO, Russ Jones in forecasting company results.A brief review of SHOP's results shows a growth re-acceleration, centered on what the company calls merchant solutions, which grew by 75% year on year. Much of this increase was driven by the company's revenues from ancillary services such as capital and shipping, but the company also achieved strong growth in processing fees on the gross merchandise value transacted through its platform.Subscription solutions revenue grew by 61%. Shop doesn't provide the details of its subscription solutions revenue mix every quarter, but on a qualitative basis, the company substantially increased additions to its base of Shopify Plus users.The company grew its gross profit margin from 57% to 58% despite some notable headwinds impacting that metric, as the company moves its infrastructure to AWS and maintains duplicate infrastructure for the next several quarters while accelerating depreciation on its current investment in company data centers. Over time, gross margins are likely to continue to grow as duplicative spending will abate and the company will continue to derive more of its revenue from high margin sources such as Capital and Shipping and the other services that can be acquired through the ecosystem.Last quarter, the company increased its operating expenses by 65% on a GAAP basis, slightly below its rate of revenue growth. Sales and marketing costs rose by 67% and general and administrative costs rose by 40%. The company is recruiting developers at a prodigious rate. GAAP research and development costs rose by 81%. As is typical these days, hiring lots of developers means that stock-based compensation will rise more than commensurately. In fact, stock-based compensation for research and development more than doubled and this enabled the non-GAAP research and development ratio to be contained to 17% of revenue.Many readers may wonder what creates a competitive moat for SHOP. Basically, the company's moat has been created by a rapid introduction of new products coupled with the company's ecosystem. Spending money on research and development is a competitive tool that this company has successfully utilized on countless occasions. This year, the company is focused on developing versions of the product in many languages, a tedious and expensive undertaking, but one which significantly expands the company's TAM.At this point, SHOP is not generating cash and while cash flow is likely to modestly exceed GAAP profits going forward, the difference is small. That said, the company has a cash balance of $1.6 billion at this point in the wake of its share sale in February. The CFO, in her script, said that she was ""a big believer in the strategic benefit of optionality. So we will ask you now to stay tuned on that front as the year progresses."" Presumably that means the company will use part of its cash balance to make acquisitions that extend the company's product offering. One reason to imagine that growth will significantly exceed the company's 50% expectation is the expectation that this company will be adding some inorganic growth to its revenue base.It is probably worth noting at this point, that the strong performance of Shopify Plus is going to have a material impact on financial results as the year progresses. While the number of new accounts last quarter was more or less consistent with prior net customer adds (although better than expected because of seasonality), Shopify Plus net adds showed a strong increase. The basic Shopify offering costs $29/month and that is the one chosen by the vast majority of merchants. Shopify Plus starts at $299/month and goes up from there. Shopify Enterprise starts at $2000/month. The financial implications of increasing Shopify Plus users are probably underappreciated at this point, and will have, I imagine, a noticeable impact on growth. Some new Plus customers that were closed in the quarter included UGG, Sportsac, HarperCollins, Colgate-Palmolive, Nestle, and PepsiCo/Lay's where users can customize the packaging of potato chips. The need to put one's face on a bag of potato chips is something that baffles the understanding of this writer-but as the saying goes, whatever. The point is that these kinds of customers spend tens of thousands of dollars each month. Overall, Monthly Recurring Revenue grew by 57% year on year to $32.5 million, and most of that increase was driven by Shopify Plus which now accounts for 22% of MRR up from 17% in the year earlier quarter. One of the reasons to be optimistic about this company exceeding guidance is the very strong MRR metric; MRR is now accounting for almost 40% of projected full year revenues.As many readers are doubtless aware, Shopify shares have been a focus of Andrew Left and his Citron Research. That company has suggested that Shop shares are overvalued and that it has a flawed business model. Citron has also attempted to link SHOP with the Facebook (FB) data scandal. Rather than reprise all of the scurrilous drivel and so-called research advanced by Citron at this point, I will focus on the issue of Shop and its drop ship customers-something that may be a legitimate concern of some. Shopify offers a service called Oberlo. Oberlo is a service which essentially allows entrepreneurs who want to start a Shopify store, to set it up and start importing product in less than 30 minutes. Presumably that 30-minute metric doesn't include this writer who is rarely successful in using elements of new wave technology.In any event, Oberlo has gotten lots of interest and lots of publicity and it is certainly a factor in Shopify achieving strong new customer statistics. But it is still tiny in terms of its revenue impact-far less than some have speculated, based on what the company's CEO said on its conference call. It is not the main thrust of the company and the company's success going forward is not going to be predicated on developing a new revenue source of customers paying $29/month so they can import Chinese printers.In addition to Oberlo, and perhaps as an adjunct to that service is something that is offered called ePacket. ePacket is a service that has made possible faster deliveries from countries like China, HK and Korea to US e-commerce sellers. It is definitely another factor in encouraging entrepreneurs to set up Shopify stores to import products from China. It is cheap, and easy and most of all offers a very quick way of importing products from that part of the world. But again, it is far too easy to create a straw man around ePacket and suggest that plans the Trump administration may have to limit its utility might affect SHOP. At the least, those concerns would seem to be a gross exaggeration of any likely impact from modifying the capabilities of ePacket on SHOP's current business. I am far more inclined to believe the input that the CEO of this company imparted on these subjects during its conference call than the innuendos and half-truths on offer by Andrew Left and some of his colleagues. While Oberlo and ePacket are certainly services that have added to the growth Shopify, they are not central elements in the company's business strategy and certainly not elements of undue risk in owning the shares.Are Shop shares overvalued? I don't think they are. I am not going to try to construct a detailed financial model with a DCF analysis as has been done by one author on this site. I simply do not have the detailed data to do so and I think models are no better than the variable they contain with minimum confidence. What I do believe, is that Shop is showing substantial operating leverage at scale, and that it continues to be a category killer. Clearly, this quarter's gross margin attainment in the wake of a strong headwinds from accelerated depreciation of existing data centers coupled with the use of both Amazon and on-premise infrastructure needs to be carefully considered. And the fact that SHOP has upped its development spending by 81%, far from being a negative should more logically be thought of as an expression of the company's opportunities which are increasing substantially. The potential leverage at scale is increasing rather than decreasing.There really are and have been many competitors in SHOP's space and that is true since I first wrote about the company and its prospects. Its attainments have been made in the midst of many competitive offerings. The other day, a viable competitor in this space, with several hundred thousand paying users, Weebly announced it was being acquired by Square. Is that going to have a material impact on SHOP? I doubt it. Square needed more of a multi-channel capability beyond selling to physical stores and remote payment points. The amount of overlap between Square and Shop has been small and it probably will remain small.So, the basic question in evaluating valuation is the potential growth of the company. It is almost certainly more than 50% for the next couple of years. I think a 2019 revenue estimate that tries to capture some of the growth opportunities of this company as well as the impact of likely acquisitions, based on the huge war chest the company has amassed for that activity, is probably around $1.6 billion. The company's enterprise value, after today's 8% share price appreciation is about $12.3 billion. So, I think the EV/S based on next year's revenues is about 7.7X. Yes, valuations of most tech names have shown some propensity to contract so far this year, and that may continue to be the case, depending on the track of interest rates or other potential risk elements. But I think the EV/S of this company, looking out just a year or so, is quite reasonable and suggests plenty of potential alpha. I think the shares should be bought by anyone constructing an optimal long-term growth portfolio.The stock market can be a demanding mistress. Sometimes a company reports a blow-out number, dramatically raises guidance and the shares still turn out to put in a negative or mediocre performance. And in a single sentence, that is about what happened to Square's shares in the wake of a very strong quarter. Square has defied the conventional wisdom regarding compressing growth rates as a business scales. This is actually the 4th quarter in a row in which its growth rate in adjusted revenue has accelerated. It reached 51% last quarter compared to 39% adjusted revenue growth in the 1st quarter of 2017 and beat prior net revenue expectations by about 5%. (Most analysts measure this company in terms of growth rate and profitability by looking at its adjusted revenue, as opposed to net revenue). The company increased its percentage growth forecast for Q2 from 39% to 49% and it increased its full year growth forecast from 34% to 44%. Somewhat incredibly, Andrew Left got wrong footed once again-his ignorance about so many of his targets is overwhelming and the attention he receives for sensationalist nonsense is perhaps an indication of the lack of current journalism standards.I had personally given up on writing about Square shares when some investors decided it was a bitcoin vehicle and bid up its price based on the price of crypto-currencies. Square, for better or for worse, is not a crypto-currency analog; its adjusted revenue contribution from bitcoin transactions was all of $200k last quarter and while that amount will grow significantly, it has little to do with the company's prospects and future growth rate.The principle reason to buy Square shares is based on the company's ability to re-accelerate growth at scale. To the extent that such performance resonates with investors, as it does with this writer, is the extent to which the company's shares are attractive. The company is enjoying growth re-acceleration because of the ancillary services, which actually grew 98% year on year (24% sequentially) last quarter. Square is attracting larger sellers and they come to Square not because it processes payments better-although it is certainly competitive in that regard-but because of the company's ecosystem. Adjusted revenue from the larger sellers grew by 60% last quarter. At this point, subscription and service-based revenue has reached $97 million and was 32% of adjusted revenues last quarter. Square is no longer really a specialized payment processor and while it GPV growth of 31% is not inconsequential, and it wouldn't have an ecosystem if it didn't process payments, the reason for its growth are the many offerings from its ecosystem. In addition, the company generated 60% growth in its hardware revenue which was 4.5% of adjusted revenues last quarter. At this point, Square is not making money on its POS hardware but it has been a tool with which it has been able to attract larger sellers, who, on average, consume a far greater proportion of high margin services compared to the average Square customer. Much of the growth in services revenue came from the instant deposit service, the Caviar food delivery service and Square Capital. I have reviewed these services at some length in prior articles. But it is probably worth reviewing again, an optimal use case for Square.I happen to have a sweet tooth and that has led me to patronize an artisan bakery in New York City called Mille Feuille. The bakery uses Square to process transactions in its two locations. But it has also used Square Capital to help it finance remodeling and to finance other capital expenditures. And it has used instant deposit to gain rapid access to funds. As it happens Mille-Feuille will be using the Seamless service for taking orders on-line and for deliveries-but it could use Square's on-line ordering and delivery service called Caviar. And it could use the Square payroll service as well. It does use Square for some primitive analytics and to deliver offers to some customers, but it could enlarge its consumption of Square software.I am amused at least at some level, that Mr. Left and his minions think investors do not understand Square and think it is a bitcoin play. It may be that some investors do not understand the entirety of the potential Square value proposition. It is far beyond taking bitcoins as a medium of payment and much more about helping physical sellers automate their back-office requirements. The reason that growth has been re-accelerating, even at scale, has to do with all of the capabilities that Square can offer beyond payment processing-and frankly it is still in the top of the first in terms of its potential exploitation of those opportunities. The fact that Square can offer sellers both instant deposit, and capital advances puts it in a different position when compared to other IT vendors offering a remote payment terminal. And its ecosystem of literally thousands of applications that users can access, is another part of the ability that Square has to distinguish itself from competitors.Square, as mentioned earlier in this article, has announced the acquisition of Weebly, to propel the company into the non-bricks and mortar component of e-commerce Square has partnered with Weebly for some time, but owning is a different level of engagement when compared to partnering. Many Square users will want to be able to create a web presence using a Square branded solution, and Weebly is a good way of providing that, and providing a multi-channel approach for Square sellers.Most recently Square's shares were impacted by some announcements regarding Amazon Pay. Needless to say, anything with the word Amazon leads investors to concerns about competitive encroachment. But again, Square is about far more than accepting remote payments at this point, and Amazon's strategy doesn't seem to be focused on developing a holistic service for small business merchants comparable to what they can get from Square.Essentially, Square increased its revenue estimate for this current year by about $100 million but did not increase its forecast for EBITDA. Initially, when Square reported its results and provided its forecast the shares were under pressure, as the net impact of how the guidance was provided lead to a reduction in the Q2 EPS estimate. It took a while on the following trading day for the shares to shake off their weakness, and even now, despite the strong beat on revenue coupled with a massive increase in the company's forecasted growth rate, the shares are where they were before the earnings release while the market has shown some buoyancy.Simply put, Square is taking the additional revenues it expects to generate, and which will no doubt come with very high incremental gross margins, and upping its bets on product development and sales and marketing. The company CFO, Sarah Friar suggested during this last conference call that the company has many strong, ROI positive investment opportunities. The focus of these opportunities is going to be the expansion of Square's omni-channel offerings, financial services and international. These opportunities are ones that are supposed to drive incremental growth in 2019 and beyond. The current growth rate estimate most recently published by First Call for 2019 is just 30.6%. I think it is far more likely that Square is going to be able to grow at a 40%+ rate next year, after growing in the 45%-50% range this year including a few hundred basis points of growth from the pending acquisition of Weebly.One of the more interesting questions during the conference call came from an analyst who wanted to know with the company's former projection of long-term 20%-25% growth, which really is a key determinant in valuation. While not answered explicitly, the CEO, Jack Dorsey, suggested that the company has developed a strategy and tactics that are going to have a material impact in terms of increasing the growth rate and the CFO talked about the contrast between 20%-25% and 44%. Basically, she said, ""read my lips,"" and this will probably turn out better than the Republican campaign slogan in 1988.It is more than a bit difficult to forecast a long-term growth rate for a set of solutions that have never before existed. What smaller businesses can do with Square today is not something that could be done using any available alternatives in the recent past. If nothing else, the availability of cash both instantly and through Square Capital has never been something that users could access. And Square, as well as SHOP, has made it substantially easier for entrepreneurs to set up a business that can focus on retail expertise as opposed to having to deal with all kinds of back-office and cash flow issues.In this quarter's letter to shareholders, Square calls out a business in the UK that had been unable to accept cards because of costs. Square's offerings allowed him to economically accept cards again, and it facilitated the sale of a set of Square hardware as well. It is those kind of use cases that will work wonders in terms of retaining this customer as a Square user into the foreseeable future. That is not the kind of demand growth that is easy to measure.At this point, I think Square revenues over the next 12 months are likely to reach around $1.6 billion and will probably reach above $2 billion in calendar 2019, compared to the prior First Call consensus estimate of $1.76 billion. The company currently has a market capitalization of $19.7 billion and an enterprise value of $19 billion. While that is an EV/S ratio of almost 12X on the next 12-month revenue estimate, this company has achieved some moderate level of non-GAAP profitability unlike many other newer IT vendors. And the company's torrid growth opportunity is reducing the EV/S ratio rapidly; I project that it is less than 10X for calendar year 2019.At this point, neither cash flow from operations or earnings has reached a level that might support the company's valuation, at least in the opinion of this writer. That said, however, the company is efficiently run and has managed general and administrative costs carefully, and the ROI of its newly funded investments is likely to be substantial.Square shares remain a bit controversial with First Call reporting recommendations that include 16 buys and 13 holds. I think that ratio provides investors with the opportunity to see additional banks raise their rating on these shares. Now that a certain amount of the bitcoin hype has dissipated in the wake of the latest quarterly report, I think that investors are gain poised to earn significant positive alpha going forward."
4184233,104302,2018-06-27T09:41:28-04:00,The Supreme Court Ruling giving the states the constitutional power to require the collection of taxes on online sales has a far-reaching effect on most of Shopify’s clients.Smaller online stores will incur additional expenses and will have lower sales volumes because of the elasticity of online sales and because the e-commerce giants are already charging state taxes.Smaller online stores that are not yet profitable may elect to exit the online merchandising business because of lower prospects of turning profitable.The exodus of smaller online stores will result in a significant drop in Shopify’s total number of clients.The drop in the total number of clients will result in severely punishing Shopify's stock price.,"On June 21st 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled that states have the power to require online sales taxes be collected regardless of the physical presence of the retailer. This ruling was the conclusion of a highly-watched case associated with upholding a South Dakota law requiring out-of-state retailers, including those that operate remotely online, to collect its sales tax (US Supreme Court Ruling). This ruling overturns two precedents, dating back to 1967 and 1992, that required a physical presence for a retailer in the state to charge state sales taxes on goods that are shipped to the state.In layman terms, online retailers will now be required to collect and submit taxes on behalf of each state that charges state taxes. Previously, online retailers had to charge taxes only if they have a nexus in the state. Shopify (SHOP) has a well-written blog that explains the meaning of “nexus” very clearly and the prior status of “state taxes” in “Should You be Charging Sales Taxes?”This ruling should have a serious impact on smaller online retailers (the vast majority of Shopify's clients), and no impact on larger online retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which are already charging taxes; they have a physical presence (nexus) in most the states and were thereby required to charge state taxes. On the other hand, smaller online stores are directly impacted by this ruling. I do not know how this ruling may impact the two big Chinese giants Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) as this is currently a topic of discussion in the trade war between China and the US and I am not entirely sure how the states would be able to force foreign companies to charge US state taxes.This article looks at the impact of this ruling on Shopify’s clients and how it may impact the Shopify valuation. The article shows that the new ruling will have a major impact on the profitability of smaller online retailers and their ability to survive in a very competitive cut-throat market. The article then concludes that within the next year, the total number of Shopify clients will drop driven by the requirement to charge taxes on the goods that they sell.Current Shopify clients are mostly smaller retail online stores who are using the dropshipping sales model (smaller online stores). While Shopify does not disclose the exact number of smaller online store clients, they indicated that the Shopify-plus clients are measured in single-digit thousands, not tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.So, let’s make some conservative assumptions here. By conservative assumption, I do not mean low or high, but I rather mean assumptions that would take the far end of the spectrum “against” this article’s thesis.Start by assuming that Shopify has 600,000 total customers (Shopify website). Out of these 600,000 customers, some are Shopify Plus customers; these are larger established retailers that are using the Shopify platform. Shopify claims that the number of Shopify Plus customers is 3,600 on their Shopify Plus landing page.There is a possibility that Shopify’s proclamations are not correct or that the landing page has not been updated. Let’s assume that the number of Shopify Plus clients is measured in tens of thousands rather than single-digit thousands, and let’s take the top end of this order of magnitude to come up with 100,000 Shopify Plus clients. I know that this may be unrealistically high, but we are making conservative estimates here.This leaves us with 500,000 smaller online stores, and this is the number we will use further in our analysis.Having run a SaaS company in the past, I know the effort associated with collecting taxes for different states and provinces. Here is the process that I had to adopt:At that time, I had only two provinces to deal with: Quebec and BC, and did not have to collect taxes for any US states, as I did not have any “nexus” in the US. The administrative effort with only two provinces was not insignificant; I would estimate a minimum effort of one-person-day annually to deal with each one of these provinces (receiving and reviewing letters, responding to letters, collections, submissions, reconciliation…). This is in addition to the one-time effort for registration and accounting adjustments; as per our conservative approach, we will ignore this additional one-time cost.The State and Local Tax Rate 2018 listing indicates that most US states (45 plus DC) collect sales taxes. This is over 20 times as much effort as I had experienced when dealing with only two provinces.The good thing for Shopify customers is that the Shopify platform supports the collection of taxes depending on the shipping address. This will reduce the effort associated with the collection.However, the accounting for these smaller online stores still needs to be adjusted and the submission process still needs to be created and properly managed. So, let’s conservatively assume that the effort for each state is ½ a day per year instead of the one day per year that I was experiencing. This will result in over 20 person-days per year to handle the administrative load associated with the collection and submission of state sales taxes.The profitability of smaller online stores will be hit on two fronts:As per the prior section, the additional expenses are over 20 person-days administrative effort plus the additional accounting cost. To be conservative, if the smaller online store has one full-time administrator, then 20 days plus the additional accounting cost would be approximately 10%. The one full-time administrator is a conservative estimate consistent with Shopify’s claim on their website that they have 600,000 customers and 1,000,000 users.Some may argue that the new ruling will apply to all companies, so there should be no net impact on the smaller online stores losing sales to other stores. This statement would be correct if the smaller online stores are only competing against other smaller online stores. However, the smaller online stores are mostly competing with the big e-commerce giants (Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy…) which are already collecting state taxes, and would not be impacted by the ruling. Moreover, there is a possibility (remote as it may be) that the Chinese giants would not be subject to this ruling depending on how the trade war with China goes. If Alibaba and JD.com are allowed to sell in the US without taxes, it would be a further negative impact on smaller online stores, and in turn, Shopify.The online merchandising market is highly competitive, and the price elasticity for online sales is abnormally high, aka, almost perfectly elastic. In other words, if the price goes up, the volume of sales would be dropping at a very high rate. Smaller online stores are already struggling because of their sub-optimal reputation compared to the e-commerce giants. Smaller online stores may be successful mainly because of their relatively lower price and because they are not currently collecting taxes. If the prices go up as a result of charging state sales taxes, the sales will be dropping significantly based on simple supply-and-demand rules combined with the high elasticity of online goods.Having said that, let’s be conservative and assume that the price elasticity of online merchandise is not perfect but rather relative. Relative elasticity is usually measured between 2 and 5, so let’s take the middle point, say 3.5. This means that if the price increases by 10%, the volume of sales will be dropping by 35%.The average state sales tax in the US of 5.11% is a very conservative estimate because most of the larger states have a larger sales tax rate than 5.11% (e.g., California: 7.25%, Texas: 6.25%, Florida: 6%, Pennsylvania: 6%, Illinois: 6.25%, Ohio: 5.75%); we will still take 5.11% as our conservative estimate. As a result, assuming a price elasticity of 3.5, we are talking about a drop of about 20% of the sales volume.As a summary of this section, the administrative expenses would increase by 10% and the sales volume would be dropping by 20% for smaller online stores as a result of the Supreme Court ruling associated with collecting state sales taxes.We do not know how many of Shopify’s smaller online store clients are in a losing position or in a break-even position; Shopify does not, and should not, disclose this information, and it is very difficult to guess this number. Another time, we would need to make assumptions, and following our standard, they will be conservative assumptions.Most of Shopify’s smaller online stores have not been in the market for a long time, and many of them are either at the break even or non-profitable stage. To be conservative, let’s assume that between 40% and 60% of the smaller online stores are profitable and the rest are either break-even or still in the growing unprofitable stage.Strictly based on my experience, if a company is unprofitable or in a break-even mode, the exit cost is negligible (both from a financial and emotional perspective), the growth prospects are uncertain and it is anticipating a certain hit on its revenue or its expenses, the company would seriously elect to go out of business. For Shopify small online stores, the exit cost is practically non-existent if they are relying on the dropshipping model. In addition, the online merchandising business is very competitive and the barriers to entry are very low, and this makes the growth potential highly uncertain.Using a conservative assumption that 40% of Shopify’s smaller online stores are break-even or unprofitable, then we should expect some of them to be exiting the business; an expected 20% drop in the sales and 10% increase in the administrative costs for an unprofitable business may be too much to take.The percentage of the customers getting out of the e-commerce business is anyone’s guess, but let’s make a conservative assumption. If logic prevails, the percentage should be very high (over 80%). However, emotions will play a major role here, and not every smaller online store would exit the business immediately.I would personally expect anywhere between 30% and 50% to be exiting the e-commerce business after one year, and let’s take the conservative low end of 30%. Based on the earlier calculation of 500,000 smaller online stores, we came to the conclusion that 150,000 Shopify customers would be leaving/closing their smaller online stores within one year as a result of the introduction of the tax collection rules.Shopify’s share price is valued assuming a 50% increase of sales year over year for the next five years. With a drop of 150,000 customers in a year, this growth assumption will be totally blown, and the market will very severely punish the stock. The primary reason for the expected drop in the stock price is that the analysts will then review their original growth assumptions, and adjust it to a much lower percentage than 50% year over year for the next five years. This revision will result in downgrading the stock price.The 150,000 drop in the number of customers in one year is an overly conservative number based on very conservative assumptions. The real drop in the number of customers will most likely be higher than 150,000 and the drop in the price of Shopify may surprise even the most aggressive short sellers.The above analysis is provided as a very rough conservative assessment of the impact of charging state taxes on Shopify’s number of clients. Because the Shopify valuation is highly dependent on its projected growth rate, and because the growth rate is directly correlated to the number of clients, the drop in the number of clients would have a serious effect on the stock price.Of course, there are many other factors at play related to Shopify, and each of these factors need to be assessed independently to get the overall picture about the company."
4181154,104539,2018-06-12T16:02:50-04:00,"In this article, I will analyze 4 simple long-term scenarios to forecast Shopify's valuation in 2023.Shopify currently trades at a forward P/E of +270 and a P/S of +22.The recent acquisitions of Magento by Adobe and Weebly by Square will create a stronger competition.With no distinguishable moat, long-term growth is questionable.","Shopify's (SHOP) growth since its IPO has been outstanding. However, the stock price has run ahead of its fundamentals. With revenue expected to come at $1 billion in 2018, Shopify is trading at 17x times forward sales, and growth is starting to slow down. 2018 expected revenue growth is 48.55% YoY, much lower than the 73% YoY growth achieved in 2017.Although this revenue growth is still impressive, the market has already priced in a beat for this year and for several years to come. With a market cap of $17 billion, Shopify will not only need to maintain its impressive revenue growth, it will have to start expanding operating margins by a considerable amount.This will prove difficult, as Shopify currently has no major moat, its business has low barriers of entry and its only competitive advantage is scale. We will most likely see a major acquisition soon, as Shopify has over $1.5 billion in cash, but I doubt that this acquisition will provide a major moat.In addition, this $1.5 billion in cash has come from increasing their outstanding shares by more than 13% since March 2017 (from 90.24 million in March 2017 to 102.25 million in March 2018), effectively diluting their shareholders for cash that Shopify does not need.For creating the different scenarios I only used 5 variables: YoY revenue growth in 2018, revenue growth rate slowdown, 2023 operating margin, yearly share dilution and forward P/E. All scenarios use a 21% tax rate.I will not be using a discounted cash flow model for these scenarios, as I said at the start of the article, this will be a very simple analysis. I will simply use earnings per share and forward P/E for calculating the stock value at the start of 2023.The most recent information that I could find for operating margin is from the following earnings call, so I will use a final operating margin of 20% for my best case scenario.Source: Q4 2017 Earnings call transcriptIn this scenario, SHOP would be worth $313.51 per share in 2023, assuming it trades at 40x times forward P/E. This would give us a 14.4% annual return if we use the current price of $160.In this scenario, SHOP would be worth $190.01 per share in 2023, assuming it trades at 35x times forward P/E. This would give us a 3.5% annual return if we use the current price of $160.In this scenario, SHOP would be worth $124.16 per share in 2023, assuming it trades at 30x times forward P/E.In this scenario, SHOP would be worth $75.64 per share in 2023, assuming it trades at 30x times forward P/E.If you do not agree with the scenarios I used in the article or want to create your own, feel free to use the template I used to create these tables: Shopify.xlsx (excel file).I look forward to hearing your opinions and seeing your forecasts in the comments.Shopify needs to get a lot of things right to justify its current valuation and generate decent returns for the next 5 years. Their next acquisition may certainly help them achieve these returns, but I am not getting my hopes up.I would not recommend shorting Shopify until the market changes its opinion, as the stock has shown no signs of stopping its upwards trend. Nevertheless, buying shares at these levels is a very risky investment that most likely won't generate worthwhile returns anytime soon."

4169000,21815,2018-05-03T04:42:30-04:00,"While growth is slowing down, it's slowing down less than we feared, and the company is still in hyper-growth phase.To boot, it enjoys an entrenched market position, powerful platform economics, and the kicking in of operational leverage.The valuation is steep, though the losses and dilution are still substantial and the share based-compensation rich.We never feared any blowback from the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica saga, though.","In February last year, we advised buying the shares (in the low $50s) of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and the shares continued to rise inexorably for much of last year. This year, the sailing is a little tougher.We predicted that growth would slow down, but that was hardly controversial, given that a hyper-growth triple-digit rise is simply difficult to maintain as the company becomes bigger - the law of large numbers.We have a habit of looking at business SaaS service provider platforms through a specific lens of the business model, which consists of the following generic steps:SaaS business service modelNot all of these steps are equally important, or even relevant, for each SaaS business service provider (so we'll skip a few here), but it's nevertheless a useful framework, we feel.1) The killer app was simply taking much of the hassle at starting e-commerce, especially for smaller players. What the company got right from the start is opening a one-stop shop where the software was not unlike an operating system, a unified system that connects otherwise disjointed services and a basis on which to build additional stuff.2) It has always functioned on a SaaS model, so this point is irrelevant. However, the company does generate two revenue streams:4) International expansion is quite a growth area and focus point for management lately, now that the company is well-established in its home market (Canada, US).The company is still in the early phase of international build-out, and there are lots of opportunities here. It does involve localizing the services, like additional languages and adding a host of local payment methods.5) We're not aware of Shopify having a service business (beyond a helpdesk), and that would beat much of the point, which is that it should be easy to set up an e-commerce business. Shopify Plus (for corporate customers) might have some handholding business for customers, but we don't think this is a substantial revenue generator.7) The company has good recurring revenues. MRR make up $32.5 million, or 15.1%, of revenues. Of the MRR, an increasing part is from corporate customers using Shopify Plus (increasing from 17% to 22% of MRR y/y).8) The company has built out several new modules, products or services, like:This is just a fraction of the service that the company offers for demonstration purposes. What matters is that a platform allows the company to continuously build more. This adds additional revenue streams, increases revenue per client, improves the value proposition of the platform and hence makes it more sticky.And it adds up. While Pay (growing at a blistering 64% itself) is still the largest single element, revenue of Capital and Shipping both more than doubled for the year.9) Acquisitions are also part and parcel of Shopify's strategy to increase the functionality and value of the platform. For instance, last year the company acquired Kit CRM, and the year before it acquired Boltmore - both were privately held companies.Recently, the company has raised cash, and we suspect that it's not done on the acquisition field.10) Shopify has a thriving ecosystem. From the Q1CC:This is yet another route for increasing the value proposition of the platform and its stickiness. For instance, it uses third-party apps like:11) and 12) will be discussed below.That business model described above leads to lots of growth:SHOP Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThis doesn't yet include the Q1 figures, but the trend is pretty clear, at least in terms of revenue growth. Growth is, of course, slowing down, but it's still very substantial for Q1:Below you see that deceleration (not including the Q1 figure of 68%):SHOP Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsBut we have to say, this is still hyper-growth and the slowdown has occurred somewhat slower than we expected.This is from the earnings PR:For the full year 2018, Shopify currently expects:For the second quarter of 2018, the company currently expects:The full-year improved guidance implies a 50% revenue growth versus 2017, which is a considerable slowdown from the near-70% levels we're at. We think this is the level management is comfortable of making, and the real outcome is likely to be higher. It has always been that way.SHOP Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThere is some gross margin creep as merchant solutions outgrow subscriptions while the former enjoy roughly half the gross margin of the latter. What is encouraging, of course, is the rising trend in operating margins, suggesting considerable leverage.And margins were negatively affected by the transition to the public cloud, which is complete by the fourth quarter.There was a net use of cash from operations of $1.87 million in Q1, down from a positive $4 million a year ago. What is a little high is stock-based compensation:This was $17.9 million in Q1, so it is increasing rather rapidly, at $110 million this year - this is 11% of guided 2018 revenue, which is really quite substantial. Even so, the company doesn't have positive free cash flow:Shopify sold 4.8 million shares in February, hence it's no surprise that its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased to $1.6 billion (from $938 million at the end of 2017). This is $10 per share.As we've seen above, there is considerable operational leverage, so the problem of negative cash flow should gradually lessen (unless the company increases CapEx a lot), but we're not there yet.On the other hand, the cash bleed isn't such that one should get worried about debt or dilution anytime soon, apart from the fact that we had significant dilution just a couple of months ago.SHOP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsBut as you can see, there has been a roughly 50% dilution over the past 3 years already, and with the jump in stock-based compensation there will be more of that to come.SHOP EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsOf course, on an EV/S basis, the shares are still very expensive, although the 18 multiple is on the basis of 2017 revenues. It's a less dramatic 11.5 on this year's expected revenue, and given that the company has a habit of beating these, it's more likely to be 11. That's still expensive, needless to say.Citron has touted a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) risk, as a clampdown on Facebook data use could affect marketing for merchants, for which Facebook is the most important channel.Quite frankly, we never saw anything in this, even if we've written quite a few critical articles about Facebook data policies. The Cambridge Analytica scandal centered on clients owning data, and how easy that was for third-party app developers and how sloppy Facebook was in allowing that and handling the problem.However, advertisers do not own Facebook data, they merely using it. It allows them to target ads precisely, of course, and this is mostly a benefit (the more relevant the ads, the less intrusive they are).So, unless there is something we're not seeing, we don't see much change in that. And if there is any change, it would be around the board for data policies (like the GDPR rules the EU adopted at the end of last month), which would leave Facebook's competitive position unaltered versus other online marketing channels.Shopify is a beast, as simple as that. Even if company guidance materializes and growth slows down considerably, that's still 50% revenue growth. It has a dominant position and enjoys some powerful platform economics - it's actual difficult to see what can go wrong from a business perspective.However, the share valuation reflects this - by how much is up for discussion - although we're inclined to say fully, or even more than fully. That doesn't mean the shares can't go higher. In fact, that's what we expect.Advising people to buy Shopify shares is more art than science. We are generally inclined to argue that if results fall short of expectations (which are generally a couple of points higher than company guidance at the minimum), the share price is in trouble. If results are considerably better than that, the shares could take another leap.But this is all against a backdrop of impressive company performance, even if growth disappoints, so unless something dramatic happens, time would tend to be on the side of the investor here.We tend to prefer Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN), while concentrating on big brands (it's a sort of Shopify-plus, one could argue). It's already profitable, enjoys much better margins and the shares are much cheaper (less than 4x 2017 sales) but growing at similar speed (once the change in business model is factored in).So we summarize. There are negatives, like the steep valuation, the stock-based compensation, the losses, the increasing dilution and the slowdown in growth. The positives are its still-hefty growth, the entrenched market position, the powerful platform economics and good operational leverage. If you add that up, we still think there is good risk/reward here."

Click here to find out more »I was recently asked by a client to help him choose an on-line e-commerce store front for his business. While doing so, I looked at two alternatives: Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and WiX (NASDAQ:WIX). This prompted me to look at both companies from both a financial and a product perspective and share my findings.Following is the stock graph for both companies:The correlation between both companies is very high and both have experienced a huge return on investment (383% for Shopify and 225% for WiX) in less than 3 years. Both companies operate in the same field (providers of e-commerce and web sites). In addition, both companies have comparable revenue (in the range of $500M each) and comparable number of employees (approximately 2,000 for Shopify and 2,400 for WiX).Shopify is an e-commerce platform, while WiX is a general web site building platform with e-commerce capabilities. WiX has come a long way over the past 12 months to the extent that it is now competing head-to-head with Shopify in the e-commerce software space, and is now considered the primary Shopify competitor. If this trend continues for the next 12 months, WiX will surpass Shopify from a functionality perspective, and this will result in significantly curtailing the potential growth rate for Shopify.Shopify and WiX have an overlap in terms of their target market. The following diagram shows how the customer base of both companies overlap:At a high level, if someone has a few products they are selling (like authors or sports clubs), they should use WiX. If someone is in the e-commerce business with hundreds of products, then Shopify would be a better choice.The following table provides a comparison between both products from a product perspective and the winner in each category:This section provides the detailed comparison of the above features. You might like to skip the details and jump directly to the BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL COMPARISON REVIEW BELOW.Given that most of the e-commerce clients for both companies are using the starting package, we will look at the starter package for both.WiX is conspicuously less expensive than Shopify. WiX starts at $17 per month while Shopify starts at $29. The features provided are very similar and comparable for simple e-commerce stores. For more details about the features, all you need to do is to search for ""WiX vs Shopify"" on YouTube, and you would get many videos that compare both platforms.Please note the date of the video you are watching. Many videos are outdated from 2016 and 2017. WiX has improved quite significantly over the last 12 months, and you should review the videos from 2018.In general, at the low end, both products provide very similar features. However, as the e-commerce needs increase, the Shopify features become better than the WiX features.While these videos are useful, you should take them with a grain of salt. WiX does not pay for referring clients to them, Shopify has an Affiliate Program that pays up to $2,000 for each merchant referral. In some comparison videos, you will find the presenter asking the viewer to click on a Shopify link for them to ""take credit and continue creating free comparison videos"".Both products are very easy to set up.WiX, being a general website builder platform, has more templates for different types of businesses, and you can add an on-line store for any of these templates as a separate page. WiX also has the WiX Artificial Design Intelligence in addition to its regular editor which can have the e-commerce site up and running in a very short time frame.Shopify, being specialized in e-commerce excels in the maintenance of the site after is being built. It also has a very large number of templates related to e-commerce sites. Shopify compares negatively against WiX from the perspective of enhancing the site with features that are not related to e-commerce, for example, blogs, resources, surveys, on-line bookings, memberships, calendars, and general forms.On the other hand, Shopify provides the ability for users to switch themes after the site is built, which is not yet available via WiX.In July 2017, WiX introduced WiX Code, the new feature that allows the site developers with an unlimited ability to introduce new features and have native database access to their site. More details are available in their public announcement: Wix Introduces Wix Code.I personally believe that WiX Code is an integral feature of WiX's strategy that would allow developers to create more advanced features which will eventually enhance the experience of WiX users.Shopify does not provide this level of flexibility in its site and its development standards are more rigid.Shopify has support for all subscription plans, while WiX has phone support only for the upper tier (which is still less expensive than Shopify). In addition, Shopify provides help with non-technical issues like how to sell your products. On the other hand WiX provides Professional Site Review with its upper tier plan ($25 per month, which is still less expensive than Shopify's starter plan at $29 per month).Both companies provide a comprehensive support database and a user group community that can help answering in-depth questions.CORRECTION: After publishing the report, WiX PR staff contacted me and informed me that while WiX does not provide a traditional call centre, they provide a call-back feature for all its users, even the free ones. According to WiX, this functionality is the same as calling and provides less sitting and waiting.In general, Shopify has better customer support compared to WiX.In this category, Shopify wins without competition. They allow integration with other platforms like Amazon, Facebook, Messenger and many other platforms. WiX does not have these capabilities, and Shopify clearly wins on this front.The following table provides a comparison between both companies from a financial perspectiveThe financial details are based on the latest annual financial results from both Shopify (Shopify Announces Fourth-Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results) and WiX (Wix Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results). All figures are in USD.Annual revenue for Shopify was $673M and for WiX was $425M. However these numbers do not tell the whole story:As a result of the above adjustments, on a non-GAAP basis, the revenue can be adjusted for both companies, and it would result in over $525M of revenue for WiX and lower than $450M for Shopify.Both companies have expenses in the low $400M ($429M for Shopify and $406M for WiX). If we look at the details of these expenses, we will see that the breakdown of expenses is marginally different:Looking at the trends, Shopify expenses went up by 75% year-over-year with most of the increase in the Sales and Marketing, while WiX expenses have gone up by 40%.I would personally see the expense profile marginally better for WiX which spends more on R&D compared to Shopify. The significant increase in the Sales and Marketing expenses for Shopify (about $100M increase) also worries me about their sales and marketing strategies.As of the end of the year, Shopify had $1,025M in current assets, while WiX had $264M. The more important factor is cash from operations. Shopify generated $8M from operating activities while WiX generated $83M from operating activities, more than 10 times as much. Moreover, the cash flow from operating activities from Shopify dropped by about 40% from $14M to $8M while WiX's cash flow from operating activities more than doubled from $40M to $83M.The above numbers provide a relatively gloomy picture for Shopify's cash flow from operating activities compared to WiX.Both companies are in a losing position, so the PE ration is not meaningful. However, price to revenue may provide a more meaningful measure for comparison.As of March 3rd, the market cap of Shopify was $11.95B compared to a market cap of $3.49B for WiX. That is, WiX is valued as a company at 30% of the value attributed to Shopify.On a non-adjusted GAAP basis, Shopify's revenue was $673M and WiX's revenue was $425M. This means that Shopify is trading at 17.8 times the historical GAAP revenue while WiX is trading at 8.2 times the historical GAAP revenue.Based on the adjusted financial statements, Shopify's revenue is approximately $450M and WiX's revenue is $600M. This would increase the price for Shopify to be 26.6 times the historical non-GAAP revenue and reduce the price for WiX to be 6.6 times the historical non-GAAP revenue.In other words, based on the adjusted historical financial statements, Shopify is about 4 times as expensive as WiX.The numbers do not lie, and based on historical figures, Shopify has experienced a higher growth rate compared to WiX both from revenue and number of customers perspectives.The following chart shows the GAAP revenue growth rate for Shopify (in millions of USD):This is an impressive chart and shows that, while both companies are experiencing a good growth rate, Shopify's revenue has been growing significantly faster than WiX.The next chart shows the paying subscriber[1] base growth rate:While WiX has a significantly higher number of paying customers, most of these customers are at much lower subscription base compared to Shopify. This shows that the per-user annual fee for WiX is significantly lower than that of Shopify, and accordingly they would be less price-sensitive and more committed to the WiX platform.In general Shopify beats WiX on all fronts of historical growth.While history may provide a glimpse on what the future is holding for us, this is not necessarily the case for the comparison between Shopify and WiX. Management guidance may also provide some indication, but in this fast changing environment, we cannot rely on them.Because of the continued growth of e-commerce, I expect both companies to continue growing. However, I expect the WiX growth rate to be increasing while the Shopify growth rate will be stagnant or even decline. Here are the reasons for my prediction:I would recommend longing WiX and shorting Shopify for the following reasons:[1] WiX has over 119,000,000 overall registered users, most of which are non-paying (only 3,200,000 are paying), which provides a tremendous growth opportunity for WiX."
4163174,103480,2018-04-16T06:58:21-04:00,"Shopify shares have lost 20% this month in tandem with Facebook's Cambridge Analytica crisis, as Facebook is Shopify's largest marketing channel.The selling accentuated when Citron Research issued a short opinion, citing a $100 price target.The company can't be considered ""cheap"" at 10x forward revenues, but if shares do fall further, Shopify could be a compelling rebound play.On top of growing MRR from standard merchant subscriptions, a diverse set of merchant solutions (Shopify Shipping, Shopify Pay, Shopify Capital) are padding Shopify's growth.The company is guiding to 46% revenue growth, and pro forma operating income (excluding stock comp) is expected to be about breakeven.","Last week, all the major headlines focused on one big event: Mark Zuckerberg's two days of hearings in front of the Senate and Congress. Actually, the spotlight has been on Facebook (FB) all month, ever since the company made its fated Cambridge Analytica disclosure on March 17. But amidst Facebook's battleground over data privacy, one other stock has been caught up as collateral damage, and that's Shopify (SHOP).The Ottawa-based technology company sits at the intersection of e-commerce and enterprise software. It powers the backend tools for mostly small, at-home merchants (though the company also does cater to some big-ticket enterprise customers like Budweiser (NYSE:BUD)) to quickly set up and run an online store, for a monthly fee of between $29-$299. This is a snapshot of the monthly subscription tiers for Shopify's flagship e-commerce offering - bear in mind that enterprise customers who use Shopify Plus receive custom pricing:Source: Shopify.comHere's the issue: the primary marketing channel for most of these small shops is Facebook. Andrew Left, of the famed short firm Citron Research, published a note on March 26 calling the Shopify-Facebook partnership as an ""unholy trinity"" that capitalized on user data to serve highly targeted ads. Citron's note is available on Seeking Alpha.While acknowledging the strength of Shopify's enterprise business (Shopify Plus), Citron believes Shopify's growth engine will start sputtering as increased scrutiny causes Facebook to rethink its data privacy policies. Left thinks Shopify sells a ""get-rich-quick"" scheme to entrepreneurs that relies on Facebook data, and that this ""punch bowl"" will soon be taken away. Owing largely to Citron's comments and $100 price target, Shopify has plummeted 20% in the past month (though it's still up 66% over the past twelve months).SHOP data by YChartsMake no mistake: Shopify is risky right now, and Citron's note captures a lot of the potential disruption that Shopify could suffer if its merchant acquisition rates begin declining after the Facebook scandal. It's also not a cheap stock. A quick valuation check: with its current market cap of $11.2 billion and after netting out its $938 million of cash, Shopify has a current enterprise value of $10.3 billion. Against Shopify's FY18 guidance range of $970-$990 million in revenues (note, though, that Shopify has a consistent history of beating earnings by 5% or more), this represents 10.5x EV/FY18 revenues - putting it right up against Adobe (ADBE) and Workday (WDAY) as one of the most expensive stocks in software.I do think a fantastic buying opportunity exists, however, if Shopify does drop to Citron's price target of $100, which implies an 8.8x EV/FY18 revenue multiple - far lower than Shopify's historical valuation averages. Given the hugely negative momentum over the past week, we could see a price in the low $100s very soon. The Facebook risk is highly relevant, but it shouldn't completely distract investors from all the bullish drivers that Shopify presents that have nothing to do with acquiring millionaire-hopeful Facebook merchants. Shopify's enterprise business remains solid, drawing recurring billings from the likes of Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY) (OTCPK:NSRGF), and it has also built out a full portfolio of merchant solutions to diversify its revenue base.I'm not a bull quite yet, but I'm willing to take a stake in this embattled company at the right price.There's no doubt that Shopify's growth in merchants has been the single driving factor behind the company's huge top-line growth and valuation explosion over the past year.In FY17, Shopify grew its monthly recurring revenue (MRR) to $29.9 million, up 62% y/y, with a retention rate above 100%. If Shopify froze its growth right now and simply retained its existing accounts, its MRR from merchant subscription fees would give it $358.5 million in annual revenues that it doesn't have to lift a finger to collect.Figure 1. Shopify key metricsSource: Shopify SEC filingThis is an impressive statistic. And the key driver behind it, of course, is the huge underlying growth in Shopify's merchant population. The company has grown its merchant base to 609,000 merchants as of the end of December 2017, up 61% y/y over 377,500 in December 2016. This, in turn, has driven 163 million online shoppers to Shopify's stores (+63% y/y) and GMV to $26.3 billion (+71% y/y).Figure 2. Shopify shopper growthSource: Shopify SEC filingIn general, Shopify has been almost doubling its merchant and shopper counts every year. Investors' fear is that with so much scrutiny on Facebook's ad policies, Facebook will implement a tighter lid on access to user data and drive would-be Shopify entrepreneurs away from using the platform.While this risk is real, it's not a foregone conclusion. Facebook is highly likely to clamp down on its data policies, but the impact on Shopify's merchant acquisition is still unknown and probably highly overestimated at the moment. Prospective shop owners don't ditch their dreams of owning an online store just because Facebook advertising suddenly becomes less powerful - and Facebook itself is just one (albeit dominant) marketing channel. Google AdWords and traditional SEO are still highly effective marketing tools.Shopify probably won't see the huge >60% growth in merchants this year, and it probably won't even hit 1 million sellers by the end of December - but with its retention rate above 100% to date, it's also foolish to start hypothesizing that its merchant count will begin a rapid churn. As growth from the SMB channel starts to fade, Shopify can count on its newer initiatives to provide its growth.In FY17, merchant solutions revenues made up 54% of Shopify's top line. That's up from 51.5% in FY16. Merchant solutions are also growing at a much faster clip than subscription fees, with merchant solutions revenues growing 81% y/y to $363.3 million, outpacing the 64% y/y growth in subscriptions. See the revenue breakdown below:Figure 3. Shopify revenue breakoutSource: Shopify SEC filingTo date, Shopify has disclosed that the majority of its merchant solutions revenues is still derived from Shopify Pay - the transaction and credit card fees that Shopify charges merchants for each sale. Emerging revenue streams from Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital (a merchant cash advance program), however, are beginning to make a significant contribution to the top line. Shopify Capital, in particular, issued $40 million in high-interest merchant cash advances in the fourth quarter of 2017, and while this is still a relatively small number, it's up nearly 3x from the prior Q4.Of course, each of Shopify's revenue streams is still highly interlinked to its success in growing the merchant base. But these additional offerings are extremely accretive in diversifying the company's revenue base and in providing more of a robust, complete platform to attract enterprise clients like Budweiser and Nestle to Shopify Plus, whose large billings will help Shopify cushion any impact from a slowdown in SMB merchants growth.In the mid-$110s, Shopify is fairly valued at ~10x forward revenues, with its bullish hypergrowth profile balanced by near-term risks induced by Facebook. I wouldn't suggest picking up shares at these levels. If, however, Shopify falls further to Citron Research's designated $100 mark, the company presents a compelling rebound play.Coverage on Shopify in recent days has mostly centered around the risk of merchant losses, and in the heat of that negative press, a large portion of the bullish narrative for Shopify has been mowed down. The company's growing enterprise business and additional offerings in Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital present additional growth drivers to complement any potential slowdown in merchant subscription fees. Potential is the operative word here - we don't know how big of a headwind the Facebook news is yet, if at all. And if history is any guide, Shopify has been a consistent outperformer during quarterly results - and it wasn't so long ago that, on the back of a huge Q4 beat, Shopify was a Wall Street favorite trading above $150.Look for a good entry point as shares continue to face selling pressure."
4168396,103480,2018-05-02T04:45:59-04:00,"Shopify managed a huge beat to analysts' expectations in its Q1 results, with revenues growing 68% y/y.It seems that fears of a souring from Facebook, the primary channel for Shopify merchants to sell their wares, have been exaggerated. Facebook's troubles haven't triggered a Shopify slowdown yet.Shopify's seller services like Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital continued to make progress in the quarter and add tertiary businesses for the company outside of subscription fees.Despite the earnings beat, Shopify shares still fell 5%.Given the recovery in Shopify shares since the Facebook fallout, and continued negative sentiment from high-profile investors, Shopify is a hold.","We can add Shopify (SHOP), the e-commerce software platform, to the large list of companies this quarter that have exceeded earnings expectations but saw a stock decline this quarter. The trend began with Alphabet (GOOG), where despite seeing sizable beats to consensus expectations on both the top and bottom line, investors sold off the search giant for fear of growing expenses. Hardware stocks like Seagate Technologies (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) followed the same pattern in their recent earnings releases.And now, Shopify. To tell the full truth with Shopify, however, the stock has endured some trying times over the past month. Shares dropped to multi-month lows in April as Facebook (FB) fell out with the media over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook is the primary marketing channel for Shopify sellers, so investors had feared that any slowdown in Facebook activity would also lead to a decline in Shopify seller additions. Shares aren't just reacting downward due to earnings, but to all the other uncertainties swirling around Spotify.Since Shopify's most recent trough, however, Facebook has posted strong earnings, and Shopify shares have recovered in sympathy. Yet it seems Q1's strong earnings weren't enough to lift the stock either, as share fell 5% in response (see chart below). Sentiment on the company continues to be negative, with short research firm Citron Research continuing its negative coverage of Shopify and now saying the company could be a target of the Trump administration (much like Amazon.com (AMZN)), due to the face that Shopify relies on cheap shipping and international imports from China.SHOP data by YChartsThere is some truth to Citron's concerns, as the uncertainty of U.S.-China relationships casts a heavy cloud over the dropship-heavy business model that Shopify focuses on. Ordinarily, I'd be an eager buyer of any shares that fell after a strong earnings release. In Shopify's case, however - given the controversies surrounding the stock and its already-high valuation - I'm content to stay on the sidelines and call this one a hold.A quick check on Shopify's valuation - at its current share price of $128, Shopify has a market cap of $12.79 billion. Netting out the $1.58 billion of cash on Shopify's Q1 balance sheet, the company's enterprise value is currently at $11.21 billion. Against Shopify's recently-increased FY18 revenue guidance rage of $1.0-$1.01 billion, Shopify currently trades at an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 11.2x - far more than the typical software company trading at 6-7x, even despite Shopify's growth premium (which, admittedly, is quite impressive at 68% y/y). I was originally eyeing an entry point close to $100, which was Citron's price target and represented 8.8x FY18 revenues. Now, with shares swiftly above 10x revenues despite the slight earnings stumble, Shopify is looking expensive (and thus quite risky) again.I'm content to keep waiting until shares drop again below $110, if the post-earnings selloff continues picking up pace.Here's how Shopify did in the first quarter:Figure 1. Shopify Q1 resultsSource: Shopify investor relationsBy all means, the company had a blowout quarter. There's no denying that Shopify is currently on extremely strong financial footing, with nearly unheard-of growth rates for a company that exceeds a $1 billion forward revenue guidance range. Whether this growth can be sustained in light of Facebook uncertainties and U.S. policy decisions, however, is another question and the biggest specter that hangs on the stock.Total revenues grew 68% y/y to $214.3 million, showing barely any deceleration from the 73% y/y growth that the company saw for the full year in FY17. Analysts, on the other had, were expecting just $202.2 million in revenues, representing 59% y/y growth. This makes Shopify's top-line beat in Q1 a nine-point upside to Wall Street's expectations, a result that would ordinarily result in a substantial stock pop.On the subscription revenues side - Shopify's bread and butter - the company called out strong new merchant additions (the most-feared item coming out of the Facebook scandal) and the corresponding growth in MRR (the monthly combined value of Shopify's subscription fees) as the primary drivers of strength. Subscription revenues grew 61% y/y to $100.2 million.Where Shopify continues to outperform expectations, however, is on the merchant solutions side. This business grew 75% y/y to $114.1 million, overtaking subscription revenues as the largest source of the revenue pie. While merchant solutions are lower-margin than subscription fees, the increased mix of Shopify's tertiary revenues is a huge positive for the business because it can benefit from the growth in its merchants and their associated volumes. As a customer grows on Shopify's platform, Shopify can really only benefit by upselling them to the next tier (unless they're an enterprise customer, at which pint pricing becomes variable). Between the standard ($79/month) Shopify subscription that's one tier above basic, and the Advanced Shopify ($299/month) subscription, there's a decent spread - but there's only so much that Shopify can grow its best individual customers to.With merchant solutions, however, Shopify can earn shipping fees (for example) as these large sellers accumulate larger and larger volumes. As such, the widened eligibility pool for Shopify Shipping in the quarter is a hugely positive development. Shopify Capital is another promising story, with merchant cash advances issued in the quarter rising 3x y/y. As most know, merchant cash advances are essentially high-interest short-term loans (though they are marketed much differently) that can provide a huge profit source for Shopify. On the profit side, Shopify continued to improve its performance. The company posted a GAAP operating loss of -$20.3 million in the quarter, representing a GAAP operating margin of just -9%; a decent improvement from the -11% it saw in 1Q17 and a stone's throw away from breakeven. Consistent with the company's business model, sales and marketing costs rose sharply in the quarter to help fuel new business, but over time as Shopify continues to scale toward the $1 billion revenue mark, it should be able to capture leverage on this front and bring down sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues. What is encouraging to see on the expense side, however, is that Shopify's general and administrative spend of $20.7 million in the quarter represented just 10% of revenues - two points better than 12% in 1Q17. Given that general overhead spending is the ""least productive"" of Shopify's opex categories (sales drives new customers, R&D drives new features which drives new customers, but general and administrative spending doesn't benefit the company much), this is a hugely positive signal of cost discipline.Shopify's pro forma EPS of $0.04 also beat analyst expectations of -$0.05 by a fairly wide margin, meaning that the top-line strength relative to consensus also translated extremely well into a profitability beat for Shopify. On the downside, however, Shopify had generated positive FCF of $1.4 million in 1Q17 - this quarter, FCF swag to a loss of -$3.5 million, though that's largely driven by working capital fluctuations and a slight uptick in capex, not due to true margin compression (as we saw above, Shopify's operating margins improved somewhat).Notching a strong quarter under its belt is certainly an important milestone for Shopify to move past the April Facebook episode. For the time being, however, shares will continue seeing pressure as investor concerns over Facebook linger and fresh new fears about U.S.-China relations fester.I still believe Shopify is a fantastic long-term play, as its ~70% growth rate atop extremely high margins and a near-breakeven financial profile make the company one of the most premium assets in the software sector. And say what you will about its business model, but Shopify truly does have few platform-agnostic e-commerce platforms out there, whereas opening a store on Amazon or eBay (EBAY) effectively locks sellers into their ecosystem. Shopify sellers, on the other hand, can be truly multichannel.With the stock tottering at 11x forward revenues amid a downtrend in which Shopify continues to search for a bottom, however, my sense is that there will be a much better opportunity to buy into shares for a cheaper price once the air clears. It's true that picking up shares for 5-8% cheaper might not be the most important decision driver for a true long-term investor, but I'm still extremely cautious about buying a stock in excess of 10x forward revenues, no matter how strong the financial profile. I'm keeping a close eye on the shares with a largely positive outlook, but I'm not yet a buyer in the $120 range. The mid $100s would be my sweet spot - and if Shopify doesn't get there, plenty of other high-growth alternatives exist in the market."

The title is self-explanatory: I look for stocks which I think have the potential to become multibaggers over the long term. The 'over the long term' part is extremely important for me. I am a growth and value investor (hence my pen name) and I don't mind that my growth stocks drop like a rock every now and then. I always keep my stocks, unless something really fundamentally has changed.Market sentiment and momentum are not part of the fundamentals for me. A stock can underperform for a few years because of a sector that is less popular or one or two pundits who feel that the stock is overpriced, but I don't mind that at all. I look at the underlying part, which is sometimes forgotten, especially by chart readers (with all respect, by the way): the company itself and its place in the new developments that point to the future.Over the long run (which can mean decades of buying-and-holding), this is the most important issue. Sometimes a company invests heavily and that can be at the expense of profitability. Over the short term, this might bring down the stock price, but most often, if the investments make sense, over the long term, this is a boost for the stock price.A year ago, when I started the series of Potential Multibaggers, I picked Shopify (SHOP) as the very first stock.I believe in the stocks I write about in this series and have them all in my real personal portfolio. If my investment thesis plays out, I add to winners (and sometimes to high conviction losers). It is counterintuitive for most investors to average up (it was for me too in the beginning, I have to admit), but that is mostly a better strategy than averaging down. Beware of the word 'mostly'. As in life itself, there are no eternal truths in the stock market.Since I have picked Shopify a year ago, the stock has done very well:SHOP data by YChartsAs you can see, Shopify's stock performance was quite volatile, but overall it beats the S&P 500 (SPY) by more than 55%. The volatility is typical for most stocks in the series of Potential Multibaggers. Mostly these stocks have a high growth profile and often a lot of growth has been calculated into the stock price. When investors' sentiment turns somewhat sour, the traders in these stocks want to secure their gains and sell quickly, which can cause huge drops in the charts. You can see a few for yourself in the SHOP chart.I think most of you who have clicked on my article (thanks!) have done that to see the answer to this question, so I am not going to hide it somewhere at the end of the article: is Shopify near all-time highs still interesting?A lot of investors just look at the numbers. And those are not rosy for Shopify: there is a negative P/E, a forward P/E of 260 and a P/S of 20. I'm pretty sure these numbers will prevent a lot of investors to ever consider taking a position in this stock. But I am regularly adding to my position and plan to keep doing that for the foreseeable future.Why? Well, as in life, in investing not everything comes down to numbers . Yes, of course, Shopify has a big premium on it back, which could be the reason why it drops a lot if there is some sort of setback. That was the case at the end of March and the first half of April, when the stock dropped 23.6% in just three weeks after the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) scandal with Cambridge Analytica and analysts (and shorters like Andrew Left) shouted out that this scandal might impact Shopify as well. The stock is almost back at its peak now, but these kinds of drops could happen again.SHOP data by YChartsBut over the long term, Shopify has got a very interesting trend behind its huge growth engine.I have been reading The End of Jobs, a very interesting book by Taylor Pearson.In his book, the author shows that we are in a new age. After the century of knowledge, we are in the century of the entrepreneur. Since 2000, millions of manufacturing jobs have been lost in the US:(Source: CNN)But there is another evolution going on: more and more jobs which require skills such as computing, design, accounting and other white collar skills are being outsourced to new economies such as China and India. Those countries have a huge number of people who have high degrees, but are willing to work for $1,000 per month or less because the standard of living is different in those countries.The reaction: more and more millennials start to work for themselves, as a side-hustle or main profession. The number of self-employed workers could triple over the next few years, some believe. Millennials don't want to work that hard to climb the corporate ladder only to be sacked when the company relocates its computer department to India, for example. The biggest advantage of large companies, job security, has evaporated. So if you have little job security already, why not try it as a self-employed worker? Maybe there is a possibility to have a better work-life balance too.Shopify is of course one of the best ways to develop your own store online and become self-employed in that way. It can easily start as a side-hustle and you don't need a lot of technical knowledge. I think that every traditional mom-and-pop store will be online within ten years maximum and a lot are already today. Amazon (AMZN) is not always seen as the best partner in this process, since it has a lot of data which it can use against its own sellers to take the profit. The platform can become a competitor by undercutting the price of the most popular product of third party sellers.Shopify is often a better solution there and Amazon had to acknowledge that too. The market sees that as well and that is the reason why Shopify's stock price trades at a high premium. Amazon too has had a negative P/E or a sky high one for many years now, but no one will argue that it is one of the best investments ever.I think that Shopify may well be the next Amazon-like investment. All the signs are there: a social trend, constant innovation, users' comfort, facilitating people to make (or save) money and a full integrated system. I could go on, but I think you understand what I mean. Maybe next year, when I review this first Potential Multibagger again, I will have to say that the stock has lost 50%. That is always possible in a bear market. But I'm pretty confident that over the long haul, ten years or more, Shopify will turn out to be an investment that people think about 'If only I had...'The rest of the article will be devoted to some events that have happened over the last year.As a long-term investor, you should wonder if anything has really changed. I definitely had a look at how Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal could affect Shopify. Citron Research's Andrew Left made a whole lot of fuss around it. And I have read the article thoroughly, because as a good investor, it is always better to read the opinions that challenge your beliefs than those that are completely similar.(Source: Twitter)And I have to admit that Left is a somewhat dramatic but very good writer, technically spoken that is. He has a compelling style, builds well-structured texts and uses all rhetoric tricks that suit his case. But for authors with such a compelling style, you should always be even more critical and examine if the article is fact or fiction. As in most cases, you should follow the money and Left has made his short thesis for Shopify a few times now. He announces when he shorts, but not when he covers.Does it mean that he doesn't have a point at all? No, but I think he doesn't look at the complete picture. Shopify's affiliate marketing program is indeed quite aggressive, but it is not a Ponzi scheme, as he wants you to believe. Left exaggerates also when he brings in the retirement letter for Shopify sellers who want to quit their ordinary job. And he clearly overstates the consequences for Facebook in his second short argument, as Facebook's earnings have shown. But Shopify dropped quite dramatically over the fears, as you can see in the chart of April. And it has not completely climbed back to those highs yet, making it maybe an opportunity to buy or add to this stock.On May 1st, Shopify released its Q1 2018 earnings. The total revenue of Shopify went up by 68% YoY to $214.3M, easily jumping over the analysts' expectations of 59% growth. Just to show you how incredible this is: in 2015, just a few year ago, over the whole year, Shopify's revenue was less than this quarter alone.And I don't think this pace will slow considerably over the next few years. Of course, because of the law of large numbers, it will slow in percentages at a certain moment, but the trend is there. Because of the add-ons Shopify is building out impressively too (Shopify Capital and Shopify Shipping, for example), the company has many levers to keep its flying wheel going.Most investors identify Shopify with its subscription based revenue. And that revenue grew 61% to top $100M. This was because of the rising number of merchants joining the Shopify platform.But the real star of the earnings was the Merchant Solutions, which grew by 75% and is bigger now than the subscription-based revenue. Solutions are a rather low-margin business, but they are indispensable for most merchants: shipping, transactions, etc. I think that this shows that Shopify will keep expanding its services to be able to attract even more merchants.The R&D expenses were up again with 18.3% versus the last quarter, almost 80% year over year. I have already mentioned in several previous articles that I think R&D is one of the smartest investments any company can make. For Shopify, this means certainly finding more and better Merchant Solutions.Unite is Shopify's annual conference for their developers' community. It was held last week, from May 7th to 9th, 2018. The motto was: 'Retail is not dead, it’s changing: making retail accessible to every merchant supports a thriving economy.'(Source: Shopify.com)As with most developers' conferences, there is a whole lot of technical details. I will highlight the most important announcements. If you want more details, then you can read a more elaborate summary here.A first news item that was announced is that marketing will be made simpler and more integrated. This is important for users but also for investors, since users can stay inside the system and again more revenue for Merchant Solutions can be generated.Shopify also announced Ping, a free mobile work space for merchants that can be used for conversations with customers, for marketing overview and so on. I think it is a great way to know what shoppers really want and it can give the Shopify Merchants an edge for costumer focus.Kit is integrated in Ping. It is a tool to fulfill advertising campaigns through Facebook and Instagram ads and e-mail using the information the merchant has gathered with Ping.The downside about all this is that at this moment these perks are only announced for iOS and not for Android. But I guess that is just a matter of time.Another improvement is the new discounts formulas. Merchants can make new actions like 'buy two, get one free' or discounts for bigger orders ('buy more than $100 and get $10 free).There was also an announcement of a new Tap & Chip Reader, a contactless payments processor that can be used both with credit cards and mobile wallets (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay).(Source: Shopify.com)There are a few other developments, such as easier returns and a clearer mobile view of the order at checkout. But all in all, I think the general conclusion is that Shopify keeps expanding its universe and that it does everything to keep merchants and their clients in their universe of related services. That is exactly the thing I expect from my investments.There was a remarkable passage in the earnings call. This is what Amy Shapiro, Shopify's brand new CFO, said:(Source: Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash)I don't know about you, but for me this is a clear sign that Shopify is on an acquisition prowl. This is not new in Shopify's history. It has completed six acquisitions before.One of those was Kit in April 2016. It was brought into the the ecosystem already a few months later. Other acquisitions were Start Studios in February 2012, a mobile app developer, Jet Cooper, a design and user experience agency in August 2013, software developer Boltmade in October 2016, digital product studio Tiny Hearts in December 2016 and the dropshipping service Oberlo in May 2017 for $15M. That is the only disclosed acquisition price, as far as I know.The hoarding of cash and the mysterious announcement make me think that Shopify is in search of a bigger target now. But it has proved in the past to be a prudent acquirer, first examining what it could need and only after that process make a precise acquisition. Let's wait and see on this one.Although Shopify's stock price has had some big ups and downs, the stock is up considerably, beating the S&P 500 by more than 55%. The social trend (the age the entrepreneur) and the financial results point in the same direction: Shopify is a premium company. Its stock price sports a premium price as well, but let that not hold you back from buying.If you don't want to miss any Potential Multibaggers installments or updates, feel free to hit the follow button.In the meantime, keep growing!"

Mostly in line with our forecast.Margin expansion drives our fair value up to US$164/share from US$134/share.What we learned a year after initiating coverage on Shopify.,"We recommend buying Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) below US$164 per share, up from our previous fair value of US$134 per share (based on our 10-year Discounted Cash Flow model). After a strong 1Q18, we have adjusted our estimates. Revenue hasn't changed much in our model. The real driver is the execution of its business model driving higher-margin revenues.In this article, we compare the differences in our model from one-year ago (published May 15, 2017) to today's model. Unpacking the reasons why our fair value has risen from US$90 per share to US$164 per share.The results were good, mostly in line with our forecast.(+) Total revenue of $214.3 million (vs. SMRE forecast of $209.9 million)(+/=) Subscription Solutions revenue of $100.2 million (vs. SMRE: $99.6 million)(+) Merchant Solutions revenue of $114.1 million (vs. SMRE: $110.3 million)(-) Operating Loss of -$20.3 million (vs. SMRE: -$12.8 million)(-/=) Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) of $32.5 million (vs. SMRE: $32.9 million)(+/=) GMV $7.95 billion (vs. SMRE: $7.9 billion)Operating loss was a little higher than expected:Management stated in the conference call that the redundant costs are expected to be complete by the end of 2018.In 1Q18, we saw something very interesting happen. Merchant Solutions' gross margin was 41%, the highest we've seen it at scale. We had only forecasted 36.5% for this quarter. While one quarter doesn't make a trend, there seem to be logical drivers.When talking about Merchant Solutions' cost of revenue:Shopify Payments saw improved margins. Management has mentioned that the contract with Stripe includes improved margins for Shopify as GPV (Gross Processing Volume = Merchant sales processed through Shopify Payments) increases. The other drivers include an increased contribution from Shopify Capital and Shipping, which come with higher marginsA year ago on May 15, 2017, we made our first forecast of Shopify. You can see the article titled Shopify: 10 Year Revenue Forecast.The easiest way to compare how the model has evolved over time is through the chart below.The first thing I want to draw your attention to is 2017 reported results versus our initial forecast. Shopify delivered better-than-expected results on revenue and margins. Keeping in mind that management guidance was for revenue between $615 million to $630 million, we were already being aggressive in our estimate at $659 million, and yet Shopify delivered $673 million in 2017 revenue.Our original 2018 revenue forecast of $1.026 billion (on May 15, 2017) is above management's initial guidance of $970 million to $990 million and is still above the updated 2018 guidance of $1 billion to $1.01 billion. But given Shopify's history of providing ""what has proven to be"" conservative guidance, we are more confident that our current revenue forecast of $1.058 billion is attainable in 2018.The second thing I want to draw your attention to is the variances in the gross margins but specifically that of Merchant Solutions' gross margin highlighted in green.Source: SMRE Forecast ModelOur original 2026 forecast for gross margin was 1,160 bps lower than it is now. This is not a typo. This improved margin forecast is not only driven by the improving margin from Shopify Payments but also an expectation that innovative and higher-margin solutions like Shopify Capital and Shipping will become bigger contributors.We also believe Subscription Solutions will find even greater margins above 80% as scale drives cost savings. The improved outlook for gross margin is a primary driver of our increased fair value over the last one year from US$90/share to US$164/share.Our takeaway from analyzing the evolution of our model over the last year is that Shopify has been able to execute against our model well. In fact, its execution and innovation have made our original model seem overly conservative from a margin standpoint.In 2018, we have revised up our Merchant Solutions gross margin forecast from 33.7% to 40.5% to reflect our belief that Shopify can continue to deliver more high-margin revenue (demonstrated in 1Q18) through its current offerings but also new innovative services yet to be announced.Our 10-year DCF model suggests a fair value of US$164/share. We are long-term shareholders, and we recommend buying Shopify at or below our fair value.Author Recommended Articles"

The e-commerce solutions provider might take a ding from privacy concerns related to Facebook, but the bigger issue is crucial valuation multiples.Source: Citron ResearchCitron Research warned investors that the investment thesis on Shopify is built on ""entrepreneurs"" that are using the e-commerce platform and Facebook or Instagram ads to drive merchandise sales. These people aren't real retailers or brands, but rather just wholesalers and in some cases not even legitimate businesses in China and other unsavory locations.The Citron research highlights how true Shopify merchant account growth is decelerating and GMV/account is actually turning negative. The company ended Q4 with approximately 3,600 merchants on Shopify Plus reducing the growth rate from last year while only seeing a profound growth in the total merchants to 609,000.Source: Citron ResearchThe quality of new accounts is definitely important to valuing the stock, but the company probably doesn't care so much about what Citron Research calls as small ""entrepreneurs"". The real key is whether these merchants are real businesses or not. Whether they benefit from ad targeting on Facebook probably isn't a huge impact to the overall success of Shopify and indeed is difficult to derive the actual numbers.The Shopify Plus accounts are growing their share of monthly recurring revenue to 21%, up from 17% last year. If anything, some signs exist that business is moving away from these accounts that Citron is warning about. The negative thesis though isn't really based on these accounts, but rather just enhanced.The bigger issue addressed in my investment blog a few weeks ago was the insane valuation on the stock of an e-commerce platform. The days of extreme growth are coming to an end as revenues see decelerating growth that always kills valuation multiples.Shopify dipped to 70% growth in Q4 and is forecasting revenue dipping below 50% this year. Analysts expect another dip below 40% in 2019.SHOP Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsHuge deceleration in revenue growth is a big headwind for a stock trading at 14x estimated forward sales. As growth slows down, Shopify is expected to trade more in line with stocks like Wix.com (WIX) and eBay (EBAY). Those stocks trade at a third of the EV/Revenues multiple of Shopify.SHOP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsIssues with the quality of revenue growth in the last year or so could further impact the short-term growth rates. A few percentage point hit in 2018 could leave Shopify growing closer to the targeted 40% growth rate of Wix. Notice how Shopify traded closer to the multiple of Wix about a year ago before the stock went on the major rally from $50 to $150.The key investor takeaway is that tighter Facebook restrictions to privacy could impact Shopify customer counts though any short thesis can't ultimately rely on such an occurrence. These customers could easily find another way to target consumers to drive sales.The bigger issue for any long is that the stock is extremely expensive for one with legitimate concerns about the quality of account growth. Don't touch Shopify near all-time highs at $140."
4158921,104302,2018-03-26T13:36:26-04:00,"Competition is very fierce among larger e-commerce players.This competition is resulting in reducing the prices, improving the return policies and providing better interface and customer support.Buyers are getting more experienced with e-commerce and online shopping.The above pressures are raising the bar for entry into the e-commerce business, and existing smaller online stores' profitability will gradually drop.This article shows how the larger e-commerce companies competitive pressures on smaller online stores will negatively impact Shopify’s profitability and valuation.","It is hard for someone to argue against e-commerce and online shopping being the way of the future. Global e-commerce retail sales are expected to double from 2017 through 2021 to $4.5 trillion, as per the following graph from the Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) website:Source: Shopify with data from StatistaAs a result, we would expect that all companies in the e-commerce space would benefit from this growth, correct?I would argue that this is not necessarily correct. Some companies will certainly benefit, and other companies will not. This article studies the impact of e-commerce growth and competitiveness on Shopify and the detailed study confirms that Shopify is under a high risk of losing both on the revenue and valuation fronts.The article first identifies the criteria that make companies successful in e-commerce by reviewing the characteristics of the largest and most successful e-commerce firms in the world. The article then assesses whether the majority of Shopify's clients (small online stores with three or less full-time employees or equivalents) possess these criteria or not. This detailed analysis confirms that the small online stores do not possess the basic criteria to succeed in a competitive e-commerce world dominated by the larger e-commerce firms.Through this analysis the article concludes that, in the long term, the Shopify stock price will be negatively impacted as a result of the smaller online stores going out of business or not achieving the success expected. Just to clarify, this article does not discuss the direct competition that Shopify has with other e-commerce software providers, the quality of Shopify's software, the partnerships that Shopify has or Shopify's financial statement analysis. This article rather focuses on the potential decline of the vast majority of Shopify's target market and provides the analysis of why this target market would be declining.The next chart from Statista shows the percentage of online retail compared to traditional retail, and extrapolates this trend into the future.Source: StatistaContrary to the graph, I am personally expecting that the conversion from traditional retail to e-commerce retail will be growing at a geometric rate rather than at a linear rate for the next few years.The primary reason for this expectation is the huge drive from brick-and-mortar stores to sell their products online, which will further drive this conversion. The most apparent example of that is Walmart (NYSE:WMT), whose management team is expecting, through its latest full-year guidance, a massive shift from physical retail to online retail with a 40% growth in the e-commerce sales. In either case, even if this growth is linear, e-commerce will overtake traditional offline retail by 2034.The next chart, from Statista as well, is very important and shows the percentage of global e-commerce sales by company. Please note that Taobao.com, and Tmall.com are operated by Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA). While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still the market leader worldwide at 16%, Taobao and Tmall combined hold 40% more global market share than Amazon.Also, please note that Walmart owns over 12% of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and a further increase of Walmart ownership in JD.com is not far-fetched. With Walmart's Flipkart investment, Walmart can also be considered one of the larger e-commerce players. Because of the diversity of Walmart's operations and the size of its combined online and offline sales volume (higher than the three top e-commerce companies combined), we will exclude Walmart from our analysis and focus only on the top three e-commerce companies.Source: StatistaAs shown in the chart, the e-commerce business is highly concentrated with the top three companies controlling about 50% of the market and the top 15 companies controlling about 65% of the market.Again, remember that the objective of this article is to assess whether the vast majority of Shopify's client base (smaller online stores) can succeed in the e-commerce market or not, and how this may impact the overall revenue stream and valuation of Shopify. Let's now look at the top three players (Alibaba through Taobao.com and Tmall.com, Amazon and JD.com), study the common characteristics among them, and assess whether the smaller online stores (the vast majority of Shopify's clients) possess these characteristics:Size of Selection and Online Store DesignAll the top e-commerce companies pride themselves of their huge selections including long tail items; It is very difficult nowadays to desire a particular item and not find it online in any of the larger e-commerce sites. And, not only would you find the brand you are looking for, but you would also find different alternatives that might be better in price, quality or delivery time.Source: Information Systems: A Manager's Guide to Harnessing Technology, Version 6.0, 2018, Boston Academic Publishing, Inc.In addition, these top companies use extensive A/B testing mechanisms to ensure the best design of their online stores and the highest visitor retention and CTR (Click-Through Rate) possible. This results in buyer behaviors similar to impulsive purchase behaviors in physical retailers' stores resulting from the stores organizing items on the shelves in certain ways to encourage more sales.On the other hand, smaller online stores, the vast majority of Shopify's clients, usually focus on very specific long tail items and usually have a limited selection. This may be attractive for customers who want to buy one specific item and this target market is very small. In addition, if the large e-commerce companies sell the same item, the small online store would encounter significant price pressures that would force them to drop their prices and cut into their profit margins.Small online stores do not have the resources to conduct proper AB Testing, and would need to rely on the expertise provided by industry experts or the results of public online surveys. Their sites may look pretty, but most small online store website utility would not be as good as those of larger e-commerce companies. In addition, achieving impulsive purchases would be very difficult with small online stores.Small online stores were successful in the past carrying long tail items because they were mostly competing with physical retailers who do not carry these items. As larger e-commerce companies continue increasing the scope of the items they are carrying, relying on strictly carrying long tail items would no longer be the means for achieving a fast, successful and profitable business as it has been in the past.AutomationThe fulfillment center of any of these larger e-commerce companies is almost fully automated with robots and these larger e-commerce companies continue to pump massive investments into improving the efficiency of their fulfillment centers. The improvements in operational efficiency achieve economies of scale and result in a significant reduction in the overall fulfillment costs; this is then passed as lower prices on to the customers thereby increasing the price competition.Smaller online stores have no resources or scale to introduce automation into their fulfillment process; their only choice to indirectly introduce automation is by using drop-shipping from some of the larger e-commerce companies (like AliExpress, for example). Coincidentally, AliExpress is extensively using drop-shipping as well for many of its products, and having two levels of drop-shipping causes serious operational problems related to the return process and policy. Without drop-shipping and without automation, the fulfillment cost of the products will be prohibitively high for any e-commerce company.Suitability of the Drop-Shipping ModelI personally think that drop-shipping is a brilliant e-commerce retail model for larger e-commerce companies. For example, Alibaba and JD.com use drop-shipping extensively, and it is a very profitable business model for both them and the vendors. Amazon is indirectly using drop-shipping principles with Amazon Marketplace, and it is also a very profitable business for them.Many Shopify proponents' advertisements and YouTube videos promise huge riches for small online stores using drop-shipping; even Shopify directly promises its users that they will potentially be millionaires, as shown in the screen shots below:Source: Shopify Facebook page and the Shopify page linked to itI was personally very concerned that Shopify's management allowed the ridiculous posting on Facebook Shopify page stating that ""2,700 people become millionaires every day; Build your Store on FB!"" Anyone reading this FB post would presume that they are talking about being a millionaire by building a Shopify store; the link of this posting actually points to a Shopify page with a title: ""The online store for someday millionaires."" I'm not entirely sure about the legal ramifications of posting such advertisements, but I think it looks more like ""shady"" advertising.To show how ridiculous this post is, and how it might be construed as misinformation or even false advertising, let's look at some numbers: To become a millionaire and to generate an income of $1M annually, assuming a margin of 20%, someone would need to have sales of $5M. With 2,700 millionaires every day, we are talking about $13.5B of daily sales. Multiply that by 356 days in a year and we are talking about $4.9 Trillions, more than the projected overall, worldwide, e-commerce sales in 2021 as per the Shopify's website. To put this number more in perspective, $4.9T is about five times as much as the overall U.S. annual deficit for 2019.Despite the assurances, I believe that drop-shipping is not suitable and will be short-lived as a business model for small online stores. Here are some scenarios that would render drop-shipping for small online stores as a non-viable option:Any of the above likely scenarios would result in negatively impacting the reputation of the small online store; most customers will not visit the same store again if they can find the same product at a lower price and/or better service/return policy elsewhere. We also have to remember that negative experiences usually spread faster than positive ones. The only way to recover from this reputation problem is to create a new store with a new brand; this would be an expensive endeavor mostly in terms of time and effort in addition to the cost of creating a new marketing campaign. In other words, consistently offering a product at the lowest price and best service using drop-shipping is almost impossible for smaller online stores while it is possible for larger e-commerce companies.In general, drop-shipping with smaller online stores that provide lower value than larger e-commerce companies (higher price, strict return policy, slow delivery and/or delayed customer support) would only succeed with uniformed buyers. As buyers gain more experience in the e-commerce world and know where to go for the best price, superior service, faster delivery and lenient return policy, they would avoid using small drop-shipping online stores that provide a lower value.The suitability of the drop-shipping business model for smaller online stores is the cornerstone of Shopify proponents' advertising. I am greatly concerned with Shopify continuing to allow such advertisements and even providing awards for them. Shopify awarded the 2017 Best e-commerce course to Anton Carly's ""Want To Own Your Own Online Drop-Shipping Business."" I saw Anton on YouTube, and he is a brilliant guy, very eloquent and provides some very valuable information; I have no doubt that his educational course was very well delivered. My concern is Shopify's push of drop-shipping for small online stores and promising them great riches from it; my analysis shows that, while not impossible, it is very difficult to have a successful drop-shipping business that can guarantee an above average income.Even Shopify itself is promoting drop-shipping and has published an online book called ""The Ultimate Guide to Drop-Shipping."" When Tobias Lütke was asked about the prospects of drop-shipping in the next 12-18 months in the Shopify Q4 2017 financial results conference call, I found his answer relatively vague, that he did not address the question and talked more about the history of drop-shipping.With the above preliminary analysis, promising huge riches through adopting the drop-shipping business model for smaller online stores is a shady business and may be construed as crossing the line towards false advertising.Return Policy and SupportEach one of the three big companies has a very lenient return policy, and provides a well-documented policy for receiving a refund in case the product is defective or even late. Sometimes, these companies provide a refund and suggest that the customer keeps the originally shipped product instead of returning it if it is the company's mistake; this happened with me twice with Amazon and Walmart.Most small online stores have an inferior return policy compared to larger e-commerce companies and sometimes they do not even allow returns. If a small online store is using over-seas drop-shipping, through AliExpress, for example, the returned items would most likely not go back to China; they would be kept with the store owner, hoping to sell them to the next buyer. Without a lenient return policy, the small online store would receive negative comments, putting their whole operation in jeopardy.The larger e-commerce companies are competing extensively on the support structure; a 24/7 support phone line or chat line is not untypical for these companies. This level of competition is continuously increasing the barrier to entry for new small online stores while increasing the pressure on existing smaller players to provide the same level of support as the larger e-commerce companies.Smaller online stores do not have the resources to compete at this level and as a result the number of new entrants in the e-commerce business as small online stores will continue dropping. While we do not have the churn rate from Shopify and we cannot accurately figure out how the number of Shopify merchants will be impacted, the above analysis indicates that the net number of Shopify merchants will likely be dropping.Financial Resources, Inventory Turnover and Cash Conversion CycleEach one of the big three companies has an inventory turnover of over 16 times on an annual basis. As per Amazon's latest financial report, their inventory turnover is 16 times annually. Alibaba and JD.com use drop-shipping much more extensively than Amazon; as a result, their inventory turnover will be higher than 16 times. Compare this to Walmart at 8.8 times and Barnes and Noble at only 3.3 times.Because they pay their providers usually after 30 days, they would have a negative cash conversion cycle (CCC) as they normally sell the product in less than 30 days. In addition, the three big companies have different forms of drop-shipping operations (Fulfillment By Vendor - FBV for Amazon Marketplace, for example), which would result in their cash conversion cycle being even more negative.Unless the small online stores use drop-shipping they would suffer from a relatively low inventory turnover and a highly positive CCC; this is because the small online stores do not have leverage to delay the vendor payments and the vendors would usually require their payment upfront. We now know that drop-shipping introduces significant challenges for small online stores, and that the store owners may be better off avoiding it altogether. This means that their start-up costs would be high and maintaining their business would require deep pockets. Accordingly, they would not get rich any time soon.Each one of these top three companies has amazingly high amounts of cash and short-term investments on their balance sheet; the following table shows some interesting financial details related to the balance sheets of Alibaba and Amazon from their last financial statements. JD.com's numbers are also in the tens of billions.Just as a side note, while Alibaba seems to have a much stronger balance sheet compared to Amazon, don't underestimate the power of $30 billion in cash, with operations that have a highly negative CCC.The above numbers are in a totally different league compared to the vast majority of Shopify's clients, the small online stores with three or less employees. These huge cash balances combined with a negative CCC business model provide these large e-commerce companies with a strong cushion to weather any downturn in the e-commerce market; small online stores do not have such a financial cushion. This exposes the small online stores to a significant risk of not being able to weather a downturn in the e-commerce market, and this risk is in turn transferred to their software provider, Shopify.Before conducting some financial calculations to substantiate the above points, let's start by recognizing that getting a 5% margin for online sales is not easy. Even for a company like Amazon, their net income from their last financial statements was $3.03B over a revenue of $177.87B, resulting in a margin of only 1.7%.Now, for our simple calculation: assume that smaller online stores can get a 5% margin. If their objective is to generate $50,000 of income per year, they would need to sell products for $1M ($50,000 / 5%). If every product that they sell is worth approximately $20, then they should be selling 50,000 units ($1M / $20), or an average of 139 (50,000 / 356) sales per day.139 sales per day looks to me like a successful story for a small online store. The problem is that the net income would be only $50,000, a far stretch from being a millionaire as promised by Shopify and its proponents.Investments in DataAny large e-commerce company has an abundance of data about its customers available at its fingertips. This data includes personal information about their clients combined with their buying history and habits, and even their site navigation style. This results in the ability to personalize the web stores for every buyer. For example, Amazon is focusing extensively on this approach and calls it p13n as there are 13 letters between ""p"" and ""n"" in ""personalization.""These top e-commerce companies sometimes even go to the extent of using AI techniques in this personalization to provide social proofing of other products thereby increasing the number of items sold within each visit.Personalization for small online stores is not possible unless their provider (e.g., Shopify) divulges personal information of customers from other clients, which would put Shopify in a serious privacy predicament. Regarding the client data utilization, the smaller online stores will always be at a disadvantage in their competition with the larger e-commerce companies.Diversified Operations and Physical PresenceIt is not abnormal for the larger e-commerce companies to have operations in business areas that may not seem to be directly related to e-commerce. For example, Amazon is in home security (Ring), streaming (Twitch) and Cloud computing (AWS). Alibaba is in marketing technology (Alimama), cloud computing (Alibaba Cloud) and financial services (Ant Financial). JD.com is in messaging (WeChat), ride-hailing (Go-Jek) and grocery supermarkets (7FRESH).The above are just examples, and these companies are involved in much more diversified businesses that do not seem from the surface directly related to e-commerce. However, a deeper look into these businesses confirms that most of them represent vertical integration with basic e-commerce operations. This vertical integration will result in lowering the final price of the products and introduce extensive competition for companies that do not have this vertical integration.Each of the three e-commerce companies has a significant physical presence; this presence mostly came through acquisitions. The physical presence provides better confidence to the buyers that they can find someone to talk to face to face, and more importantly serves both as fulfillment centers for perishable products (e.g., groceries) and as pickup and return centers for online sales.The above characteristics of diversified operations and physical presence are not possible for the vast majority of Shopify's clients (small online stores), which puts them at a serious disadvantage in their competition with the larger e-commerce companies.Marketing BudgetsEach of these larger companies has a huge budget earmarked for marketing. For example, Amazon had a marketing budget in excess of $10 Billion as per its last financial statements. Alibaba and JD.com have marketing budgets measured in billions as well.These marketing budgets seem huge, but they pale compared to the overall revenue of these companies. For example, the $10B marketing budget for Amazon is only 5.6% of its sales revenue ($177B).For a small online store to succeed, it would need a relatively high marketing budget for paid traffic to their site. According to WordStream, the average cost of Google AdWords is between $1 and $2 per click. The next table from Compass shows that the top 10% of online retailers have a 3.77% conversion rate, or about one sale for every 27 clicks.Source: Ecommerce Genome by CompassIf the small online store uses Google Adwords as recommended by Shopify, even at 50% of their sales, the rest being unpaid traffic, and with the lowest cost per click ($1) and the highest conversion rate (3.77%), then we are talking about a marketing cost of $14 per item. Depending on the sale price of the item, the percentage of the sale going to the marketing may be quite high. To get to Amazon's 5.6% the item should sell for $250. This shows that most small online stores have marketing budget much higher than 5.6%.Shopify's e-commerce university has a myriad of discussions about the budget to be allocated to marketing the products. Most of the answers from mentors and Shopify experts are pointing to a minimum of 10%. With this 10%, small online stores will be at a disadvantage compared to larger e-commerce companies that normally spend much less than 10% on their marketing efforts.To summarize: The cost of the paid traffic for small online stores would significantly eat into the thin margins under which they are operating, and may render their business model to be unprofitable.Scale and Negotiation Power over VendorsWith the huge scale of the larger e-commerce companies, they can demand a lot from their vendors to both increase their profits and pass the savings on to their clients. Some of the demands on the vendors would include:These demands cannot be made except with a large purchasing power. Because small online stores usually have relatively low volumes, they would have limited negotiation powers with the vendors compared to larger e-commerce firms. The limited negotiation power would result in a higher cost for their products that would be passed on to the buyers, thereby reducing their competitive advantage compared to larger e-commerce companies.ReputationThis might the most important difference between larger e-commerce companies and smaller online stores. We can all agree that most online shoppers will likely go to a site that they know and trust rather to a new company that they never heard about before.From my perspective, reputation is the largest barrier to entry for small online stores, and overcoming this barrier is very expensive in terms of marketing costs, time and effort from store owners. In other words, the likelihood of the continuous growth of smaller online stores is at a huge risk. The high Shopify valuation is assuming that the number of small online stores will continue growing and I disagree with this assumption.The smaller online stores, defined as stores with three or less full-time employees constitute a significant percentage (in terms of numbers) of the overall e-commerce market and they represent the vast majority of Shopify's client base.Based on the above analysis, I am predicting that the number and the sales volume of smaller online stores will be declining. The primary reason for this decline is that most small online stores do not have the criteria (described in the prior section) needed to succeed in the highly competitive e-commerce business. As the competition among the large e-commerce companies dominating the business intensifies, the small online stores margins will continue declining; they would eventually turn unprofitable and close.Learning from history, this is similar to the smaller stores that closed after Walmart opened their huge stores in the small town.Not all small online stores will be driven out of business. Certain smaller online stores that are highly specialized in a specific niche and have a large comprehensive selection of that particular niche will still remain in business. An example of a smaller company that I use instead of the bigger e-commerce companies is Battery Depot, which provides a more comprehensive selection and a better price point than any of the other larger e-commerce companies.Such clients do not currently represent the vast majority of Shopify clients by numbers. A good strategy for Shopify may be to focus on these small size, well established e-commerce companies and switch them to Shopify; in the last conference call, the management team indicated that their strategy with the Shopify Plus platform is to up-sell to the existing client base rather than getting established companies on to it. Please note that the number of these companies is relatively small, they may already have their own established technical solution and they also face similar competitive pressures from the larger e-commerce companies.As of the time of writing this report, Shopify has not yet identified its churn rate or the number of customers that constitute a ""small online store"". Based on calculations of their revenue, we can assume that at least 65% of Shopify customers may be considered small online stores. Out of a total of 509,000 paying customers this will be 330,000 customers, and to be conservative, let's assume it is 300,000 customers. Anything less than $300,000 would render the revenue model from Shopify's financial statements to be invalid and would indicate that the larger Shopify clients pay much less fees than what Shopify is leading us to believe.We do not know exactly how much revenue is generated from these small online stores, but we can safely assume that it is a minimum of 40% of Shopify's revenue. This portion of Shopify's revenue is more at risk compared to the remaining 60%; this is where most of the merchant turnover is taking place, and the replenishing of the churned merchants will become more difficult as e-commerce further matures.In summary, the research in this article is predicting that this category of Shopify customers (small online stores) is at a serious risk of not being able to successfully operate in the e-commerce world with the increased competition among the larger e-commerce players. When the number of subscribers or even the growth rate of these subscribers starts declining, the skyrocketing valuations of Shopify will be severely tamed down resulting in a massive shock to its stock price.There is no doubt that competition among the larger e-commerce companies will continue and will be even fiercer than it currently is. This will result in a lower price for the products, better personalized interface to the e-commerce websites, faster delivery, and superior service and return policy for the customers.The article has shown that smaller online stores will have a very hard time competing with the larger e-commerce companies. Many of the smaller online stores, primarily those that are depending on drop-shipping as their business model, will end up closing; the income generated would not justify the effort that the owners put in running their business together with the risks they are undertaking.Once the Shopify number of customers starts declining, or even the growth rate of Shopify customers starts dropping, the Shopify stratospheric valuation will be tamed down, and the stock price will be negatively impacted.Until this happens which I expect will start within a year or two, quoting Alan Greenspan, the irrational exuberance with Shopify's valuation may very well continue."
4148865,73185,2018-02-21T12:19:22-05:00,"When all is said and done, a $200 price target on SHOP stock may prove to be far too conservative.Shopify is optimized to succeed in a world of digital retail decentralization.All signs point to the world gradually heading in this direction, and we specifically point investors' attention to startup Darkstore.Overall, we think SHOP stock is still in the early innings of a huge, secular growth story.","We recently put out a note on how Shopify (SHOP) stock could get to $200 and up over the next several years. We feel, however, that this price target undervalues what's arguably Shopify's biggest catalyst: Retail decentralization. This catalyst was recently brought to our attention over the 2018 NBA All Star Weekend, wherein athletic retail giant Nike (NKE) teamed up with Shopify, budding social media platform Snap (SNAP), and decentralized fulfillment center start-up Darkstore to pilot a new way of commerce that, if replicated at scale, will decentralize the retail landscape and allow for small and medium sized e-commerce businesses to compete at scale with larger players. Given that SHOP's customer base is largely small to medium sized e-commerce businesses, we think the Nike All Star Weekend test has broad and bullish implications for SHOP stock in the long term. Here's a deeper look.Shopify provides e-commerce solutions for digital commerce businesses of all sizes, with a concentration on small to medium sized businesses. If you are a start-up e-commerce business, you will probably tap Shopify to help set up commerce ability on your website and across the entire Internet (Shopify provides cross-digital commerce solutions, so you can sell on social platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, as well). Naturally, as digital and social commerce have surged, Shopify's businesses have grown at a robust rate. This digital and social commerce surge will persist, so Shopify's business will continue to grow at a robust rate and SHOP stock will head higher. But we believe that growth could be potentially super charged by a massive retail decentralization trend that's still in its very early innings. At this point, we direct investors' attention to Darkstore, a start-up business which is using decentralization principles to revolutionize the current digital retail fulfillment center model and make it appropriate for today's same-day delivery dominated world. Darkstore essentially allows anyone to ""rent"" out extra space (storage facilities, malls, bodegas, etc) as a quasi-fulfillment center for partner brands. This enables smaller retail companies (and even larger ones) to store inventory in quasi-fulfillment centers across the globe without setting up multi-million dollar, full-fledged fulfillment centers. Darkstore then leverages growing last-mile delivery systems (Uber Rush, Postmates, etc) to fulfill same day delivery. Essentially, Darkstore is the Airbnb or Uber in the fulfillment center world which allows retailers to set up low-cost fulfillment centers anywhere in the world. This concept is revolutionary. Just like e-commerce mitigated the necessity for a physical store front and ride-sharing mitigated the necessity for a physical car, the era of crowd-sourced fulfillment centers that Darkstore is pioneering mitigates the necessity for multi-million dollar fulfillment centers. The implications of this retail decentralization trend are broad. Not only does this allow for more rampant growth in e-commerce by making same-day delivery a global reality, but it also evens the playing field between big and small digital commerce players. The result will be super-charged growth among small to medium sized digital commerce players. We come full circle to Shopify - the company's target demographic is small to medium sized digital commerce players. If retail decentralization trends continue to play out and startups like Darkstore allow small to medium sized digital retailers to cheaply store goods in quasi-fulfillment centers across the world, then both the number of merchants and gross merchandise value on Shopify could hit levels even bulls didn't think was possible. In other words, the Shopify growth narrative could just be getting started. We are bullish on this trend. Nike's pilot of this at the 2018 All Star Weekend (wherein Jumpman All-Star party attendees were able to scan codes on their smartphones to buy exclusive sneakers through the Snapchat app and have them delivered the same night through Darkstore, with the whole commerce process powered by Shopify) is proof that this concept can work and is exceptionally beneficial for consumers. As the world moves to more digital, real-time, and personalized solutions, the digital retail decentralization trend will gain momentum and super-charge growth among small to medium sized digital retailers. All in all, we maintain that SHOP stock is a long-term buy and hold. This company is optimized to succeed in a world of decentralized digital retail."
4148775,101430,2018-02-21T09:03:44-05:00,"Shopify is a growing e-commerce company.Shopify's business model is compelling.Technically, Shopify is very bullish.Risks of investing in Shopify are explored.","During the most recent stock market correction, I used the correction to add to some of my existing positions as well as to establish some new positions. For one of the new positions, I wanted to buy a growth company in the e-commerce space. That company was Shopify (SHOP). This article will outline why investors interested in e-commerce growth stock should consider Shopify.Shopify, with a market cap of just less than $14B, is a Canadian e-commerce company whose market is small and medium-sized businesses. It specializes in making web and mobile software that allows small and medium-sized businesses to have successful multi-channel commerce platforms. Its software allows a company to manage inventory, accept payments, process orders, fulfill payments, manage social media, review data analytics, etc. Shopify entered the small and medium-sized business niche and offered them a product that is robust and is easy to use at a price point that a small business can afford. For example, Shopify's entry level service cost a business $29 per month.Shopify makes money two different ways; through its subscription solutions and through its merchant solutions. Through its subscription solutions, it sells software and applications through monthly, annual, and multi-year terms. The majority of its merchant solutions revenue is value-added fees Shopify collects for processing payments, shipping goods, etc., when merchants use Shopify's software to process and to ship orders. The merchant solutions revenue is closely associated with the metric of gross merchandise volume. The more a merchant sells, the more money Shopify can collect in fees.I do like the business model of focusing on small to medium-sized businesses and then selling them software that performs so many needed aspects of a multi-channel retail strategy. This makes Shopify's software very ""sticky."" Once a business uses the commerce platform, the business provides Shopify with a long-term revenue contract and additional fees that only grow as the underlying business grows.Investors looking for a long-term growth story should consider Shopify. The company went public in May 2015 and has yet to turn profit. However, I like the fact that it focuses on small and medium-sized businesses. I feel that this is an underserved market. As I stated earlier, I like the fact that it sells a product that is sticky to its customers and then generates fee revenue off of the company.The growth story for Shopify revolves around its revenues. See Chart 1 below. While an investor can't expect 70% annual revenue growth to continue forever, there is ample room for growth in the next several years as the economy continues to grow.Chart 1 - Shopify Annual Revenue Growth(Source)Shopify currently gets most of its revenues from the United States. Its international sales are growing as well. Because Shopify targets small and medium-sized businesses, there are countless opportunities to continue to grow revenues by high double digits for years to come. This includes the United States as well as its international markets.I also believe that profits are not too far away. As Chart 2 shows, Shopify has consistently decreased the cost of its revenue. It is getting closer and closer to turning a profit.Chart 2 - Shopify Annual Operating Leverage(Source)Analysts currently expect Shopify to post a profit in 2018 of $0.25 per share and $0.70 per share in 2019.Another one of the characteristics of Shopify that I like is the strength of the balance sheet. Shopify's current ratio is over 10. Yes, 10. Furthermore, Shopify's debt to equity ratio equals .11.From a technical standpoint, there is much to like about Shopify. As Chart 3 shows, Shopify is in a bullish uptrend and is at an all-time high. The 20, 30, and 40-week moving averages are trending higher and in bullish alignment, meaning that the fastest moving average is above the slowest moving average. See this article here for more on the concept of stocks in bullish alignment. Additionally, the price-sensitive True Strength Index just registered a bullish crossover. This index is a double-smoothed momentum oscillator that is unique in that it is known to track price really well; meaning that bullish crossover signals are often good to follow.Chart 3 - Shopify Weekly ChartThere are risks associated with investing in Shopify. While I like the business model, it is built on the most fragile part of the economy; small businesses and entrepreneurs. When the next recession comes, and it will eventually, a big part of Shopify's revenues will be adversely affected in two ways. First, many businesses will go under and take those subscription solution revenues with them. Secondly, in a recession, there will be less merchant solution revenues from fees as consumers buy less goods and services. Another risk is that growth projections will fail to materialize. Chart 1 above does look impressive, but it is unlikely that revenue growth will continue in a hockey stick-like fashion. If revenues fail to deliver as analysts expect, the share price will decline. Next, Shopify is currently not profitable. While I expect it to become profitable this year, any earnings shortfall could send the share price plummeting. Lastly, Shopify continues to sell new shares, diluting current shareholders. While this is common for new companies, there is no guarantee that Shopify's management will be good stewards of the money. While I am currently a believer in the management team, there is room to be suspect of what it will do with the money gained in the latest offering.In conclusion, there are many things I like about Shopify. The business model is one that has an enormous number of potential clients and recurring revenue streams that will grow as their clients' businesses grow. Growth has been impressive and should continue to grow at impressive rates. Positive earnings are expected in 2018. The company has a solid balance sheet. On a technical basis, the stock is favorable. However, there are risks that need to be considered when investing in Shopify. All things considered, though, I believe that investors looking to invest in a growing company in the e-commerce space should consider Shopify at current levels."

Topics include: E-commerce trends, Amazon, Shopify's Culture, and Shopify Plus.E-commerce trends are lining up well and may see an inflection point in the next couple of years. We believe Shopify is a good way to play the ride up.We are long-term shareholders and recommend buying shares below $113/share.","We recommend buying Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) shares below $113/share according to our 10-year DCF model. Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein was talking about Shopify and e-commerce this week at the RBC Disruptor event in Toronto. We were in the audience. This article will discuss a few topics he talked about including e-commerce trends, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Shopify’s culture, and Shopify Plus' birth. We believe Shopify has a lot of things going in its direction that makes us remain long-term shareholders.He is the COO of Shopify, one of the first customers of Shopify and one of the first employees. He started his first business, selling licensed t-shirts, when he was 17, and studying in Montreal, he continued to run the store when he was doing his law degree at the University of Ottawa. This is when he met Tobi, CEO of Shopify, in a coffee shop where entrepreneurs hang out. After getting his law degree, he went to work at a law firm in Toronto but soon found out the culture of law was not right for him. That’s when he decided to call Tobi. He thought he could help commercialize Shopify.Eight years later, Shopify is now a $10 billion company, it is expected to bring in revenue of $665 million this year (SMRE estimates), and has helped merchants on its platform generate sales of $22.6 billion in the last 12 months. It’s come a long way in eight years.Only 13% of Canadian retailers sell online and only 2.5% of Canadian retail sales are on e-commerce. In the US, Shopify’s COO said 15% of US retailers are selling online with only 8.2% of retail sales on e-commerce.He was confused about the low adoption rate in Canada given the geography (huge distance between people) and climate (cold winters). He thinks this is a trend that is ramping up to an inflection point in a year or two.Two Retail TrendsHarley talked about Amazon both as a partner and industry leader. He said the economy of scale of Amazon is impossible to compete with. Amazon is in the business of commoditizing as many products as it can. This means that if you are not providing enough value with whatever you are selling, you will not be in business for very long, and you will probably not even be able to make one sale.The majority of stores on Shopify are not selling commoditized products, he said. These are products you cannot get on Amazon. If you sell toothpaste, you’re going to have a tough time. The products sold by Shopify merchants are cool watches, innovative backpacks, stylish bicycles, premium temporary tattoos, uniquely branded products from celebrities like Drake and 50 Cent, and even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) runs on Shopify. You aren’t going to buy those things from Amazon. Certainly, there are a lot of commodity products we need and Amazon fulfils those perfectly, but when you want something special, you will not go to Amazon.As a partner with Amazon integration, Shopify merchants can set up Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA), and with a couple clicks in their Shopify Dashboard, merchants can push inventory to Amazon to clear out the end of season inventory. It’s a great channel for reaching a wide audience that wants a deal.Former eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) CEO John Donahoe coined a term, “snacking”. This is the time between meetings, in transit, on the toilet, and any other moments where you are filling time. You always have your mobile phone with you, so that is where most turn to spend their “snacking” time.Mobile was being used to view products, but the gap between adding to cart and completing the purchase was “huge”, according to Harley. In 2013, mobile transactions were 13% vs. desktop at 87% on Shopify. The trend is reversing; in 2016, the split was 54% mobile vs. 46% desktop.On September 27, 2016, Shopify launched Shopify Mobile to over 130,000 merchants. This was a shift in direction announced company-wide by CEO Tobi Lutke. It was not a mobile-first mentality; it was “we need to think about mobile” because consumers want to buy on mobile and merchants want to run their businesses on mobile. The platform should be agnostic, and that’s what it has moved towards.Shopify Plus was born out of the needs of its growing merchants. Unlike traditional software where companies upgrade to the next biggest company to get more advanced services as they grow. Shopify merchants were not leaving as they grew bigger.Shopify wanted to make it easier for merchants to grow with more enterprise-level services only big merchants need. Like cross-border legal, dedicated support, flash sale support to name a few. Larger retailers require different levels of service, and if they are staying on Shopify even as they grow, Shopify felt it needed to provide the same quality of service for those at the enterprise level.So while Shopify Plus was built for merchants upgrading, what it is seeing now is that the majority of new Shopify Plus merchants are established businesses switching to Shopify. They want to be more nimble from their proprietary systems. If they want Apple Pay tomorrow, they can’t do that with their proprietary system, they can get that with Shopify Plus. It just makes it easier and is still customizable.Shopify was named the #3 place to work in North America and #1 place to work in Canada. This is a result of a strong culture. According to the COO, culture is often confused with a company’s mission like “leadership”. Culture is also confused with perks like onsite chefs, maid service, gym memberships; these are all small things that make people's lives easier but don’t contribute to the culture. Culture to them is “what people do when no one is watching”.Shopify has a weekly Ask Me Anything (AMA) where employees can submit questions to the executive team and the questions are upvoted (like Reddit) with the top 10 questions answered. This makes everyone feel like they have a voice. They are treated like owners. Shopify is everyone’s baby, it’s part of their identity, it’s their company and Shopify is still in its infancy, so every employee can have an impact. If you go to work for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with 72,000+ employees, your impact is much less.This strong culture not only weeds out those that don't fit but also attracts those that have drive. It's good for building a strong business even as its employee base increases.Shopify has about 3,000 staff and a meaningful % have a side hustle. Having a side hustle is encouraged; it believes it helps employees empathize with merchants.We are long-term shareholders of Shopify. We recommend buying shares below our fair value of $113/share. Shopify’s COO brought to the surface some trends which we believe will be huge contributors to e-commerce growth, and they are still in the early stages. And looking at the long-term strategy of Shopify, it starts with quality employees in a culture that is inviting for innovation. From listening to him speak, Harley is clearly seeing Shopify as a primary piece of his “life’s work”.The COO said he was talking with a very senior investment banker with a top bank on Wall Street. He owns a lemon tree and sells marmalade on his Shopify store.The trend is moving away from requiring capital to make sales. It’s about creativity and influence through social media to reach your target market.Expansion into countries like India requires understanding the way business is done. Not with a credit card but with cash on delivery. Someone knocks on your door, brings you the product and you pay them. This goes back to how the consumer wants to buy, and Shopify is looking for ways to be agnostic to how the consumer wants to shop. It’s countries like these where Shopify Payments doesn’t make sense in its current state.Kylie Cosmetics has done $420 million in revenue in 18 months since launching with Shopify. Celebrities from all categories want to be entrepreneurs; they don’t want intermediates, so they are choosing Shopify.

Here's the first chart from our friends at Statista:But, the real gem here is that even in today's world, the share of commerce that is done online is still tiny, even in the United States.That chart comes to us from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED). You're reading that right - even in the US, we're still at less than 9% of retail sales done online. eMarketer projects that number rising from 8.7% today, to 14.6% in four years.Shopify isn't just an investment in e-commerce - that would never make our Top Picks list - it's an investment in the guts of the online shopping trend - the part that's actually growing.Shopify is the leading cloud-based commerce software for small- and medium-sized businesses. But the company makes money from more than e-commerce sales, it makes money from businesses coming online.Here are some quick facts about the company from the latest earnings call, before we turn to the news over the Holiday season.Nearly 500,000 businesses now rely on Shopify for their sales and back-office software needs. That's up from 375,000 in the third quarter and 243,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Here is the revenue trend:But even that chart doesn't fully encapsulate the growth and adoption. Here is what the company had to say a couple of months ago:We remind everyone of the moat. The biggest threat was once Amazon'sWebStore, a similar platform which was launched in 2010. But WebStore eventually failed, and Amazon shut the service down in 2015 and integrated its marketplace with Shopify's platform.So, yes, Shopify is integrated into Amazon, and Amazon already failed here.After all of that news, bears turned to the lack of profitability but Shopify reported an operating profit of $1.7 million last quarter.But even that is not the needle moving news for 2018. This is where we are focused:First, we start with Cyber Monday, which is the Monday after Thanksgiving. In the quarter last reported, Shopify noted $6.4 billion in GMV - a fancy acronym for the amount (in dollars) that its customers sold.Black Friday through Cyber Monday (BFCM), that is - a long weekend - saw over $1 billion in GMV alone. First, to put that number into perspective to last year we get this from the company (our emphasis is added):BFCM saw worldwide reach, too. Here is a great graphic that shows comparisons of GMV to the average for both Black Friday (BF) and Cyber Monday (CM) across the globe.Note that while the growth is fantastical, that is international sales - it excludes the United States. Shopify notes that since its inception in 1959, Black Friday has been largely regarded as an American holiday. But in the past few years, and due in large part to the ever-increasing popularity of online shopping, the frenzy has started to catch on worldwide.But that's not the needle mover either. With the integration into Instagram, Shopify must turn to mobile, and that is exactly what we found (data from Shopify regarding Black Friday):But there's more data.There is no company like Amazon in the e-commerce world. While the company can't make money selling things online, it can drive volume, and from that we can see the appetite of worldwide consumers for any holiday period.GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives estimated online sales were up 18% overall in November and December. He also noted that he expects Amazon to continue to aggressively expand into key international markets.The National Retail Federation, the industry's trade group, anticipated that holiday retail sales rose 4%, so that e-commerce number coming in at 18% growth is more than 4x the total retail space.It seems like the Internet has been around 'forever,' but the truth is, e-commerce is still, even now, just at the start. And remember, as Amazon expands, so does Shopify.While there is certainly a risk that the FTC slaps Shopify on the wrist if there is any 'hype' surrounding its blog posts or a failure to disclose a paid relationship with the firm now that Citron has lit the world on fire about it and has allegedly send the FTC its own findings , that news is not a short thesis, not from what we can see.We see e-commerce in general still, even now, in the early stages of growth, and we see Shopify's moat growing in the part of the business that actually makes money - the platform.Any conversation about Shopify must include a note on valuation. This is a company with $580 million in revenue over the trailing-twelve-months [TTM], which with its current $11 billion valuation gives it a lofty 19x price to sales.However, we also see a company with 76.5% revenue growth in the TTM and a company that just hit its first operating profit last quarter. It needs to grow to justify this valuation, but for now, it is.We maintain our Spotlight Top Pick status on Shopify - even though we allow for the possibility of an FTC warning. We see Shopify turning a profit this year, expanding through partnerships with eBay and Instagram, and riding the high tide of e-commerce in general.While the United States (or other parts of the world) could certainly see a recession in the future, over the long run, e-commerce is growing, it will not stop growing for a long time, and the platform business is very lucrative in our eyes.Thanks for reading, friends.Please read the legal disclaimers below and as always, remember, CML Pro does not make recommendations or solicitations for the sale or purchase of any security ever.

4147626,73185,2018-02-16T11:51:33-05:00,"SHOP stock reported blowout holiday numbers.
        Big growth is here to stay for a long time considering the company's massive addressable market and huge secular tailwinds.
        Margin drivers will start kicking in soon, and this company could be generating huge profits in 5-10 years.
        We think $200 is a reasonable target for SHOP stock within the next several years, and perhaps sooner.","E-commerce solutions provider Shopify (SHOP) reported blowout fourth quarter numbers which easily topped estimates, and yet SHOP stock struggled for gains. Although a stock failing to pop on good news is usually a sign of a maxed out valuation, we don't think that is the case with SHOP. The stock had rallied huge into the report, so a beat was clearly already priced in. Plus, SHOP stock closed marginally up on the day. Usually, a maxed out stock will drop after good numbers.All in all, we think SHOP is a secular growth stock that is a must-own for the long-term. We realistically see SHOP stock hitting $200 over the next 5 years.The quarter was very good. The headline numbers beat across the board, but more importantly, growth isn't slowing at an alarming rate while margins are starting to ramp up. Throughout the year, SHOP reported revenue growth in excess of 70%. That resiliency on such difficult laps is quite impressive. Moreover, growth of 45% next year is equally impressive considering the tough lap. This big growth will persist. At its core, SHOP is a pure-play on cross-platform digital commerce. Most people think that e-commerce is just one sales channel, but e-commerce actually encompasses multiple sales channels. To name a few, there is the direct channel (through a company's website), the social channel (through a company's social media pages), and the mobile app channel (through a company's mobile app), among many others. These are different points-of-sale with unique back-end requirements, and that can be challenging to tackle for a commerce business of any size. SHOP ties all these points-of-sale together, and makes it easy for commerce businesses to digitally connect with customers on all fronts. Moreover, the company has launched solutions such as Shopify Pay, which further streamlines the digital shopping process through a cross-merchant checkout solution. This era of cross platform digital commerce is still in its infancy, meaning Shopify still has a long ways to go before its at scale. Digital commerce sales in the US have been growing at a steady 15% per year clip. E-commerce sales growth is faster on a global basis because international commerce markets are less digitally penetrated. Moreover, the global social commerce market is expected to grow at a 30%-plus clip over the next several years, while the mobile commerce market is expected to grow right around 30% per year over the next several years. The more retail sales move online, and the more diversified those digital retail sales become to include social and mobile channels, the more Shopify's value prop to merchants grows. Consequently, we think that Shopify will easily tap into a large portion of its 50 million-plus merchant TAM (see TAM analysis here). Shopify has just 609,000 merchants currently. That means Shopify is tapping into 1-2% of its total TAM. That can easily grow to 10-15%, implying big growth is here to stay for a long time. Meanwhile, the margin growth narrative is progressing very well. During the holiday quarter, SHOP recorded operating profit margins of 5%, much better than last year's operating loss margin of 1%. On the call, management expressed confidence that this company could get to operating margins of 20-30% over the next 5-10 years.Overall, its easy to see how this is a secular growth stock with secular growth potential, both on the top and bottom lines. We attempt to quantify that growth in order to come up with a valuation for this stock. To do this, we employ a 10 year model. A 10 year model might seem like a stretch, but such a long model is necessary to value an early-stage, hyper-growth business like SHOP.Given revenue growth is expected to be 45% next year, we think that revenues can grow at a 40% CAGR over the next 5 years, representing a slight slowdown but overall still robust growth given market expansion. We think that growth rate will slow to 20% over the subsequent 5 years, as digital commerce growth starts to slow and find an equilibrium with bricks retail. That puts revenues at $3.6 billion in 2022 and $9 billion in 2027, versus $673 million today. Management has shown an ability to meet or beat guidance, so we believe that, per management's rough guide, operating margins can hit 20% in 5 years and 30% in 10 years. That puts operating profits at $725 million in 2022 and $2.7 billion in 2027, versus $6 million today. After taking out 21% for taxes and dividing by a presumably growing share count thanks to stock comp (110 million by 2022 and constant thereafter), we get to earnings per share of $5.20 by 2022 and $19.41 by 2027. See the recap of our model below. Lets assume these estimates hold, and lets fast forward to 2021. SHOP stock will be looking at a forward earnings estimate of $5.20 per share. The projected long term earnings growth rate will be 30%. The market trades at a PEG of 1.2, implying that a fair forward multiple for a 30% growth stock is 36. A 36x multiple on forward EPS estimates of $5.20 gets you to a $190 stock in 4 years. Its easy to see a hyper-growth operation like SHOP getting a bigger PEG, and if you change the PEG to 1.3, we are all the sudden looking at a $200-plus stock in 4 years. We think that is where SHOP stock will trend over the next 4-5 years, and perhaps sooner if top-line growth continues to overwhelm and margin drivers kick in sooner than expected. Overall, we view SHOP as a pure-play on cross platform digital commerce, which we see as one of the biggest growth markets over the next 5-10 years thanks to increases in mobile and social commerce. We continue to liken this stock to an early-stage Amazon (AMZN) in that the company benefits from dual tailwinds in digital commerce and cloud solutions. The failure to rally after strong holiday numbers isn't a sign of anything more than a stock that needs to catch a breather for a moment. Longer term, there is tons of upside left in SHOP stock."
4131061,102683,2017-12-11T11:01:34-05:00,Shopify's price action is consolidating after a strong run higher.It has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its consumer discretionary peers in recent years.Strong fundamental growth could propel the company even higher in coming years.,"Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) share price is in a strong upward trend as its e-commerce business model looks to be gaining traction. Although its share price is in a near-term consolidation, the long-term trend remains higher. Moreover, Shopify has outperformed the S&P 500, and the consumer cyclical sector over the last few years as its operations have taken off. With continued fundamental success, Shopify should be able to experience further share price gains going forward.Below is a weekly and daily price chart of Shopify. Since the start of 2016, its share price is up nearly 400% on growing revenue. The massive outperformance has come amid its online retail platform gaining traction among consumers.Shopify's ability to merge entrepreneurs with interested shoppers anywhere in the world is an innovative service, not currently found elsewhere online. The company's share price has taken a breather during the second half of 2017, but the long-term trend remains intact based on moving average indicators.With Shopify trading near record levels, there is little overhead resistance should the company breakout higher. Investors can begin to add a position during the current consolidation, or play the breakout higher above the 125 level. Either way, e-commerce is proving to be the wave of the future, and Shopify is uniquely positioned to take advantage of that.Source: Trading ViewThe consumer discretionary sector as a whole has outperformed the S&P 500 in recent years as unemployment has fallen, and wage pressures have begun to move higher. Within the consumer discretionary sector, Shopify has relatively outperformed its peers.The chart below highlights this relative strength, showing the ratio of Shopify to the consumer discretionary sector. From the start of 2016 through summer of 2017, Shopify strongly outperformed its sector peers. Its tilt towards e-commerce aided this ascent, as well as the company's relatively smaller market cap, indicating the company could further expand market share in coming years. Although the relative strength has paused in recent months, the trend higher remains intact.While Shopify has outperformed its sector, it has also outperformed the broader S&P 500 since the start of 2016. As traditional brick and mortar retail companies have seen their share prices diminished to a fraction of their record levels, e-commerce companies have seen a strong inflow.Similarly, general economic optimism and a steadily higher trending S&P 500 are leading investors to take risks in economically sensitive stocks, such as Shopify. The company's relative outperformance signals that it is a strong stock in a strong market, with upward momentum on its side.Strong price momentum has been driven by Shopify's innovative business model, as well as its growing traction among consumers. Over the past month, Shopify had a breakout performance over Black Friday weekend, according to Seeking Alpha. The company reported that more than 500K of its merchants in 175 countries sold over $1B in gross merchandise volume during the extended weekend. $1B over the holiday weekend was a milestone the company had yet to reach, but its ability to surpass the figure in 2017 signals that demand for its platform and the merchants on its platform continues to expand.Moreover, mobile sales continued to outpace desktop for the third consecutive year, accounting for 64% overall, according to management. This signals that Shopify's continued investment in its App platform is paying off and keeps it ahead of the curve as other retailers seek to thrive online, moving away from traditional brick and mortar stores.Shopify has also shown strong results the past few quarters as well, rapidly expanding its operations. In its most recent quarter, the company grew revenue 72% year over year to $171.5 million with both of its revenue lines contributing to this rapid expansion, according to management. Its subscription solutions revenue grew 65% to $82.4 million; the underlying monthly recurring revenue also grew 65% and ended the quarter at $26.8 million. Its ability to tap into and expand its recurring revenue streams should further stabilize cash flows going forward.Its slight acceleration over last quarter in subscriptions is due primarily to another record number of merchants paying to run their business on the Shopify platform, according to the results. Management has this to say about its subscription revenue from Shopify Plus, revenue from merchant solutions:Within merchant solutions, revenue is tied to its individual merchant success as Shopify delivers back office capabilities that save merchants both time and money, allowing them to focus on sales activities. With the growth in this area continuing, it signals Shopify's platform is symbiotic to both the company and the merchant, which should further drive growth in this division going forward.Additionally, overall gross merchandise volume grew to $6.4 billion, up $2.6 billion or 69% from last year's third quarter. Within this, gross payments volumes were $2.4 billion or 37% of GMV versus $2.2 billion or 38% in Q2 of 2017, according to management.The growth of overall gross margin dollars accelerated to 86% year on year to $100 million, driven largely by volume increases as well as improvement in both subscription solutions and merchant solutions margin.Shopify's business model is gaining market share quickly because it offers a strong platform for entrepreneurial business owners, while also offering a diverse selection of products for all consumer demographics. It essentially does what a traditional brick and mortar retailer cannot do with its limited shelf space.In its most recent earnings call, management explained the reasoning behind why its service has its finger on the pulse of retail currently. Consumers are moving toward retailers who offer a personal touch, according to its research, and not simply a one-size-fits-all product. By utilizing a diverse set of merchants, Shopify achieves this initiative.Additionally, Shopify connects its merchants with quality manufacturers without a significant capital investment. Capital investment and inventory management can be one of the biggest threats to an entrepreneur, and with Shopify helping to mitigate this risk, they improve the merchants' chances of success.Finally, new developments in supply chain technology enable small business owners to hold less inventory, and in some cases, no inventory, which again, makes a merchant's finances much easier to manage, focusing more on creativity and product expansion.Additionally, Shopify's reach across most demographics allows it to increase market share. In its most recent earnings call, management discussed how merchants are distributed across ages, with 35-44 and 45+ ranges becoming almost as large as the 25-34 age group, which was previously a majority of its business by a wide margin. Moreover, merchants targeting 65+ are growing as well, according to the call. With a growing demographic of merchants, as well as expansion into other countries, Shopify's global reach should further grow revenue and market cap going forward.Below is a chart of both Shopify's market cap and revenue growth. While its share price has grown at a rapid pace, so too has its revenue. As long as fundamentals continue to lead the stock price higher, it signals a healthy trend higher.Shopify's share price remains in a strong trend higher. Moreover, the company has outpaced both the consumer discretionary sector, as well as the broader S&P 500 higher over the last two years, signaling relative strength. Shopify's unique business model is tapping into the pulse of retail currently, leading to growing traction among consumers and pushing its share price higher. Shopify therefore looks like an attractive buy at current levels."
4147775,103149,2018-02-16T14:14:28-05:00,"Beat and raise again. Our target price goes up from $113/share to $138/share.Merchant additions accelerate to 609,000 total merchants.Focus on International has incredible potential.Merchant Solution revenue breakdown.2018 Forecast estimates. We are forecasting over $1 billion revenue in 2018.","We're recommending owning shares of Shopify (SHOP) for the long-term. Shopify reported 4Q17 and full-year 2017 results on February 15, 2018, before markets opened.The results were mostly well above our forecast.(+) Total revenue of $222.8 million (vs our forecast of $214.2 million)(+) Subscription Solution revenue of $93.9 million (vs $91.1 million)(+) Merchant Solution revenue of $128.9 million (vs $123.1 million)(+) Operating Loss of -$6.1 million (vs -$16.1 million)(+) Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) of $29.9 million (vs $29.7 million)(-) GMV $9.2 billion (vs $9.4 billion)MRR and Subscription RevenueMRR came in at $29.9 million slightly above us at $29.7 million indicating growth is accelerating at a faster pace. This means our forecast of high margin subscription revenue gets adjusted up again. We do not forecast an acceleration of growth faster than what Shopify has executed to in the past as that is not prudent. Further acceleration is considered upside to our model and fair value per share.For 2018 we are looking to close the year at $45.6 million MRR (52.5% growth y/y).609,000 MerchantsMerchant additions since last updated in 2Q have grown by 109,000 or about 22% from 6 months ago. Since the beginning of 2017, the merchant count grew from 377,500 to 609,000 (+231,500 or 61% y/y). That's an incredible pace of growth considering their scale. In 2016 the growth rate was ""only"" 55% y/y.3600 Shopify Plus MerchantsShopify Plus merchants grew by 1100 y/y (+44%). That's pretty good considering these are the merchants that are contributing the most to GMV and now 21% to MRR. Management remains consistent in telling us that over 50% of GMV is from Advance and Plus merchants and that proportion is growing.Improved Take Rate - Increasing Share Of WalletTake Rate is the amount of merchant solution revenue Shopify gets as a percentage of the GMV processed through their platform. This quarter had a 1.40% take rate, the highest we've recorded for Shopify. This is due to improving adoption of Shopify Shipping and Capital. By our calculations, Shopify Capital and Shipping contributed $22.7 million in revenue in 2017 up 304% y/y.Note that Shopify Capital was launched in April of 2016, and according to Management, Shopify Capital is in the early innings, while Shopify Shipping is still ""in batting practice"".Shopify Capital is almost completely automated running on AI and machine learning. This reduces the costs and increases the scalability.We are forecasting take rate to continue to increase gradually over time. For every 0.05% increase in take rate Shopify increases revenue by $13 million (against 2017 GMV). With GMV also growing there is even greater potential for take rate contributing to revenue growth.OPEX forecast to fall off a cliff in the next 10 years.S&M forecast to grow by 5x in the next 10 years, but on a % of revenue to drop from 34% to ~12%. R&D is expected to drop from 20% to 15%, and G&A from 10% to 3%.Our model suggests there is greater than 3000 bps upside to operating margins in the next 10 years. Which corroborates with the comments on the earnings conference call by CFO Russ Jones.Geographic GrowthRest of World leads the way with 107% y/y growth vs company average 73% y/y revenue growth. Rest of world is only 10% of Shopify's revenue but is 21% of Shopify's merchant count, which means there is a huge opportunity for some catch-up.Target countries for growth in 2018 are Germany, France, Japan, and Singapore. With a total population of about 283 million people in the target countries (about 88% of the USA), there is significant potential if executed correctly. Currently, USA revenue is nearly 7x greater than rest of world revenue.Shopify PayShopify transacted an average of 29.9 million orders per month or about 358.8 million orders in 2017. Shopify Pay was used in 5 million transactions so far from 2 million customers. 5 million transactions account for only 1.4% of all orders.It's still early days.I've actually used Shopify Pay buying some things from a couple of different online merchants both using Shopify's platform. It's the experience you expect when you go back to a store you've already purchased from previously, however you immediately get that experience when you go to another Shopify store even for the first time. It's not a big deal, it's just the way it should be.The success of having 61% of purchases from mobile, well above the 1/3 in the rest of the industry, is a tip of the hat to the strides Shopify is taking to make commerce faster, easier, and everywhere.Revenues outpacing employee growth - Machine Learning, AI, Automation kicking inEmployees numbers grew from 1900 to 3000 in 2017 (+58% y/y). Revenue grew 73% y/y. The operating expenses grew by 74% though, so we aren't seeing the operating leverage yet. If the pace of revenue growth continues to outpace employee growth, higher margins could follow.As mentioned Shopify Capital is almost completely automated now. Shopify Plus is focused on solving merchant problems with software rather than with people where it can. Shopify continuously looks to create efficiency after a product/service is proven.Merchant Solutions BreakdownShopify Payments made up 75% of Merchant Solutions Revenue in 2017 (down from 81% in 2016, and 79% in 2015).Transaction fees made up 10% in 2017 (10% in 2016, 12.5% in 2015)Referral fees made up 6.5% in 2017 (4% in 2016 and 2015)Higher margin Shopify Shipping and Capital revenues made up 6% in 2017 (up from 3% in 2016). This is where we want the breakdown to start shifting towards.Introduction of 2027 forecast sends our fair value to $138/shareThe reality of our discounted cash flow model is that the terminal value after 10 years is based on a relatively small growth rate of 3% into perpetuity. The result is that when we roll over the model from one year to the next and add a new 10th year to the end of our 10-year forecast period a large cash flow is added to our fair value and our new terminal value is based on this new 10th year.Here's why there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this method of valuation.If Shopify were to underperform and show signs of a weaker future during 2017, then the new 10th year of the forecast would be a negative contributor to the model depressing our fair value. However, since Shopify was able to perform well and above our expectations in 2017 there is no reason to doubt its future.On the back of a strong execution well ahead of our original forecast in 2017, our fair value for Shopify increases to $138/share from $113/share.An additional note on our fair value. It is based on what we would consider conservative expectations of maintaining the acceleration of growth for the next 4 years (no faster or slower), and subsequently maintaining the dollar value of revenue growth to the end of our forecast period. This means there is upside to our model should Shopify catch any trends that give it a boost like ""Early Majority/Late Majority"" technology adoption cycles.Our 2018 ForecastRevenue of $1.06 billion (vs guidance of $970 to $990 million)GAAP Operating Loss of $55.5 million (vs guidance of -$95 to -$105 million)Adjusted Net Income of $22.5 million (vs guidance of -$5 to +$5 million)MRR of $45.6 million (vs 2017 $29.9 million, +52.5% y/y)GMV of $40.5 billion (vs 2017 $26.3 billion, +54% y/y)We are not concerned that guidance is below our forecast, as Shopify has historically raised full-year guidance throughout the year. 2017 and 2016 full-year results were 14% and 20%, respectively, above the mid-range of first guidance.We recommend owning Shopify shares for the long-term, below our fair value price of US$138/share. Curiously (not on purpose) Shopify shares are trading around US$138/share which means there is an opportunity to buy shares around our fair value.Check out our previous article on called Shopify + Cannabis = Upside.

There are no signs that growth opportunities are lacking.","Shopify (SHOP) stock has had an amazing run with returns of over 440% from the lows of February 2016 to the highs of September 2017. This has left many investors worried that they missed out on a great opportunity.Is it still safe to buy with the price so high and an astronomical P/E ratio? This is a tough question because the company is investing heavily in growth, managing cash flow so its earnings are close $0. We can only analyze the true value of the business by separating current earnings from the part that's reinvested in growth. Then we can estimate the return on that investment.In this article I'll break down the two major components of growth investment, R&D and marketing, and calculate the net earnings behind those investments. These show that the future value of Shopify's shares based on these earnings and the potential growth may be a lot higher than today's share price.Starting from the last quarterly report, Shopify's gross profits for the trailing 12 months are $327m, up from $178m in the previous 12 months for 84% year over year growth. The net loss for the trailing 12 months is $46m.Using the management guidance from the latest earnings release, we can see the following results:(Note: All numbers in thousands; all figures from Shopify's earnings releases; 2017 is estimate based on three quarters of results plus the guidance for the last quarter.)The Adjusted Gross Profit is what I get once I remove the cost of investing in future growth. I'll break down how I arrived at that.The reporting of R&D expenses is all lumped together so it's hard to separate the necessary maintenance of current technology from the development of new offerings. However, a common guideline with software development is that you can take 20% of the initial development budget as an ongoing maintenance expense.The R&D expenses are on track for $136m in 2017. Note that the expenses are largely incurred in CAD, which increased the reported amount this year due to the exchange rate surging as much as 17%. The actual increase in 2017 was not as large as it looked. I don't account for this in my analysis.Adding up the R&D costs for the last 4 years gives us a total investment of around $145m from 2013-16. If Shopify is spending 20% of that amount in annual maintenance that would be $29m of their R&D costs, so the other $107m spent this year would be for new investment.However, their ongoing maintenance costs may be higher than that. Rapid growth could create scaling issues that take additional engineering time to resolve. If we estimate maintenance at 30% instead then the annual maintenance is $43m and the new investment this year is $93m.When we back out the new investment in R&D, the business would turn to a net profit of $47m-$61m for the trailing 12 months.Unlike Blue Apron's (NYSE:APRN) problems, Shopify does not need to invest heavily in marketing to its current merchants to keep earning their business. Why? Because they are making money every month and using Shopify to manage that. You don't forget about something that's making you money!There may be some small degree of activation marketing to help customers who haven't gotten their business running, and add-on marketing to help current customers use new offerings (and increase Shopify's revenue). I'll assume those are minor parts of the marketing budget. That means most of the sales and marketing cost is going towards acquiring new customers.The sales and marketing expense for the last 12 months is $198m. During the same time the gross profit increased by $149m. Part of that increase is due to new customer acquisition and part is due to the growth in revenue from existing customers. Shopify has net negative churn, which means that the average annual revenue per customer keeps going up the longer that customer sticks around.They don't disclose the exact amount of growth in revenue from existing customers but it may be in the 5-10% per year range based on the charts they show in their reports.To be conservative on the marketing side, let's assume that the $198m they spent only increased gross profit by $99m/year. That means that the amount they invest in marketing returns 50% per year. This still leaves the business with great economics.On the more realistic side, their gross profit from new customers may be as high as $131m, which would be a return on their marketing budget of 66% per year. On top of this the new customers have not even been through a full year. That means those customers will automatically generate more profits over the next 12 months as they account for a full year of revenue. I'm not including that in my analysis at all.If we back out marketing spending while leaving in R&D spending, the net profit for the last 12 months would be $152m.When we subtract these expenses, we get the following estimates:(Note the difference from the table at the top, which shows the estimates for the full year of 2017, while this shows the actual results for the last 4 quarters as of Q3 2017.)The current share price would be equivalent to a P/E ratio of 166-216 with R&D backed out, 67 with marketing backed out, and 48-51 with both of them backed out.In estimating future profitability, it's also possible that the administrative costs as a percentage of sales will decline. I'm not accounting for that here but it could increase these estimated earnings by 3-10% (or $6-$15m per year at current levels).To understand the earnings from current operations we have to remove a large part of the marketing and R&D costs. We don't know the precise amount but we can estimate that the current P/E with all future investment removed would conservatively be around 67.This would also give Shopify an ROE of 15%-20%, all of which is being re-invested for compounding growth. That's another positive sign that the business value will grow to catch up to the share price. The ROE may be depressed at this moment because of the large inflows of capital -- the book value has increased by 2.5x in a year. Back that out and the true ROE could be as high as 30-50%. Once again this is all being reinvested to grow the earnings.Very few businesses can consistently hit that kind of benchmark. If Shopify does they will create a lot of shareholder value.At this point Shopify's growth is self-funding. Most of this investment is paid for from ongoing earnings, without needing to resort to debt, stock issues, or their cash reserves. The core earnings of around $150-$200m can easily pay for the current marketing. And this results in steady growth.The gross profit from current customers is growing at around 5%-10% per year and the increase in annualized gross profit from new customers is 50%-66% of the amount spent on marketing. If all the core earnings are reinvested in marketing, we should expect steady growth of 43%-77% per year in gross profits.Some amount of R&D is also necessary to support this growth. The balance sheet gives Shopify enough cash to pay for this out of liquid assets for the near term.Let's imagine that this continues for the next five years. At that point the cash would be starting to run low. However, the gross profits would have increased by 6x-17x from the current point, to a range of $1.96b-$5.68b. At that point the earnings could fund a huge increase in ongoing R&D with a slight slowdown in marketing (which would be fitting if it's hard to find good opportunities to spend $6b/year on marketing).If we divide the current stock price by estimated earnings we get a 5-year forward P/E ratio of 1.8x-5.2x. That is the ratio of today's price to potential earnings after holding the stock for 5 years.The company has $1b in current assets with only $113m in offsetting liabilities. This is easily enough to pay for their current expenses for a few years with no revenue at all. If there are major investment opportunities that come up they do have the cash available to finance them. Their financial position is very strong and well-supported.Shopify does use some share-based compensation. The amount is around $45m per year. This is around 0.4% of the current market cap so it doesn't result in much dilution.The high share price gives them a bonus in compensating employees. But with a lower share price they could still compensate their employees fairly. Shopify is not caught in the same trap as Tesla (TSLA) where a lower share price would take away their growth and survival options.With these results we can estimate Shopify's long-term value. At a current P/E of 67x (after backing out growth investment) it's obviously an expensive stock.But each year of stellar growth will cut down that ratio for current shareholders. If you buy shares at a P/E of 67 and the company grows core earnings by 65% after a year, your P/E (based on purchase price) is down to 41. After another year of similar growth it declines to 25. Their growth will quickly buy them a better P/E ratio.We need to account for opportunity cost. Achieving a P/E of 20 after 5 years of growth is not the same as buying a P/E of 20 today. By some estimates, the stock market as a whole can grow at a 4% real rate or around a 6% nominal rate based on the current high valuations. In the past we have seen growth of closer to 10% nominal. Any more than that would not be sustainable.We have to discount the growth by 6%-10% to account for the cost of waiting. We also have to remove the dilution from share-based compensation. We'll assume this is steady at 0.4% per year.So after 5 years the total cost of holding Shopify shares would be 36%-64%. This reduces the estimated 5-year forward P/E ratio to a range of 2.4-8.5x. If we pick the midpoint that's 5.5x.What are the chances that 5 years from now you'll be able to buy high-quality stocks at a P/E ratio of under 6x? I'd say they're pretty small. But buying Shopify today could be equivalent to that.And at that time Shopify will likely be either still growing faster than the market or holding steady with strong earnings. That could give it an actual P/E ratio of 15x-40x in 5 years. This would represent a gain of 76%-1,666% based on the current stock price.At the high end the market cap would be over $169B. That's too aggressive to be part of my baseline expectations but it's not inconceivable for this type of business.Of course all of this depends on the growth holding up. There are several key threats to watch out for:If any of these develop into major issues it may cut back the growth rate.However there are some positives that I don't account for aside from their potential to continue the underlying growth pattern:Any of these could sustain or increase the growth rate.Fortunately, Shopify has released data going back to 2012 so we can verify this model.At a high level, the results are fully in line with the growth I outlined here. From 2013 to 2016 the company invested approximately $374m in R&D and marketing to grow the business (according to the ratios modeled here). As a result the gross profit went from $18.9m in 2012 to $379m in 2017, or a 20x increase in 5 years.In each year, the gain in gross profit ranged from 55 - 76% of the amount spent on marketing. And it's only counting the actual revenue in that calendar year from the new customers so the actual growth is higher than that. This confirms my assumption of the marketing investment returning 50% per year.The actual gross profit has grown at 68 - 94% per year while the adjusted gross profit using my ratios has grown at 48 - 90% per year. The estimated growth in 2017 is 81% for both figures, in the upper end of those ranges. It has not been declining significantly. With outliers removed the current growth rate is within a few points of the highest historical growth rate.If the business grows the gross profit by another 20x over the next 5 years it would be at $7.6b for 2022. At that scale it's likely that many other expenses would fall as a percentage of revenue, leaving a larger part of that amount as net profit. With a current market cap of $10.2b USD the stock price today looks good.Any sensible investor will avoid a stock that's increased its price by over 5x in 18 months and trades at a multiple of hundreds of times adjusted earnings.With Shopify it's reasonable to take a different view. The core earnings, after removing investment for growth, give a multiple around 67x.This high multiple can be fully justified by an equally high growth rate in earnings. The company is well-protected and has less risk than many other growth stocks. The current market cap is a small fraction of the levels it could reach over the next decade.There is always risk in a situation like this. If the growth fails to materialize then the stock will fall quickly. Shopify will have to keep up its current growth rates as it earns and invests more.The best indication that this could happen is that the net earnings are around $0. This is obviously an intentional result. If the executives are managing earnings to get to breakeven, that means they are forgoing other potential investments with good returns. When the business earns more, quarter after quarter, they will allocate more to their growth budget and pursue those additional opportunities.If the growth comes through then Shopify's stock is like an opportunity to buy shares at a P/E of 5.5, on the condition that you pay today and you only receive the shares in 5 years. Even when considering the risks that's an attractive opportunity.The question is: Will you take it?"
4146275,103149,2018-02-13T16:14:22-05:00,The Ontario government chooses Shopify's e-commerce platform as the exclusive distributor of cannabis sales online and in stores.This could instantly add $2 billion to GMV in year one.This introduces concentration risk in the short-term only. We see this as an opportunity.,"We recommend owning Shopify (SHOP) for the long-term. With every quarter, the growth rates continue to accelerate (on a second derivative basis), and Shopify continues to benefit from the spotlight. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook praised Shopify’s AR development (if you haven’t seen what’s happening with Augmented Reality [AR] check out what Shopify is up to) and Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (OCRC) chose Shopify to be the back end of its online and physical retail stores.Shopify will benefit from the instant demand for legal marijuana sales in Ontario, where over a third of the population of Canada lives. The CBC reports potential first-year demand:This is 5% of our forecasted $40 billion GMV for Shopify in 2018.The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (OCRC) will fall into the Shopify Plus bucket meaning $2,000 a month of subscription fees, plus up to $38,000 a month upper limit on merchant solutions. Marijuana sales will likely eclipse the $320 million GMV required to get to the Shopify Plus total monthly limit of $40,000 ($480,000 a year).Shopify will likely be a full-service solution which may include apps from the Shopify App store and Shopify Shipping. This could boost margins.While alcohol’s online sales have not caught the trend, we believe marijuana will be different given the weight of the product is substantially less, making shipping a less costly addition for consumers.For example on the LCBO website (Liquor Control Board of Ontario), minimum orders of $50 still have shipping costs of $11.95 to $16.95. Considering the weight and size difference of marijuana, we would expect a much lower barrier to entry for online sales.Source: LCBOEven if all sales are in-store, Shopify will be the POS system. Merchants on Shopify Plus still pay the interchange fees from Visa/MasterCard/AMEX through Shopify Payments. So Shopify should still benefit. We estimate average interchange of 2.68%. The split of gross profit between Stripe and Shopify varies based on volume but we believe Shopify captures about 0.325% on a Shopify Payments transaction.Shopify is going to directly benefit from the instant demand for legal marijuana in Ontario, capturing a small percentage of the entire market. From a Shopify Plus perspective, the OCRC should be a $480,000 contributor to high margin revenue, plus potentially another $50 million in lower margin Shopify Payments revenue (~$6 million gross profit). At about 5% of our 2018 revenue forecast of $1.04 billion, from an overall company perspective, the OCRC will become a significant merchant to Shopify.Some might view this as a concentration risk, but we rather look at it as a near-term opportunity for accelerated growth and a long-term core merchant in a ""staple"" industry. Given Shopify's history of growing nearly 100% on average for the past 4+ years, we expect in the long-term, new merchant additions and existing merchant growth will outpace the growth of the OCRC, bringing the concentration risk below 5%. We recommend owning Shopify stock for the long-term.UpcomingShopify reports full-year 2017 results on February 15, 2018, before the market opens with a conference call at 8:30 AM EST.

4120159,98236,2017-11-03T13:59:00-04:00,"Shopify announced the results of its Q3 earlier this week.The results were a beat and raise quarter - the shares fell by more than 10%.Guidance, as has been the case indefinitely, appears to be conservative and designed to be beater.Almost all of the key operating metrics that are tracked by investors/analysts were positive and the company actually reported non-GAAP profits sooner than had been anticipated.Company executives vigorously and credibly rebutted the ill-intentioned and ill-informed ""research"" from Citron that has plagued the shares - although not the company since it appeared.","Shopify (SHOP) reported the results of its Q3 earlier this week. For most companies, the results posted would have been considered a blow out. After all, revenues grew by 72% and were 3.6% above the consensus. And non-GAAP EPS turned positive, significantly sooner than had been anticipated. Even a key GAAP metric was strong with GAAP gross profits rising by 86%. The company’s GAAP operating expenses, up by 78% year on year, were still rising more rapidly than revenue and contributed to a GAAP operating loss of 7% of revenues compared to a GAAP operating loss of 10.2% of revenues in the same quarter, the prior year.The company’s improved gross margins are both a function of scale but also a function of a gradual mix shift to higher margin services such as Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital. The opportunity for Capital is clearly enormous as can be seen from the growth that Square (SQ) has had with its offering. It is not really a function of long-term growth estimates because no one today has any idea of how large the opportunity might be.Shopify reports its revenues in two segments, subscriptions and merchant services. Subscription revenue growth at 65% actually reaccelerated, albeit by a minor amount. The fact is that at this point, Shopify has such a powerful brand name within the e-commerce community that it will continue to expand its share of first time e-commerce users. But the real cause for the receleration in growth was the huge jump in revenues coming from Shopify Plus. That phenomenon will be discussed later in this article.Shopify Merchant solutions, ultimately the company’s other key long-term growth driver, rose by 78% last quarter primarily because of the increase in gross merchandise value which was up 69%. The major difference between the two growth rates relates to Shopify entering markets where its payments platform is not yet available. Shopify still receives a significant fee even in those cases where it does not actually process payments.The company continues to show operating cash flow losses on a headline basis. These headlines showed a cash burn of $6.2 million last quarter and about $11 million for the year to date. That is entirely a function of the company’s loan program with merchant cash advance receivables rising to $50 million last quarter, up from $33 million in Q2 and compared to $10 million last year.Excluding the amount of these cash advances, the company’s cash generation this past quarter was about $13 million. In the prior year, when merchant cash advances were not significant, SHOP’s reported CFFO for the quarter was about $1 million. On a year to date basis, and excluding merchant cash advances, CFFO has risen from $16 million to $30 million. That increase has occurred despite the rise in receivable balances that reflects the growth of sales. Much of the increase in cash flow generation was a function of rising stock based compensation which has more than doubled over the period. Hiring developers these days means paying out stock-based awards as part of a recruiting package, and given this company's plans, stock based comp will continue to increase rapidly. An additional component of the increase reflects the rapid growth of depreciation which jumped by more than 60% and a small component of the cash flow increase was attributed to the larger increase in deferred revenues.While CFFO and free cash flow, regardless of their definition, is far too small at this point to support the company's current market cap of nearly $10 billion, the rapid increase is certainly a very positive harbinger of the company’s longer-term business model potential. During the course of the conference call, the company implied that as a result of the impending holiday season, merchant cash advances would likely be significantly higher in this current quarter. I assume that at some point, SHOP, like Square, will arrange for third-party capital sources to fund its merchant cash advances. There is, apparently, a strong appetite on the part of institutional investors for participating in this market with a loan originator that enjoys the advantages of Shopify.The company provided guidance that was thought by some to be less than stellar although this company has been providing conservative guidance since I first became aware of this business. The company does not supply churn statistics which apparently is a bone of contention on the part of some observers. It would be surprising, given that SHOP sells mainly to SMBs that are start-ups, if the company did not have significant churn. Given just how low the barriers to entry are in the e-commerce field, and the ease of canceling a SHOP subscription, churn at some significant level is likely to remain significant. That said, the company now has subscriptions from more than 500k businesses. That metric almost doubled in little more than a year.The company’s CEO addressed the issues raised by the so-called research that was launched against its stock by Citron. As a SHOP user, I can’t imagine that many serious people put much stock in some of the wilder allegations advanced by Citron and its founder/author, Andrew Left. And yet the shares have gone down by more than 12% since the earnings were released and the chart might be considered to be sickly looking by some analysts who focus on that kind of thing. The question of what is next for the stock is vexing. The question as to what is next for this company is surely less so.One of the things that can’t be stressed often enough when considering Shopify is that it has essentially established a category by itself and really has little in the way of direct competitors. I have recently written about Wix (WIX), which might be considered a competitor at some level. But for those users who want to establish a retail business online these days, SHOP almost is certainly the solution of choice. One of the things about the so-called Citron research is that it has been done without the slightest knowledge of or evaluation of who actually subscribes to SHOP and why they do so. How might I write so confidently about that. Well I am, in another life, a SHOP merchant and conducted a reasonably thorough evaluation before acquiring the software with knowledgeable web designers assisting me in my endeavor. And no, they got no commission from SHOP for their recommendation. Most of what has been written by Citron on this subject is not just wrong - but exactly wrong.Because of this company’s positioning, which by this time is well understood by most investors, every quarter that the company reports is expected to be a blowout. And so far as it goes, investors are accustomed to large beats and expect to see so-called consensus expectations march upward every quarter as well.The company did raise guidance but perhaps there were some observers who thought the increase in guidance should have been be greater. Overall, the company had been anticipating $645 million of revenues. The company beat its revenue guidance by $6 million for the reported quarter and raised its revenue guidance by $12 million for the full year. Consensus revenue expectations had been $203.7 million for this current quarter and the company has now forecast revenue for the quarter, at the mid-point of its guidance range, to be $207 million. So, it did raise Q4 guidance by about 2% compared to the prior consensus which seems quite conservative given the strength of the global economy, some modest amount of currency tailwind and strong e-commerce sales trends.Still, the new guidance would indicate about a 21% increase in sequential revenues, partially reflecting normal seasonality for retail sales. This compares to 13% growth in sequential revenues from Q2 to Q3, which inevitably reflected some retail sales seasonality. Summer quarters typically show negative growth for retail sales. Sequential revenue growth in Q4 2016 was more than 30%, although the company was far smaller at that point. Overall, the company is now forecasting that it will achieve revenue growth of about 52% in Q4 which would be a noticeable deceleration from the 72% revenue growth reported this past quarter. The company recorded relatively strong earnings performance in the quarter, mainly due to the mix of revenues within merchant services. While merchant services has substantially lower gross margins at this point compared to subscription services, the gross margins for merchant services jumped sharply.In any event, the company reported non-GAAP EPS of $.05 and this compared to prior guidance of a loss of about $.02 and prior consensus expectations for a non-GAAP loss of $.01. The company is now forecasting a non-GAAP profit of $ about $.03 at the mid-point of its forecast, including an expectation of $16.5 million of stock based comp. in the quarter. Stock based comp. was $13.3 million last quarter.Again, I would be quite surprised if EPS wasn’t noticeably higher than the company’s forecast simply based on the continuation of the mix trends in Q3 coupled with some continued moderation in the percentage growth of operating expenses which grew by 10% sequentially, last quarter, compared to 13% revenue growth. As mentioned, gross margins on merchant solutions rose from 28% to 37% year on year last quarter, and should be higher still in Q4 based both on volume and a higher percentage of revenues that are coming from software services.I think it is fair to say that the quarter was reasonably positive, although not perhaps more than that, based on what investors have been led to believe about the prospects for this company. I think the guidance provided was more than a bit of a sandbag, meant to be exceeded on both the topline and the earnings line.No, I do not propose to build a detailed model. After 20 years-plus and thousands of detailed models, I have hung up the model building keys on my PC and have tried to forget about how to build excel spread sheets. What I can say is that I doubt that 40% growth, which is currently the published consensus on First Call for this company for 2018, could possibly support the current valuation, let alone propel the shares so that they might produce positive alpha. And I would be even more emphatic that investors are going to want to see a bit steeper ramp in terms of profitability and cash flow than is currently embedded in consensus numbers which call for EPS of just $.21.I also would say that trying to put together a forecast for this company even one quarter at a time is likely to be a frustrating exercise. No one can write about the real size of a market that is just now being created and expect to be believed. Perhaps the leaders of SHOP thought there was a market for 500k web stores a dozen years ago. Probably not.Does anyone have a real idea based on some credible divination as to just how many people want to run web stores? I confess that I certainly do not have that kind of second sight. I imagine it is reasonable to believe that the cadence of growth for Shopify’s subscription revenue will fall at some noticeable level simply as a function of the law of large numbers. How fast that might be is not something I can guess at, especially when there was a slight growth acceleration last quarter. My guess, and it is just that a guess, is that subscription solutions will reach $310 million in revenues this year and then see growth of 45% in 2018 which will yield revenues of $450 million. Some of the growth in subscription services is a function in the growth of Shopify Plus, where monthly pricing starts at around $2000/month and can be several times that amount (up to $40,000 month, actually) compared to $30 for base Shopify. So, it is no longer strictly a function of increasing the number of users at an accelerating rate in order to forecast dramatic growth for subscription service revenues. (I have linked here to a current review of Shopify Plus for those interested in understanding the business dynamics and the optimized customer for the service.) Shopify Plus revenue is rising very rapidly at this point and it is now 20% of monthly recurring revenue compared to 18% of that metric last quarter. That is a sequential growth rate of almost 25%. Merchant solution revenues are likely a bit more visible, at least for the company. Last quarter, merchant solution revenues grew by 11% sequentially, which does reflect some seasonality. Gross merchandise value processed on the platform grew by 10% sequentially.I think that sequential growth in merchant solutions revenue will show a very strong seasonal pattern that overlays organic growth. I think that it is reasonable to believe that merchant solutions revenue can grow by 25% in Q4 on a sequential basis, particularly as the company enjoys a substantial increase in its sales of additional back-office services within its installed base. Again, at this point, we have no idea specifically about the growth cadence for revenues, as opposed to cash advances, generated by SHOP Capital.In addition, the company has a new pricing model for Shopify Plus that will likely be a noticeable tailwind in terms of growth and which kicked in during August. That would bring full-year merchant services revenue for the year to about $350 million and take full year revenue to $660 million, modestly higher (1.5%) than current guidance.My guess on the growth of merchant services revenue in 2018 would be about 60% to $565 million. Merchant services revenue is both a function of the success of larger sellers using the platform and the ability the company has to attract new users. That would take full-year revenue to $1015 billion, or growth of 54%. The growth of merchant services revenue is going to be a significant function of the growth of the larger sellers on the Shopify Plus platform, the company’s premium service. Last quarter, Shopify Plus was launched by a record number of users including some better-known names (at least to some) including the Phoenix Suns, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Rebecca Minkoff as well as Blue Diamond Growers, Beer Nuts, Igloo and Yeti. There comes a tipping point, I think, at which point all but the largest users make the decision to use some kind of a hosted service for their e-commerce sales. That is really the heart of the bet one is making in terms of forecasting rapid growth above the consensus. I doubt very seriously if anyone is really particularly invested in expectations of a growth number consistent with the 40% First Call consensus for next year for next year. At the time of this writing, a couple of days after the earnings release, First Call indicated that it has only one estimate for both the current quarter and for 2018 although the company is followed by more than 20 analysts.The company continues to hire at an exceedingly rapid pace and announced that it plans to triple its headquarters staff in Waterloo, Ontario, in the next couple of years and has opened a second building to double the company’s physical footprint. The announced hiring plans for Waterloo alone would most likely raise the company’s opex by more than 20% in just a couple of years. While management continues to articulate a growth focus, as opposed to a focus on improving operating margins, there are many potential margin drivers including pricing, volume, ancillary services such as capital and shipping and the opportunity the company has developed with Plus to sell an e-commerce platform to large users.I think that most analysts - and that includes those with hold ratings on the shares - are actually looking for something closer to 50% growth, possibly a bit more. My estimate of 54% is perhaps on what is likely the high side of consensus growth expectations, but not by all that much.I would be very surprised if this company were not able to show some significant improvements in core profitability metrics while growing revenues by $350 million year on year. As it happens, operating expenses have already seen decelerating growth. Last quarter, opex rose by 78% year on year. That percentage growth is consistent with the growth so far this year. But sequentially, the growth in opex dropped to just 9.8%, perhaps the smallest sequential increase in opex since SHOP has been a public company. The guidance for Q4 suggests that management believes that this metric might reaccelerate, and, as mentioned earlier, management spoke during the call about its desire to focus more on growth than operating profit. My guess, however, is that the company will simply not be able to hire the kind of staff it wants, at the rate it wants and particularly in some of the smaller cities such as Waterloo that it calls home within the last 50 days of this year. I would be surprised not to see at the least a seasonal spike in operating margins in this current quarter coupled with secular improvements in margins in 2018.So far this year, non-GAAP gross margins have been about 58% which is up 300 basis points year over year. Non-GAAP gross margins rose by 200 basis points sequentially. And given some normal Q4 seasonality, I imagine that trend will continue into Q4. As mentioned, the growth in opex was less than 10% sequentially last quarter. But even operating expense growth were to reaccelerate to 15% sequentially, that would still leave operating expenses at $128 million or 61% of revenue compared to 65% of revenues in Q3. With 60% non-GAAP gross margins, and about $112 of non-GAAP operating expense, Q4 operating margins would be about 6.5% and the company would have a $4 million operating loss on a GAAP basis. I think those numbers would be positively received by investors - although I suspect Q1 guidance will be a bit of an issue, based on a cryptic comment by the CFO during the conference call.I think that 2018 is likely to see some continuation in gross margin improvement although at a lesser magnitude than has been the case this year. Overall, I think that GAAP gross margins could reach 60%. How fast might opex grow? On a conservative basis, I think growth could possibly reach 51% which would bring GAAP operating expense to $650 million. Stock based comp will probably be about $80 million next year. That would yield non-GAAP operating margins of $45 million and EPS of around $.35-$.40.Is that kind of topline growth and earnings improvement enough to support a buy recommendation? The following section takes a look at some valuation metrics and tries to answer that question.Shopify shares have not been cheap for a long time now and they will not appeal to any but momentum growth investors. If deep value or GARP investing is your preferred style, you shouldn’t be reading this article except for comic relief - and 3,000 words or so in, you need to have a very black sense of humor to make that work. SHOP is a momentum growth story for investors or its shares are not worth considering. At this writing, SHOP has a market capitalization of just shy of $10 billion. It has a cash balance of a bit more than $900 million, in part a function of the recent secondary offering. That yields an enterprise value of a bit over $9 billion. Based on my forecast for just over $1 billion in revenues next year, that is an EV/S of 9X. Yes, that is high, but not outlandish high. With growth of over 50%, I think that this valuation lies on a plotted line relating growth percentage to EV/S ratio and is no longer far above such a plot as may have been the case in the past. The EV/S ratio, while not a screaming buy indicator, is no longer outside the bounds of what most momentum growth investors find acceptable.I have constructed my own set of expectations regarding earnings. But clearly the P/E is simply not reasonable as a valuation metric at this point. And given the company’s emphasis on growth, earnings seem unlikely to reach levels at which they will be a significant factor in supporting a buy case. Currently, the company’s use of stock based comp. is not outlandish, but it is rising substantially and given the hiring of developers, I imagine it will continue to rise at rates greater than revenue in the years to come.I mentioned earlier in this article that CFFO, as I choose to define it (not the standard GAAP definition) is positive and rising. My projection of what I consider to be CFFO is for that metric to reach as much as $50 million this year, dependent on the specific trajectory of balance sheet items, particularly receivables. I expect CFFO to increase at some level mainly consistent with revenues in future periods. But regardless of the specifics, the company is unlikely to achieve free cash flow of as much as $100 million. Investors will not be able to value SHOP shares on a free cash flow yield for years to come.How much does that all matter? I would suggest at this point, with EV/S no longer at outlandish levels, much of the trajectory of these shares is going to be based on sentiment. I think sentiment is relatively balanced at this point, in the wake of the scurrilous slander that was disseminated by Citron Research. I doubt that most of the institutional holders, who own 62% of the outstanding shares according to Yahoo Finance, and probably own more than that percentage in the wake of the secondary offering in May, put much credence in those baseless allegations. Analysts spent lots of time on the call asking about the specifics of the allegations in detail and receiving, as expected, specific rebuttals.I presently do not own the shares - I sold them at prices less than here. But to be fair that was a few months ago. I'm searching for the right entry point, which is usually more visible in arrears that prospect. I sometimes miss names by limiting my portfolio to 11 names. That shouldn’t matter much to readers.Putting that aside, I think the shares can be attractive because there really is nothing quite like SHOP available to investors. There may be a speed bump when the company discusses guidance during its February call and probably winds up guiding Q1 to a set of conservative expectations based on retail sales seasonality. But for investors with a long-term horizon, wanting to own shares in what is clearly the best in class company in this space, SHOP is as good as it gets."
4121372,103005,2017-11-06T17:52:17-05:00,Worries of the Citron report may be overblown.Shopify's top line growth is extremely impressive.High margin revenues streams continue to grow.,"In spite of the risks and constant negative press, Shopify (SHOP) has growth that just can't be ignored. The valuation may detract some investors, but the company offers a platform that caters to the ever popular ""entrepreneurial lifestyle"". Shopify gives a more independent feel to those who want to grow their e-commerce business. Technology and the thirst for independence have led to the pursuit of entrepreneurship being more popular than ever. Shopify can continue to benefit from this economic trend.Shopify has been a name often seen in the headlines recently, with short seller Andrew Left (Citron Research) publicly stating his distrust of the business model. He threw out accusations of the company operating illegally, breaking FTC laws, and comparing it to Herbalife. These statements sent the share price to a quick but drastic downturn. Then, just a few days ago, the company released results from another strong quarter, which, again, induced a reversal of the recovery from after the Citron report. Left's full report can be found here.SHOP data by YChartsSome of the Citron's accusations have some merit, and Shopify's response from their earnings call didn't answer all the questions people had hoped, as seen in the price reaction. I do tend to agree with Left on one topic, but it may not be Shopify's fault. If you search ""Shopify"" or ""Shopify millionaire"" on YouTube, you will see people talking about how much money they made on Shopify and how easy it was. Many of these videos have hundreds of thousands of views, as well. One of the main points in Citron's report was the company's partners, which are not disclosed anywhere, but they have 13,000 of them, seem to be an unknown. Many of these videos seem ""clickbaity"" and like get rich quick schemes and it is unknown whether or not they are affiliated with the company. However, Shopify has become increasingly popular over the years and may not have as much need for this referral program anymore.Image From ""Shopify"" Google TrendsCurrently getting around 818,000 google searches per month, a number that has grown exponentially over the past few years, customers are beginning to find them through more organic means.About a month ago, Shopify emailed its partners stating that they were changing their terms of service. Shopify made these terms much less friendly to their partners, stopping payments if inactive and finding ways to cut the percentage given for a referral. (A thread on the topic can be found here.)The actual business model is actually a much different one than the Citron report claims. Shopify provides a platform for people to sell their own products; they don't provide products like a MLM does. From this, the company gets a subscription fee and a fee for the use of their services to process payments on and offline. Because of this, Shopify has a great interest in how well their merchants do.Shopify earned $171.5M of revenue in 3Q17, 72.2% higher than the same period a year before. $82.4M (48% of total) came from subscription revenues, up 65.4% from 3Q16. The other $89M came from merchant solutions, 79% higher than a year ago.Image from company SEC FilingsThe increase in subscription revenue comes from Shopify growing its total merchant base from an estimated 325k to 550k since 3Q16. In the press release, they cited ""a record number of store launches on Shopify Plus"". Shopify Plus is their premium platform used by high volume sites. The screenshot below shows that they have around 2,500 Plus merchants, up 126% Y/Y.Images from Shopify.comSelling to major brands, the per-month fees are much higher than the normal rates, which are:From a merchants blog, I found an email from Shopify stating that the fees for Shopify Plus range from a minimum of $2,000/month to $40,000. The email can be found here.Merchant solutions revenue continues to grow on behalf of Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital, as they grow through ""increased adoption and international exposure"". Shopify's total merchant solutions gross margin was 37.1%, 128% higher than last year. The high margin of Shopify Shipping and Capital are the main drivers of this margin growth. About 20% of merchants in Canada and 30% in the US use Shopify Shipping, so as these percentages continue to increase, so should revenues and margins. In 3Q17 $2.4B in GMV (37% of total GMV) was processed through Shopify Payments. This is compared to 38% of total GMV a year earlier. This may be from the increased number of merchants in countries where Shopify Payments is not yet offered. The growth of total GMV (69% to $6.4B) is due to increased merchants and each merchant becoming more successful.Some statistics that would be interesting to see (which they don't release) are churn rate and GMV of non-Shopify Plus merchants. These would give insight into whether or not Shopify really is a platform for small to medium businesses like they claim, or if only the big businesses succeed and stay.Shopify as a company saw its first adjusted operating profit in 3Q17. Adj EPS of $0.05 and a net loss of $1.8M was from increasing margins, which outpaced the growth in operating expenses.Image from company SEC FilingsI like to focus on revenue growth as it better captures the bottom line impact of the company's various revenue streams.Shopify increases guidance on revenue to $656-658M from $642-648M, which implies $206-208M for Q4. Slightly higher at $220 behind strength in subscription growth and seasonality trends is not at all beyond the realm of possibility. Management noted it expects to improve GMV/merchant trends in Q4 given the strength of retail in the quarter (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas), and as larger GMV merchants offset the low margin, entrepreneurial merchants. Behind, higher GMV merchants, the holiday season, and their higher margin revenue streams being introduced in more countries, margins should continue to increase in Q417.Shopify has been a very interesting stock as of late. There are reasons to love and hate it. The lofty valuation and translucent business model vs. the popularity of the enterprise cloud platform and huge top line growth.SHOP Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsIt's easy to compare SHOP, Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN) because of the similarity in business (Amazon webstore closed in 2016), huge top-line growth and initial lack of interest in showing big bottom line numbers. The current dip comes after an impressive quarter and makes it an attractive investment. This should be a profitable stock into the future and could reach mid-$120-$130s this coming year.After weighing the pros and cons, I believe there is a nice opportunity here with Shopify. Overblown, but still real, risks may stop many investors from becoming a shareholder of the stock, but not me. People nowadays want to feel self-sufficient, and the e-commerce business gets rid of the once-large barriers of being your own boss. Shopify Plus, which attracts larger businesses, has also been significantly growing in popularity. The attractive financials and emerging social trend make Shopify a buy, currently priced under $100."

It was a clean beat-and-raise quarter followed by bullish commentary from management on the conference call. Nonetheless, SHOP stock dropped 10% because the market was not entirely satisfied with management's response to the Citron short thesis. We believe this sell off is a buying opportunity. We believe the robust growth numbers speak for themselves, and further believe management added enough color around those numbers to adequately deflate concerns related to the Citron short thesis. The valuation remains rich, but growth remains bigger, a combination that will likely lead to handsome share price gains in the long term. This earnings report was critical for two reasons:SHOP did both of those things this quarter.Management appropriately refuted Citron claims that Shopify was a ""get rich quick scheme."" On the call, management said they consulted with outside legal counsel and came to three conclusions: 1) Shopify sells a commerce platform, not business opportunities, 2) Shopify complies with FTC rules, and 3) Shopify actually consistently underscores just how hard (not easy) entrepreneurship is. Management went on to say that most of Shopify's revenue comes from a merchant successfully completing a transaction, meaning that Shopify only succeeds if its merchants succeed. Thus, if Shopify is growing as quickly as it is, then it means the underlying merchant base also is succeeding.While management admitted that there is churn in the merchant base (a lot of entrepreneurs don't succeed on their first try), they also said that there are a lot of successful merchants on Shopify. Management said that every 90 seconds an entrepreneur makes their first sale on the platform.Overall, management's sentiment on the call captures how we feel about Shopify. Shopify is an enabler of e-commerce solutions for small to medium-sized businesses that would otherwise be eaten alive by Amazon (AMZN) and other big retailers. While there are certainly marketers out there who have put together articles and videos detailing how one can get rich using Shopify, that doesn't mark the business as illegitimate. It's no different than articles and videos telling you how to make money from YouTube or Instagram. Google ""how to be a YouTube star"" or ""how to be Instagram famous."" There is plenty of content out there on that front, but none of it serves to undermine the value of YouTube or Instagram.Same with Shopify. Shopify's value is providing a commerce platform at a reasonable price to hundreds of thousands of merchants. That value isn't undermined by videos and articles saying its possible to get rich with Shopify. Shopify's value stands on its own as a platform that allows SMBs to level the commerce playing field with big retailers. Beyond refuting Citron, SHOP also proved that its growth story is still red hot. Revenue growth remains on fire (+72% versus +75% in each of the prior two quarters). Subscription solutions growth is actually accelerating (60% to 64% to 65%). The accelerated growth is being driven by yet another record quarter of merchant adds. That is what really matters in the Shopify business model - how much the company can grow its merchant user base. Merchants are the people who add value to Shopify and drive recurring revenue higher. On that note, monthly recurring revenue jumped 65% in the quarter, the best growth rate seen this year. Shopify Plus also is scaling nicely, as its contribution to MRR has gone from 17% to 18% to 20% so far this year. That means the proportion of merchants that see Shopify as adding ""big value"" continues to go up. GMV growth remains strong at nearly 70%. Gross profits jumped 86%, the best growth rate seen this year. Operating loss narrowed. Shopify reported its first ever adjusted profit as a public company. Plus, the revenue and earnings guides were hiked substantially. Clearly, this growth narrative isn't showing many signs of slowing. Bears want to point to the valuation and say it makes no sense. At 15x forward EV/revenues, SHOP stock is more richly valued than comps Square (SQ), Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW). But not by much. The 15.1x forward EV/Revenues multiple is only a 30% premium to the average 11.6x multiple for SQ, WDAY and NOW.We say only because SHOP is growing more than 2x as fast those companies. The average MRQ revenue growth rate at those three companies is 35%. Revenue growth at SHOP has been consistently above 70% this year. In fact, if you look at the one-year forward EV/revenue multiple, SHOP is no longer the most expensive stock in the group.In other words, SHOP does have a big multiple, but it should be bigger considering SHOP's huge growth rates. A 70%-plus revenue growth story should trade at more than 15-times EV/revenues. All in all, SHOP is still attacking only a small portion of its massive addressable market (see our TAM analysis here). That is why top-line growth rates are staying high at 70%-plus. Growth will inevitably come down, but this is a 20%-plus revenue growth story for the next five years-plus. Consequently, we believe SHOP stock is still in its early innings. We continue to believe this stock will follow an AMZN-like trajectory. There will be road bumps (such as shorts attacking the stock), but that won't knock this secular growth stock off course for long. Overall, the multi-year trend will be solidly up."
4119136,103791,2017-11-01T14:12:49-04:00,Q3 revenue grew by 72% Q/Q. The growth story has not changed.Shopify's two key performance indicators (KPI) do not show any weakness in the company.Margins have improved in both subscription solutions and merchant solutions.Gross profit is still scaling faster than operating expenses. This is a good indicator of future GAAP profitability.,"(Source: flickr)SHOP data by YChartsShopify (NYSE:SHOP) spooked investors with their Q3 earnings this Halloween. The stock has dropped more than 9% at the close. After a solid Q3 earnings, I believe the stock has had another unjustified sell-off. (the first after the Citron report which I also wrote about) This article will go over some of the reasons why I believe this is another opportunity to buy shares of Shopify: (1) Shopify continues to grow revenue at high double digit rates. (2) Shopify continues to perform well on its key performance indicators. (3) Margins have improved across both their main segments. (4) Gross profit has been increasing at a greater rate than operating expenses.If you compare the last three quarters Q/Q, revenue has increased by 74%. You might also have noticed that the company's revenue has been slowly shifting on a percentage basis from subscription solutions to merchant solutions. This could reflect the fact that merchants are on average processing more gross merchandise volume (more sales) on the platform.Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is calculated using the number of merchants with subscriptions at the end of the period multiplied by the average monthly subscription plan fee at the end of the period. This KPI serves as a better long-term indicator of subscription solutions revenue.Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) is the gross dollar amount of orders processed on Shopify's platform. This KPI serves as a good proxy for merchant solutions revenue because merchant solutions revenue is generated as a percentage of GMV.Shopify has been able to improve margins in both merchant subscriptions and merchant solutions. If you look at cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue, both segments are operating a lower cost than last year. In Q3, cost of subscription solutions and merchant solution as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.6% and 2.8% Q/Q respectively.Margins in merchant solutions are particularly important because the bulk of revenue is from processing fees through Shopify Payments. I previously wrote about how Shopify earns roughly 1.36% of GMV as merchant solutions revenue. Small improvements in margins could have a large impact on total revenue as the Shopify Payments segment is very sensitive.Comparing the Last Eight Quarters on a Percentage BasisQ3 of 2017 has actually been Shopify's best quarter so far. As a percentage of revenue, this quarter's net loss was only 5.5% of revenue when including other income. Excluding other income, this quarter's net loss was 7.4% of revenue. (Still an improvement from last year's 9.5%) Shopify will mostly likely set another best quarter in Q4 this year, as Q4 has traditionally been retail's strongest quarter.Comparing the last 3 months with the same period last year:Gross profits grew by $46 million, an increase of 86%. Meanwhile, operating expenses grew by 78%.Comparing the last 9 months with the same period last year: Gross profits grew by $118 million, an increase of 83%. Meanwhile, operating expenses grew by 79%.I believe Shopify has had an unjustified sell-off following their Q3 earnings report. For investors who still believe in the company, the growth story has not changed. Besides revenue, the Shopify has been able perform well on KPIs. If you combine the fact that the company has been improving margins and scaling gross profit faster than operating expenses, it is very likely Shopify will be GAAP profitable in the future.I also reiterate that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and their recently acquisition of Oberlo will continue to be growth catalysts for Shopify. Investors can look forward to Shopify's Q4, as it is retail's strongest quarter. While the stock is not as cheap as it was after the Citron report, investors can pick up some shares back around the $100 range.If you enjoyed this article, please press the follow button or leave a comment below.

If Shopify meets our expectations, we would expect it to reach positive adjusted net income one quarter earlier than expected. This could blow a key short thesis out of the water. And given the recent short report by Citron bringing the short interest to 5.6%, a strong quarter could cause a short squeeze on the stock.The discussion around the Citron Research Short Report has been overly publicized by now, so I will just refer you to our Response to Citron article.The news I want to talk about is Shopify's expansion in Waterloo. For those that don't know, Waterloo is a ""university city"" about 1.5 hours drive from Toronto (the 4th largest city in North America, ahead of Chicago). The University of Waterloo is famous for producing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineer, Mathematics) graduates. The city is home to other famous Canadian tech companies like BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and OpenText (OTEX). Waterloo is the Silicon Valley of Canada.According to LinkedIn, Shopify has 2,504 employees and 264 Shopify Plus employees, 43 of which are listed as Merchant Success Managers (the equivalent of account managers for Shopify Plus Merchants). The expansion in Waterloo is expected to add 300-500 more Shopify Plus employees over the next couple (2) years. This implies Shopify Plus merchant growth is expected to double or triple in the next couple of years. If you consider the operating scale of G&A employees within the Shopify Plus employee base, the Merchant Success Manager growth could be (and likely is) greater than triple, implying greater than triple Shopify Plus merchant growth.Considering that Shopify Advanced and Plus make up about 50% of GMV, and Shopify Plus contributes 18% of MRR (monthly recurring revenue). This expansion of the top tier of Shopify bodes well for revenue growth. Diversifying and expanding the ""blue chip"" merchant base is a better bet on setting a strong long-term revenue base as opposed to the high churn new businesses many short investors focus in on.The three keys in our expectations to look for in Shopify's 3Q17 results:Shopify will release 3Q17 earnings results before the market opens on October 31, 2017.Since 2Q17 was released, we calculated a fair value price per share for Shopify of US$104 per share. Currently, the shares are trading near our fair value derived from our 10-year forecast.Management guidance provided for 3Q17 is as follows:Revenue of $164 million to $166 million.GAAP operating loss of $17 million to $19 million.Adjusted operating loss* of $2 million to $4 million.*The difference between the GAAP and the adjusted number is an exclusion of stock-based compensation expenses and payroll taxes of $15 million.Additionally, the full-year 2017 guidance was provided as follows:Revenue of $642 million to $648 million.GAAP operating loss of $62 million to $66 million.Adjusted operating loss* of $7 million to $11 million.*The difference between the GAAP and the adjusted number is an exclusion of stock-based compensation expenses and payroll taxes of $55 millionOur expectations for the quarter 3Q17:Revenue of $171 million versus guidance of $164 million to $166 million.Adjusted numbers are less important to us, as we base our model on the more standardized results of GAAP. However…What we think isn't what other investors will necessarily think.If our forecast is correct and Shopify reports a GAAP operating loss of $4 million in 3Q17, after adjusting for $15 million in stock-based compensation expenses and payroll taxes (per guidance), they would have an adjusted operating income of $11 million.This would be the first quarter where adjusted net income is positive, and this would come one quarter earlier than most analysts and investors expected. Company guidance is already implying positive adjusted net income in 4Q17.For long-term investors like us, reaching positive net income this quarter or next quarter doesn't really matter. But for investors looking for a short-term catalyst to trade on, this might be one to watch.Our expectation for the full year 2017:Revenue of $662 million versus guidance of $642 million to $648 million.Lastly, our expectations for 4Q17 are as follows:Given that our expectations result in a fair value of US$104/share and the current stock price is around US$104/share, our model suggests that if we buy today, we would expect a 10% annual return on average for the next 10 years. We would normally recommend buying stocks below fair value with some margin of safety. However, we believe Shopify has the potential to benefit from some known and unknown factors such as wider market adoption (Early Majority Phase), which could accelerate merchant growth as businesses move online more and more, as well as GMV growth as consumers become more comfortable to buy online as their first choice, and Shopify Plus growth accelerating in the next couple of years.3Q1720174Q17We recommend owning Shopify at or below our fair value of US$104/share before the 3Q17 results on October 31.The three keys in our expectations to look for in Shopify's 3Q17 results:The upside result: Shopify continues its streak of beating and raising guidance, plus produces positive adjusted net income/EPS. This could create a short squeeze given the increased short positions after the Citron Research Short Report.The downside result: Shopify misses its guidance, we will continue to hold long term, but re-evaluate our model.If Shopify misses its guidance, we would consider selling some of our position first. As investors have seen with the impact of the Citron Report, when a negative catalyst takes hold of a stock like Shopify, it can take a while for the dust to settle. Any indication that the growth train has slowed significantly is reason enough for short-term investors to flee the stock.Follow us if you like our insight.Check out our most popular articles on Shopify:Shopify: A Response To CitronShopify In A RecessionShopify: 10-Year Revenue ForecastShopify: Cash Is Cash, M&A Is Upside"

        But today's results have been unable, so far, to solidify the stock's comeback
        Considering the volatility in the stock and the rich valuations, not to mention my value-bias towards investing, I remain on the sidelines","Shopify (SHOP) has been a hotly debated name as of late. Following Citron Research's bear attack on the stock, allegedly due to questionable business practices (see a couple of great articles supporting and refuting Citron's claims), shares eased off their all-time highs of $120. Despite the bounce back of the past three weeks, today's earnings beat and improved outlook have been unable, so far, to solidify the stock's comeback. Shares were up in the mid-single digits at one point before the opening bell, but deteriorated sharply later in the morning.Credit: The Official Slack BlogControversies aside, the Ottawa-based tech company delivered solid revenues of $171.5 million that topped consensus by about $6 million on the back of increased GMV (gross merchandise volume) and solid growth in the more profitable subscription end of the business. The performance does not surprise me, as I believe Shopify to be on the right side of commerce trends and still in the very early stages of its high-growth cycle. With increased scale came drastically improved margins, by 433 bps on a non-GAAP basis at the total company level and driving the near-doubling of gross profits YOY. See simplified P&L below, including a YOY comparison.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsBelow the gross profit line were operating costs that grew at a bit faster pace than revenues, particularly on the R&D and S&M lines. Once SBC charges are taken into account, representing 8.4% of total revenues this quarter vs. 7.3% last year, the opex increase was more pronounced. I have been a critic of young, fast-growing tech companies overusing the shared-based alternative to compensation. But I understand that the cashless expense is a valid tool for retaining talent without jeopardizing scarce resources in the earlier stages of the company's life.The bulleted items below summarize Shopify's guidance for the upcoming quarter, which compares favorably to consensus expectations. Source: Shopify's press releaseWith a solid quarter in the bag, SHOP continues to be a promising stock riding favorable trends in e-commerce and an increase in small but already numerous retail outlets. Now that the pre-earnings quiet period is over, the company's management team will be able to address concerns that may still be lingering regarding the bear case presented on the stock about a month ago.But as the chart and table above suggest, SHOP is no bargain however one chooses to look at the stock, even compared to otherwise richly-valued peer SQ and other fast-growing tech names like NOW and WDAY. Shopify has only now been able to reach non-GAAP net profitability, and free cash flow around breakeven levels on a trailing-twelve month basis suggests the company still has quite a bit of work to do.Considering the volatility in the stock and the rich valuations, not to mention my value bias, I will remain on the sidelines and just watch the next few chapters in Shopify's promising growth story.Note: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

We take this as a positive comment as we believe Shopify has years of exponential growth ahead.While Shopify easily beat its guidance, its results are more or less in line with our expectations.3Q17(+/=) Revenue of $171.5 million vs. SMRE: $171 million vs. guidance: $165 million(+/=) Operating loss of -$12.7 million vs. SMRE: -$9.6 million vs. guidance: -$18 million(=) GMV of $6.4 billion vs. SMRE: $6.6 billion vs. 2Q17: $5.8 billion, 3Q16: $3.8 billion(=) GPV (Gross Payments Volume) of $2.4 billion vs. SMRE: $2.5 billion vs. 2Q17: $2.2 billion(+) MRR of $26.8 million vs. SMRE: $26.2 million vs. 2Q17: $23.7 million, +13% q/q2017 Guidance – Updated full-year guidance has moved within spitting distance of our full-year forecast.

A continuation of this level of performance would put our forecast well in the range of possibilities.(-) Revenue of $206 million to $208 million vs. SMRE: $214 million(=) Operating loss of -$12.5 million to -$14.5 million vs. SMRE: -$13 millionShopify started the conference call today, making it clear that they do not want to spend their time responding to ""trolls"" between quarterly earnings. The earnings calls are the time they allocate to these activities.CEO Tobi Lutke made it clear that Shopify has not been contacted by the FTC about their business practices. And if they were contacted, it would be required to be disclosed as material information.Shopify is being run with the intention of making entrepreneurship easier for small businesses and they want to be a “100-year” company. Their operating lease obligations imply they have 20-year leases on their office space, which some may find aggressive, but this is in alignment with their vision of staying in this business for the long term.Shopify made it clear that the large majority of the 14,000 partners provide some kind of value added service when referring their clients to Shopify. From the MD&A:And becoming an affiliate partner is not so easy, every potential partner is vetted to ensure they can provide value to Shopify.As we mentioned in our Response to Citron article, the affiliates Citron mentioned in their report are not Shopify affiliates, and that was confirmed on the conference call. These are people selling their online courses on how to build an online business, and they are just using Shopify as the platform they recommend, but do not receive affiliate fees for this. They make money from selling their courses. Using Shopify in their advertising helps them drive traffic to their courses because of Shopify’s popularity in the e-commerce platform space.Shopify gets its new merchants from organic search, paid advertising, and, in third place, partner referrals and affiliates. The majority of their new merchants are not from affiliates, though the affiliate partners are a powerful driver of high-value merchants willing to pay developers (partners) for value-added services.Churn was discussed by the company without giving metrics. This was probably a big one that many investors wanted to know about. The CEO only said that some businesses fail but hundreds of thousands are thriving. This implies that it's not just a small handful of the 500,000+ merchants that are succeeding, but in fact “hundreds of thousands” which could mean 200,000+ which would imply 40% of the existing merchant base.Shopify is in the business of seeing businesses rise and fall, so they know better than anyone else how hard it is to create a successful business. The app ecosystem, the building a business resources, and the features like Shopify Capital, Shipping, and Payments, are all designed to make the back office of building a business easier. Shopify, fortunately, makes a cut on these features either directly from a subscription fee or indirectly through customer sales driving payments on the platform.We believe that as long as Shopify can continue to make commerce easier to access, it will put more and more entrepreneurs through its ""sift"". The end result will be that all the good businesses will thrive on Shopify and ramp up towards Shopify Plus subscriptions, while the unsuccessful entrepreneurs will churn off. And that's okay. One Shopify Plus merchant is worth at least 25 regular Shopify merchants and is worth at least 68 basic merchants in just Subscription revenue. Take into account the Merchant solution revenue and the value of ""sifting"" the best merchants is huge. But the only way to find these good merchants is to pour as many of them through their ""sift"".The result is a lot of churn, but it's worth it.The Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) continued to accelerate at the 2nd derivative level (we refer to this as “acceleration of growth”). The primary driver of this improvement was a record number of net new merchant additions and net new merchants on the Shopify Plus plan. The majority of new Shopify Plus merchants are net new, while Advanced merchants that should be on Shopify Plus saw upgrades as well. Shopify Plus now makes up 20% of MRR (2Q17 was 18%).For those interested, the acceleration of growth is calculated as MRR multiplied by 12 (to annualize), subtract the difference from the prior year. And again subtract the difference of the difference from the prior year. So this method of modeling requires 3 years of data points to work.Example calculation with 3Q17 Acceleration of Growth:3Q17: $26.8 million MRR x 12 = $322 million (annualized MRR)3Q16: $16.3 million MRR x 12 = $195 million3Q15: $9.8 million MRR x 12 = $118 millionDollar Value of Growth Y/Y (1st derivative)3Q17: $322 million - $195 million = $127 million3Q16: $195 million - $118 million = $78 millionAcceleration of Growth (2nd derivative)3Q17: $127 million - $78 million = $49 millionIn 1Q17, the acceleration of growth was $30 million on an annualized basis. In 2Q17, it increased to $40.8 million, and in 3Q17, it continued to ramp up to $49 million.In our model, we apply the current acceleration of growth forward to 2019, ramp it down to $30 million for 2020-2021, and flat line it to zero from 2022 to 2026 to represent a stabilizing of growth on a linear basis (instead of the exponential growth we get with a positive acceleration of growth).This acceleration shift from $40.8 million to $49 million has resulted in an 8% increase in the long-term Subscription Solutions revenue in our model.Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $26.8 million at the end of 3Q17, a $10.5 million increase y/y and a $3.1 million increase q/q. We expect by the end of 2017, MRR will be $29.7 million (up from our previous forecast of $29 million)Subscription Solutions revenue in 2017 increases slightly from $300 million to $307 million. While our 2026 (10-year forecast) subscription revenue increases from $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. Even more impressive is the cost of revenue for Subscription Solutions is accelerating at a slower rate, driving an increase in our gross margin forecast from 80% to 83% for this Subscription revenue. This gives a boost to our forecast profitability and cash flow.Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) was $6.4 billion in 3Q17. We had forecast $6.6 billion. The difference is minor to our model.For 2017, we forecast GMV of $26.4 billion, down from $26.6 billion. And 2026 (10-year forecast) GMV of $278 billion, down from $288 billion.Merchant Solutions revenue in 2017 decreases to $358 million from $362 million. While 2026 (10-year forecast) merchant revenue decreases from $5.2 billion to $5 billion.On the bottom line, a dollar of Subscription Solutions revenue is worth about twice as much as a dollar of Merchant Solutions revenue. So the net difference is a win for Shopify.Our model continues to forecast Free Cash Flow breakeven (after share-based compensation) in 2020.With these changes, our fair value based on a 10-year DCF model increases to US$113/share from US$104/share.We are long-term shareholders of Shopify. The “short” pressure from Citron has created a depressed stock price in the near term. But we believe the strong earnings, showing acceleration of high margin Subscription revenue, should speak volumes for the robustness of this business. We recommend taking this opportunity to buy shares below US$113/share.Author Recommended ArticlesShopify: Q3 2017 Earnings Preview And Waterloo ImpactShopify: A Response To CitronShopify In A RecessionShopify: 10-Year Revenue ForecastClick the “Track Comments” button, we typically answer questions with great detail that you may find useful.And follow us if you like our insight."
4114865,103791,2017-10-19T18:05:28-04:00,"Citron Research is mistaken on their Shopify short report.Monthly recurring subscription revenue has increased by 28%. This accounted for 60% of total subscription revenue growth to date, and this is ""healthy"" growth from long-term orientated merchants.Shopify earns roughly 1.36% of total gross merchandise volume processed through the platform as merchant solutions revenue, which was $10.7 billion in the first half of 2017.Gross profits grew by 81.6% while operating expenses grew by 78.8% in the first half of 2017. However, the company operated at a $30.4 million loss.Amazon.com integration into Shopify remains a strong catalyst. Q4 of 2017 will be Shopify's first Q4 with Amazon.com and Oberlo integration.","(Free stock photo from Pexels)Since the release of Citron Research's report by Andrew Left on Oct. 4th, Shopify's stock has fallen more than 15% from its closing price of $116.81. Andrew Left became famous after his hugely successful short report on Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2015. The Shopify report can be found here.In his report, Left challenged Shopify's claim of having over 500,000 registered merchants. He believes that these merchants are not legitimate merchants selling goods. Left also criticized Shopify's 13,000 partners, a portion of which are non-software related affiliate partners who act as promoters for the company. Left believes these affiliates unethically promote the company as a get-rich-quick scheme. The combination of these two factors create a risky situation for Shopify because the company relies on merchant subscriptions for half its operating revenue. Finally, Left placed a price target of $60 for the stock. You can monitor where Shopify has traded at on the stock chart below.SHOP data by YChartsI found most of Left's claims to be baseless and lacking in evidence. However, the stock has tripled (to its peak in September) this year, and this raises some doubts on its valuation. Reading Citron Research's report lead me to ask the question, ""Is Shopify really a lemon?""In regards to the problem with Shopify's affiliate partners, companies are usually not liable for what their affiliates (typically independent contractors) claim. As some others writers in the industry have already pointed out, large online retailers such as Amazon.com and eBay.com also have their own affiliate programs. Should Amazon and eBay investors be concerned as well?Left's attack on the authenticity of Shopify's 500,000 registered merchants is a much better argument. Because a majority of their registered merchants are small and medium-sized businesses, I decided to investigate further on the quality of Shopify's revenue.Shopify generates revenue from two main sources: merchant subscriptions to their platform and fees collected on their merchant solutions. Let's first look at merchant subscriptions which is Shopify's bread and butter.Shopify has at least 2,500 merchants registered as Shopify Plus accounts which is their service for big businesses. Popular brands registered include Tesla, Nestle, GE, and Red Bull. The price of Shopify Plus accounts is not advertised publicly and must be negotiated individually for every merchant. However, it is known that Shopify Plus subscriptions cost a minimum of $2,000 a month. This means that Shopify collects at least $60 million in subscription revenue annually from their Shopify Plus merchants alone. Big business merchants usually sign up for long-term multi-year contracts to get a discount, so this portion of revenue is actually quite safe. As for the remaining 497,500 merchants, Shopify's subscriptions range as cheap as $29 a month for their Basic Shopify plan to $299 a month for their Advanced Shopify plan.(From Shopify website.)Unfortunately, pricing plans don't give us very much information on the quality of the merchants registered. Shopify does not require merchants to register for annual contracts, and merchants can renew their subscription on a monthly basis. This makes it hard to differentiate revenue between merchants who stay for the long-term and merchants who end their subscription after their first month. Fortunately, Shopify has come up with a useful performance indicator, monthly recurring revenue (MRR).MRR - is the average monthly subscription revenue Shopify earns from merchants. This metric is more useful than annual subscription revenue because it filters out noise and seasonal fluctuations from newly registered merchants who don't renew their subscriptions. Shopify also recommends that investors pay more attention to MRR than total merchant subscription revenue because they believe it is a more accurate metric for the company.In the first half of 2017, Shopify had an MRR of $23.66 million. This is an increase of about $5.16 million or 28% over their MRR in 2016. ($18.5 million) When the increase in MRR ($5.16 million) is semi-annualized, you get $31 million in reliable revenue growth for the period. We can compare this value with total subscription revenue growth to see what percentage of growth was ""healthy"" revenue growth. Shopify generated $133.7 million in total subscription revenue in the first half of 2017. This is a $51.3 million or 62.3% increase in total subscription revenue over the same period in 2016.$31 million / $51.3 million x 100% = 60%This means that 60% of the subscription revenue growth in 2017 so far has been ""healthy"" growth from long-term orientated merchants. The remaining 40% of subscription revenue growth is from merchants who are considered ""high churn."" This might seem high, but it is also possible these merchants will convert to long-term subscribers later.Merchant subscriptions is something that is relatively easy to understand, but where does the other 52% of their revenue in 2017 come from? Let's examine Shopify's merchant solutions which composes the other half of their revenue.Shopify's merchant solutions are fee based revenue sources generated as a percentage of total gross merchandise volume (GMV) sold on their platform. Main revenue components include: Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, and Shopify Shipping. As of the first half of 2017, Shopify has generated $145.36 million in merchant solutions revenue. GMV processed on their platform in the same period was $10.7 billion. This means that Shopify earns roughly 1.36% of their GMV as revenue through merchant solutions.I found that 91% of revenue generated from fees collected on merchant solutions is from processing fees earned by Shopify Payments. This percentage is estimated from Shopify's 2016 annual report by subtracting merchant solutions revenue earned by Shopify's other subsidiaries (Shopify Capital, Shopify Shipping, etc.) from total merchant solutions revenue. This means that Shopify Payments contributes to 47.3% of Shopify's total revenue. Most people don't think of an e-commerce platform like Shopify as a payment processor!The remaining segments contribute to the remaining 9% of merchant solutions revenue. Relatively speaking, they are not as important, but I will still discuss them for readers who are curious to learn more about Shopify. Shopify Capital is an interesting subsidiary of Shopify that offers an optional merchant cash advance (""MCA"") service to merchants registered. Shopify gives merchants a cash advance in exchange for the ability to buy their receivables at a discount. Shopify Shipping generates revenue from fees collected as a percentage of shipping costs. Finally, Shopify also receives referral fees from partners who sell software on their platform to merchants.Many investors are impressed by Shopify's impressive revenue growth in 2017. Merchant subscription revenue grew 62%, and merchant solutions revenue grew 88.8% in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period last year. After accounting for cost of revenues, gross profits grew 81.6%. Unfortunately for investors, operating expenses grew in nearly the same proportion. Total operating expenses grew by 78.8%. This might be a good sign to investors as gross profits grew at a greater rate than total operating expenses. However, the company still operated at a $30.4 million loss for the first two quarters of 2017.(From the 2017 second quarter report)This year Shopify has increased the total number of shares outstanding to 94.3 million shares. Another 10.8 million shares through employee stock options and restricted share units (RSU) brings the total number of shares to 105 million shares. This is an increase of 12.2% in the total number of shares from the same period last year. (From the 2017 second quarter report)In Dec 2016, Shopify integrated Amazon into their platform. As can be seen in the chart below, it has been a major catalyst in 2017. Because Shopify generates revenue roughly equal to 1.36% of GMV that is sold on their platform, it benefits immensely when other retailers are integrated into their platform. Amazon.com is one of the largest online retailers, and Shopify will be able to capitalize on e-commerce growth from other companies through their all-in-one platform. Investors can look forward to Shopify’s Q4 as it will be the first Q4 with Amazon.com integrated into the platform. On April 28, 2017, Shopify also acquired Oberlo to help merchants source products to sell. This could benefit Shopify by increasing GMV as merchants will have more products to sell, but it is unknown how many merchants have been using the service. The effects of the Oberlo acquisition will be seen further in Q3 and Q4 of this year.(This chart is from Yahoo Finance and reflects the price at the close on Oct. 17)Investors who agree with me that Shopify has had an unjustified sell-off because of Citron Research's report might want to consider picking up some shares of SHOP at current prices as the stock is trading at a discount from its 52-week high. I believe that Citron Research has been incorrect in their recent report on Shopify. Left's argument against Shopify's affiliate partners does not hold when you consider the fact that other retailers (such as Amazon.com) have their own affiliate programs. For investors worried about the quality of Shopify's merchants, monthly recurring subscription revenue has increased by 28%. This accounted for 60% of total subscription revenue growth to date, and this is ""healthy"" growth from long-term orientated merchants. On the operational side, the company's operating gross profits grew by 81.6% while operating expenses grew by 78.8% in the first half of 2017. I believe that Shopify will also continue to benefit from Amazon.com and Oberlo as catalysts for growth through increasing gross merchandise volume. Shopify earns roughly 1.36% of total gross merchandise volume processed on their platform. While Shopify has operated at a $30.4 million loss in 2017, it is expected to be profitable starting 2019.If you liked this article, please press the follow button or leave a comment below.

4115009,103262,2017-10-20T09:03:26-04:00,"Andrew Left will be releasing more accusations soon -- be aware.Shopify cannot protect itself publicly due to dubious timing of Left's research and the ""quiet-period"" rule.This next earnings release could generate an abrupt stock move.","Hello all. This is Ophir writing.We added Shopify (SHOP) to Top Picks on 22-Mar-17 for $66.50. As of this writing the stock is trading at $98, up 47.3%.We noted in great detail the rationale and impact of short seller Andrew Left's narrative on Shopify in our recent dossier The Reason Behind Shopify's Drop.But, we have news now that we must urgently convey ahead of an event.This dossier will not go point-by-point to cover, explain, and at times refute the short narrative presented by Andrew Left - that was the purpose of the prior dossier. Today we remind all of our members that more bad news is coming - Andrew Left told everyone so much.But we also face the possibility of chicanery from Citron Research that is almost inconceivable.On October 11th, 2017, Reuters published a story Citron's Left says follow-up report on Shopify likely. The takeaway from that story is quite simple:Left told Reuters that ""I am looking at many parts of the business."" Then he revealed what it is that he will be criticizing if not catastrophizing.* He wants Shopify to disclose data on so-called customer churn, or the rate at which clients leave, a key metric to evaluate companies that sell subscription services.As for Shopify's defense of itself, at first it was quite weak, we must say:But that defense gained some momentum, through of all places, Twitter.Shopify's CEO Tobi Lutke posted two tweets directly in response to Andrew Left's accusations.And then he followed it up with a rather appropriate message:The totality of the response from Shopify was less than vigorous, but, the company is also in a quiet period, something Andrew Left surely knows. Read this carefully - this is one of those times where every word matters (our emphasis has been added):That quiet period has been extended by many companies to not only include the quarter end, but the 4-weeks prior to an actual earnings announcement.Now, follow this logic carefully. Shopify's quarter end is (was) Sept. 30, 2017. The company is expected to announce earnings for that quarter on November 1st according to an estimate by Wall Street Horizon. Last year the announcement came out on 11-2-2016.Four weeks before 11-1-2017 is 10-4-2017, and what do you know, Andrew Left dropped his bomb about Shopify on, you guessed it, 10-4-2017. So, you see, while investors want Shopify to stand up and go point-by-point to refute the accusations, their hands are tied, or, there could be a view from the general council that their hands are tied.Just to be fully transparent, this ""quiet-period"" (which is different than the quiet-period before an IPO) is in fact not a law, it's a suggestion, by the SEC.So, yes, Shopify could have, hypothetically, gone on television and major media and point-by-point addressed the Andrew Left accusations, but it's also possible that the company could not.Now, let's read the tweet from Shopify's CEO again, with that context.This is a little bit of tea leaf reading, but my interpretation of that tweet is simply that Shopify does feel they are in a quiet period, and the next time they can address these accusations is on the earnings call.Whether you agree or disagree with this conclusion is up to you. You have the facts, and some of them are fuzzy - which is to say, what and when is exactly a quiet-period?I have spoken with many companies as an interview for Top Picks and always danced around quiet periods and have been told several times that they prefer not to speak until a date such that the SEC could not consider our discussions in bad timing. So, yes, this is a thing, it's not a little tid-bit that a crazy Google search uncovers.The worst possible view of this for those that are pro-Shopify and anti-Andrew Left is that Andrew Left timed his accusations perfectly, and will time his next accusations perfectly and may in fact be a worse fraud himself than the accusations he has levied on Shopify (and other companies).The best possible view of this for that are anti-Shopify and pro-Andrew Left, is that he levied his accusations openly, bluntly and was likely ready to take on a response from the company.The truth likely lies somewhere in between, but not the middle.This is when I write about a ton of objective data and make it clear what the bullish and bearish narratives are. But I've already done that in the prior dossier. So now it's just a guess, so I will give you my guess, but this time I can't hand you facts, which is what we would all prefer.I think Andrew Left can wreck a stock. We've seen it - he uncovered a massive fraud in Valeant (VRX) and did some good for the pubic as well, bringing drug pricing to the forefront of the news and to the floor of the United States Congress.We also know he can have zero effect - he shorted Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)(oops) and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) with a price target of $11. MBLY was acquired by Intel for $67 (oops, again).I don't know what's going to happen. Shopify has yet to turn a profit, but that is very much on purpose. They are growing unlike almost any other legitimate tech company and the stock is still up 100% in the last year.Here is the revenue chart from the prior dossier:Thomson First Call has an average estimate of -$0.01 EPS for the quarter that ended on Sep 30th. So, the losses are shrinking. Estimates are actually for $0.02 EPS in the quarter to follow.If, on the earnings call, Shopify raises EPS estimates, whether it be due to a direct response to Left's attacks or simply because the company is doing better than analysts have projected, the stock could absolutely rip higher.But… and this is a big one, if the company misses estimates, and further yet takes down guidance for EPS in the next quarter to the point of a loss, even if we are talking about pennies in earnings per share, the stock could crater.Normally, these reactions would all be rather subdued, but with the short narrative out there and the media attention to it, along with yet to come, but soon to come, new accusations, this has become the Wild West. It's dangerous, lawless, senseless, and everyone is out for blood.So, this is the new reality we live in because of Andrew Left, and no objective data I can provide, even that thorough analysis from the prior dossier, can take that risk off.We reiterate our Spotlight Top Status on Shopify and much of that has to do with its enormously powerful partnerships - Amazon, eBay, and Facebook's Instagram, but also the undeniable, even by Andrew Left, thematic trend of e-commerce. Here are our favorite two charts:That chart comes to us from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED). You're reading that right - even in the US, we're still at less than 9% of retail sales done online. eMarketer projects that number rising from 8.7% today, to 14.6% in four years.And here are the retail e-commerce projections worldwideRetail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2020 are pegged to grow from $2.3 trillion in 2017 to over $4 trillion by 2020.So that's it. We see those trends, and Shopify's growing moat, and remain bullish, even though that bullish call could leave us looking at a stock, that in the short-term, gets decimated from an exogenous, albeit powerful, force.As always, control risk, size appropriately and use your own judgment, aside from anyone else's subjective views, including my own.Thanks for reading, friends.The author is long shares Shopify at the time of this writing.To get more stories like this from me, you can feel free to tap on my Seeking Alpha profile and follow me.LegalThe information contained on this site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the readers.

4114255,41351,2017-10-18T10:19:14-04:00,"The short-thesis presentation on Shopify by Andrew Left has led investors to compare Shopify with Herbalife, which was prosecuted by the FTC.The two companies share a common, illusory space of selling ""home-based"" businesses as the economic remedy for millions of people.The short-sellers, William Ackman and Andrew Left, share common views and strategies. Both single out ""multi-level marketing"" companies, without context, and expect the FTC to prosecute only those.In regulatory terms, the main question is whether Shopify, which is not ""MLM"" or a pyramid scheme, sells a ""business opportunity"" or just exploits the delusion of home-based businesses.","Seeking Alpha has published several articles discussing the short-thesis of investor, Andrew Left, who is making publicized claims of deceptive business practices against Shopify (SHOP), a mass marketer of personalized e-commerce sites and tools. The short-thesis argues that investors should classify Shopify with Herbalife (HLF). Because of their fundamental similarity as enterprises as well as similarity of business practices, the thesis argues, the fate that befell Herbalife from the FTC inevitably awaits Shopify.This is a misleading, unfounded and confusing characterization. Yet, with the investment factors of these two equities being based more on the sins of Dante's Nine Circles of Hell, e.g., deception, public harm, pyramid scheming, secrecy or subterfuge, illegality and prosecution by authorities, than on market factors, making distinctions cannot be a matter of defending either enterprise.Nevertheless, even in an ethics-free zone of pure speculation, shams still deserve to be sorted from scams. In such an investment arena, the overriding issue may not be illegality, but rather assessing the level of possible prosecution and measuring the amount of potential fines or restitution. Which federal agency might bring charges becomes the concern, not whether a prosecution is warranted. Prosecution, class action lawsuits, large fines, and government imposed changes in business practices are blithely treated as routine costs of doing business. Herbalife easily paid off $200 million to the FTC. Amway paid out $50 million in a pyramid scheme class action case, etc.As a consultant, I have had several recent inquiries and consultations about whether Shopify is a pyramid scheme, a multi-level marketing, aka MLM, enterprise, and a marketer of a ""business opportunity."" Most importantly, I have been asked if the FTC were to act against Shopify, how severe would the penalty likely be? In other words, even if Shopify is illegal as Herbalife was found to be, is there a grade level of wrongdoing in ""business opportunity"" schemes?Most of these questions were generated by the misleading and confusing implications contained in Left's guilt-by-association presentation on Shopify. But the inquiries also reflect Wall Street's enduring lack of understanding as to what ""multi-level marketing"" is. This blind spot, in the face of all the information generated around Herbalife, can only be characterized, using Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi's description of the SEC's posture toward Bernie Madoff, as ""aggressive cluelessness."" Many just don't want to know.Before pointing up the distinctions between Herbalife and Shopify and the common jeopardy they both pose to investors, it is necessary to note some common characteristics shared by the two protagonists, whose short-sale theses brought these two companies to the forefront, William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital and Andrew Left of Citron Research. Both are inexplicably selective in their condemnations of certain ""multi-level marketing"" enterprises. Left has presented short theses against Herbalife's first cousins, Nu Skin (NUS) and Usana (USNA). He has been prominently silent about the charges against Herbalife, even though his claims against his two MLM targets are essentially the same as those made by William Ackman against Herbalife. Ackman, for his part, has asked Wall Street to believe that Herbalife, based on its ""endless chain"" business model, ""conscripted"" purchase incentives and recruiting-based pay plan and income promises, is a criminal enterprise, a pyramid scheme, with a net value of zero. By implication, he also asks investors not to notice that other MLMs such as Nu Skin and Usana and all other similar companies are, essentially the same as Herbalife, and there is nothing truly significant about Herbalife in the MLM field.There is no factual basis for either investor's laser focus on their respective MLM ""frauds,"" to the exclusion of hundreds of others in the field. This narrow view, accompanied by the short-sellers' public expressions of personal concern for the victims of their respective short targets lead many people, reasonably, to question the basis of their claims. Showing selective outrage and calling for targeted government intervention only against companies they would gain profit from, casts a shadow of doubt over the validity of their well researched factual presentations. Government regulators are also placed in an untenable position by these selective campaigns. Doing nothing, FTC may appear to ignore publicized, verifiable facts about illegal behavior. Responding, it may appear to be aiding privileged hedge funds in yet more profit-taking, while the greater public interest regarding the same harm caused by all other MLMs is continues to be ignored.Neither William Ackman nor Andrew Left has addressed the reality that Herbalife, Nu Skin and Usana are essentially identical enterprises and that they are representatives of a large syndicate of companies, known as ""multi-level marketing,"" all exhibiting the same fundamental traits. Neither has called for an industry-wide investigation or spoken about the MLM model, its history or practices. MLM enterprises are all structured with the same ""endless recruiting chain"" as Ackman's and Left's short-sales targets are; they all internally transfer new money from later recruits to earlier ones in a closed market; induce pay-to-play fees and purchases in the same manner; make the same extravagant income claims and promises; employ identical reward formulas; indoctrinate followers with the same methods; and they all produce exactly the same financial consequences, huge loss and churn rates, year after year, which are the inescapable outcomes of the model and pay plan. Neither of these investors has acknowledged that, if their respective short targets are as they describe them, an industry-wide investigation of ""multi-level marketing"" by the FTC is indicated, not ""fenced in"" prosecutions.This essay is not intended to address the price performance of the MLM stocks Ackman and Left have targeted, however, it is impossible not to wonder if the limited, contradictory, illogical, self-serving and credibility-stressing approach taken by these two famous personalities has not affected the reluctance of regulators and the rest of the investment community, leading to the stocks' continued inflated pricing.To properly evaluate Left's Shopify short-thesis, it is necessary to understand the common market space that Shopify and Herbalife (and all other MLMs) share. This space may be called the hall of illusion of home-based businesses as the economic remedy for millions of people. Promoters in this space rub raw the sores of discontent over declining wages, loss of pensions, rising costs of life's necessities, vanishing job security, and the predicted collapse of Social Security. This dystopian vision is redeemed by their utopian dreamworld of self-employment for all, (especially those that have never run a business) independence from bosses, ""extraordinary"" income and freedom of time, all done from the comfort of home as ""home-based"" businesses. The fantasy is epidemic on Main Street, as promoters ramp up this propaganda and few people entertain expectations any longer of government help, an economic boom or any other turn of fate that might benefit them. They still believe in the American Dream, though, and so the claims by multi-level marketing and other ""e-commerce"" schemes, that solemnly swear they are true standard bearers of the American Dream, seem plausible, their last, best, and perhaps only hope.Herbalife, as the FTC documented in gruesome detail, led millions of people to believe they could sustain themselves and even become wealthy selling its commodity weight loss shakes from home. The absurdity of this idea, on its face, was obscured by Herbalife's (and all other MLMs') additional offer of leveraging the recruiting chain. So, the ""business opportunity"" expanded from selling shakes to buying shakes as ""distributors"" and then gaining income, they hope, from an exponentially expanding base of more ""distributors."" Selling was quickly replaced by quota-purchasing and then relentless recruiting. But behind the pay-to-play trickery and underneath the delusion of the ""endless chain"" was the larger illusion of the ""home-based"" business as a viable safe haven.Shopify capitalizes on the same mass delusion. Supposedly 500,000 people currently own its e-commerce site services or its tools for operating a site. The package is sold as the alternative or a supplement to dead-end jobs, unemployment, or as a bulwark against a host of misfortunes lurking in the economy or said to be caused by government. What will they sell on the sites? How will customers find their little sites among the millions of others? What value do they add? How do they differentiate themselves or cover marketing costs? Why buy a personal website plan from a company that is generating a host of new competitors to your own site every day? Buyers are ""re-directed"" away from such common sense questions with testimonials by others who struck it rich, or by general rhetoric about the exploding volume of business now done ""online."" Better to get in now, and figure out details later.Herbalife and all other MLMs exploit the same general space with ""home-based"" business, equipped with online purchasing. The business is not only ""home-based"" but ""infinite"" in potential. How will you sell the shakes? Find customers? What about all the millions of competitors that Herbalife is generating with recruiting incentives? These concerns, like those raised by Shopify's offer, are overwhelmed by testimonials of wealth, admonitions that ""believing is seeing"" and by pseudo-economic claims about the benefits of ""self-employment.""Andrew Left is spot-on when he puts Herbalife and Shopify in the same camp for selling illusory, essentially non-existent income opportunities, which lead to massive churn rates and the specter of saturation, though he does not describe the common market space they share, perhaps because it might also raise questions about why he did not lend support to the Herbalife-exposure campaign?But after exploiting the same sad sector of mass delusion, fear and naiveté among millions of consumers, trying to make a living, Shopify and Herbalife take different routes. Andrew Left would seemingly have investors not notice the difference. First, Shopify is not ""multi-level marketing."" This is a massive distinction. MLM is unique in the business world, in a class all its own, the only business based on ""infinity"" and an internal money transfer in which ""wholesale"" is said to be ""retail."" The claims and charges against Herbalife are based not on its products or even its practices, but its business model. The flaws, and the resulting harm to participants are inherent. Herbalife is the picture of an unsustainable enterprise unless new territory can be found perpetually. Herbalife is running out of geography.Shopify does offer a lucrative referral program that has even attracted some hucksters previously working for Herbalife, but it is not based on the endless chain, promising ""infinite"" payments ""while you sleep."" The second key feature of MLM is the closed or rigged market, a term coined by English writer, David Brear. As the FTC confirmed, Herbalife did not offer a viable retail (external) profit opportunity. Its funds for rewarding ""distributors"" were coming from the ""distributors"" themselves, inside the ""chain."" Shopify's income stream and affiliate rewards do come partially from subscribers who might be regarded as ""members"" of a closed network, subject to high attrition rates. But referral payments offered by the company could not be compared to Herbalife's classic endless chain income offer, with recruiting as the only avenue for profit.In contrast, the majority of Shopify revenues comes from transaction fees and related purchases based on transactions. There is no way Shopify could exist with its clients just ""buying from themselves."" But, that is exactly the premise of Herbalife and all other MLMs. Set up your ""store"", buy your own inventory, consume it or give it away or maybe even sell some if you can, and then find others to do the same. Your own purchases are then magically called ""retail"" sales and qualify for possible ""unlimited"" recruiting-based reward, unrelated to retail sales. Unless recruits succeed in bringing in a long chain of new recruits, who would do the same, they will spend themselves into insolvency within a year, which is precisely the fate of nearly all that join MLMs.Between 2006 and 2013, the FTC deliberated and took public comment on a proposed new ""business opportunity rule"" said to cover all the companies selling ""business opportunities"" that weren't covered by the ""franchise rule."" Since the franchise rule had been adopted in 1979 (same year that a federal judge ""legalized"" Amway), solicitations for a new type of ""business opportunity"" began spreading rapidly across the country, called multi-level marketing. In 2006, when a new rule was opened for public comment, revenue gained by these MLM enterprises was now in the tens of billions and far more people were exposed to MLM financial solicitations than franchise pitches. The initial proposal made it perfectly clear that multi-level marketing was the main type of business the new rule would now cover. Indeed, the rule would have little point, if they weren't. Up to that time, MLMs were completely exempt from all disclosure rules based on charging an initial fee below $500, which triggered the franchise rule requirements. Many MLMs offer distributorships for $499.During the comment period, the FTC was barraged by letters, criticisms and pressures, orchestrated by the Direct Selling Association, whose members are MLMs such as Herbalife, Amway, Nu Skin and Usana. In the end, MLM, the most pervasive and largest purveyor of ""business opportunity"" solicitations on Main Street, was exempted! No type of company was ever outlawed or actually regulated by the rule, only ""disclosures"" were required.It is this ""rule"", gutted and barely known to anyone, that some are now saying the FTC will bring down like a hammer on Shopify. The main infraction that is cited is that the ""affiliates"" who are recruiting new subscribers and gaining Shopify's high-dollar referral rewards are not disclosing that they are getting compensated by Shopify. Perhaps this will attract the interest of the FTC. Maybe, maybe not. But unlike Herbalife's pay-to-play and recruiting-based deceptions on which revenue is existentially dependent, if Shopify is charged with this disclosure violation, it would appear to be fixable, without threatening the business model.The larger question is whether Shopify offers a ""business opportunity"" at all. For Herbalife, that is not in question. Herbalife sells its own branded but illusory ""opportunity."" Buyers become Herbalife distributors. The income that is promised is based entirely on buying and selling Herbalife goods, and getting others to do the same. Shopify sells a platform for operating an e-commerce business - any e-commerce business. Many other companies do this too. Most of Shopify's revenue is not coming from subscribers but from transaction fees, presumably generated by commerce on subscriber sites. In contrast, the FTC did not find evidence of significant retail transactions among Herbalife's army of ""home-based"" businesses.This is how the FTC itself describes coverage: The Business Opportunity Rule applies to commercial arrangements where a seller solicits a prospective buyer to enter into a new business, the prospective purchaser makes a required payment, and the seller - expressly or by implication - makes certain kinds of claims. Examples of what's covered by the Rule include work-at-home opportunities like envelope stuffing or craft assembly where the seller offers to buy back merchandise from the bizopp buyer. Also covered: opportunities where a seller says it will help the buyer set up or run the business - for example, by providing the buyer with customers, accounts, or locations to sell products or services.Could the FTC determine that Shopify is not just selling a service or tools for running an e-commerce site, but a proprietary ""business opportunity"", on par with an envelope selling scheme or ""craft assembly""? My own reading of the Biz Op rule is that it was not intended to cover a company like Shopify. True, Shopify leads people to think they will make money in e-commerce, but this is hardly a proprietary offer. The alleged benefits with testimonials of success in ""self-employment"", home-based business or online businesses are everywhere these days, with many promoters selling online tools, accounting software, courses in marketing, search engine optimization, product ideas, success-oriented attitude adjustment, and financing. Indeed, the FTC rule seems not only inappropriate for what Shopify does but after it exempted the MLM business opportunities that are sweeping the country, the Rule has no modern-day purpose of consequence. It seems written for another era, long passed.Apart from the merits of Left's claim that Shopify violates FTC rules in some way, and given his silence on the five-year exposure campaign waged against Herbalife, it is puzzling that he would urge investors to anticipate an imminent FTC prosecution of Shopify. The FTC has not acted against his other MLM targets, Nu Skin or Usana. In this FTC-based strategy Left is, in yet another way, making common cause with his colleague, Bill Ackman, who based his Herbalife investment on prompting a FTC prosecution. It took Ackman, who built his entire research and exposure thesis on the claim that Herbalife is an illegal pyramid scheme, two-years and many millions of dollars before a FTC investigation ensued. This was followed by two more years of FTC investigation and then the infamous settlement in which the FTC refused to call Herbalife a pyramid scheme. Today, the FTC, with only two commissioners at work, and with MLM-promoter and former MLM-owner, Donald Trump, also owner of the real estate ""business opportunity"" program, Trump University, as its boss, the FTC would seem even less likely to respond to a business opportunity fraud case. Meanwhile, former FTC Commissioners, including a former Chairman, are now on Herbalife's staff!At the end of his short-thesis presentation, Andrew Left raises the specter of his own dystopian vision for America, even worse than the one that recruiters for multi-level marketing promote: ""What If Citron is wrong on our assessment of Shopify, ""Left asks, ""and the future of this world is millions of people selling fidget spinners and we all become our own flea market?""It's a prophetic speculation. More than 15 million Americans, per year, already are buying into MLM's illusory ""distributorships."" Shopify says half a million currently own its e-commerce packages and sites, with some making a business out of selling the ""opportunity"" not just goods online. Factor in huge attrition rates annually and the picture emerges of America well on its way to Left's grim vision. What are they all selling? Anti-aging creams, protein powders, costume jewelry, energy drinks, herbal cures - fidget spinners? Or their own and others' used stuff - flea market? And whom are they selling to? Themselves? Each other?To gaze over the delusional and exploited landscape of MLM and Shopify, in which millions desperately seek refuge in ""home-based"" and ""e-commerce"" businesses, is to realize that there will still be one very lucrative business in this dire environment - short-selling."
4111888,28141,2017-10-05T12:46:37-04:00,Citron Research accuses Shopify of illegal business practices.Shopify is littered with red flags.Its time for the market to close the current 'GAAP' on Shopify's price inefficiency by accounting for net processing revenue VS gross processing revenue.,"Since May, my recommendation to short Shopify (SHOP) shares has been a bit painful. (stock went from $90 to $120) My research has focused on a bubbled valuation and criticism of executive management. In my articles, I stated that management was developing a reputation for misleading investors. Based on Citron’s research, it looks like they are misleading customers as well.Today, Citron released a video explaining that Shopify should be investigated by the FTC for unethical/illegal business practices.(FYI- Citron’s most recent success has been a Valeant short)Citron's suspicion comes with merit and should not be dismissed. Merchant growth has exploded and I question the quality of these new merchants. I have also seen many questionable FB/Instagram ads about selling using Shopify. I found his comments about Aliexpress (BABA) most riveting. Amazon's 3rd Party Seller network (I call it a SCHEME) opens the door to illegitimate businesses dumping cheap imports from overseas.(while putting real companies like Toys R Us out of business)This is just an extension of it. For example, look at this sketchy toy company selling toys on Amazon as a 3rd party seller, built on Shopify. This is obviously a shell company trying to look legitimate, god knows what are in those toy products. I reached out to them for CPC (Child Protection Certificate) information 2 weeks ago and still waiting for a response. I stand vindicated and steadfast to my short even without Citron’s discovery. If Shopify has done something wrong, I think this stock sinks lower than Citron’s $60 target, we could see as low as $30 per share in the next year.Notable red flagsIn red, I circled 2 interesting notes. The avg revenue per merchant is $1243 and 'anyone who wants to make more $ than what they pay for the site. Does this sound like sustainable long-term customers? It certainly makes Citrons accusation believable. According my research, a 50% share of the global retail merchant market (their core business) equals $3 BILLION not $58 billion.From here are in, Shopify will be under sharper scrutiny by analysts, investors, and now the FTC. Their CFO stepping down should have been a red-flag since the company and stock were going ‘gangbusters’. Why leave the party when it has just started? Unless of course, there is something not kosher beneath the surface. The detective in me doesn’t believe in coincidence.Shopify should lose 25%-35% of its current valuation based on this one simple truth and market inefficiency: They are overstating sales by recognizing gross transactions in their payment processing division. Not surprisingly, they are not disclosing net transaction sales like other players in payment processing, i.e. Square (SQ), who also records gross but discloses net revenue to investors in sec filings. This is a big reason why Shopify smelled sour to me. Shopify Estimated Sales in 2017*Adjusted Est 2017 Sales: Adjusts Merchant Solutions revenue by deducting the interchange fee that gets paid automatically. The interchange fee is 1.5% of the 2.7% credit card processing charge. Formula: (Gross Payment Processed: ~$11 billion) X (Net Transaction Fee: 1.20%) with Shopify Payments making up 83% of Merchant Solutions sales. Conclusion:The market should close the ‘gaap’ (no pun intended) on this price inefficiency, as it does with other comparable companies in the industry. (look up P/S or EV/S multiples on SQ,GPN,TSS) In light of the Citron accusation, Shopify should no longer get a pass.If the market acts efficient, SHOP could be trading as low as $77 shortly.

4113367,103764,2017-10-13T12:23:56-04:00,"Citron tries to call out 500K merchants as an unrealistic metric, when really it should be (and will be) MUCH more. Plenty of TAM to go.His attack on churn rates are fairly irrelevant, for each merchant that dies off, an army will take its place.Yes, affiliate marketing is a legitimate thing and it’s not to be confused for a ponzi scheme.You do know Amazon has an affiliate program right?Valuations take into consideration this other factor called growth, who knew!?","In Citron’s “research” Andrew Left is somehow mind boggled that Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) can claim 500,000 merchants on the platform. As if its universe isn't that big. If you know even a bit about this vertical, you'd know he's wrong from the get go. As the founder of a startup, I am familiar with how easy it can be to get carried away with your own TAM, and how investors can too, just as easily. Skepticism is warranted, because often enough, it is overestimated. So somewhere he figures this is a weak spot to begin his attack. However, in the case of Shopify, he's really just walked into a trap.Target them on competition, the threat of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), on shifting market dynamics, anything but TAM.The addressable merchant market for SMBs/micro-sellers looking for a platform enabling them to sell online is almost immeasurable. For a b2b SaaS, it is perhaps the largest TAM of any vertical.Let's look at just one of their competitors (more of an indirect competitor) in Magento, they claim 250K merchants Now take into consideration that Magento is far more enterprise-oriented, not as simple to setup and configure - you generally have to hire someone to manage it for your organization.Magento is just one example of those going after larger corporates, but there are dozens more. Here's roughly what that landscape looks like. It's safe to assume 1M plus medium to large merchants active today amongst the competition. What does that say for Shopify’s potential... how long is the long tail?Well it's not so hard to imagine, look no further than Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), which claims 1.8M active sellers; they might want independent sites too, and could very well turn to Shopify to do so.Simply put, Shopify’s current number of merchants is a drop in the bucket of what they could be doing – even post IPO, they’re really just getting started.Now, get a whiff of this... according to their 2016 annual report roughly 85% of merchants on Shopify were coming from North America, UK, and Australia. Those countries account for just 6% of the world’s population. If he thinks 500K is a vanity metric, imagine what they can achieve becoming more truly global. Remember the premise here, anyone with some motivation and an internet connection can affordably have an ecommerce store. We are talking about an addressable market in potentially the tens, and maybe up to 100 million?Better yet, let's get to the real elephant in the room – Instagram.Instagram has so drastically changed the landscape of online commerce and it’s gone largely undetected by not just Citron, but almost the entire market. Let me explain…After studying this very subject for well over a year, it boils down to something simple actually. There are two ways Instagram is used for commerce. The first way is that it's used as a channel to drive traffic to my ecommerce site (this is what happens in developed markets). The second way, is that it is my ecommerce site (and that's how it's used in emerging markets).Instagram has lowered the barrier of entry so low to open a “shop,” that there is virtually no barrier at all. In markets like South East Asia, Africa, and MENA – if you want to start selling, your first port of call is now Instagram. In the time you’ve spent reading just the first paragraph of this article, you could have opened an Instagram “shop.” It's used as a store front to add some photos of your products.How does one get orders? No problem… they just slide into the DM. Either that or on one of the chat apps that all the (billions) of kids are using these days. Just add your phone number and voila! Customers messaging you with a WhatsApp, Kik, Viber, Telegram or (insert preferred chat app for any particular market here) message. Click, tap, tap, click, and congrats, you’re now a seller.This is increasing the TAM for someone like a Shopify – Instagram is a factory creating newbie sellers with a growing appetite for more tools to help them sell. That’s the only problem with Instagram; they aren’t getting those tools to help them manage sales, no CRM, no order management, no payment and delivery automation. They’re left in a vacuum, they've gotten the taste of selling, and now someone like a Shopify can step in to help.As a disclosure, I am the founder of a startup that addresses Instagram seller problems. I watch this space very closely, hence why this Citron buffoonery caught my attention and why I’m compelled to chime in. We've built a platform that enables small merchants with chat commerce tools and helps social sellers in emerging markets. I can attest to how many of these merchants there are. Heck, my wife is one of them. We are trying to solve the same problems Shopify is, just from a different angle. I can see how big the opportunity is and how many merchants are still underserved globally.I don’t know if this makes me an expert exactly, but I’m sure I know a lot more than Andrew Left does on this subject. I must admit though, he is way ahead of me in the art of click-bait.Left keeps using the C word to induce panic. But let's be realistic, we're not talking about trying to sell software for golf courses here, where churn will make or break you... this is a different beast. I'm not saying churn doesn't matter. It likely will be higher than other SaaS's across most verticals. That's expected though - these customers often run a lifestyle businesses. One that they can walk away from as easily as they walked into. Although for as little as $10 per month, the opportunity cost of churning may actually be too high for me to abandon my shop. With rent that cheap, I wouldn't wanna let go of the lease.Let's assume however that there is high churn, does it really matter? For every seller that abandons ship, an army of new merchants will take its place.Ultimately, he clearly underestimates the potential and opportunity to enable the entrepreneurial endeavor for millions of people – and the significance of providing the tools needed to help them.In my mind, it's hard to rationalize how betting against this model at this juncture is anything but madness. Shopify has literally just scratched the surface.Now onto Citron's next stab in the dark.Citron begins their attack on the Shopify model by asking you to Google “Shopify Millionaire.”If those results surprise you, well then let’s Google ""Amazon Millionaire"" and see what comes back.Need I say more?If Shopify is a scam, then so is Amazon.Citron seems to take issue with affiliate marketing in general – putting it all in the naughty category. When really, it's a common practice amongst many mainstream internet-related businesses.It's simply a smart way to grow without headcount, and not every company knows how to do it. Really, for Shopify, it’s a cherry on top - a way to bring incrementally more merchants and controllable CAC.Juxtapose this with something like Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) or some multi-level marketing scheme, whose business model is built specifically around that premise.Using affiliates as a business development tactic is so enormously different than a company with DNA built in the shape of a pyramid. It's so BS to associate the two, but I suppose that achieves his desired effect. Left, you evil genius you.Let's say Left is right. The FTC is gonna come knocking on Shopify's door about all these marketing tactics. We saw what effect that had on a much more clearly controversial Herbalife. They got investigated how many times? Guess what? They're still worth roughly $7B - not exactly out of business.About one year ago, I became a Shopify affiliate myself, mainly to learn about how it works and to see if it made sense to refer customers who were specifically asking for an ecommerce site. I discovered the affiliate program initially by coincidence, just via navigating around Shopify's site, not from an ad somewhere (in fact, I’ve never really seen those types of ads myself) that Left showcases in his “report.”I receive the regular email newsletters from Shopify. Many examples of successful stores are cited and used as case studies. The language of the subject lines and email bodies are very occasionally about how a seller is earning millions and how they go about achieving that.Don't believe me? Here's an actual screenshot of my inbox...In my opinion, Shopify tows the line pretty responsibly, recognizing that at the heart of these entrepreneurs they want to make money and earn financial success, but also the freedom to be their own boss. But follow the trail of their comms - at the end of the day, a merchant learns that they will have to spend money on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook to get good at this, and otherwise take a very scientific approach to building up traffic and sales. Shopify is really just trying to get merchants to become and stay motivated to do that.Citroen’s valuation argument against Shopify falls flat on its faceAfter several pages of essentially preposterous allegations and zero business analysis, Citron attempts to provide a quick financial analysis of what Shopify’s stock is worth based on peer group multiples. Naturally, like everything else in the report, they paint a very misleading portrait.He uses this table to get to his $60 target.It's just missing one thing, the revenue growth rates of these comps!Now, I am not an expert investor let alone a seasoned short-seller, but even I know the most important driver of high multiple stocks is their top line growth rate.Why did Citron choose to overlook this important metric?Here's why:Shopify is growing their revenue at 2.2x the peer group average.Does that difference deserve a premium? Well, according to Citron, clearly not. In their “objective” analysis, the revenue growth rate of a business is completely irrelevant.A short-seller who makes his living putting out reports with sensationalized headlines criticizing anyone’s marketing practices is the definition of hypocrisy in my book. Andrew Left’s report titles and stock price targets all imply that you need to short (fill in the blank) the ticker, and get rich immediately. How many stocks does he write about that are the “most overpriced pieces of garbage” he has ever seen? How many are the next Enron? Going to zero? Total frauds and etc...?Why aren’t his reports titled “A detailed analysis of the fundamental business of xyz which we believe is an interesting short opportunity?” Obviously, because titles like that don’t grab headlines or cause enough hysteria to induce a swift arbitrage. This same individual somehow saying opening an online store to join the club of aspiring “someday millionaires” is illegal marketing?If Shopify stock is ahead of itself or overvalued, which could be, there is nothing substantive in Citron’s report that supports this conclusion. I assume if you are shorting a stock, you have a compelling case for why the growth story is going to slow, or you’ve uncovered a chink in the armor or a dying business model - and in Shopify’s case, that is not happening anytime soon. If they are an ""illegal get rich quick scheme,"" then so is the most-loved growth story of all time Amazon.com. There's only one real scheme he exposes in his report, is his own.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4111761,103149,2017-10-04T19:21:00-04:00,"Shopify is not a ""get rich quick scheme."" Shopify does not sell any products directly to the end consumer. The comparison to Herbalife is terrible.GMV is growing rapidly, indicating Shopify's business is real and is enabling e-commerce. People are becoming millionaires, but Shopify is not claiming everyone will be come a millionaire.Shopify's operating leverage needs time to be revealed. It is growing too fast for the results to be seen.In 3-5 years when the existing merchant base far outnumbers the new merchant additions, the operating leverage will be apparent.Citron uses valuation comps of companies growing at 2-3x slower than Shopify, it's no wonder they came to a price target of $60. Not a fair comparison.","Andrew Left from Citron Research posted a video and report on Shopify (SHOP) on Oct 4 2017, calling Shopify’s business a “Get Rich Quick Scheme.” This article will address and respond to his claims. We believe Shopify has a real business with real merchants generating real sales as seen in the rapid growth of the gross merchandise volume (i.e. all sales through the Shopify platform). Comparing Shopify to a pyramid scheme is a very poor comparison because Shopify doesn’t sell any products through its merchants. Not even through Oberlo. Shopify is an enabler of e-commerce, and Oberlo merely uses technology to connect merchants with suppliers. Shopify’s operating leverage has been masked in the last three years because it is growing rapidly and onboarding new businesses which overpowers the operating leverage from the existing merchant base. When half of your merchants are less than a year old, you can’t see the operating leverage.Citron uses the valuation multiples of companies that are growing at 2-3x slower than Shopify. It’s no wonder they came to a price target of $60. This is not a fair comparison. Finally, we believe there is a buying opportunity for long-term investors. We recommend waiting for the dust to settle and for the Citron Research to be widely distributed over the next day or so. We would be buyers of the dip. Our intrinsic value is US$104 per share.What is the real business behind Shopify?Shopify is an e-commerce platform for small- and medium-sized businesses. Shopify does not sell businesses, it does not sell products that reach the end consumer. Shopify is a middle man, an enabler.Unlike Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), which Citron compares it to, Shopify does not produce a product that is sold through a distribution network.How do we know that Shopify’s platform and services are effective? Citron says that Shopify has 2,500 Shopify Plus merchants and maybe 20,000 Shopify Advance merchants. This is probably in the right ball park. So who are the other 470,000-plus merchants?They are the small businesses trying to become bigger businesses. Many are new businesses that are less than a year old, given Shopify has acquired more than half of them in the last year.Just because most of Shopify’s merchant base are new businesses doesn’t mean Shopify’s platform is not working. We can measure the effectiveness of the platform by Shopify's GMV growth. Gross merchandise volume is the total sales of products transacted through Shopify’s platform by its merchants. GMV has been growing at an exponential rate. In 2016, GMV grew by $7.7 billion from 2015. And in 2Q17 it grew by $2.4 billion over 2Q16 (annualized growth of $9.6 billion year over year). The dollar growth of GMV continues to accelerate, indicating that the Shopify platform is working.Selling a product is not easy. Just being able to start a store online doesn’t guarantee success. But as growth in GMV continues, this is a measure of merchant success. You can’t argue with the numbers.Comparing FTC Claims Against Herbalife to ShopifyAccording to Citron, the FTC settlement with Herbalife “prohibits Herbalife from misrepresenting distributors’ potential or likely earnings. The order specifically prohibits Herbalife from claiming that members can 'quit their job' or otherwise enjoy a lavish lifestyle.”From what we’ve seen, Shopify is sharing stories of how others have found millionaire status through starting a store on Shopify. Shopify makes no promises of how much money you can or will make. Shopify, again, does not sell any products that end up in the end consumers hands. Shopify is merely an enabler of e-commerce. Even if you look at the Oberlo, dropshipping app, Oberlo is merely an enabler to streamline the product importing and order fulfillment from Aliexpress. Aliexpress is a marketplace of merchants/wholesalers in China, where each individual wholesaler fulfills their own merchandise. Oberlo does not handle any products, Oberlo does not make any products, Oberlo is merely an enabler to make it easier for Shopify stores to access products from Aliexpress.According to Citron, the FTC says, “opportunities where a seller says it will help the buyer set up or run the business – for example, by providing the buyer with customers, accounts, or locations to sell products or services."" Citron claims that Shopify is selling businesses. Shopify is not selling businesses, it is selling a platform for a business, it is providing that store front. The business owner still has a ton of work to do on their own, coming up with a product to sell, marketing the product effectively, fulfilling orders, handling customer service, and more. Shopify has apps and services to make these things easier, but by no means does opening a Shopify store guarantee any success and Shopify is not promising that success.Shopify is not selling businesses. Shopify is enabling businesses.The Partner Network – Affiliates Citron cites that Shopify has 13,000 partners with a few thousand of those being technology developers and the rest are bloggers, influencers and brands that promote the Shopify platform and make an affiliate fee. Citron claims they do not disclose their relationship about their compensation. However, if you follow the links on some of these “Shopify Millionaire” searches, these people are selling their own online courses of how to make an online e-commerce store. These are not direct affiliate marketing links. They may suggest you to use Shopify as your platform, but without buying their product and signing up with Shopify through them, they wouldn’t make an affiliate fee. While this may or may not be true in all cases, the ones cited by Citron are selling online courses.It is true that the FTC requires influencers and brands to clearly disclose their relationship when promoting a product, but in this case, these influencers are promoting their own product first and foremost.Unit Economics – Operating LeverageCitron shows that since 2015, sales and marketing expenses have been between 32%-35% of revenue, R&D has been 15%-16% of revenue, and G&A has been 8-10% of revenue. They claim there is no operating leverage. Two very important factors must be understood.1) The sales and marketing spent on a merchant today becomes zero for that merchant for the life time of that merchant. Shopify is in a merchant acquisition phase, where they are spending at a rapid pace in order to acquire new merchants for the long term. E-commerce platforms tend to be sticky, since if a business has its infrastructure on a platform it’s a hassle to switch to another platform. Given this stickiness, it is vital for Shopify to get these merchants to choose them first.2) The way businesses work is that in the first few years they struggle to find their niche. This means they don’t make a lot of money. This means the upside benefit to Shopify from its new merchants is going to be small in the early stages. These new merchants will be on the basic or regular plan for a while, probably not generating a lot of sales and therefore not providing a lot of merchant solutions revenue for Shopify. More than half of Shopify's merchant base are recently acquired. And every year for the last three years, this has been the case where half of their merchant base was new businesses.What does this mean for Shopify’s operating leverage?It means Shopify will likely not see operating leverage until the existing merchant base is substantially larger than the new merchant additions every year. We expect to see operating leverage to be unmasked in the next 3-5 years, in the meantime merchant growth continues to accelerate in the near term.ValuationCitron put at $60 price target on Shopify giving it a 8.5x sales multiple compared to SaaS comps like Workday (WDAY), Salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW). Citron also noted that Shopify isn’t even 100% SaaS revenue as half of its revenue is merchant solutions revenue at a lower margin. We think comparing Shopify to SaaS comps is not a fair comparison. Shopify is growing at a rate 2-3x faster than these three competitors, so why should Shopify trade at a comparable multiples. Secondly, the merchant solutions revenue is an upside benefit that should be viewed as a unique investment opportunity for investors. There are not many businesses that provide two very consistent and growing revenue streams. With Shopify you are getting a piece of the upside of the online shopping consumer trend, while also getting the SAAS revenue.ConclusionShopify is within shooting range of our intrinsic value of US$104 per share. We will let the dust settle and the influence of Citron’s research to loosen the weak hands over the next day or so before buying the dip.Click the “Track Comments” button, we typically answer questions with great detail that fall outside of the scope of this article.Author Recommended ArticlesShopify: Scarcity, 'Fear Of Missing Out' And CatalystsShopify Q2 Results: Revenue Mix Shifts Our ModelShopify In A RecessionShopify: 10-Year Revenue ForecastFollow us if you like our insight."
4112157,103262,2017-10-06T14:33:44-04:00,Shopfiy is not a pyramid scheme.Google searches can find anything.FTC has little bite if any.Shopify is not a get-rich scheme.The opportunity in e-commerce is still immense.,"Spotlight Top Pick Shopify (SHOP) stock has fallen nearly 20% in two days on the heels of toxic accusations from a well-known short seller, Andrew Left of Citron research. Rather than summarize Citron Research's short thesis, here it is, straight from Left's mouth in a seven-minute video:Before we move on to the accusations, let's first start with the bullish thesis -- that is, why Shopify stock has risen so sharply.Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2020 are pegged to grow from $2.3 trillion in 2017 to over $4 trillion by 2020. Here's the first chart from our friends at Statista:We can also focus on the United States, looking at the same data:In this case, we are looking at growth from $354 billion in 2017 to $459 billion by 2020.But the real gem here is that even in today's world, the share of commerce that is done online is still tiny, even in the United States.That chart comes to us from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. You're reading that right -- even in the U.S., we're still at less than 9% of retail sales done online. eMarketer projects that number rising from 8.7% today, to 14.6% in four years.While all of that seems huge -- and it is -- there is a dirty little secret about e-commerce that no one likes to talk about: being the platform for selling goods online doesn't make money.Yep, while the world marvels at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), its $120 billion (ish) in e-commerce revenue turns a smaller profit than its relatively small cloud computing (AWS) business. In fact, AWS is 1/10th the size of the Amazon's e-commerce, but generates more operating profit than that mountain of e-commerce.So, why do we even care about Shopify?Shopify isn't just an investment in e-commerce -- that would never make our Top Pick's list. It's an investment in the guts of the online shopping trend -- the part that's actually growing.Shopify is the leading cloud-based commerce software for small- and medium-sized businesses. But the company makes money from more than e-commerce sales, it makes money from businesses coming online. Remeber that chart from the Federal Reserve plotting e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales and how it is supposed to go from ~9% to ~15% -- that's what Shopify is after, the influx of new e-commerce businesses.As of the last earnings call, more than 500,000 businesses now rely on Shopify for their sales and back-office software needs. That's up from 325,000 in the third quarter and 243,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Here is the revenue trend:As an aside, Andrew Left never makes any claims that Shopify is fabricating financial results.We can also look at some snippets from the last earnings call -- and none of these facts are being questioned by Left:Now let's move to a discussion of the short-sellers bearish thesis. We start with the accusations. A lot of these are quite serious and toxic. Let's take them one at a time with objective data that will help you decide if you agree or disagree.1. Get Rich QuickLeft says Shopify has mastered ""the good old get-rich scheme"" and tells us to ""Google Shopify and millionaire."" He says, ""sure enough, we see about 27,000 results.""So, let's start here. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian was the first to take issue with this narrative, and here is what he wrote in a note to clients:Yet further sentiment from Baird addresses the reality that it takes a very specific type of Google search to find these results:You can Google almost anything to find a result, so this first attempt at uprooting evil appears to be off base, based on Baird's research.2. Pyramid SchemeAt minute 1:49, Left brings up Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) and that Shopify is a pyramid scheme and how an FTC settlement by Herbalife is proof that ""this will impact Shopify sooner rather than later.""If you zoom into the video, here is the headline that proves ""this will impact Shopify sooner rather than later.""Please don't get me wrong -- I am no supporter of Herbalife, but we can see that the settlement was for $200 million. Here is the link to the FTC's website for that settlement: ""Herbalife Will Restructure Its Multi-level Marketing Operations and Pay $200 Million For Consumer Redress to Settle FTC Charges."" Note that is was dated July 15, 2016.To put that $200 million into context, Herbalife has generated $4.4 billion in revenue in the last year and has a market cap above $6 billion. Let's turn to a stock return chart for Herbalife:Herbalife stock, when the FTC decision was rendered, rose 10% on the day, because the market was bracing for much worse -- the fact that it had so little bite was in fact a bullish push for the stock. But, with that FTC reality out of the story, this is the real problem -- the original claim is false. Shopify is not a pyramid scheme and any argument to the contrary is in error.Shopify is an e-commerce platform builder and ecosystem. In fact, Left says that at the start of the video. Furthermore, Shopify has created such a powerful ecosystem that it has now partnered with Amazon, eBay and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram.Moreover, it generates revenue from software as a service (SaaS), which is a fancy way of saying recurring software fees and as a payment provider. Many people felt that the ""Shopify Pay"" initiative was worth trying and likely would not gain traction, but it has.This is from the last earnings call: $2.2 billion of GMV in the quarter or 38% was processed on Shopify Payments. This compares with $1.3 billion or 38% in Q2 2016.For the record, this how Shopify describes Shopify Pay:Whether you believe in the short thesis as presented by Left or not, there is nowhere in this entire narrative where Shopify has built a business on a pyramid.3. Resignation LetterAt minute 2:10, Left says ""when you see what Shopify does it's to a level that you cannot even imagine."" He makes reference to the fact that Shopify has a page on its website on how to write a resignation letter.I found two posts on Shopify surrounding this subject. Here is the first, written on May 1, 2017: ""Ready to Become a Full-Time Entrepreneur? Here's How to Quit Your Job.""Since there is so much misinformation floating around, I'm not even going to copy and paste the article, I am just taking a screenshot for you to read:So, I won't comment here. You decide if that sounds toxic.Now, here is the other post that Left referred to:Again, I'll refrain from subjective analysis and let you decide how disturbing this is to you.4. Creating a BusinessAt minute 3:20, Left discusses some dubious opportunities that Shopify offers clients -- namely to buy goods from other vendors, like Alibaba (Ali Express), and then re-sell them in the U.S.for more. For those who aren't familiar with this practice, this is actually quite a popular approach and is most often used on Amazon.com.On June 15th of this year, Yahoo Finance actually published an article titled ""Think you're buying on Amazon? It's actually from Alibaba."" The article goes on to explain how people do this, with great regularity. Now, if the argument is that this is an odd business model or that it violates FTC rules if promoted by the reseller (like Amazon or Shopify), then he may have an argument -- I'm not a lawyer.When it comes down to it, Left's final proclamation on this is at minute 3:56: ""This is a business opportunity and this will require the same business opportunities disclosures that other have in this country."" That's true, but it doesn't feel like a bearish thesis to support a 50% stock drop.5. PartnersFinally, at minute 4:10, Left discusses Shopify's partners: ""On their last conference call I think they may have had 13,000 partners. And you might ask, who are these partners? Well a few thousand of them, maybe a thousand of them might be technology developers, but the rest of them are bloggers and influencers ... and are actually being paid by Shopify.""Left's issue here again is with FTC rules. He notes an FTC page where it reads that ""FTC Staff reminds Influencers and Brands to Clearly Disclose Relationship."" If you go to that post it is, in fact, as the title alludes to, ""a reminder."" It's primarily focused on social media stars:It's definitely possible that this is happening at Shopify, and if so the influencers are already or will need to soon disclose that relationship. This FTC note was written on April 19, 2017. Let's look at what's at stake here.If what Left is revealing is true, this is not a false business -- it's simply noting a requirement of a disclaimer. Something to the effect of: ""The author of this post was compensated by Shopify for this content.""I don't exactly know what the right wording is as, after all, it's legalese. But the accusation is that blog posts don't have this notification, not that using influencers is somehow illegal. The very basis of worldwide advertising rests on influencers (read: celebrities). Again, this really started with influencers on social media, say someone showcasing a beauty product while getting compensated by the brand. The FTC ""reminded"" everyone involved that a disclaimer was required (""I'm going to show you this new great face wash, and I want everyone to know that [fill in brand name] has compensated me for this review."").So those are Left's statements. Again, you can watch the whole seven-minute video above.We can't say what will happen with these new acquisitions from Citron Research. I think it's fair to assume we will soon see a headline in the news that reads something like: ""FTC Investigates Business Practices at Shopify,"" or something along those lines. So, be prepared for that.Generally speaking, we maintain our Spotlight Top Pick status on Shopify. But we should note that while Left was wildly wrong on many shorts, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), he is famously right for his call on Valeant Pharma (VRX). He does have an odd tendency to pick stocks that are at all-time highs to short.As always, control risk, size appropriately and use your own judgement -- aside from anyone else's subjective views, including my own.

4108901,70365,2017-09-22T15:55:52-04:00,"Shopify is a rapidly expanding cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform business.However, a closer look at the company's valuation reveals that it is currently incredibly overpriced.Equity dilution is gaining momentum and price-to-sales ratio is skyrocketing.Clearly, this is not sustainable and therefore investors should not expect the current rally to continue indefinitely.","Even though I typically try to avoid taking a closer look at companies with no earnings and negative free cash flow, Shopify (SHOP) broke my rule as it has experienced a remarkable revenue growth which appears not to slow down anytime soon. Over the years, I learned to value such companies as earnings and cash flows are something that can come later if a company's concept is accepted. This also looks like Shopify's case, but I found a few warning signs. According to Reuters financial highlights, Shopify's annual sales growth over the past 3 years has reached a rate of almost 98 percent, which confirms that the business has met the first condition of a successful story. As Dr. Andrew Stotz, CFA, puts it, revenue growth is a ""proof of concept"", or in other words, proof that the market wants your product. If a company moves its products or services up through the value chain, it can afford to raise prices. Generally, the longer the track record of revenue growth, the more the business model is economically durable and innovative enough to keep up with the pace of the changing world. Undoubtedly, one of the most critical issues Shopify's shareholders are facing is constant stock dilution. Over the last two years, the number of shares outstanding has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 20 percent. This represents an acceleration against the first year after IPO when the number of shares outstanding increased roughly by 10 percent. At present, Shopify has almost 98.6 million shares outstanding. From an investor's perspective, another critical issue that needs to be addressed is its exceptionally high and still rising price-to-sales ratio. Over the last year, Shopify's trailing-twelve-month price-to-sales has increased from levels under 12x to the current multiple of more than 21x. In other words, the company is now trading at almost two times the extraordinarily high price-to-sales multiple at which it traded one year ago. Clearly, such expansion is unprecedented and unsustainable in the long run.Using the revenue variation of popular Peter Lynch's earnings line for the projection of intrinsic per share values of the company, I see Shopify's upside potential as very limited. According to my model, assuming 90 percent annual revenue growth, 20 percent annual growth in the number of shares outstanding and an unchanged current trailing 12-month price-sales (P/S) ratio of 22x, the company's intrinsic value by the end of 2020 could reach $602. This is however a very unlikely scenario as most similar revenue fast-growing companies trade at P/S ratio of maximally 6x (- Tesla; Domino's Pizza 3.7x; Amazon 3.2x). Therefore, under a more realistic assumption of roughly 5x P/S multiple, the company's upside potential seems to be almost fully exhausted as demonstrated in the valuation output below. To sum everything up, I see Shopify as an overly expensive business. At the current revenue growth rate, any additional share price rise is hard to justify. If the stock continues to rally, it will be at extraordinarily high price-to-sales multiple, which is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run. Clearly, Shopify is an amazing business, but most of its upside in terms of share price is presumably exhausted. Should the market price stretches above the orange line of my valuation PS Multiple valuation output, I am ready to initiate a short position.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion and do not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

4109235,103616,2017-09-25T12:32:42-04:00,"Shopify has experienced exceptional subscription and revenue growth.Shopify only has 500,000 merchants, of the estimated 47 million small business owners in their target market.Shopify has gone on an exceptionally bullish run in 2017. I would consider buying on a pullback at about $105.Shopify is in 175 countries and has partnerships with Amazon, Visa, Facebook, GE and Red Bull.","This article will be a total diversion from my usual coverage of high dividend yielding financials, utilities and telecommunications. Shopify is a speculative technology company that does not pay a dividend, has a negative EPS and has a Price/Sales ratio of 20. However, I have closely observed this stock and further considered entering a position into it. If you would like more coverage on growth stocks please let me know. Feedback is always appreciated. I believe that over the next 3 years Shopify will greatly appreciate in value for the following reasons. Firstly, Shopify has seen some remarkable subscriber growth that has helped surge the stock higher. Shopify is now in over 175 countries, has 500,000 merchants and merchant growth YoY of 56% and 82% in North America and Asia respectively. Secondly, Shopify has seen remarkable revenue growth with revenues between 2015 (IPO year) and 2016 increasing by 189%. Finally, Shopify has yet to fully penetrate the small-medium sized business market which they estimate to be 47 million in the markets they serve. This would mean that Shopify is hypothetically, only penetrating about 1% of its target market. Shopify is a cloud based ""e-commerce solution in a box."" They offer small and medium-sized businesses, a complete package of services for starting an e-commerce website. These services let users build a website, manage products and inventory, process payments, ship orders and manage customers. They have a variety of plans starting at $29/month and ranging to $2000/month for large companies. They also allow users to buy additional add-on's from third party providers for additional fees. The business model is simple; appeal to entrepreneurs who want to start their own business and offer them an all in one solution to manage that business for a monthly fee. As the business grows, they expand their capabilities and thus their spending on Shopify's platform.Shopify can be broken into 2 distinct segments: Merchant Solutions, categorized as a success-based component and Subscription Solutions, which is the monthly fee Shopify collects from users. A key idea behind Shopify's business model is being able to up-sell merchants who start at the $29/month plan to more expensive plans with more capabilities. A key metric Shopify uses to measure subscription success is Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). This is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants who have subscription plans by the average monthly subscription plan. As seen below, MRR has grown significantly YoY, due to subscriber growth and the acquisition of Shopify Plus clients ($2000/month) such as GE (GE), Nestle, and Red Bull ($5.5 billion in 2014 sales).2017: 500,000 * x = 23,660 (in thousands)x = Average customer spends $47.32 / month Shopify Plus contributed to 18% of MRR in Q2 2017 versus 13% Q2 of 2016. Subscription services accounted for 47.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 of total revenues versus 51.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. In addition to the monthly fee, Shopify gains payment through the sale of themes, third-party apps and the registration of domain names. Shopify has over 13,000 developers who have published over 1,800 apps in the Shopify App Store with over 7 million installs to date. Merchant revenue is generated from a percentage (varies depending on plan) fee taken off all purchases. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) for the second quarter was $5.8 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 74% over the second quarter of 2016. Revenues from merchant solutions is directly correlated to the amount of payments being processed. That is why merchant solutions revenues increased from $77.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $145.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017, representing an increase of 88.8%. Merchant solutions revenue has now surpassed subscription revenue representing 52.1% of revenue. Shopify has invested heavily in mobile payment processing, which has now reached 72% of traffic. Shopify users can now accept mobile payments using Shopify Pay, Apple Pay, and other mobile wallets. This will help improve merchants’ ability to accept payments and contribute to strong GMV. So why am I recommending such an absurd company? Let's be clear. Shopify is not for the faint of heart. Any remote market correction or revenue/subscriber decline would be catastrophic for the stock price, as major success is already being priced into the stock. Subscriber growth has taken off since last year. Merchant growth in Q2 year over year was global, with a 56% increase in North America, 82% increase in Asia, 168% increase in South America, and 70% increase in Africa. Since 2012, the number of merchants on the Shopify's platform has grown annually at an average rate of 74%, and these merchants have achieved over $40 billion dollars in sales. Additionally, since December 31, 2015 Shopify has grown its merchants from 243,000 to 500,000 today.Revenues have been increasing quite dramatically as well. Revenues are projected in the range of $642 million to $648 million for 2017, which would represent a 65% revenue growth YoY. It is growth such as this that helps project this stock higher and higher. Shopify as mentioned earlier is yet to be profitable but is projected to be profitable by the end of 2017. Although concerning at first, Shopify is doing what most tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) did at this stage. They focus on revenue and customer growth and worry about profitability later, in an effort to monopolize the market. This strategy seems to be working with exceptional revenue and merchant growth supporting exceptional stock returns for Shopify. FB Net Income (TTM) data by YChartsShopify's operating expenses are as follows:As you can see, Sales and Marketing Expenses and Research and Development has almost doubled YoY. These expenses are costs associated with helping Shopify become a dominant player in the e-commerce enabling business. At any point, they could scale back these expenses and begin to become profitable, although I wouldn't recommend it. I would encourage these expenses because the dollars spent on these expenses seem to be yielding much more in revenue. SHOP data by YChartsIn fact, Shopify is essentially spending all its gross profit on marketing and research. So, despite the lack of profitability, the key metrics investors should worry about are revenue, number of merchants and GMV. I am confident that if these metrics continue to grow, which current projections support, the stock will continue to appreciate. In addition, if unavoidable expenses such as administrative and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) remain stable, I like the prospects of Shopify as a long-term play. One of the reasons I like Shopify as a business is because the sector they are dominating is growing significantly. The National Retail Federation estimates e-commerce growth of 8-12% US in 2017. As more e-commerce businesses enter the market, you can only expect that merchant growth continues to be strong. Entrepreneurship is on the rise as well, with nearly 14% of people starting or running new businesses. As these trends continue, more people will enter the target market that Shopify is yet to fully encapsulate. Shopify has 500,000 merchants of a market which they estimate to be 47 million. This would mean that Shopify is only hypothetically penetrating about 1% of its growing target market. Realistically, not all 47 million small-business owners need Shopify but more and more businesses are converting to e-commerce businesses, a favorable trend for Shopify. This gives Shopify huge potential as there is no foreseeable ceiling for them to reach. In addition, Shopify's prevalence has led to Amazon and eBay (EBAY) dropping competing products, named Webstore and Mangento Go. In 2015 Amazon went on to partner with Shopify to allow users to migrate their Webstore data over to them. Shopify surged 8% on this news. Another reason I like Shopify is because it is beginning to develop the network effect for its business. The network effect is the value created when a large amount of people use something. For example, Facebook's value is created by the fact that nearly everyone uses it. Similarly, Shopify has begun to create a network effect with its third-party app developments. As mentioned earlier, Shopify has over 13,000 developers who have published over 1,800 apps in the Shopify App Store with over 7 million installs to date. Although anyone could replicate Shopify and offer a similar product to Shopify, their exclusive partnerships with Apple Pay, Ebay, Buzzfeed, Amazon and Facebook as well as its expanding collection of third party apps is adding value to merchants. For this reason, I see Shopify beginning to separate itself from other start ups to a dominant force in e-commerce enabling space. SHOP data by YChartsAs you can see, Shopify's bullish run from its IPO has not been unsupported. Despite a lack in profitability, Shopify continues to increase its revenues substantially, which has supported the stock in its increase. Risk adjusted CAGR: 60.28%CAGR: 130.49%CAGR = (end price / beg price)^(1/timeframe)Risk adjusted CAGR = [(end price / beg price)^(1/timeframe)] * (1 - Standard deviation)From a technical prospective, I am waiting for a pullback to the 50 day MA or the support established at about the $105 level. The Relative Strength index (purple) is quite over extended at about 70 and the MACD looks like it may be on the verge of a crossover. I would look for a bearish move if the MACD crosses over this week. Long term, the stock is exhibiting bullish signs, with corrections being very short and shallow. Over the next 3 years I would watch for this stock to increase substantially. Today, MorningStar gives Shopify a quantitative value of $97, but it is also noted that this value is highly speculative. The largest risk for any investor is that Shopify does not post revenue or merchant growth that the market was expecting. As mentioned earlier, major success has been priced into this stock, which I why I would only buy on a pullback. This creates significant risk because in the event that Shopify misses revenue or merchant growth projections, the market will correct it’s future estimates for the stock swiftly. Shopify reports earnings on October 31, 2017. Additionally, any market correction would create selling pressure for Shopify because investors are more likely to sell their riskiest assets first. Shopify is not profitable, has a price/sales ratio of 20, has no dividend, is extremely volatile and susceptible to a major correction if it misses revenue or merchant growth. Despite this, Shopify is a buy on a pullback because I believe the business model is sound, profitability can come later once they grow exponentially, their business developments will yield more revenue, they are successfully creating a network effect around their business and technically, the stock is in a long term bullish run. For these reasons, I strongly believe in purchasing Shopify at the right price. Price to buy: $105"
4107641,47391,2017-09-18T10:39:10-04:00,Shopify enjoys blistering growth.Shopify is on the cusp of profitability.But Shopify valuation is extreme.Investors have had a good ride. It is time to take some profits.,"There is little doubt Shopify (SHOP) is a great company. The question is whether it is good value at today's stock price. That is a more difficult question to answer.Shopify revenues seem likely to beat $600 million this year and growth should better 40 to 50% at annual rate for a few years yet. Expenses are rising as well putting the company at a break even level more or less. How do you value a fast growing company that is on the cusp of profitability? With caution, in my view.A reasonable way to value rapid growth in the technology space is to use a multiple of sales. The number of very successful technology based companies that took years to turn in a profit of any magnitude is legion. Notwithstanding, investors will buy into a story that has a robust underpinning even if that means a long wait before multiples of net income or free cash flow make any sense.I think the best valuation of Shopify will come from comparison with other technology companies who have followed or are following a somewhat similar course of growth. In the ecommerce space, the comparables I suggest are Go Daddy (GDDY), Salesforce.com (CRM), and, Amazon.com (AMZN). All three are growing quickly; all three have grown quickly with little in the way of profits; and, all three comprise stalwarts in the ecommerce space. Of the three, Go Daddy is the most comparable to Shopify in that like Shopify, Go Daddy facilitates online commerce for third parties including most elements of on-line commerce management.Source: Yahoo.com financeShopify is a young company with a strong ecommerce platform and is turning in impressive growth figures. Growth at 40% or more is difficult to sustain for any long period of time and it is unreasonable to believe that torrid pace will persist for more than few years. In my view, investors should expect Shopify growth to ameliorate to the mid-20% annual rate within the next five years. By that time, the company will be a $2 to $2.5 billion annual sales company and, in my opinion, will enjoy a price to sales multiple of 4 to 5 times, putting a market value on the company of $8 to $13 billion.The market already values Shopify at $12 billion. That valuation carries very high execution risk. I like the company and see real value in its comprehensive set of ecommerce applications and tools. Having said that, I would take some money off the table.It is worth noting that in Shopify's public offering, the owners priced the company at a small fraction of its current market value and did so only a bit more than two years ago. Investors have done well and seen their stock rise eight-fold since issue despite suffering over 90% dilution based on the offering price. At the time of the IPO, it is reasonable to infer that management viewed the offering price as ""fair value"" and have done a very good job executing the plan they laid out for investors. But there is little reason to believe that management underestimated the potential for the company such a short time ago, and less reason to believe that the current value is sustainable.Shopify is a market favorite and I don't see a lot of risk that the stock price will collapse if the company continues to perform, and I think it will. The risk to investors today is simply that they are unlikely to earn a return commensurate with the risk in the stock.I rate the stock a ""hold"". Momentum seems strong and barring a disappointing quarter, the stock is more likely to rise short term than to fall. But, over time, value will merge with stock price and investors should expect only modest returns from today's elevated price."

The stock is now up more than 135% year-to-date. That makes it one of the best performing stocks in the market this year. Despite the huge run higher, we remain bullish on SHOP's upside potential even from these elevated levels. The SHOP growth story increasingly reminds us of the Amazon (AMZN) growth story in that both are hyper revenue growth companies with the ability to scale profits rather quickly. They are also both relatively pure plays on the secular growth in e-commerce and cloud adoption. From this standpoint, we continue to like SHOP stock and believe it is a must-hold in today's e-commerce and cloud dominated world.SHOP data by YChartsSHOP is a secular growth story. There really isn't any other way of looking at this stock. Revenues grew 112% in 2013, 109% in 2014, 95% in 2015, 90% in 2016, and were up 75% in 2Q17. GMV grew 128% in 2013, 133% in 2014, 105% in 2015, 99% in 2016, and was up 74% in 2Q17. Yes, there is some slowdown in the growth rates, but it's a natural and gradual comedown due to the law of large numbers. It's actually quite impressive that revenue and GMV growth has remained largely above 75% for 5 years. These large growth rates are here to stay into the foreseeable future because SHOP is a pure play on two very strong secular growth trends in e-commerce and cloud adoption. Technology is giving retail a face-lift. Before, consumers bought everything in stores and through catalogs. Now, consumers are faced with shopping decisions in multiple avenues. Almost every retailer also has an online store, brands are starting to sell through social media platforms like Instagram (FB), online marketplaces like eBay (EBAY) and Amazon have grown in popularity, and mobile-based app commerce is also quickly rising in popularity (think JackThreads or Houzz).With all these new avenues to sell products through, retailers are re-thinking their sales strategy. They need to create a robust, omnichannel commerce presence which caters to the rapidly evolving demands of the consumer. Enter Shopify, which allows retailers to do that by tying in all these distinct points of sale and connecting them through the cloud. It's one solution across multiple commerce avenues. This trend is just getting started, and SHOP has a very, very bright future as the e-commerce trend accelerates. The company makes a good portion of its money through its subscription model, which translates into consistent monthly recurring revenue. The company's monthly recurring revenue has grown at an 80% CAGR since 2012. That gives the company's topline a level of stability non-subscription businesses do not have.Meanwhile, gross profits are scaling with the business (+83% in Q2 versus revenue growth of 75%) and the operating expense rate is dropping rapidly as revenues explode higher (84% opex rate in 2012 to 57% in 2016). All in all, big revenue growth plus steady gross margins plus falling opex rates equals big bottom-line growth. Despite this, the bears continue to come back to valuation when it comes to SHOP. Yes, the stock trades at 670x next year's consensus earnings estimate, but this is an Amazon-like growth story where robust revenue growth today will drive margin expansion and robust earnings growth tomorrow. The long-term result will be a higher stock on a lower multiple.Investors should remember that there was a time when AMZN stock traded north of 700x trailing earnings. As it turns out, that was an incredible buying opportunity. Revenue scale eventually resulted in huge profitability gains, and the forward multiple compressed dramatically. The stock now sits markedly above where it was when it was a 700x P/E multiple stock. The P/E multiple, though, has compressed to about 190x today.AMZN data by YChartsThat's called growing into a valuation, and its exactly what SHOP will do. Secular tailwinds in e-commerce will continue to drive huge topline growth for SHOP. Gross profits will scale with the business, while the huge revenue gains will naturally drive significant operating leverage. Net losses will turn into net profits, and those net profits will swell as the business scales. All in all, SHOP stock will head significantly higher. We own this name for the long-term."

This article will highlight some keys from the quarterly results we found useful in our investment process.In short, the quarterly results were very good. Slightly below our expectations in some areas, but well above in others and far better than their guidance. Some interesting dynamics shifted the revenue mix in our model, accelerating the time to cash flow breakeven (less: share based compensation), and driving a $16/share increase in our fair value.Shopify enables commerce with a cloud-based, multi-channel platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses. Merchants can use the software to design, set up, and manage their stores across multiple sales channels, including the web, mobile, social media, marketplaces, and physical retail locations.Check out our Shopify: 10-Year Revenue Forecast if you need a deep dive.Overall this is another beat-and-raise by Shopify. They beat the top end of their 2Q17 guidance by 5% on revenue and $2 million less operating loss. 2017 revenue guidance was raised by 2-3%. The full year 2017 and 3Q17 guidance implies Shopify will reach positive adjusted operating income in 4Q17 between $0.2 million and $2.2 million.2Q17 - The weak GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) growth was offset by better than expected net new merchant additions contributing to an acceleration in MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue). This acceleration in higher margin subscription revenue impacts our model significantly. We go into detail below.(=) Revenue of $151.7 million vs SMRE: $154 million vs SHOP: $144 million(=) Operating loss of -$15.9 million vs SMRE: -$11 million vs SHOP: -$18 million(-) GMV of $5.8 billion vs SMRE: $6.2 billion vs 1Q17: $4.8 billion, 2Q16: $3.4 billion(=) GPV (Gross Payments Volume) of $2.2 billion vs SMRE: $2.3 billion vs 1Q17: $1.8 billion(+) MRR of $23.7 million vs SMRE: $22.8 million vs 1Q17: $20.7 million, +15% q/q(+) 500,000 merchants vs SMRE: 465,000.

Typically, Shopify has underestimated their full-year revenue. We would expect our forecast to at least be fulfilled despite the gap between guidance and our forecast.(=) Revenue of $642 million to $648 million vs SMRE: $659 million vs SHOP: $630 million(=) Operating loss of -$62 million to -$66 million vs SMRE: -$56 million vs SHOP: $-69 million3Q17 Guidance – In the last four quarters, Shopify has beaten the high end of quarterly guidance by an average of 5.4%.

Similarly to our 3Q commentary, we believe Shopify can beat guidance by 3-5%, putting our forecast in the range of possibilities. (-/=) Revenue of $199 million to $203 million vs SMRE: $209 million(=) Operating loss of -$15.5 million to -$17.5 million vs SMRE: -$16 millionWhat Shopify didn’t talk aboutShopify acquired Oberlo on April 28, 2017, for $15.7 million (net of cash acquired). Oberlo is a Shopify app which facilitates product sourcing and dropshipping. Oberlo is a five-star rated app with over 1,000 reviews on Shopify’s App Store.Making a product and then selling it is tough. Many new entrepreneurs start off selling other companies products. Dropshipping is one of the easier ways to start and a primary reason people choose e-commerce to start a business. With dropshipping, the store owner doesn’t take inventory, but rather finds the customer and gets the wholesaler or manufacturer to directly deliver the product to the end customer.With Shopify taking Oberlo in-house, we expect them to continue integrating new sources for merchants to dropship products from, but more importantly, they now have full control over a service that drives new merchants to the platform.With net new merchant additions topping 500,000 this quarter, we believe the acquisition of Oberlo will only help drive further acceleration in net new merchants.Nothing really new here. Shopify now has nearly $1 billion in cash to grow the business organically and through acquisitions. On the earnings call, they mentioned they will likely continue to make tuck-in acquisitions but now have the ability to contemplate bigger deals if they become available.MRR increased by 15% in 2Q17 over 1Q17, while net new merchants increased by 25%. This is an example of the quality of Shopify’s existing merchant base versus the new merchants joining the platform. We are not saying there are low-quality merchants joining Shopify. But we will take note and attribute this difference to the quality you would expect of a merchant that has endured and built a stronger business over several years versus a new merchant that has only spent less than three months in business. The more established business will have more traffic and require a more expensive subscription service than a new business.This also leads to the potential for organic growth from upgrades as today’s new merchants become tomorrow's established merchants.Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $23.7 million at the end of 2Q17, an increase from $20.7 million at the end of 1Q17. This $3 million increase compares to our forecast which was expecting a $2.1 million increase. This is a 40%-plus faster acceleration of growth. The impact to our model is substantial.Our forecast for Subscription Solutions revenue in 2017 increases slightly from $292 million to $300 million. While the 2026 (10-year forecast) subscription revenue increases from $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. This slight increase in high margin (75%-80%+ gross margin) revenue gives a boost to profitability and cash flow.Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) was $5.8 billion in 2Q17. We had forecast $6.2 billion. This shortfall implies the acceleration of growth we saw in 1Q declined slightly in 2Q. If Shopify consistently remains at this lower acceleration of growth our Merchant Solutions revenue forecast comes down.For 2017 we forecast GMV of $26.6 billion down from $27 billion. And 2026 (10-year forecast) GMV of $288 billion down from $311 billion.Our forecast for Merchant Solutions revenue in 2017 decreases to $362 million from $367 million. While 2026 (10-year forecast) merchant revenue decreases from $5.5 billion to $5.2 billion.On the bottom line, a dollar of Subscription Solutions revenue is worth about twice as much as a dollar of Merchant Solutions revenue. So the net difference is a win for Shopify despite the revenue offset in our model.This improvement in revenue mix also drives faster free cash flow breakeven (less: share based compensation). Previously our model forecasted FCF breakeven in 2021, but now it suggests we could see that breakeven point in 2020.With these changes, our fair value based on a 10-year DCF model increases to US$106/share from US$90/share. Recall we use a 10% discount rate and 3% terminal growth rate after the 10-year forecast period.We are long-term shareholders of Shopify. The mix shift in the revenue implies subscription revenue could grow quicker than we had previously forecast. The high margin subscription revenue shifts our model into a higher gear, bringing our fair value to US$106/share.

4107748,24761,2017-09-18T16:39:11-04:00,"Company might never turn to profitability due to challenges facing its subscription solutions.Its drop shipping and importing system Oberlo targets Chinese companies with slow delivery time and often poor quality products.Marketing expenses have almost doubled year-over-year to battle an increasing turnover ""churn"" rate as the company focuses more on finding new merchants than retaining existing ones.Consumers can go directly to the supplier on AliExpress and purchase the item for less.Out of more than 1,400-plus application such as Hurrify, AliReviews, Modalyst and others, add-ons tend to increase monthly subscription costs without yielding expected conversion rates for most merchants.","While the stock has been on a bullish uptrend for the last year gaining a whopping 180%, my confidence in the company primarily stemmed from its sound balance sheet with relatively low debt levels, coupled with moderate to high growth expectations.However, for the past three months I incrementally gravitated from being bullish on Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) to strongly bearish, as some of the operational challenges which financial analysts cannot comprehend by just listening to Management Discussion & Analysis on conference calls became clear to me. Here are the primary reasons:While the company is boasting in doubling its Gross Merchandise Value from $7.7 bln. in 2015 to $15.4 bln. at the end of 2016, as well as adding over 377,000 merchants across the world, its bread and butter still remain to be Subscription Solutions and Merchant Solutions. While both revenue streams are equally important as they compose 52% and 48%, respectively, for the sake of keeping this article as short as humanly possible, let us focus on the bread (Subscription Solutions) and leave the butter aside for now.Shopify's subscribers are typically novice millennial entrepreneurs ages 21-35, opening similar niche type stores and selling the exact same products from AliExpress through the Oberlo importing system, hoping to strike it big with finding one or two products that may go viral like Fidget Spinners. And when the fad goes away or becomes saturated, they move to another product or open an entirely new store with the ease of Shopify's platform, upon which Shopify makes an extra $30-$50 a month until subscriber cancellation. Shopify expects this trial and phase to continue for many months as the motivated entrepreneur spends heavily on advertising, hoping one home run product will recoup all the prior losses.Aspiring entrepreneurs or SMBs usually bombard Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) feeds with similar advertisements by spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on influencers to promote their products. The name of the game is to mark up the price and offer ""free shipping"" incentives to lure customers, but for the transaction to make financial sense, overall markup should cover shipping costs, Shopify's payments percentage, as well as third party marketing fees for Facebook, Instagram influencer, or any other sales channel. Since each beginner needs 4-6 months to realize whether their store will start gaining ground and possibly be successful (through series of trial and errors between niche marketing or traditional store methods), this translates in ever increasing revenue for Shopify, at least for the short term.Revenue is not sustainable if the merchant cancels their subscriptions after losing hope within several months of dwindling sales, which is usually the case.In the 2016 Annual Report, Shopify management stated the following:Those ""other risks"" mentioned in the first sentence of the paragraph could be open to interpretation and is more prevalent than the company admits. New merchants often see an immediate drop in return business when the consumer is not happy with the quality of the product in comparison to the advertised image, which is sometimes the case with drop-shipping from China. The average consumer is also not pleased with waiting 15-20 days for a product to arrive from overseas with the ""e-Packet"" feature that costs an extra $1-$3. Expedited DHL shipping costs will hardly work on select products and greatly reduce net profit margins.While Shopify fails to comment in depth on merchant cancellations, it would be virtually impossible for the company to maintain and increase its subscription revenue levels without increasing its marketing expenditures to attract new amateur entrepreneurs. Management was indeed clear on this very issue in the annual report:As a potential long-term investor, the inability of a company ever attaining profitability is quite alarming to me, especially when Shopify is currently trading at $122 a share without a positive P/E ratio.Why would an investor pay X amount of dollars for every zero dollar of earnings now or in the future if there are no EPS growth expectations? Why wouldn't a shareholder seek growth elsewhere, when the company showed a $83.2 mln. deficit as of Dec. 31, 2016, and already $110.8 mln. as of June 30, 2017.The stock price is way overextended as equity firms are riding the phase of online shopping craze of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and moving money from falling stock prices of traditional retailers such as Sears Holdings (SHLD), Macy's (NYSE:M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) to Shopify stock without grasping the intricacies that affects subscription solutions turnover.As you can see in the chart below Shopify spends heavily on social media marketing to target new merchants vs. retaining existing ones.This is a situation where I would prefer the company to increase its debt levels and operate more efficiently rather than live with a parallel correlation between revenue and marketing expenditures.On the contrary, Shopify completed another public offering in Aug. 2016 of 8,625,000 Class A voting shares with aggregate net proceeds of $224 million to strengthen its balance sheet and provide flexibility to fund its growth strategies.Advertised Price vs. Real PriceWhile a Basic Shopify plan should not break the bank as it costs less than a tank of gas, the app add-ons such as Hurrify, AliReviews and others quickly push the basic monthly plan to $50, if not more. Add-ons such as Modalyst will increase the plan to $75 a month excluding any other apps that a new merchant will need to make a sale. And if you choose to put your store in a sleep mode, it will still cost you $14 a month.Application Add-Ons Have Room for ImprovementHurrify ($6.99 a month) is a countdown timer app with a fake ""left in stock"" number used to manipulate a sale and create a sense of urgency. A merchant enters any number of products left in stock, which absolutely has no connection to the supplier's stock number. One problem is that upon refreshing the app or reopening the page, the ""left in stock"" number restarts again. I am not sure if this is even legal.AliReviews ($9.00 a month) is an app that is supposed to increase conversion rates by importing reviews from AliExpress into a merchant's store on a specific product, but while they pride themselves with many authentic reviews, some are 2-3 words maximum creating doubt rather than being trustworthy.Kit CRM Inc. (Free) is another $7 million acquisition of Shopify which integrates with Facebook Messenger and automates its ads by marketing merchant products. While the app has few shortcomings, it does a great job at shortening the process of posting ads on Facebook's news feed. This translates to millions of dollars a month for Facebook's ad revenue stream, but does very little for Shopify's bottom line.Modalyst ($45 a month) is an app that allows one to reach other drop-shippers across the globe if a merchant is not satisfied with quality of suppliers at AliExpress. It does a great job at staying up to date with automated real-time product feeds, including inventory levels and descriptions, but is the most priciest of all the apps, making it difficult for a beginner to thrive.Although these are just few of many, some of the third-party apps that Shopify depends on and pays revenues to have plenty of room for improvement. Mobile Audiences Are Mostly Sharp MillennialsCommerce transactions done over mobile devices still continue to grow faster than desktop transactions. Mobile purchases have surpassed desktop purchases for the first time consisting of 54% vs. desktop's 46% in the year 2016. Mobile purchasers are typically millennial or generation Z consumers who are sharp: they think fast, act fast, and adapt fast. Within a few searches, they can locate the advertised product on Alibaba and buy it way cheaper directly from the supplier vs. the marked up price advertised by the merchant. They are quick to copy each others retail stores and try their own Shopify store by watching a few Youtube training videos.The result? Increased revenue for Shopify in the short term and oversaturated array of products, which eventually results in declining sales and cancelation of subscription renewals.There are dozens of Shopify-made millionaire entrepreneurs on YouTube who are now charging thousand dollar courses to reveal their advertising ""secrets."" Gurus teach novices how to properly target audience ads on Facebook to create the best impression possible on a mobil/desktop ad to gain a consumer's trust and make a sale. This may be the secondary red flag that what used to work no longer isn't. One may want to ask why these millionaires are not trying to repeat the process to turn into multi-millionaires but rather focus on selling their own programs at discounts on Youtube.ConclusionThe online consumer is becoming pickier than ever. To generate sales an online merchant needs to stay competitive, which often means having plenty of cash on sidelines for advertising and great quality products with on-time deliveries. Automation and drop-shipping tends to be the area that suppliers and merchants are gravitating toward to, but there are many internal problems. Asia suppliers run out of inventory, the quality of the product is sub-par and is drastically different than the image on AliExpress upon arrival, a shipment may take 20-30 days to arrive or not arrive at all. A consumer is being tricked with fabricated ""left in stock"" numbers that have absolutely no connection to the suppliers inventory, and the list goes on. All of this weighs in negatively on a merchant's store and its ability to retain a loyal following of repeat customers. Switching to a local drop-shipper often means higher monthly subscriptions costs, higher sales price and less sales, albeit shorter delivery times. It's a trade off.At what point does an entrepreneur decide after several unsuccessful attempts, to switch to eBay (EBAY) or Amazon, where heavy traffic is guaranteed and the advertising burden is lifted off a merchant's shoulders. They also have the option of creating a website on Wix.com (WIX) and pay a fraction of the cost of $100-$120 for an entire year by easily creating a shopping cart website and uploading the products manually without drop-shipping features.To an average analyst who is busy dissecting companies in numerous industries, reading an annual report or listening to management's discussion and analysis, this could be perceived as a typical company working out its challenges and risks associated with growing a business. However, actually beginning an online store and trying to overcome the hurdles, makes one realize that Shopify may have a broken business model that it's trying to fix."
4108286,73185,2017-09-20T13:20:15-04:00,"SHOP stock has been on a tear.Bears hark back to valuation, but this company will grow into its valuation.Secular growth in e-commerce adoption and entrepreneurship provide secular tailwinds for SHOP.","A little over a month ago, we called out Shopify (SHOP) as one of our favorite long-term, growth-oriented investments. We likened the growth narrative to Amazon (AMZN) as both are hyper revenue growth companies and pure plays on accelerating e-commerce adoption trends. SHOP, like AMZN, also has the ability to scale profits rather quickly.Since then, shares of SHOP have surged almost 20% versus a 1% gain for the S&P 500. While we do think SHOP stock is due for a near-term technical pullback, we are not terribly concerned with the short-term movements in SHOP stock. We reiterate that SHOP is one our favorite long-term investments.SHOP data by YChartsFor those unfamiliar with Shopify's business, here is a quick overview. Shopify provides omni-channel commerce solutions for brands looking for increased exposure. Shopify's solutions have experienced exponential growth recently because technology is giving retail a face-lift. Before, consumers bought everything in stores and through catalogs. Now, consumers are faced with shopping decisions in multiple avenues. Almost every retailer also has an online store, sells through social platforms like Instagram (FB), sells through online marketplaces like eBay (EBAY) and Amazon, and is tapping into mobile commerce.With all these new avenues to sell product through, retailers are re-thinking their sales strategy. They need to create a robust, omni-channel commerce presence which caters to the rapidly evolving demands of the consumer. Enter Shopify, which allows retailers to do that by tying in all these distinct points of sale and connecting them through the cloud. It's one solution across multiple commerce avenues.That is why SHOP stock has exploded recently. It's up more than 350% since the beginning of 2016.SHOP data by YChartsWe argue that SHOP will continue on this big growth trajectory over the next several years.Consider this: SHOP only has around 500,000 merchants on its platform.That is a pretty small number considering just how big the company's core addressable of small-to-medium sized businesses actually is. In 2013, there were 28.8 million small firms (less than 500 employees) in the United States alone. There are another million small businesses in Canada and another 23 million in Europe. Put that all together, and you get more than 50 million small businesses in the US, Canada, and Europe alone.Granted, not all of those businesses will last forever nor do all of them need Shopify. A big portion of those 50 million-plus firms will never need to be a Shopify customer.But there are also a whole bunch of bigger businesses which are starting to see the value of Shopify and use Shopify Plus. Companies that launched stores on Shopify this past quarter include Visa (10,000-plus employees), Frito-Lay (50,000 employees), BuzzFeed (1,300 employees), Canadian Tire (50,000-plus employees) and The New York Times (3,000-plus employees). Other big companies that are SHOP customers include Fossil (14,000-plus employees), Red Bull (nearly 12,000 employees), Proctor & Gamble (100,000-plus employees), Nestle (300,000-plus employees), and General Electric (300,000 employees).These big fish are at the high end of SHOP's value chain. These are the guys that most normally subscribe to Shopify Plus, which starts at $2,000 per month. By comparison, Shopify Basic (designed for entrepreneurs) is around $29 per month, while standard Shopify (designed for SMBs) is around $79 per month.All in all, SHOP's addressable market is huge. Essentially, 50 million-plus huge (not all small businesses need this product, but there are a lot of larger businesses which do need Shopify). Undoubtedly, because of the huge growth in e-commerce, SHOP will be subject to ever increasing competition. But considering this hyper-growth giant is tapping into less than 1% of its addressable market, competition shouldn't be a problem for a while. Many players can grow without rubbing elbows. See Netflix (NFLX) and its huge growth in the Internet TV space.It also helps that entrepreneurship is exploding in the United States. There are two things that are causing this rise in entrepreneurship. First, everyone sees the success stories of Facebook (FB) and Snap (SNAP), which were started by college kids who turned good ideas into multi-billion dollar businesses. There is also the proliferation of shows like Shark Tank and The Profit, which paint entrepreneurship in a positive light. Second, the rise of the gig economy and companies like Uber have granted a bunch of people the financial liberty to be entrepreneurs (they get to make money driving a car, and get to do it on their own schedule).The rise of entrepreneurship is huge for SHOP. The more small businesses there are out there, the more potential customers SHOP has.All in all, this is a huge secular growth story that draws strong parallels to Amazon. Like Amazon a few years ago, Shopify has a hyper-growth business which is tapping only a small portion of its addressable market. As e-commerce adoption trends accelerate, Shopify will simultaneously ramp market share, revenues, and profits.Bears want to hark back to valuation, but we again emphasize that this is a stock which will grow into its valuation. SHOP is a hyper-revenue growth business with high gross margins. That means SHOP can turn a profit just by scaling back operating expenses whenever management wants to stop investing in their own growth initiatives.Granted, on a short-term basis, it certainly does look like SHOP stock will pullback. It has had quite the run-up over the past several weeks, and that has jumped the RSI into overbought territory. Normally, when SHOP stock jumps into overbought territory, the stock cools off for a bit before taking its next leg higher.SHOP data by YChartsAll in all, though, we aren't playing the short-term game with SHOP. This is a multi-year investment which we expect to yield significant returns."
4107287,103149,2017-09-15T12:59:00-04:00,Shopify's price has detached from our intrinsic value by about 15% to the upside. We believe scarcity is driving shares higher.There is a huge near-term catalyst that could blow a big short thesis out of the water on Halloween. Shopify could announce its first positive adjusted profit one quarter early.We recommend holding onto your Shopify shares. We believe the downside risk is worth taking for the potential of shares to outperform long term.,"If you have been following our articles for the last few months, you are aware we are long-term shareholders of Shopify (SHOP). Since our last article, Shopify has run up from around $90 to a high of $122.50. Our intrinsic value is $105 per share. We believe Shopify has become detached from our intrinsic value because of scarcity.Scarcity comes in a few flavors including the expectation of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)-like growth, the lack of technology companies in Canada and a sticky multi-faceted as-a-service business model. Secondly, we believe there is a huge near-term catalyst that could blow a big short thesis out of the water around Halloween. Shopify could announce positive adjusted net income one quarter early in 3Q17. This would shut down the short thesis that Shopify grows revenues, but losses grow too.Fear That Shopify Could Produce Amazon-Like ReturnsThe level of attention Shopify has received since its IPO in 2015 has been substantial. Likewise, the stock has compounded at a rate of 130% CAGR from its IPO offer price. A seven bagger in less than 2.5 years. There are many writers and analysts who have compared Shopify to that of Amazon. Where Amazon has compounded 38% CAGR for 20 years, a greater than 650 bagger in 20 years. It’s no wonder so many investors are having ""fear of missing out.""Can Shopify be a 650 bagger in 20 years?The short answer is we don't think so. Here is our reasoning. Since Shopify shares have appreciated 7x already, from today 650x the IPO price is about 90x today’s price in 18 years. The CAGR to achieve this feat would be 28.5%. While 9.5% is lower CAGR than Amazon’s amazing run, and over 100% lower than its own CAGR over the last 2.5 years, 28.5% growth every year for 18 years is enormous and would require Shopify to capture a substantially greater market share than we have projected. In our 10-year forecast model, we estimate Shopify will have over 5 million merchants on the platform (currently 500k). 90x today’s price in 18 years, discounted back to today at our 10% discount rate would imply an intrinsic value today of about $2,000 per share. For our model to produce a $2,000 per share intrinsic value, we would be suggesting that Shopify becomes a monopoly. While we do believe Shopify has a strong offering, we believe our 5 million merchants in 10 years is a much more fair forecast.This reverse engineering makes us feel Amazon-like returns are not possible. However, it is certainly possible for Shopify’s growth to accelerate from here. In a previous article, we discussed how Shopify is only in the early adopters stage of the technology cycle. As more people look to create an online presence for their existing stores, or an online-only presence for whatever they want to sell, Shopify will enter the early and late majority stages, where growth will accelerate. Currently, Shopify is valued at 10x 2018 EV/revenue valuation multiple on 57% y/y expected revenue growth, according to our forecast. If Shopify sees accelerated revenue growth in the 100% per year range again, it is not hard to justify substantial multiple expansion in the range of 15-20x revenue, especially if they are also showing a profit.Currently, Shopify is valued at a 10x 2018 EV/revenue valuation multiple on 57% y/y expected revenue growth, according to our forecast. If Shopify sees accelerated revenue growth in the 100% per year range again, it is not hard to justify substantial multiple expansion in the range of 15-20x revenue, especially if they are also showing a profit.Institutional Investors In Canada Have Few Choices When It Comes To Technology StocksThe largest tech stocks in Canada include CGI Group (GIB) (IT Services/Consulting ~$13.7 billion market cap), Open Text (OTEX) (Enterprise Software - $8.5 billion), Constellation Software (CSU) (Software Roll-Up Model – ~C$14.6 billion), BlackBerry (BBRY) (Enterprise Security - $4.9 billion), Descartes Systems (DSGX) (Logistics Software - ~$2.6 billion) and Shopify (~$11.9 billion). And by US standards, the market cap of other Canadian technology companies outside these top six is quite small. After covering all these companies for four years, we can say that, by far, Shopify is in the category of technology with the most potential for rapid growth.Shopify is now at a scale where it is becoming harder to ignore from an institutional investor point of view. Shopify is nearly the largest by market cap in the technology sector in Canada. Even to just track the benchmark, Shopify has to be a core holding in any Canadian institutional investor’s technology portfolio, otherwise any outperformance of Shopify would create a significant tracking error when they present their performance against the benchmark. As a result of Shopify's rapid rise in market cap, Shopify is now in the top 40 largest companies in Canada. This means it could be added to the S&P TSX 60 index. However, this index tries to have minimal turnover and is at the discretion of the committee, so we are not expecting a change unless a spot opens up.Sticky Multi-Faceted As-A-Service Business ModelShopify generates revenue in two main ways, monthly subscriptions and through the payment system to take a cut of every sale of its merchants. Monthly subscriptions are paid by merchants to use the platform and host their websites. These range from $29 for a basic plan, $79 for a regular plan, and $299 for an advanced plan, and $2000 a month for a Plus (enterprise level) plan.With the subscription, if a merchant is a basic, regular, advanced or Plus user it is an indication of engagement. Higher plan users will be more engaged, but we cannot see the breakdowns except for an occasional disclosure of Plus users. We can, however, try to calculate the subscription revenue per merchant and get a sense of how the distribution lies.We calculate annualized subscription revenue per merchant in 2Q17 was $616. Per month this equates to about $51. With the regular plan at $79 and the basic plan at $29, this $51 falls somewhere between them. Of course, you have Advanced users at $299 and Plus at $2,000 per month. But we could assume that those higher end plans are a small minority. (Plus had 2500 merchants at the end of 2016 vs total merchants of 377500 at the same point in time or just 0.7%). What we can conclude from these data points is that there is a minority of high-end users and a majority of lower end users.This implies a huge opportunity to upsell to higher value plans from the merchant base. If you have a new merchant, they are likely to start on the $29 plan. They are still learning the ropes, probably not selling much and don't want to risk the extra $50 a month for the regular plan. This is probably the majority of new merchant adds every quarter as the extra $50 per month would require a business to revenue $25,000 per month to justify the credit card fee savings. Certainly added features from the regular plan could be a factor, but let's just look at straight numbers. We would guess that 75%-90% of the new merchants in 2017 (~122.5k) are on the basic plan still, this is about 20% of total merchants. This doesn't include the basic users from 2016 that have yet to churn off. Most basic users from before 2016 (if they have not upgraded) have likely churned off the platform due to not making enough sales.If Shopify can upgrade their existing merchant base, the opportunity from basic to regular is 2.7x, from regular to advanced is 3.8x, and advanced to Plus is 6.7x.The second way Shopify generates a recurring revenue is through credit card payments and payment processing fees. While these revenues are not perfectly recurring, with the diversity of merchants, and the consistency of seasonal retail cycles, these revenues are relatively secure. Merchant engagement is a factor related to GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume – total sales of all merchants) and GPV (Gross Processing Volume – total merchant sales processed through Shopify Payments). Higher merchant sales generation is a direct metric to show how engaged and sticky the merchant will be to the platform.Unlike many other recurring or software as a service business models where the revenue upside is limited to a subscription or subscription upgrade, with Shopify, there is a subscription model that has the potential for significant upgrading. We will likely not see the metrics impacted for the foreseeable future as they continue to add substantial numbers of new basic users every day to dilute the outward impact. However, we look forward to those new merchants becoming future upgrades. The limitless upside is the merchant solutions portion, where merchants sell more and Shopify gets a clean cut of the pie. The pace of GMV growth is substantial at 84% y/y reaching nearly $20 billion in the last four quarters.The limitless upside is the merchant solutions portion, where merchants sell more and Shopify gets a clean cut of the pie. The pace of GMV growth is substantial at 84% y/y, reaching nearly $20 billion in the last four quarters. Shareholders of Shopify are able to gain exposure to the e-commerce trend while at the same time getting a subscription revenue that is rapidly growing. Not many other investments have two very good recurring revenuesWhat does this Scarcity mean for investors?Investors who believe Shopify is currently in the early stages of its development should hold on to their stock despite it appearing to be overpriced. While we believe Amazon-like returns are unlikely, many investors may see Shopify as a chance to redeem themselves after missing opportunities like Amazon. And this is not the only dynamic limiting the supply of stock. Demand for a recurring business model with high upside potential in the Canadian tech sector is significant.With multiple factors driving incremental demand for Shopify's stock, we believe investors should hang on to their positions. We are not advocates of buying stocks at prices above our intrinsic value, but we are more than happy to continue being an owner of a company that has the potential for a very bright future.Previously we had suggested that the 3Q17 earnings announcement would include guidance for 4Q17 indicating the first quarter of positive adjusted net income. We suggested that this would eliminate a big short thesis on Shopify. But we think there is something even more powerful to look out for in the 3Q17 results. If Shopify has a strong quarter and beats on revenue again, it is well within the realm of possibilities to report its first quarter of positive adjusted net income in 3Q17 around Halloween.What does Shopify need on the top line to achieve this in 3Q17?Less than you would expect. Our model is forecasting for $171 million revenue in 3Q17, $5 million above the high end of guidance or only 2.8% above the high end of guidance. In the last four quarters, Shopify has beat the top end of its guidance by 5.4%, on average. With our $171 million revenue, we forecast a reported net loss of $4 million. Add back the $15 million of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes from the guidance and our net loss becomes an adjusted net income of $11 million.This event should be a substantial positive catalyst for Shopify stock.We try to explain the divergence in the stock price from our intrinsic value. We attribute it to a significant supply and demand issue with regard to available investment opportunities in high-growth potential stocks, the limited landscape of Canadian technology stocks, and a unique business model with huge upgrading opportunities and wallet sharing. While we understand other investors may have different valuation methods and assumptions, we stick with our valuation methods and our intrinsic value of $105 per share. Due to the scarcity of stock, we do not advocate selling shares, but neither do we suggest you should buy shares above our intrinsic value.Finally, we see a potential for a surprise to the upside when Shopify reports 3Q17 earnings results at the end of October or Early November. Shopify could announce its first profitable quarter since the IPO. If it does, this would be one-quarter earlier than expected and eliminate a well-known short thesis.Click the “Track Comments” button, we typically answer questions with great detail that fall outside of the scope of this article.Author Recommended ArticlesShopify Q2 Results: Revenue Mix Shifts Our ModelShopify In A RecessionShopify: 10-Year Revenue ForecastFollow us if you like our insight."

Since my first article, ""Will Shopify Continue to Outperform?"" on April 27th the company has rocketed up 45% from $72.88 to its high this morning of $105.78. Even here on Seeking Alpha, the stock’s readership has doubled from 9,500 to over 21,000 followers and there have been over 25 articles published in the last two months since their Q1 earnings, which is more than the previous two years combined.I truly enjoy reading the discussion of educated investors debating the finer points of a company’s fundamentals. But like any stock that has experienced rapid growth, Shopify’s stock has attracted its fair share of perma-bears and trolls, who I’m convinced skip to the comment section and post the same baseless, unproven remarks on article after article.I’ve read every one of these 25 articles and nearly every comment posted. What I’ve realized is that there are hundreds of people invested or considering an investment in Shopify who don’t understand the company’s business model, the key drivers behind their success, or the competitors they are up against. They underplay the incredible potential the company has and overstate the minimal risks.After the news and run-up this morning, the shorts are running for the hills. What is Shopify’s Business ModelIn my first article on Shopify, I outlined their business model but with the influx of new readers and potential investors, it seems necessary to quickly repeat what they do and how they generate revenue. Before you make any investment decision, I believe it is necessary to have at least a basic understanding of the business model, revenue generators, and key growth drivers of the company.Shopify is the provider of a cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses. To make it as simple as possible, companies and individuals use the software to design, set up, and manage all of their sales channels from their own personal websites to social media to brick and mortar and pop-up shops. How do they make money?Shopify earns money primarily in two ways: Merchant Solutions and Subscription Solutions.Each of their now 500,000 merchants pay a monthly subscription fee ranging from $25 to $299 to use the software. There is also a high-end option, Shopify Plus, where users pay a variable fee based on how much revenue they generate. I believe this will be one of the long-term drivers for the company as evidenced by the earnings report this morning.Quite simply, the more successful the merchant's businesses are, the more their product needs will grow, thus advancing them up the tier to more expensive pricing options.What makes Shopify unique is that they have every incentive to help their users generate sales.Shopify simplifies the online selling experience for businesses and entrepreneurs by handling complex back-end work such as processing payments, integrating payment options, shipping products, and maintaining site security. This gives the business owner more of the one thing money can’t buy - time. It frees them up to do what they do best - focus on their product and make sales.The more revenue each store brings in, the more revenue Shopify makes.In Q2, Shopify has brought in $71.6 million in revenue from their Subscription Solutions (+64% YOY) driven by an increase in MRR, now at $23.7 million (+64% YOY).2. Merchant Solutions through Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)The second way Shopify generates revenue is through their ""Merchant Solutions."" This component makes up nearly 53% of Shopify’s total revenue and is generated from fees on the Gross Merchandise Volume - or the total revenue generated by its users.For Shopify, it is all about creating “more.” Acquiring more merchants who can sell on more platforms and helping them generate more sales. This all leads to more fees and more revenue for Shopify.In Q2, Shopify brought in $80.1 million in revenue from their Merchant Solutions (+86% YOY) driven by the massive growth in GMV, $5.8 billion in Q2 (+74% YOY).Earnings ReportAbout an hour ago Shopify reported their Q2 earnings and after listening to the call I couldn't be more excited about the long-term opportunity for the company. Here are the highlights, starting with numbers reported to the valuable information I gained from listening to the earnings call.The Financial HighlightsThe most interesting element of the call was the emphasis placed on Shopify’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) by the analysts as well as the company’s leadership. They have absolutely crushed expectations this year and as Tobi Lütke said “the train is about to speed up.”In one off the cuff moment, he recalled venture capitalists laughing him out of the room saying that the total addressable market for Shopify was only 40,000 users. Well, with over 500,000 active users, no one is able to truly predict the growth ahead. They’ve added over 125,000 merchants over the last two quarters and it seems that they are only picking up speed.In many ways, Shopify’s TAM is constantly expanding through their sales channel additions, customer referral growth, different points of sales available, and the rapid growth of entrepreneurship. Shopify’s goal is to reduce as many barriers to entry for someone seeking to sell products online. And they have done so by creating an incredibly accessible and user-friendly e-commerce platform.The Biggest and Only Risk Worth Considering There is however, one risk you must consider before making any investment these days, especially if you are considering a high growth stock such as Shopify. That risk is the overall direction of the market. For the past eight years, we have experienced one of our nation’s most impressive bull markets. Every year that the market has marched upward, the bears have yelled louder and louder. The truth is one day they will be right. When that day will come? No one can know for certain, but rest assured, someone will get it right and get a book deal out of it.In a down market, nearly everything will fall. If the market crashes, Shopify will fall further than most. Why? For one, many investors will sell off their shares to realize already impressive gains. Secondly, Shopify is considered by many to be over-hyped and over valued. I personally think the present valuation, while overvalued according to fundamental metrics, is a fair price for the potential this company has. Value investors love to shout that Shopify is not even profitable, but the simple answer is they are plowing all of their cash back into the company to capture market share and lead the industry.If the market drops 40% tomorrow, I will double down on Shopify stock. Every company I consider investing in must pass this simple question, “if the market tanked tomorrow, would I be willing to buy more?”If the bull market continues, Shopify will likely continue to outperform the overall market. I am strongly bullish on Shopify's business model and growth potential. However, I am cautiously bullish on the overall direction of the market and do not plan to add shares until we see a market-wide pullback.What your decision comes down to is your time horizon and your stance on the direction of the market. If you believe the market is due for a downturn, then feel free to stay on the sidelines, but don’t be surprised if this stock breaks the $150-200 mark in the next year. My RecommendationAfter the run-up over the last four months, it may be too late to catch a short-term play but it could be the investment of a lifetime if you allow it to be. I bought in at 76.92 at what was a market high and I haven’t looked back. Author NoteSeeking Alpha has had an enormous impact on my investing success over the last six years.

4086802,103149,2017-07-10T21:09:37-04:00,"Shopify will report 2Q17 results around the end of July/early August.We present our expectations for 2Q17 results, guidance for 3Q17, and guidance for the full year 2017.We also walk through a few scenarios of what to do if results are better or worse than expected.","The three keys in our expectations to look for in Shopify's (SHOP) 2Q17 results:For the last two years, Shopify has released 2Q earnings results on July 30, 2015, and August 3, 2016, while it has yet to announce the timing of the 2Q17 earnings results, we would expect a similar timing for this year.Since 1Q17 was released, we calculated a fair value price per share for Shopify of US$90 per share. Currently, the shares are trading in line with our fair value derived from our 10-year forecast.Management guidance provided for 2Q17 is as follows:Revenue of $142 million to $144 million.GAAP operating loss of $18 million to $20 million.Adjusted operating loss* of $6 million to $8 million.* The difference between the GAAP and the adjusted number is an exclusion of stock-based compensation expenses and payroll taxes of $12 million.Additionally, the full-year 2017 guidance was provided as follows:Revenue of $615 million to $630 million.GAAP operating loss of $69 million to $73 million.Adjusted operating loss* of $14 million to $18 million.* The difference between the GAAP and the adjusted number is an exclusion of stock-based compensation expenses and payroll taxes of $55 millionOur expectations for the quarter 2Q17:Revenue of $154 million versus guidance of $142 million to $144 million.GAAP operating loss of $11 million versus guidance of $18 million to $20 million.Adjusted numbers are less important to us, as we base our model on the more standardized results of GAAP.Our expectation for the full year 2017:Revenue of $659 million versus guidance of $615 million to $630 million.GAAP operating loss of $56 million versus guidance of $69 million to $73 million.Lastly, our expectations for 3Q17 are as follows:There are a lot of moving parts, so what should you be looking for in making a buy or sell decision?Given that our expectations result in a fair value of US$90/share and the current stock price is around US$90/share, we are in a position to make a clear decision after the quarter of how we view the results.Summary of Our Expectations2Q1720173Q17Scenario 1 – BUY or BUY MOREResults for 2Q17 are better than our expectations.Management guidance for 2017 and 3Q17 are better than our expectations.If everything is accelerating faster than our expectations, then making those adjustments to the model would imply a price target above US$90/share, so we would consider buying more.Scenario 2 – BUY or BUY MOREResults for 2Q17 are worse than our expectations but better than management guidance.Management guidance for 2017 and 3Q17 are better than our expectations.Short-term results can be volatile, but if long-term visibility and expectations remain strong, we would buy more.Scenario 3 – HOLDResults for 2Q17 are in line with our expectations.Management guidance for 2017 and 3Q17 are in line with our expectations.If nothing has changed, even with management raising guidance to match our expectations, this is a scenario where we would just hold our position.The market could see the increase in guidance as a reason to buy, but we see guidance rising to our expectations as already priced in.Scenario 4 – SELL or HOLDResults for 2Q17 are worse than our expectations but better than management guidance.Management guidance for 2017 and 3Q17 are worse than our expectations.Scenario 4 and 2 differ in that the future looks worse than our expectations in Scenario 4. If we applied lower long-term expectations to our model our fair value would drop. Given the stock is trading around our fair value, it would give us reason to sell.Stocks like Shopify have a lot of short-term money invested in it which creates a lot of volatility in the stock price. An expectation of slowing growth could cause the stock price to drop significantly.Depending on the magnitude of a potential “miss”, we would consider selling part of our position but likely hold most or all of it. As long-term investors, we believe the company has all the right ingredients to continue to innovate and grow.Scenario 5 - SELLResults for 2Q17 are worse than our expectation and worse than management guidance.Management guidance for 2017 and 3Q17 are worse than our expectationsThis is a clear sell now, and wait for the dust to settle scenario. If everything looks like Shopify can't beat and raise anymore, a lot of short-term money will leave the stock in search for the next big thing. Even a long-term investor would be better off shooting first and asking questions later.There too many possible scenarios to cover them all, but we believe we have provided investors with enough information to make a proper judgment of how the actual results differ from our expectations.ConclusionThe three keys in our expectations to look for in Shopify's 2Q17 results:If Shopify can produce a result better than our expectations, we would buy more.If Shopify produces a result worse than our expectations but better than its guidance, we would hold.If Shopify produces a result worse than our expectations and guidance worse than our expectations, we would consider selling part of our position but likely hold most or all of it.And lastly, if Shopify produces a result worse than its provided guidance and provides guidance worse than our expectations, we would consider selling first and waiting for the dust to settle before looking at buying it back. Any indication that the growth train has slowed significantly is reason enough for short-term investors to flee the stock.Follow us if you like our insight.Check out our most popular articles on Shopify:Shopify In A RecessionShopify: 10-Year Revenue ForecastShopify: Cash Is Cash, M&A Is Upside"

Shopify has plenty of cash to backstop this venture after a $561 million equity raise. We don't believe Shopify Capital will consume a large portion of their estimated $957 million of cash, but as their merchant base grows they will have a good use of cash in Shopify Capital.From a shareholder's point of view, there are not many places we could get 20-25% annual return on our cash consistently. Shopify has this outlet, and the opportunity is growing. Shopify Capital also enables its merchants to expand and grow into higher level subscription plans. It also drives higher volume merchants onto Shopify Payments.If Shopify Capital can be successful long-term, it can be a significant feature in developing the Shopify ecosystem. We are long-term shareholders of Shopify.Shopify has provided some interesting segmented data from Shopify Capital which we will use in our analysis.Shopify Capital gives cash advances in return for receivables of some amount greater than the cash advances.Example: for a $5,000 cash advance, Shopify could take receivables of $5,500.Every day, Shopify takes a portion of the merchant's revenue (directly from their bank account) until the receivables reach zero. The remittance rate can vary. We have seen that a factor rate of 1.1 is typically associated with a remittance rate of 10%. Likewise, a factor rate of 1.13 is likely associated with a remittance rate of 13%.Source: ShopifyIn the 1Q17 earnings call, Shopify indicated MCA receivables are paid back in 7 to 9 months.We should note that Shopify does not offer cash advances to all its merchants. Its underwriting process should help to mitigate some risk as well.Source: ShopifyIn a recession, we would expect Shopify might see longer payback periods as merchant revenues accelerate at a slower pace or decline. Some smaller merchants that shutter the doors would even increase total losses. But Shopify has a partnership with Export Development Canada (EDC) to insure merchant cash advances, which should help mitigate losses.Shopify Capital In A Perfect WorldIn a perfect world, Shopify would get remitted all its merchant cash advances without fail.If Shopify gives a $10,000 MCA, it will on average charge a 1.12-factor rate and acquire $11,200 in MCA receivables. To receive full remittance in 7 months a merchant needs to have monthly sales of about $13,500. For 9 months remittance, the monthly sales need to be about $10,500. This assumes 12% daily remittance on merchant sales.The return on investment is not a simple back of the envelope calculation because remittance occurs daily. This means we have to take into account the time value of money on cash received on day 1 vs in 7 to 9 months.Using an annual percentage rate or APR calculator, we can determine Shopify's return on investment. In the 7-month remittance scenario, the APR is 40%. In the 9-month scenario, the APR is 31%.This may sound like a ridiculous rate to charge, but given the amounts are small, the risk of foreclosure on the merchant low, the remittance dependent on merchant success, and the ease of obtaining capital for the merchant, we can see why merchants will take these cash advances to progress their businesses in the short term.But We Do Not Live In A Perfect WorldShopify records provisions and charges for MCA receivables it does not expect to collect. In 1Q17, this amount was $1.3 million out of $18.6 million of outstanding MCA receivables.Since Shopify only started reporting the MCA breakdown in 1Q17, we don't have the charge-off data for 2016 to calculate the actual loss they recorded every quarter. We only have the ending allowance of uncollectible MCA receivables amount which doesn't include any actual charged off amounts. In 1Q17 the actual charge off was $324,000. We would assume the amounts in 2016 were smaller given the program had just launched, however, we do not have data to confirm.At a 1.12 average factor rate, if total collected receivables dropped below 89%, Shopify Capital would lose money as a standalone business. If the charged off amount over the last year was 4x the amount in 1Q17, it would, coincidentally, be $1.3 million. On cumulative MCA receivables, this would imply about 95.7% successful remittance.At a 95.7% remittance rate, the APR for 7 months remittance would be 25%. The APR for 9 months remittance would be 20%. A bit of a drop from 40% and 31%, respectively, but a good return on capital nonetheless.Shopify Capital's Potential ReachWe estimate the average merchant generated $50,000 in sales in 2016. However, our model suggests that to be eligible to receive the lowest cash advance of $5000, the merchant would need to generate at least $80,000 in sales per year. Without median data, we are not able to accurately assess the number of merchants generating over $80,000.From the 1Q17 earnings call we learned that ""more than 50% of the GMV on the platform come from both the advance plan as well as the Plus plan"", but without an accurate count of the numbers of Advance and Plus merchants, we are still short on data.If we assume 2.5% of merchants fall into the Advance/Plus plans or about 10,000 merchants, splitting 50% of the GMV from 1Q17 would imply nearly $1 million in GMV per merchant annualized. Extending $5,000 to $50,000 to 10,000 merchants puts the opportunity at $50 million to $500 million. But the merchant base is growing so the opportunity will grow with it.It's a wide range. And in all likeliness, those at the top end of the range will not be taking these cash advances as they likely have cheaper access to capital.While we make a lot of assumptions, we can squeeze out a few observations from this exercise.ConclusionIf Shopify can collect 95.7% of its MCA receivables the return on capital could range from 20%-25% APR on an aggregate basis. At 89% successful remittance, they are breakeven.We don't believe Shopify Capital will consume a large portion of their estimated $957 million of cash, but as their merchant base grows they will have a good use of cash in Shopify Capital. We would expect the majority of the cash to be used in organic product development and M&A.From a shareholder's point of view, there are not many places we could get 20-25% annual return on our cash consistently. Shopify has this outlet, and the opportunity is growing. Shopify Capital also enables its merchants to expand and grow into higher level subscription plans. And drives higher volume merchants onto Shopify Payments.If Shopify Capital can be successful long-term, it can be a significant feature in developing the Shopify ecosystem.

The market did not like that news at first glance, but since that first reaction, has decided there was good reason for the raise, and the run has continued.All can be forgiven when a company grows revenue at 84% (TTM) year over year, with subscription solutions up 60% and merchant solutions revenue up 92%. But, the news that may also have turned the market back to bullish surrounds yet another business line that the company is pursuing.First we take a step back and look at the growth in charts. We start with revenue:Revenue (TTM US$ million) for Shopify was $444 million. Last year it was $241 million, which is an 84.5% one-year change. The company is also driving positive cash from operations:But, let's not lose sight of some other realities. The company has not turned a profit and appears nowhere near that:But, here's the reality we are watching.There was a point in Shopify's early days that it was a foregone conclusion that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) would simply crush the company. It turns out that the mighty Amazon is, in fact, not only unable to crush the new comer, but has succumbed and is now a major partner. Even further, Amazon.com shut down its ""Webstore,"" which would have been the direct competitor to Shopify.The partnership with Amazon then, in a total reversal of fortunes, gave Shopify the beginnings of its moat against smaller peers. The history is magnificent, and that moment was a true line in the sand - it was day one of a growing moat.Now we have more updates from Shopify.Apple, Shopify and GamingOn May 25th of this year, we learned that Shopify released a new software development kit (SDK) called Unit Buy, giving game makers the ability to add support for sales of physical goods within a game.This move comes on the back of a reality in the gaming business that e-commerce is now a legitimately new market for them to drive revenue. Here's a snippet from a nice article written by Shoshanna Delventhal for Investopedia.*The new SDK will integrate with Apple Pay and will work across mobile, console and PC platforms.Unit Buy is another step at strengthening Shopify's moat in that it becomes an ecosystem that cannot be easily replaced and gives smaller companies a new avenue for sales.And then there's more...Credit Card ReaderOn April 20th, we learned that Shopify announced its own credit card reader. Here are the press release highlights, with analysis to follow:And here are some the features:So, why do we care?This is subtle, but Shopify is becoming the Alpha and Omega for small businesses, which oftentimes have to piece together various technologies to make their online and brick-and-mortar stores work. It becomes a tangled and costly amalgamation of technologies, each of which is a point of failure and, worse yet for Shopify, a potential competitor.Now, with its first ever in-house made hardware, ""any of our merchants can use Shopify to power every aspect of their business, at every interaction"" (Craig Miller, Chief Product Officer).When we combine this reader with Shopify Pay, that messy, multi-pronged process has been eliminated. ""With Shopify Pay, Shopify says it has whittled down the number steps required for checkout from 16 to two. Among the merchants who've tested the feature, Shopify Pay has increased checkout speed by 40 percent."" (Source: ZDNet)Friends, we love this move and remind everyone how much this deepens Shopify's moat. At this point, merchants are totally beholden to Shopify when we consider the data storage, transaction history, payment processing, store hosting and avenues it opens up with Amazon. Add a new SDK and credit card reader, and it's a shrewd move and one that does make this company more valuable.We maintain our Spotlight Top Pick on Shopify Inc., and while we note rather urgently that the market is getting toppy, in the long run Shopify has a long way to go, while also keeping in mind the risks of execution and competition.The author is long shares of Shopify Inc. at the time of this writing."
4079075,103149,2017-06-06T07:40:21-04:00,"We are long-term investors in Shopify. We have discussed the long story, but now we need to assess the risk of our investment.
        The biggest risk we see to Shopify's stock is a market crash and recession. In the last recession Amazon fell 60%, we calculate Shopify could drop 40% from here.
        Merchant acquisition could slow in a recession. But the major risk to the stock will be fund flows as it is with all growth stocks in a market crash.
        If you are long Shopify, and nothing about a recession changes your view of why this is a great company, a market crash is a great opportunity.
        But we don't know when a crash is coming, it could be tomorrow, it could be in one or more years.","As long-term investors in Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), we want to take a look at the downside risk so we know what we should expect if the market does crash.We conclude that there is a serious fundamental risk to Shopify's business as merchant acquisition could be slower than expected in the event of a widespread recession. As a result shares of Shopify could tumble more than 40% in our downside scenario. But all hope is not lost, we offer some potential levers that could offset some of the impact.Taking the leap into ShopifyFor us, initially taking the leap to buy our first position in Shopify was outside of our comfort zone. It felt like looking at only one down day for every ten up days. We had never really bought a stock that was moving this fast day after day.As many people have expressed in many comment sections, the stock valuation at first blush is expensive. But knowing our research and trusting the robustness of our analysis gave us the confidence to take the leap.Obviously, when the stock moves in your favor it is easy to say it was a good decision.A Crash Is Coming - MaybePeople have been saying the market is going to crash for years now, and that a recession is coming. We don't know when they are going to happen, but we do believe at some point they will happen. Could be tomorrow, or could be a few years from now. In our article Bear Market: Extreme Or Not Extreme, That Is The Question we discovered that if you are invested in the market, it's easier, and probably better to stay in the market when it crashes if it's not an extreme crash like in 2007-2009.In this article, we look more specifically at Shopify.What happens to Shopify in a recession?As long-term investors of Shopify, we see ourselves as partners in their long-term growth story. If we were invested in a private company, we wouldn't try to bail out in the event of a recession especially if Shopify continues to demonstrate the attributes that made it great in our eyes.Recessions don't last forever, and great companies are the first to be reborn out of those flames.With that said, let's examine what would happen to Shopify's business and stock price if a recession occurred.Subscription Solutions Revenue - Merchant AcquisitionMerchants are being acquired at an incredible pace relative to Shopify's install base. In 2016 Shopify ended the year with 377,500 merchants, adding 134,500 net new merchants year over year or 55% growth.Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is the metric Shopify likes to use to measure the revenue growth of its merchant base. MRR grew 63% year over year in 2016.Contrast the MRR growth at 63% with the merchant number growth of 55%, tells us Shopify's merchants are upgrading to higher value plans.In a recession, we consider two scenarios for merchant acquisition.1) Merchants go out of business, reducing the net new merchant growth on the platform.2) Unemployment increases, pushing people into entrepreneurship.Merchants Go Out of BusinessThe merchants going out of business are likely basic plan subscribers. These are businesses that may not have survived in the first place, but some of which could have done well in a better economy. Larger businesses may be more resilient in surviving during a time when consumers are spending less. We would expect these large merchants to struggle, but continue to remain in business.Remaining merchants will not likely downgrade their plans as a loss of functionality would not be helpful in tough times. We may even see increased use of the Shopify App store, as merchants search for tools that will help them reach consumers.Unemployed People Becoming EntrepreneursA recent survey by Shopify found that 7 in 10 Canadians want to start a business but only 3 in 10 do. The US was built by entrepreneurs, so we would expect a similar statistic.But can we expect increased unemployment to drive new business formation?The Bureau of Labour Statistics would suggest otherwise. During economic downturns in 2001, and 2008-2009 the number of new businesses established declined.Given the evidence, in a recession, we expect net new merchant additions to slow. We would still expect merchant acquisition to be positive, but likely at a slower pace. If we use the decline from top to bottom in the last recession, we can estimate net new merchant acquisition to dropped by 5% each year.So if we assume a 5% drop in net new merchant acquisitions each year for the next 3 years, the impact to our fair value is a decline from $91/share to $81/share or 11% decline. We account for the impact to Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), as well as cost of revenue for both Subscription and Merchant Solutions. We assumed operating expenses will remain unchanged at our base model, as we would expect Shopify to continue to invest in growth and innovation despite a recession.This downward pressure could be partially offset by merchant upgrades to more expensive plans. In our base model, we conservatively assumed the average revenue per merchant from subscription solutions would remain flat over the next 10 years. But as we mentioned early, MRR is growing faster than Merchant acquisition, which implies average revenue per merchant has historically been increasing.Merchant Solutions RevenueIt is reasonable to assume GMV will likely grow at a slower pace during the initial years of the recession. But the trend of consumption moving online from physical stores will likely persist as we can see in the chart below from the US Census Bureau. Through 2007-2009 the trend of e-commerce retail sales continue to take share from total retail. While still in the early stages, it grew from under 3.5% to around 4% over that period. Today e-commerce has a 8.5% share of total retail sales.Source: US Census BureauWe have assumed slower merchant acquisition will impact total GMV in our forecast. But we would still expect GMV to continue to grow and industry-wide GMV from e-commerce as a percentage of total retail spend should continue to increase.Currently, in our 10-year revenue forecast, we expect GMV to grow from $15.4 billion in 2016 to $27 billion in 2017, then to $42 billion in 2018, and $62 billion in 2019. As the law of large numbers comes into play, naturally the rate of growth will decline, shown on the secondary axis below.Source: Author, Shopify filingsIf we cut the acceleration of growth of GMV in half starting in 2Q17 to 4Q19, our fair value drops from $91/share to $79/share or about 13% decline. Cutting acceleration of growth to zero for the same period drops our fair value to $66/share or 27% decline.For more details on our base assumptions and a full explanation of acceleration of growth see our article Shopify: 10-year Revenue ForecastShopify Capital - Maybe Slower, But Limited DownsideShopify Capital provides merchant cash advances in exchange for receivables, paid back from daily revenues. In the 1Q17 earnings call, Shopify indicated receivables are paid back in 7 to 9 months.In a recession, we would expect Shopify might see longer payback periods as merchant revenues accelerate at a slower pace or decline. Some smaller merchants that shutter the doors would even increase total losses. But Shopify has a partnership with Export Development Canada ( EDC) to insure merchant cash advances, which should help mitigate losses.We should note that Shopify does not offer cash advances to all its merchants. It's underwriting process should help to mitigate some risk as well.Source: ShopifyStock Market - Fund FlowsWhen the stock markets turn south, many investors will run with their tails between their legs. That means a lot of cash will exit the markets especially from investors who are investing on borrowed money. These will be the first investors that will sell because they cannot afford to pay interest payments for years while the stock market finds its legs again.Money will leave high growth non-dividend paying stocks first because investors will not have any dividends from these stocks to pay interest payments or live off of. High growth stocks are also positioned as having less growth prospects in a recession.Investors are assigning high valuation multiples to stocks like Shopify because they believe it has high growth potential. But as soon as a recession hits, investor sentiment may change. We have outlined the fundamental risks that could materially slow growth during a recession.Summing up the impacts of a recession, we could see a downside fair value for Shopify of $57/share or 37% downside to our base model fair value of $91/share. Given Shopify is trading at around $97.50, this would be a downside risk of 41%.Amazon comparison during 2007-2009Amazon's stock price dropped from a peak of nearly $95/share in December 2007 to a low of $38/share in November 2008. That's a 60% drop.Meanwhile actual net sales continued to grow at a pace of 28% in 2009 and 29% in 2008, albeit from 39% in 2007. While a slow down from 2007, it was still growing at an incredibly consistent pace. And in 2010 and 2011 restarted that torrid pace of 40% y/y net sales growth.Will a recession change the attributes of what made Shopify great in our minds?Not likely.Will the long-term trend of e-commerce do a 180 because of a recession?We doubt it.ConclusionWe believe that in the case of a recession, there are real fundamental headwinds that could impact Shopify's pace of growth in the near term.We also believe market sentiment and fund flows will take control of stock markets as they always do. In 2008, Amazon saw 60% of its stock price disappear from the top to the bottom. But since the $38/share bottom in November 2008 it has more than recovered, multiplying by 27 times to over $1000 today.Plugging into our 10-year forecast, a 3-year hiccup from a recession could fundamentally slow down Shopify's pace of growth. This gives us a downside scenario of over 40% to the current share price.In essence, a recession will delay Shopify's drive to stable profitability, which we had reached by the end of our base 10-year forecast. To achieve this stable profitability and operating leverage with a recession could take a few extra years, but ultimately we believe the result will be similar to Amazon.Money will flow out of the stock and people will be fearful of growth stocks in a recession. Investors who are well educated on the capabilities of Shopify and the trends of the retail and e-commerce industry will have an opportunity to get in at a massive discount to fair value.In the meantime, we don't know when a recession will come, and we don't know how much Shopify can grow before then (i.e. revenue, fair value, and stock price). If a recession is a year or two away, Shopify stock could be up significantly by then, and a pull back could be to a price higher than it is trading for today. Regardless of how the stock trades, we remain long-term fundamental investors of Shopify.We hope this analysis helps you assess the downside risk of investing in Shopify.If you like our insight, please consider following us."
4082966,24992,2017-06-21T13:11:43-04:00,"Relationship between revenue and net income is strongly negative.The more the company sells, the worse it net income gets?Heavy shareholder dilution over the last four years - and the trend shows no sign of reversing.Forward PE is an eye-watering 294x - stock is priced for perfection, but perfection most likely will not occur over the next 12 months.ChartMasterPro downward target price of 72.50.","Over the past twelve months, shares of Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) have risen about 198%. In my view, current investors would be wise to count themselves lucky and to sell, and prospective investors should stay away. The fact is that there's little reason to own these shares, especially at these levels. I would say that there's more downside than upside in the shares and therefore, I rate Shopify a sell. I'll outline my reasoning below.Financial SnapshotTo put it mildly, the financial performance at Shopify has been uninspiring. On the one hand, revenue and operating profit both continue to climb, but the rising sales have not flowed through to the bottom line. In fact, the more the company sells, the worse it seems to do.It's not unreasonable for investors to expect that rising sales will lead to higher net income. This is such an uncontroversial claim that it's strange to me when fellow investors question it. In the absence of a positive relationship between revenue and net income, we're left to wonder ""if rising revenues won't lead to rising net income, what on Earth will?"" With the idea that a picture is worth a thousand words, here is the relationship between revenue and net income at Shopify. The correlation is actually strongly negative (r=-.79). This suggests that the more this company sells, the larger are its net income losses. At the very least, that should give investors pause.There are obviously many investors who prefer free cash flow as a more valid measure of a firm's performance than net income. I happen to see a great deal of informational value in accrual accounting measures, but we can put that debate aside. Even on a free cash flow basis, Shopify is quite volatile and has been uninspiring.In addition to the disconnect between revenue and any source of shareholder value, the company continues to dilute its shareholder base, having issued approximately $436 million of stock over the past four years. We can have a robust debate about the need to sell shares to fund operations, but it's fairly plain that it is harmful to current shareholders. The probability is quite high that dilution will actually continue apace, given that the share count has increased by approximately 10 million shares from Q1 2016 to the quarter just ended. There's nothing on the horizon to suggest that this trend will reverse itself anytime soon.The StockSome investors have very short memories. They don't remember what happened when earnings light businesses were driven to huge valuations. The fact that these stories inevitably end with shareholder losses doesn't seem to phase shareholders in Shopify who seem willing to bid the shares ever higher. At some point, though, even these optimistic souls must acknowledge that there's more downside than upside potential.Shopify is emblematic of a wider issue, namely the relationship between a stock's risk and the level of optimism embedded in the share price. In my view, optimistically priced shares are the worst of all possible worlds because they represent tremendous downside and little upside. The reason is straightforward enough. If the company executes perfectly, when the shares are priced for perfection, little will happen as the (optimistic) expectations were simply met. If, as is more likely, the company eventually stumbles, the shares will drop precipitously. That's why investing in companies that are floating on a sea of hope is dangerous.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for SHOP turned bearish with a daily close below $90.00 on June 20. This signals a bearish breakdown from a Bear Flag on the daily charts. From here we see the shares falling to the $72.50 level over the next three months.Today we may buy SHOP put options which will provide us with approximately 5x leverage on our short trade (for details on the option, please visit our website). Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $92.50.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you sell to avoid any further drop in the share value.ConclusionI usually quantify the level of optimism embedded in share price, but that's a difficult exercise to do with Shopify, given the lack of earnings present. That said, the forward PE for the firm is an eye watering 294 times, which suggests the market is forecasting EPS of about $.29. That would be an extraordinary level of growth from the current loss position. It's made even more challenging by the fact that this company seems to keep issuing new shares.In my view, there's actually nothing to like about Shopify and a great deal to eschew here. The shares are massively priced, are very optimistically priced relative to any reasonable expectations about the future, the company seems to grow losses the more it sells, and management seems intent on selling an ever growing number of shares into this bull market in the shares. In my view, there's a great deal more downside than upside here, and therefore investors should shop for returns elsewhere and avoid this company."

It's still 10 years away, but the path looks reasonable.Shopify has proven to us their ability to continue to execute while they grow rapidly. This gives us confidence they can manage the growth going forward.","Doing your homework is critical to making rational decisions, especially in real-time when the price of shares is moving up or down 10% at a time. If the stock is making new highs or gapping down lower, knowing the fundamentals of why you are invested will help you decide to buy more, sell everything, or just hold.We believe Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) can get to $1 billion in free cash flow in 10 years. And that will be the floor going forward.Getting there will require merchant growth of 18-27% CAGR, compared historically to their 73% CAGR in the last 4 years.The current enterprise value to sale multiple is 12x our 2017 sales and 7.7x our 2018 sales. But in 5 years we expect that to drop to 3x while still having 30% y/y growth prospects.Lastly, Shopify's ability to execute is clearly proven to us. Over the last 5 years, they have grown their employees from 131 to over 1900 while maintaining their innovative culture and long-term perspective. The next 5-10 years is going to require the rapid addition of employees to achieve the growth necessary to justify the current stock price. Given its history, we believe Shopify can handle the challenge ahead.In the event of a widespread market pullback, we would be buyers of Shopify to position ourselves for the next 5-10 years.Source: ShopifyHow We View RiskOver the weekend we were fortunate to meet a friends' friend at a wedding reception. Our Hero (as we will call him), works in Silicon Valley at a very well know tech company. But it wasn't always that way. He started out working for the government nearly 3000 miles away.Our Hero had a secure job. A job that he could have stayed at for life, with a great pension lined up for when he retired in 35 years. In the minds of everyone he worked with, he was in the lowest risk situation possible.But that's not how our Hero saw it.Fast forward to now. Our Hero has a high paying Silicon Valley job at one of the biggest tech company's you can think of. But our Hero is looking again to leave a job that everyone sees as the best thing in the world.He wants to join a start-up. He's probably not going to get a salary, but he will probably get some expenses and meals covered. The early stock options will be his upside, along with excitement and adventure.From an uninformed point of view, our Hero is a huge risk-taker, you may even call him a risk-seeker. He is leaving a very nice six-figure salary with all the perks, a sure-thing some would say, for uncertainty with essentially no pay.If we analogize his career to an investment. He has gone from a government bond to riding the momentum of a rapidly growing stock. And now going from a maturing tech stock to a start-up that doesn't have a name, doesn't have an office, but has some angel funding.How can our Hero make this decision with a straight face and tell us ""Not taking this opportunity is risky""?Distilling our Hero's decision, we concluded that risk is in the eye of the beholder.Our Hero is a smart, rational guy. He puts a lot of thought into every major decision. He knows the founder of the start-up thoroughly as a genius, and someone he has wanted to work with as soon as he met him 4 years ago. He sees this start-up solving a huge problem for enterprise level customers. He knows what he is capable of and is confident he can help bring this company to the next level. In his mind, he knows the risks but he has mitigated them.To an uninformed outsider, we don't know the founder, we don't understand the problem they want to solve, and we just met our Hero a couple of paragraphs ago. To us, this is a huge risk. If we were responsible for choosing our Hero's next career path, we would not send him to the start-up.But our Hero knows better than us because he has done his homework and has way more information than us.What does this story have to do with investing?The risk is in the eye of the beholder. We do deep dive research into the companies we invest in. We make sure we understand as well as possible how the business model works. We identify where the upside levers are for the company to succeed, whether it is scale, new products, or a rising tide. We also look for potential downside risks, like what would happen to the stock price in a recession or widespread market pullback.The more we know about a company and the characteristics of the investors in that stock, the less risk we see in the investment. From the outside, we might seem crazy to invest, but from our perspective, we are making a rational decision.The risk of not investing is greater to us than the risk of investing.Shopify - Uninformed Outsider vs Informed InvestorFrom an uninformed outsider, Shopify is viewed as a risky stock because its enterprise value to sales ratio is well above what would normally be considered the mean. Shopify currently trades at 12x our 2017 forecast revenue and 7.7x our 2018 revenue. The stock chart looks like a 45-degree slope up and to the right. Since the IPO, the stock has gone from an opening price of $28 to a high of $100 last week, in a matter of only two years.Many uninformed investors end up buying the stock based on hype, the recommendation of others, momentum, and comparisons to Amazon. But making a proper investment decision needs more than knowing the ticker, the price, the chart and reading one or two paragraphs on a company. It is these uninformed investors that create a short-term risk for any stock and which create short-term price inefficiencies in Shopify's stock, both up and down.Emotional DecisionsUninformed investors who buy on a ""stock tip"" do not have enough information to steady their emotions and make a rational decision during high-stress times.When the stock rises 10-20% in a short period of time, they sell too early. When the stock falls 10-20% in a short period of time, they sell instead of buy. It's where we believe the ""sell first, ask questions later"" mentality comes from.Let's take an example of Shopify's recent sell-offs and bounce backs.On May 11, 2017, Shopify saw an early day sell off. It opened near$93 but dropped to $89.50 about 30 minutes after the open. It closed the day at $92 and several days later at over $95.On May 18, 2017, Shopify opened below $84, after closing the previous day at $90. But 2 hours later was trading around $90 once again.On June 12, 2017, Shopify opened at $90, but quickly reached a low of $82.50 about 20 minutes after the open. 2 hours after the open the stock was back to $90, closing the day at $89.These are examples of uninformed investors selling short-term positions and informed investors taking advantage, to position for the long term.We do not assume that every sell off will find support like these last three significant occasions. Informed investors may have a full allocation to the stock already which will restrict their ability to buy more. They may also run out of new money to invest as they continue to buy on the dips.Long-Term Informed Investors Want The Price to Drop TodayWhile short-term price doesn't matter as much to long-term informed investors, we still want to get our shares as cheap as possible.Either way, we are invested in seeing Shopify become a multi-billion-dollar revenue company. And follow that by becoming a billion-dollar-plus free cash flow company. Cash flow is how we expect to be paid for our investment. We don't necessarily expect the company to pay a dividend when it gets to that point, but if that recurring cash flow is valued fairly by the market, we believe our shares will be worth much more than they are worth today.To simplify. We believe Shopify needs at most 2 to 4 million merchants on its platform to generate $1 billion in free cash per year. That is a huge range. But here are the scenarios.The Road to $1 Billion Free Cash FlowWe take what we know today to forecast the eventual breakeven point on cash flow. We see free cash flow break even in 2019, and free cash flow minus share-based compensation breaking even in 2021. $1 billion free cash flow comes at the end of our forecast period in 10 years. But given Shopify's recurring revenue model, that $1 billion becomes a floor.Scenario 1: Shopify's subscription revenue per merchant stays flat for the next 10 years at $615/merchant per year (calculated based on the average merchants active on the platform in 1Q17). At this rate, Shopify will need 4 million merchants to generate $1 billion in free cash per year. From today, that is about 10x the merchants or 27% CAGR growth for the next 10 years. In the last 4 years, the merchant base has grown from nearly 42k in 2012 to 377k in 2016, that's 73% CAGR growth. We think this is a very achievable outcome given this history.Scenario 2: Shopify's subscription revenue per merchant increases at 5% CAGR for the next 10 years, revenue per merchant could grow to $1000/merchant. In this scenario, only about 2 million merchants would be required, or an 18% CAGR over the next 10 years.This is a trade-off of quality merchants versus quantity of merchants. The third scenario would be to get both the 4 million merchants and the $1000/merchant, but that would be quite ambitious.A basic subscription merchant generates $29/month or $348/year.A regular subscription generates $79/month or $948/year.An advanced subscription generates $299/month or $3,588/year.Shopify Plus generates $2000/month or $24,000/year.As merchants become more successful on the platform over the next 10 years, they will upgrade to higher price plans. Additionally, the ratio of new merchants starting on lower priced plans compared to existing merchants on higher priced plans will be lower. Instead of 50% new merchants coming on the platform, that ratio will drop to 15-25% in the latter part of the next decade, in our model. This means the average subscription revenue per merchant should increase.This is before any potential price increases over the next 10 years. But there is also a potential that base subscription prices will drop in the next 10 years as competition, innovation and business models change the landscape.Valuation MultiplesShopify currently trades at 12x our 2017 forecast revenue and 7.7x our 2018 revenue. Some investors may think looking even 2 years forward is too far for a disruptor company. We are long term investors though, we don't know exactly what will become of our investments in 10 years, but trying to make an educated guess about it today is part of becoming an informed investor. Putting that extra effort into understanding what assumptions make today's valuation fair is what makes us informed. Then when the company shows us earnings results that underperform, meet, or outperform those assumptions, we can make a rational decision to buy more, sell all or some, or hold on for more data points.Informed investors will base their valuation on more than just the enterprise value to sales ratio for this year or next year. From our model, we see that in 5 years, the valuation will be only 3x sales but still be expected to grow 30% a year.Proven Ability to ExecuteShopify's execution in the last 5 years is clear proof to us of their ability to execute, as they doubled revenues in 2013 and 2014, and nearly doubled them in 2015 and 2016.Imagine how difficult it is to go from 131 employees at the end of 2012 to 632 employees by March 31, 2015. Shopify added 501 employees to a base of only 131 in only 2 years and 3 months. Meanwhile, they were able to maintain their culture of long-term thinking and innovation.Two years later and the employee count has tripled to over 1900 today. The cogs kept spinning smoothly throughout the last 4-5 years despite this rapid internal change. Many companies would have failed to succeed as the business grew out of the start-up stage, but not Shopify. They have found guidance from directors on their board to grow while maintaining their independence. This gives us confidence in their ability to execute and maintain their culture even as they continue to grow rapidly in both employees and revenue.Macro Tail Winds - A Rising Tide Lifts All The BoatsThe tailwinds from online retail adoption versus physical retail should lift all e-commerce related companies. This is one of those data points that is driving widespread uninformed investors to invest in Shopify. They are jumping on the bandwagon. Many are using Shopify to add e-commerce exposure to their portfolio without understanding the underlying business giving them that exposure. This creates a flow of money tied to e-commerce data points. If the macro data is stronger than expected, Shopify shares may rise. And if it's weaker, then Shopify shares may fall.Source: ShopifyIn 2016, US e-commerce sales were $395 billion according to the US Census Bureau, +15% y/y and accounting for only 8.1% of total retail sales. As the shift to online sales continues to rise, Shopify should see more gross merchandise volume (GMV) being transacted over its platform. Total retail sales in the US was $4.8 trillion in 2016, so there is plenty of room for growth as e-commerce as a whole penetrates further into the overall retail sales.Our forecast model does not imply a further acceleration of this trend. E-commerce has moved passed the Innovators phase of the technology adoption life cycle into the Early Adopters phase. When e-commerce approaches Early Majority and Late Majority phases, merchant additions and GMV could see accelerated growth even faster than we have already experienced.Summing It All UpWe believe there are two main types of investors of Shopify.The uninformed investor is buying and selling on short-term valuation metrics, ""stock tips"", and macro data related to retail and e-commerce.The informed investor is buying with a proper rationale of how much potential revenue Shopify could generate in the next 5 to 10 years.The risk is in the eye of the beholder. If you have done your homework and know the company you are investing in inside and out, then the investment risk is much lower. The more you know, the less risky it will be to you.Those on the ""outside"" who have not done their homework, but insist on ""investing"" create a risky situation for themselves. When prices start to move up or down, how does an uninformed investor make a decision to buy, sell or hold?Uninformed investors cannot eliminate emotion from that decision because they never had the right logic when they bought the stock in the first place. This creates opportunities for informed investors to buy stock for low prices.ConclusionWe believe Shopify can get to $1 billion in free cash flow in 10 years. And that will be the floor going forward.Getting there will require merchant growth of 18-27% CAGR, compared historically to their 73% CAGR in the last 4 years.The current enterprise value to sale multiple is 12x our 2017 sales and 7.7x our 2018 sales. But in 5 years we expect that to drop to 3x while still having 30% y/y growth prospects.Lastly, Shopify's ability to execute is clearly proven to us. Over the last 5 years, they have grown their employees from 131 to over 1900 while maintaining their innovative culture and long-term perspective. The next 5-10 years is going to require the rapid addition of employees to achieve the growth necessary to justify the current stock price. Given its history, we believe Shopify can handle the challenge ahead.We are long-term shareholders with a fair value of $90/share. See Shopify: Cash is Cash, M&A is Upside for more details on our fair value.In the event of a widespread market pullback, we would be buyers of Shopify to position ourselves for the next 5-10 years.Check out our article Shopify in a Recession, to see why we think Shopify could drop 40-60% in the event of a widespread market pullback.If you like our insight you can follow us in real-time."

It will begin trading on the index on June 19, 2017. See the announcement from S&P here.We expect investors benchmarking the index will start to accumulate Shopify shares as a result of this announcement. Additionally, institutional investors which benchmark the index will look to buy significant amounts of shares at the close of market on June 16, 2017.In the Long TermFunds that are benchmarked to the index will likely hold their position indefinitely, thereby removing a significant number of shares from circulation. This will reduce the supply of shares that will be actively traded, potentially increasing the volatility of the stock price.Now a wider base of investors (who only buy stocks in the S&P TSX Composite index) can add Shopify to their portfolios.The impact on the long-term price of shares could be considered non-material. These shares are not physically being removed from circulation like a share buyback would, they are just being held by funds that likely won't sell. Fundamentally nothing changes with regards to the company.In the Short TermThere will be an increase in demand for shares in the short erm from index funds. Holding all other factors constant means the price could move up.As index funds, these will not be price-sensitive buyers. These indexes have the mandate to own the exact weighting of the index regardless of the price because that is what investors in these indexes expect.The index does not set limit orders or stop losses. They buy at market. And when anyone buys large quantities of shares at market, prices tend to move.In an article from The Globe And Mail, ""Scotia estimates passive investors such as index funds will buy approximately 5 percent of Shopify's stock, or 5.4 million shares if the company joins the S&P/TSX composite.""We caution that other factors may come into play, so don't think the stock can only move one direction on this catalyst. Time the market at your own risk. Exhibit A, Friday's tech sell-off.The impact on US-traded sharesFor stocks that are dual listed like Shopify, the shares can be traded on either exchange. The difference in the share price is usually only the foreign exchange rate.In Shopify's case with about 98 million shares outstanding, those 98 million shares can freely be traded in Canada or the US under either ticker.If you own 100 shares of Shopify in the US at US$92/share, you can ask your broker to sell those 100 shares on the Canadian Exchange at ~C$124/share. In either case you would be no better off given the exchange rate, and assuming you want to hold Canadian dollars.This means that as a shareholder of the US listed shares, if there is reduced supply of shares in Canada, then there is equally reduced supply of shares in the US.To Sum It All UpWe are long-term shareholders of Shopify. Being added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index is positive news for investors who are long the stock as a wider base of investors can add Shopify to their portfolios.In the short term, there may be an opportunity to take advantage of demand from index funds that are not price sensitive. The majority of index buying will occur near the close of market on Friday, June 16, so they can be perfectly weighted to the S&P/TSX Composite Index when trading starts on Monday, June 19.Follow us if you want to get our insights in real time."
4080132,103149,2017-06-08T16:59:06-04:00,"Shopify is now flush with cash with over $900 million. We only value the cash as cash. If the company makes more acquisitions like Kit, it could be worth much more.We expect 10% long-term annual returns on our money. At a 10% discount rate, our fair value is adjusted to $90/share from $91/share post equity raise.Other investors with access to cheaper money or with lower expectations for long-term returns could calculate a higher fair value than us.With an 8-9% discount rate, our model yields a share price between $109 and $136.","With Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) 2nd Annual Shareholder meeting earlier this week and the recent run-up of the stock post equity raise, we want to revisit our fair value DCF. Currently, shares are trading at around $97. Not long ago on May 19, we posted an article ""Shopify: Cheap Or Expensive?"" arguing a fair value of $91/share.Since we posted the article, we have a little bit of new information that should affect our fair value: the closing of the equity raise, and Kit CRM being offered to all merchants for free.We are not changing our expectations for the growth prospects from an organic/internal growth perspective. However, Shopify is now flush with cash. What the company ends up using the $957 million for will impact our fair value. But, for now, we can only value it as cash.To jump ahead to the conclusion, our fair value gets adjusted down to $90/share after the equity raise using our 10% discount rate. Other investors with access to cheaper money or with lower expectations for long-term returns could calculate a higher fair value than us. At a discount rate of 8-9%, our fair value calculation moves up to $109-136/share. Also, we see a scenario where Kit could be worth $4/share above our fair value.A Quick Word on The Annual Shareholder MeetingWe were hoping for more from the live webcast, but it was disconnected after the shareholder voting. All items were passed.But given there was a ""packed house"", as indicated at the start of the meeting, we expect there were some post-meeting stories that could have built up some additional color around the business prospects. Next year, we may need to fly out to Ottawa to take part.The webcast was streamed live on YouTube and peaked to a mere 61 viewers, by our recollection.Kit CRM is now free for all merchantsKit is a virtual employee that enables merchants to focus on their business. It finds customers by creating marketing campaigns on Facebook and other advertising channels. According to Tech Crunch, the core marketing features of Kit will be free for merchants, while nearly 20 skills will be available for merchants to upgrade. The skills are third-party apps which are compatible with Kit's AI interface. These other skills can ask customers to write product reviews, create holiday promotions, automate invoices, manage SEO and more.(Source: Kit)Kit's revenue model becomes two-fold. First, increase sales for all merchants with the free core marketing features, thereby increasing Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) and Merchant Solutions revenue.The second is to increase Shopify App Store revenue when merchants add skills. These skills are third-party apps which charge both one-time and monthly subscriptions. Shopify makes 20% of the app price, increasing Subscription Solutions revenue. We estimate the average monthly subscription per app is $30, though some advanced options can go for over $699 per month.Kit was previously offered for $10-25 per month for the core features. We believe with the exposure to a wider audience, it gains the potential to more than justify the loss of revenue.The additional benefit that is less apparent and harder to quantify is the potential to drive new merchants onto Shopify.Shopify acquired Kit in April 2016 for $8.25 million. Kit is a service that is only available to Shopify merchants. Now that it's free, more small businesses that can't afford to hire someone to do marketing may consider using Shopify. On top of this, many new merchants may fail because they don't know how to get their first customers. Kit will be their first employee and help them find their first customers, potentially reducing merchant churn.Shopify is investing in merchant success, especially new merchant success. Keeping new merchants on the platform and showing them how to be successful is how it will be successful. It builds on the brand that Shopify is viewed as a platform that is easy to use, where merchants can make more money than the alternative.Imagine being a new merchant that used Kit to successfully make sales. If you saw a good return on your advertising investment, you would be much more likely to pay for another skill that could help your business grow even more. Shopify has completely removed the barrier for new business owners to get their business off the ground.How Can Shopify Breakeven When Kit Is FreeShopify says Kit is already enjoying strong adoption, with 800% growth in adoption since it came in-house. If we assume the company paid 10x revenue for Kit, we estimate Shopify has about 10% of its merchants paying for Kit. For reference, at the time of acquisition, we calculate Shopify was trading around 8x its guidance revenue for 2016.Hypothetically, let's say 10% of Shopify merchants pay on average $15 per month to use Kit and 10% of those Kit users paid $30 per month for additional skill apps. To break even in the first year, 26% of Shopify merchants would need to buy skills app upgrades at $30 per month.The improvement in GMV for all merchants and any improvement to net new merchant additions (and reduced churn) is all upside.The Type Of Acquisitions Shopify Needs To MakeCould Kit's business model change drive faster growth and a higher share price?We calculate that for Kit to drive an incremental 2.5% higher subscription solutions revenue every year in our model, it would need to see 50% of merchants upgrade to a skill that costs $30/month. Without accounting for any merchant acquisition synergies or GMV growth, this 2.5% subscription revenue increase would be worth $4/share in our model.Considering that Kit was acquired for $8.25 million just over a year ago, in this scenario, if it can add $4/share in value to Shopify, that would value it at an incremental $400 million.But, we cannot assign this incremental value to Shopify just yet. Kit needs to show that this new business model will be able to capture 5 times more merchants than before.In future earnings releases, we will be looking for the following:Shopify will likely not provide us any of this data specifically, but any indications would be helpful.These are the types of businesses we hope the company will invest its $957 million in. These are businesses that currently have a small customer base, but when exposed to Shopify's 400,000 and growing merchants, can be worth multiples more over time.Current Market Price Versus Our Fair ValueSince we published our fair value of Shopify at $91/shares on May 19, the company has closed its equity raise, adding 6.325 million shares and collecting net proceeds of $561 million. From the prospectus, the total shares outstanding on May 15, 2017, were given at 91.7 million. Adding the 6.325 million shares gives us a total of 98.05 million shares outstanding. With cash at the end of 1Q17 of $395.7 million, we estimate current cash at $957 million.Making these changes reduces our fair value to $90/share, or 7% below the current market price.Some might say the market is not efficient. But we know it is the nature of markets to be inefficient in the short term. In the long term, markets tend to follow the fundamentals.How far can Shopify go? Our terminal growth after 10 years: 3%Our discount rate is our expectation of return for our money in the long run. Some investors have a much lower expectation of return for their money. We are expecting 10%.A 9% discount rate would put the fair value at $109/share and 8% would put it at $136/share. So we can see how the stock price could move up from our fair value just by investors with cheaper money or lower return expectations getting into the stock.In a previous article, we outlined our full 10-year forecast.ConclusionShopify acquired Kit CRM a year ago, and it just announced it is going to offer the core features to all merchants for free. We think this is a huge opportunity and a big win for new merchants. If this gambit works and Shopify can get 50% of its merchants to pay for upgraded features, we could see a 2.5% upside to subscription revenues. This scenario could add $4/share to the stock price. But it is still early days, so we have not priced this into our fair value.To us, Shopify is trading 7% above our fair value. But we are long-term shareholders, so we are not selling at this small premium. We believe there are investors with lower costs of capital and lower expectations for long-term returns than us. We expect 10% return on our money in the long term. If other investors of Shopify expect 8-9% return on their money, the fair value of the stock goes from our $90/share up to $109-136/share.One More ThingShopify potentially could be added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index. In a previous article, we went into more detail on this. Based on our calculations, the company should meet the liquidity requirements to be included in the index. Regardless of whether Shopify is added to the index or not, we are expecting a press release to announce all the other additions and deletions on Friday, June 9 (usually aftermarket).If you like our insight, please consider following us."
4078560,28141,2017-06-04T14:48:46-04:00,Executive management suspends guidance on quarterly KPI: Merchant additions.This signals the possibility of slower merchant growth rates.Examination of past conference calls' tone and information.,"After many months of research and analysis on e-commerce platforms, the competitive landscape, and Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) executive management, my investment thesis on SHOP's overvaluation and a shorting candidate remains solid.While I understand that many investors don't short, please utilize my analysis as a guide to your investing activities and properly allocate capital based on your risk tolerances and financial condition.This article is an expansion to my previous articles:For the record, I admire what CEO Tobi Lutke has accomplished as co-founder of Shopify. He has created an incredible tool for SMBs. I believe his leadership and vision will allow for continued success in this industry.CEO Lutke is seemingly candid and focused on the company's mission, he is vigilantly focused on building an e-commerce platform from the bottom-up for SMBs. The success is evident with incredible growth in merchant additions in 2015 and 2016. They are trending up and capturing market share. Capturing new merchants will in turn capture more market share, the leading indicator for a company's dominance.My suspicions of a slowing growth rate in merchant additions look to be confirmed in the latest pivot by executive management. If you remember, I was extremely critical of executive management's revenue recognition practices on merchant solutions and moving merchant processing chargebacks down to G&A.I made the bold statement that executive management (more so on CFO Russ Jones) is earning a reputation of misleading investors and dressing up results.After careful analysis of the information and tone of the conference calls, CFO Russ Jones is at it again.Pivoting Away from KPI - Merchant AdditionsIt is telling when management highlights specific metrics when they complement it and stops when they do not. After only seven reporting quarters, executive management has decided that this quarterly milestone, which was a bulleted point previously, is a longer, important metric for the investing community.This is alarming because Shopify is valued on the premise of market share growth. The CFO has suggested it has caused confusion and we should focus our attention to MRR and GMV growth. MRR is an important metric, but lumping in subscription fees that range from $25 to $40,000 monthly actually creates more confusion on Shopify's progress.Low-Hanging Fruit Picked?This major pivot only creates more questions and more confusion. The investor must evaluate if Shopify has signaled that the low-hanging fruit for merchant additions has been harvested. Has competition increased significantly in the SMB market? Is a dramatically slower growth rate in merchant additions on the horizon?Let's throw Our Hefty Purse at Shopify PlusIn the past couple of conference calls, there has been a large amount of attention on Shopify Plus. Shopify Plus is the enterprise version of Shopify which captures large monthly MRRs and GMVs.According the CEO, this is not Shopify's core business (2,500 of the 400,000 subs), only an extension for its more successful merchants. CEO Lutke talks about Shopify Plus sparingly, yet, his executive managers have spent a whole lot of attention on it.Shopify's push for larger customers with Plus will provide the growth in MRR and GMV that management is pointing to. Its campaign in Q4 is to capture Magento clients who are weighing the option to upgrade to Magento's new offering, Magento 2. I expect these conversions to be much more expensive because it will require larger amounts of resources and incentives to attract the Magento defector.While management would like the investor to ignore merchant additions now, we know that merchant additions are the key component of its platform success.Below I copy and pasted significant quotes from CFO Russ Jones from the past conference calls.Russ Jones communicating the importance of the company's net additions to growth in his opening statement:Source: Q4-2016 Conference CallOnly a quarter later, this important metric is missing from his opening remarks. Thankfully, a diligent analyst is helping us out…Source: Q1-2017Wait, did you just say net additions were more than Q4!?!? That is incredibly significant since you added 50k new merchants in Q4! Especially since you disclose below the Q1 is slower on merchant adds.Later on in the call… an analyst wants to confirm what Russ Jones just said…This is complete non-sense, management could easily provide a Shopify Plus breakdown and continue to provide merchant addition data without confusion.Below CFO Russ Jones provides color on the seasonality of merchant growth from Q4 to Q1 on the Q1 2016 conference call.Q1-2016 Conference CallSo let's review this. Shopify apparently doubled the quarterly net additions YoY in Q1 and surpassed the net additions from Q4'2016. Yet it abandoned the metric and did not guide whether it was expecting strong merchant growth. To date, Shopify has not clarified or updated its merchant count.The CFO's botched answer on Q1 2017 additions leaves me scratching my head. I believe the correct answer is the company added more merchants to its cumulative base; my estimate is approximately 400k, not 430k.Dressing Up Results for the Quarters AheadLet's go back to the most recent Q1 2017 conference call. Apparently, CFO Russ Jones hasn't figured out how to recognize sales from Shopify Plus just yet. I promise you it will make results look as good as possible, especially, if Subscription Solution sales growth is waning.Source Q1 2017 Conference CallSummary & ConclusionManagement suspending key quarterly merchant metrics could signal that merchant growth is slowing significantly. Shopify's current valuation and case for future gains are based on the expectations that it will continue to grow its SMB merchant base rapidly.In the quarters ahead, I will be watching closely on its results. A change in sentiment because of missed expectations could significantly reduce Shopify's stock price.Please stay tuned to my next article, Shortify Shopify - Part 3, where I plan to share my thoughts on future growth, SMB e-commerce market share, and testing SHOP's core-market TAM."

4078005,38311,2017-06-01T09:52:35-04:00,"Shopify is growing its top line at a high rate.
        The two sources of its revenue are subscription solutions and merchant solutions.
        The subscription solutions revenues are recurring. The merchant solutions revenues are dependent on merchants' success in growing their sales.","Shopify Inc. [TSX:SHOP](NYSE:SHOP) has been on a tear. Year-to-date, alone, the stock has appreciated 114%, which greatly outperformed iShares S&P 500 Growth Index (NYSEARCA:IVW) and SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF (NYSEARCA:MDY).Source: Google FinanceIn my last article, along with the comments that followed, we explored whether the growth stock is a good buy today. In this article, I focus on how Shopify is growing in numerous ways.Targeting small and medium-sized businessesShopify's target market is small and medium-sized businesses. By getting these smaller merchants to sign on with its platform when they're small, Shopify can grow when these merchants grow bigger.For example, most of Shopify's merchants are on subscription plans that cost less than $50 per month, but Shopify's advanced plan costs $299 per month.Generating recurring revenueShopify's subscription plans generate recurring revenue. Its monthly recurring revenue (""MRR"") in Q1 was $20.7 million, which was 62.2% higher than in Q1 2016.The MRR is one of the key performance indicators that Shopify tracks. Management believes it correlated with the long-term value of its merchant relationships. As defined by management, it is calculated ""at the end of each period by multiplying the number of merchants who have subscription plans with us at the period end date by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period, assuming they maintain their subscription plans the following month"".Growing its ecosystemShopify's ecosystem consists of app developers, theme designers, and other partners. As of the end of Q1, there were about 1,500 apps available in Shopify's app store. The ecosystem improves the functionality, customizability, and flexibility of the Shopify platform. Ultimately, it helps to drive the growth of Shopify's revenue and merchant base.Nearly half of Shopify's revenues come from subscription solutions, which is a recurring subscription component. This includes the sale of subscriptions to its platform, and the sale of themes, apps and the registration of domain names.This component accounted for 48.7% of Shopify's total revenues in the first quarter. Subscription solutions revenues were $62.1 million in Q1 2017, which was 60.4% higher than they were in Q1 2016.Catering to large merchantsShopify's highest-end plan, Shopify Plus, starts at a rate that is several times that of its advanced plan. Shopify Plus is designed for merchants with high-volume sales and the need for additional functionality, scalability, and support. Shopify also offers a dedicated Merchant Success Manager for these clients. Its Shopify Plus merchants include multinational brands such as Unilever and Nestlé.Processing more sales through its systemThe other major component of Shopify's revenues is merchant solutions, whose success is reliant on merchants' success. In Q1, this component accounted for 51.3% of total revenues. Shopify principally generates merchant solutions revenues from payment processing services that allow its merchants to accept and process payment cards online and offline.As a result, the more transactions occur through the platform, the higher this component of revenue will be. The gross merchandise volume (""GMV"") is another key performance indicator that Shopify tracks. GMV is defined by the company as ""the total dollar value of orders processed directly through its platform in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes"".The more sales Shopify's merchants make, the more likely they are to continue using Shopify, and the more revenue is generated for Shopify.Shopify's Q1 GMV was $4.8 billion, which was 81.2% higher than it was in Q1 2016.A future revenue generator?McDusty suggested a potential idea for Shopify's future revenue generator in my previous article:SummaryShopify is rapidly growing its market share of the e-commerce pie through its focus on targeting small to medium-sized businesses, its ability to cater to enterprises with high-volume sales, its expanding ecosystem, and its recurring revenues.Share your thoughts in the comments belowAuthor's note: If you like what you've just read, consider following me.

It easily eclipsed the FANG stocks (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (i.e. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG)), which ""only"" appreciated 27-58% in the period.Source: Google FinanceYou can't argue against Shopify's outperformance, except that it hasn't turned a profit - yet. The company is expected to start making a profit as soon as late this year.What does Shopify do?Shopify helps merchants sell their products by providing a simple, unified, multi-channel commerce platform. It targets small to medium sized businesses. However, its solutions can add value for large enterprises as well.Shopping today is different from shopping 10 years ago. Nowadays, merchants may sell their products through their online store, their physical stores, marketplaces, social media, mobile apps, and other sales channels.Shopify ""provides (merchants) with a single view of their business and customers across all of their sales channels and enables them to manage products and inventory, process orders and payments, ship orders, build customer relationships, and leverage analytics and reporting from one integrated back office"". - 2016 annual report (pdf)Rapid growthFrom small to big merchants who want to build their brands, Shopify will probably have a plan that fits their needs and budget. Shopify offers a $9-per-month plan for merchants selling on Facebook, which is great for small businesses that already have a following on their Facebook page and would like to sell their products there as an extra sales channel.As well, Shopify has basic to advanced plans, which cost $29-299 every month. Shopify's platform can handle large spikes in traffic from events, such as new product releases, holiday shopping seasons, and flash sales. Here's an example with Nestlé (OTCPK:NSRGY). Other Shopify Plus clients include Wikipedia and Alphabet.Shopify's growth strategies focus on growing its merchant base. At the end of 2016, Shopify had more than 377,500 merchants from roughly 175 countries using its platform. Specifically, 58% were in the U.S., 10% were in the U.K., 7% in Canada and Australia, respectively, and 18% elsewhere on the globe. This suggests there's much room for potential international growth in the future.Shopify can grow from an increasing number of merchants using its platform, and as its smaller merchants grow their businesses and upgrade their monthly plans.From 2013 to 2016, Shopify grew its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 98%. This year, management expects to grow its revenue by 49-54% to $580-600 million.Recently, Shopify had a stock offering at $91 per share for gross proceeds of $500,500,000. The shares dropped on the news but more than recovered on the day, indicating there's strong demand for its stock. The company plans to use the proceeds to ""strengthen its balance sheet, providing flexibility to fund its growth strategies.""ProfitabilityShopify is not profitable, but it can turn a profit right now if it wanted to. It has a higher priority on its marketing efforts to get more merchants on its platform.In 2016, Shopify spent about $129.2 million in sales and marketing and experienced a net loss of about $35.4 million. If management had wanted to turn a profit, it could have reduced its sales and marketing efforts. However, it makes sense to invest in expanding its merchant base for future growth.Investor TakeawayShopify is growing at a rapid pace, but it trades at sky-high valuations: price/book of 21.5 and price/sales of 17.7. It's difficult to determine how high a valuation one should pay for the high-growth shares. (It depends on how much you want the shares.)As a primarily value and dividend investor, it's hard for me to wrap my head around a growth stock, such as Shopify. However, within a portfolio of primarily value and dividend stocks, Shopify can be added to spice things up with the intent of rapid growth.My biggest concern is that in a market-wide decline, Shopify, like other growth stocks, will likely fall much harder than more defensive stocks such as utilities which offer stable dividends and tend to hike their payouts every year.Some even say that Shopify is a speculative investment with its sky-high valuations and the fact that it is not currently profitable.If you choose to buy some shares now, consider a partial position with the mindset to build a position over time, possibly adding on dips. I think shares bought now will be fine for a long-term investment of five years or longer. Just be ready to buy more if shares fall hard in a market-wide decline.Share your thoughts in the comments belowAuthor's note: If you like what you've just read, consider following me.

4077647,102008,2017-05-31T10:41:13-04:00,Shopify has run “too far too fast” and it seems investors may be pricing in unreasonable expectations for the next 12-18 months.Gross and operating margins have improved over the past three years but are still inferior to rest of the industry which is a cause for concern given its premium valuation.I have reduced my position over the past three months and am moving to a Neutral stance in the short term.,"Back when I first initiated coverage on relatively unknown Canadian SaaS platform Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) in June 2016, shares were trading at a respectable forward EV/revenue multiple of around 7.1x, which was in-line with its peers despite growing revenues at nearly double the peer average. With shares up ~200% over the past 12 months and ~100% year-to-date, mainstream investors have come attacking with traditional bear arguments including the infamous ""short on valuation"" call, ignoring the fact that the company has only penetrated ~3% of its $12 billion TAM (note: company increasing TAM from $10B to $12B as of Q1 2017). Despite reporting another stellar quarter in Q1 with total revenue up 75% to $127.4 million, I would err on the side of caution at current levels with shares now trading at a 12.6x 2017 EV/revenue multiple, a substantial premium to its peer group. That said, I'm moving to a Neutral stance on the company and arrive at a $94 price target, derived using 2017 revenue projections of $651 million and a 12.5x EV/revenue (2017) multiple.Another quarter of record merchant and ARPM growth underscores the long-term growth trajectory. As usual, the company stuck to its disclosure format of only providing an update on the merchant count every few quarters but did admit on the call that the number of merchants added exceeded the net addition of around 50K in Q4 2016. Given that the company did not explicitly provide an update this time around, I think it would be safe to assume that the merchant count is well above 400K. Moreover, with a fair amount of churn which would be expected in the down-market/SMB space and given the fact that every disclosure on merchant count has come in increments of 25K, I decided on 400K as an appropriate model input. Average revenue per merchant (ARPM) growth y/y reached a multi-quarter high at roughly 20%, assuming ~$318/merchant for the quarter. More importantly, it appears that merchants on the higher end ""Advanced"" and ""Plus"" plans are beginning to shine as increasingly valuable parts of core business, noted on the call by COO Harley Finkelstein who stated that more than 50% of the gross merchandise volume (GMV) run through the platform came from either of the two plans. For reference, merchants on the Advanced plan pay ~$299/month and plans for the enterprise/Plus customers range anywhere from $2,000-$40,000/month. Furthermore, an increase in the number of merchants on higher tier plans will result in more merchants accessing the add-on tools of Shipping, Payments, and Capital. Note that gross margins were slightly depressed in Q4 of last year due to the holiday season as the mix between the subscription and merchant solutions portions shifted to a 43/57 split, compared to the even 50/50 that was seen in Q3. While the Payments side has been a point of weakness since the company pays a substantial portion of fees for interchange and processing, I think the idea of encouraging merchants to stick within the Shopify ecosystem for most of their e-commerce needs bodes well for the long run, even at the cost of sacrificing margins in the short term. Additionally, CFO Russ Jones did point out on the call that as the number of merchants outside North America continue to grow, margins on the merchant solutions side should expand due to more favorable agreements outside North America ($12B key geographies include: US, Canada, UK, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand). In fact, gross margins on the merchant solutions side were up 13% y/y to 36% for the first quarter, and are up 17% compared to two years ago.Figure 1: ARPM Q2 2015 - Q1 2017(Source: Company filings)Management execution remains solid with operating margins improving 5% y/y from Q1 2016. 2016 was a significant investment year for the company with the acquisition of Boltmade (~$1-1.5 million expense hit add-on in Q4), launch of first annual Unite conference, and the hiring of a dedicated new sales team for Plus customers (headcount at 30 as of Q3 2016). It seems that the main reason for the sequential decline in operating margin from Q4 2016 to Q1 2017 came courtesy of the aggressive online marketing, particularly against main competitor Magento. For example, a search for competitor Magento yields a Shopify paid advertisement, which is extremely common to see in the software space but is worthwhile noting that this specific placement ranks amongst the highest in terms of cost-per-click for the advertiser. Regarding operating/net profitability, management did not provide an update to the previous guide of the fourth quarter of this year, thus I'm keeping consistent with that timeline given that spending (albeit less than 2016) will remain aggressive in 2017.Figure 2: Shopify Adwords Placement(Source: Personal search)Moving to a Neutral stance as most the upside has been captured YTD and the remainder of the growth will rely on a ""show-me"" story. The peer group shown below is trading at an average of 6.8x 2017 EV/revenue estimates with the group averaging ~27% of revenue growth from 2016-2017. While Shopify remains a best-of-breed platform, it still suffers from inferior gross and operating margins, which are understandable growing pains for the time being but are potent enough to derail the rosy growth story into 2020. With shares at 12.5x, there is practically zero room for error in the event the company is unable to deliver on profitability and margin upside. Moreover, while revenue growth is substantially above any of its peers, it simply doesn't warrant the rich valuation being assigned currently. On a price/sales basis, Shopify trades at an even larger premium to its peer group (21x 2016 sales). The next best peer would be ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), trading at 12.9x 2016 sales, 9.3x EV/revenue, and ranks just behind Shopify in terms of revenue growth at 34%.Figure 3: Updated Peer Metrics and Comparables(Source: Bloomberg, Estimize estimates, Company filings)Model UpdateFigure 4: Shopify Updated Income Statement Projections(Source: Personal estimates, Company filings)The company raised the midpoint of guidance for FY2017 by $32.5 million (5.5%) in the Q1 report, and I do fully expect them to continue to raise guidance throughout the year as they have done on a quarterly basis since coming public. For the second quarter, I'm projecting ~$147.8 million in sales, 3% of gross margin improvement y/y, and EPS -$0.05 on an adjusted basis. I am above consensus estimates by roughly 2.5%. For FY2017, I am projecting revenue to come in at $651 million, representing growth of 67% y/y. Granted, this is slightly aggressive compared to projections I have made in the past (4.5% above management guidance, 5% above consensus) but I do think it is important to price in any upward revisions in a scenario where a company consistently low-balls guidance. Note that I do expect overall gross margins to increase to 56% in FY2017 but I'm cautious on this revision given that gross margins will remain highly correlated with Payments and will only improve if Capital and Shipping become a larger part of the merchant solutions mix.I have modeled out the income statement through 2020, where I expect revenue growth to slow to 25% y/y bringing total revenue to ~$1.5 billion, and operating margin to reach ~11%. Moreover, I expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to fall to ~30%, R&D expense to fall to ~17%, and G&A expense to fall to ~9% in year 2020.Figure 5: Shopify Updated Valuation Summary(Source: Personal estimates, Company filings)Note: Data as of market close, May 30 th, 2017."
4076355,103149,2017-05-25T05:14:26-04:00,"Shopify Pay is a game-changing solution that will change consumer behavior to how online shopping should be. Easy!
        Big retailers are shutting the doors. More brick and mortar stores have closed this year than all of last year. This is probably not cyclical.
        There are so many e-commerce platform providers for brick and mortar retailers to choose from. But we believe Shopify has the one thing the other don't have. Shopify Pay.
        Shopify Pay is a big win, long-term play on e-commerce. Shopify is reducing the friction for customers to make purchases.","We believe Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has introduced a game-changing solution. Shopify Pay for Shopify Payments. Think Apple Pay for Shopify merchants and their customers. A universal payment platform, where your payment and shipping information is saved securely with Shopify. Every Shopify merchant with Shopify Pay enabled will allow a customer to access their payment information with only an email address and an authentication code sent to their smartphone. That's two-touch payments, and so much easier on a smartphone than the alternative.Shopify is reducing the friction for customers to make purchases. This is a ""big win"" for Shopify in the hyper-competitive e-commerce space. We believe Shopify's end to end capability with Shopify Payments is a huge differentiator to its competition. We believe Shopify Pay will drive higher Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) for its merchants, we also believe it will drive more merchants onto Shopify Payments to drive higher Gross Processing Volume (GPV). This is further evidence to justify our long-term forecast.E-commerce vs Brick & MortarYesterday, we listened to the replay of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) 2Q17 earnings call. Something very interesting was said.""Before getting into Starbucks' Q2 results, I thought I'd comment on a recent Wall Street Journal article noting that more retail stores have closed in the first quarter of the calendar year 2017 than closed in all of 2016. And that more retail stores are expected to close in the U.S. this year than closed in any year during the Great Recession that began in 2008. The article illuminated once again the seismic shift in consumer behavior underway and the devastating impact that this sea change in behavior is having on many traditional brick and mortar retailers."" - CEO of Starbucks Kevin Johnson (transcript)In the article from the Wall Street Journal, Credit Suisse, estimates 8600 US retail locations will close in 2017, while 2880 were announced through April 6. For comparison about 2000 stores were closed in 2016 and 5000 in 2015. See the chart below.Many of these companies have built supply chains around brick and mortar retail. While many online merchants are ""online-first"", many of these brick and mortar retailers have hard investments in a strategy that has worked for them in the past. Making the change is a much harder decision and requires a different skill set. Instead of only competing with the stores in their city or in their mall, they now must compete with every online retailer in the world.There are many solutions for these retailers to make their way online. Including (but not limited to): Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, Volusion, WIX, Woocommerce, Shopping Cart Elite, X-Cart, 1 Shopping Cart, Netsuite, Clarity-Ventures, Weebly, 3dCart, Baozun.We don't pretend to know the ins and outs of every solution out there. You can do a web search for head-to-head reviews from web designers and experts for that.What we do want to point out is that Shopify has been able to grow at a rapid rate over the last few years, despite the volume of competition. So either the market opportunity is so large that it is lifting all boats or Shopify is doing something special and some merchants are recognizing it.The Long GameFrom an investment point of view, we are looking for signs of a solution that is playing the long game and solving the big wins. While we are big believers in doing the little things right, we think it is just as important to look for those big wins that might take years to develop, but lock in a competitive advantage. We are looking for the difference between saving a couple of bucks on a cup of coffee and saving thousands on a mortgage or car payments.Shopify is developing their long-term competitive advantage with Shopify Pay. Not to be confused with Shopify Payments which is Shopify's payment gateway. Shopify Pay is a unique feature to Shopify Payments and not available with any third party payment gateways, where customers no longer need to spend time typing in their shipping and payment details on a Shopify store.Imagine wanting to make an impulse purchase at a brick and mortar store, it's easy to pull out your phone, credit card, or cash to pay and go. There is almost no friction in getting you together with your new toy. With Shopify Pay, that experience is being brought to online shopping.After entering shipping and payment details the first time at a Shopify Pay enabled store, the customer will be asked to save their information with Shopify Pay. On future purchases, they only need to type in their email address and a verification code they receive via SMS. If you have ever used Apple Pay, the concept is similar, except without Touch ID. We believe this solution will increase conversion for purchases made by mobile phones. According to Criteo, mobile will account for 70% of e-commerce sales by the end of 2017, up from 40% in 2015.Link to a gif of how Shopify Pay worksShopify has removed a barrier to conversion for merchants. This is a ""big win"" feature that, we believe, other e-commerce solutions cannot provide today. From what we have seen, Shopify's competitors, are not focused on developing their payment solutions business, and rather leaving those services to third parties. Shopify has understood from the very beginning that e-commerce is more than just a website where people can select items to put into their shopping cart. The key to making online shopping easy is to make shipping easy, and payment easy. These are the things that stop customers from following through with a purchase.Retailers already using Shopify Pay have seen checkout completion times up to 40% faster, and 18% higher conversion for returning customers.The Network EffectBecause Shopify Pay is going to be put front and centre on merchant shopping carts, Shopify will gain brand exposure from this service as well.Shopify Pay not only benefits customers returning to the same merchant but also benefits customers shopping on other Shopify merchant stores. Enabling Shopify Pay brings the added benefit of a network of other merchants that have pioneered online payments with their customers. Instead of each merchant storing credit card information Shopify Pay stores it, so it can be used for thousands of merchants.ConclusionIn a world where enterprise level brick and mortar retailers are closing shop, Shopify is offering solutions like Shopify Plus to bring these high volume retailers online. While some may say Shopify does not have the most options and capabilities of the smaller more agile solution providers, we believe Shopify is gaining the scale necessary to offer innovative and higher value solutions like Shopify Pay. It is still early days, but as Shopify expands the availability of Shopify Payments to more countries, it will be able to do the same for Shopify Pay and other unique solutions.In our 10-year Revenue Forecast , we see Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growing from $15.4 billion in 2016 to over $300 billion in 2026. We believe Shopify Pay is one of those features that will help merchants reach that level of transaction volume and at the same time drive Gross Processing Volume (GPV) on Shopify Payments. Consumers are going to find purchasing online to be easier and easier, even on their mobile phones.This is further evidence to justify our long-term forecast. We are long-term shareholders of Shopify."
4073795,103149,2017-05-16T14:25:09-04:00,"In our last article, we provided a deep dive into our 10-year revenue forecast. Now we look at the cost of revenue.Shopify's rapid merchant scaling is driving opportunities for high margin solutions.In 10 years, we forecast revenue of $7.6 billion and gross profit of $3.6 billion. We expect overall gross margin to decline to 48%.","Scale Drives Opportunities For High Margin Solutions.Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has automation and scale built into their business model. The same 100 employees in 2016 will likely onboard a different number of merchants in 2017. With automation and scale, merchant acquisition is becoming a flywheel that keeps spinning faster, even though they continue to apply the same force. Adding a new marketing channel or partnership (like with Amazon) can be a catalyst for this growth.As the number of merchants on Shopify's platform increases, Shopify can leverage this scale with value-added service providers like how it has negotiated a cut of the profit with Stripe for Shopify Payments and USPS, UPS, FedEx and Canada Post for Shopify Shipping.Rewind for contextIn our last article (Shopify: 10-Year Revenue Forecast), we presented our assumptions and forecasts for Shopify's revenue over the next 10 years. With a deep dive into 2017 revenue forecast versus management guidance.We think it's important to recognize that a 10-year forecast is probably not going to be fully realized. What's important about a 10-year forecast is that it takes what we know about a company today and applies (hopefully) reasonable assumptions given the company's history and trajectory. If from the analysis, we can draw some conclusions on the current stock price and support other methods of valuation, I think it is useful.In this article, we take a step down the income statement. We will present our assumptions and forecasts for cost of revenue by segment (Subscription Solutions & Merchant Solutions), and in a future article we will take a look at the three operating expense lines (Sales & Marketing, Research & Development, and General & Administrative)We will be utilizing the ""Acceleration of Growth"" methodology discussed in our last article to forecast the growth of the cost of revenue by segment. We recommend referring to our last article for a detailed explanation of our Acceleration of Growth methodology.​Cost of RevenuesSubscription SolutionsSubscription Solutions cost of revenue includes cost to deliver the subscription service, including hosting costs, software costs, billing processing fees, operations and merchant support expenses, payments to partners for Themes and Apps, and Domain registration. We are forecasting Subscription Solutions cost to remain in a tight range around ~78% gross margin throughout our 10-year forecast period.We expect some opposing forces to keep costs stable. When new merchants join Shopify, they typically purchase lower margin subscription levels (Basic vs Advanced) and low margin Themes (30% margin). In 5 to 10 years from now, we assume Shopify's merchant base will grow into the millions, shrinking the proportion of new merchant additions relative to the existing merchant base.On the other hand, we assume a steady contribution from low-margin AppStore purchases (20% margin), as these are on a subscription basis. (Source: Theme & AppStore gross margin)[Update 05/16/2017: The article has been updated to reflect that partner referral payments are a Sales & Marketing expense, not a Subscription Solution cost of revenue.]In 2016, Subscription Solutions gross margin was 79% (2015: 78%, 1Q17: 80%). (Source: 1Q17, 2016 company reports)We calculated Subscription Solutions cost saw an Acceleration of Growth of $7.2 million in 2016. We assume this level continues between 2017 and 2021. In our 10-year revenue forecast, we drop the Subscription Solutions revenue Acceleration of Growth assumption to $0 between 2022 and 2026. We expect Shopify to ratchet down the merchant expansion growth and look to profit generation in the back half of our forecast. Therefore, we do the same for our Subscription Solutions cost assumption, taking the Acceleration of Growth down to $0 between 2022 and 2026.We think our assumption for Acceleration of Growth is justified given the in line nature of costs growing at a similar pace with revenues.Subscription Solutions Forecast for 2017We forecast Subscription Solutions cost increasing by $22.2 million in 2017 to $61.6 million, +56% y/y. Comparatively, we forecast Subscription Solution revenue to increase by $103.4 million to $292 million, +55% y/y. Our forecast for 2017 yields a Subscription Solutions gross margin of 79%.Subscription Solutions 10-Year ForecastIn our 10-year forecast, we estimate Subscription Solutions revenue growing by 11x to $2.1 billion. Likewise, we see Subscription Solutions cost growing by 12x to $477 million. The Subscription Solutions gross margin in 2026 is forecast to be 78%, inline with 2016 at 79%. See the table below for a full breakdown of revenue down to gross profit by segment.Merchant SolutionsThe Merchant Solutions cost of revenue includes credit card interchange, network fees, third party processing fees, hosting costs, software costs, operations and merchant support expenses, and cost of Point of Sale (POS) hardware. But the big one is the credit card interchange.As Shopify Payments grows as a percentage of total GMV transacted, Merchant Solutions revenue will increase. However, we estimate between 85%-90% of these revenues will be ""passed through"" to Visa, MasterCard, and American Express as interchange fees. More revenue comes with more cost.Using market share statistics of Visa, MasterCard, and American Express we get a weighted average transaction fee of 2.68% or 268 basis points ((bps)). On average, we estimate about 209 bps is ""pass through"" to pay for interchange, leaving about 50 - 60 bps to divvy up between Shopify and its payment processor, Stripe.We test this assumption, by considering that Visa/MasterCard interchange rates can range from 100 to 300 bps, but with many products in the 200 bps range. American Express is higher at around 290 bps.Given the costs of interchange and profitability requirements for payment processors, we assume Shopify makes about the same gross profit dollars per GMV with either Shopify Payments or a third party provider. As a proxy for gross profit dollars per GMV, we use the average of the third party provider transaction fees. We calculate this proxy to be 32.5 bps.Based on the above findings, as Shopify Payments usage approaches 100% of GMV, Merchant Solutions gross margin is going to approach 10-15%.What's going to stop this outcome? Shopify Shipping, Shopify Capital, the new Shopify POS hardware, and other transactional-based services. These services don't run the same ""pass through"" revenues as Shopify Payments and therefore contribute much higher margins. They will have to grow at least as fast as Shopify payments adoption, in order to keep Merchant Solutions gross margin from falling.In 2016, Merchant Solutions gross margin was 30% (2015: 28%, 1Q17: 34%). Source: 1Q17, 2016 company reportsOur assumptions for Merchant Solutions cost:1) GMV growing from $15.4 billion in 2016 to over $300 billion by 20262) Shopify Payments adoption increasing from 37% of GMV in 2016 to 47% by 20263) Our 32.5 bps assumption of gross profit per GMV as discussed above.Merchant Solutions Forecast for 2017We forecast Merchant Solutions cost increasing by $104 million in 2017 to $245 million, +74% y/y. Comparatively, we forecast Merchant Solutions revenue to increase by $166 million to $367 million, +83% y/y. Our forecast for 2017 yields a Merchant Solutions gross margin of 33%.Merchant Solutions 10-Year ForecastIn our 10-year forecast, we estimate Merchant Solutions revenue growing by 27x to $5.5 billion. Likewise, we see Merchant Solutions cost growing by 25x to $3.5 billion. The Merchant Solutions gross margin in 2026 is forecast to be 36%, a substantial improvement from 30% in 2016.This improvement is due to two factors:1) The increasing contribution from high margin solutions like Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital.2) The expectation that Shopify Payments adoption only grows to 47% of GMV from 37% in 2016. Recall that higher adoption of Shopify Payments puts downward pressure on gross margin. Given the flattish growth of adoption since 2015, we believe it might be too aggressive to assume adoption at a higher rate.Source: AuthorNote: The desktop version will be easier to readSumming it all up2016 revenue was $389 million and gross profit was $210 million, for an overall gross margin of 53.8%.We are forecasting 2017 revenue of $659 million (+69% y/y) and gross profit of $352 million (+68% y/y) for an overall gross margin of 53.5%.In 10 years, we forecast revenue will grow ~20x or 35% CAGR to $7.6 billion and gross profit to grow ~17x or 33% CAGR to $3.6 billion, for an overall gross margin of 47.5%.The decline in overall gross margin is due to the increased contribution from the lower margin Merchant Solutions revenue. In 2016 Merchant Solutions contributed 29% of gross profit, we forecast this to grow to 54% by 2026.Given our 10-year revenue forecast in our previous article, we make a case for Shopify as a company capable of much more revenue than its current size suggests. Taking a step down the income statement, we can now expect gross margin to decline over the next 10 years. To some, this may come as a surprise. But as a long term investor, it is important to realize this likely outcome today, before making an investment in a company. Regardless of this decline in gross margin over the next 10 years, we believe the gross profit dollars Shopify could produce will still be substantial.In the next article, we will break down our assumptions for each operating expense, drive down to operating income and EBITDA, and provide some valuation interpretations.Are our assumptions too aggressive or conservative?

To quickly rehash, Shopify is offering 5.5 million shares (6.235 million shares with the over-allotment) at US$91/share. Given our free cash flow or FCF forecast, this new level of cash should be multiples of what they need to fund their organic growth until they are FCF positive in a few years.In conjunction with the offering, Shopify filed a new shelf prospectus raising its equity issuing capacity by 5x from $500 million to $2.5 billion over the next 25 months. Given the new cash hoard, we believe this additional capacity will only be accessed if a significant acquisition is on the table.Our Fair ValuePerhaps coincidentally, our 10-year Discounted Cash Flow (NYSE:DCF) model suggests a fair value of the stock of US$91/share. We promise you, this was the case before the equity offering. But given the equity offering is equal to our fair value, there was no accretion or dilution to our valuation.At the recent highs of almost $96/share, our fair value would suggest the stock price was expensive.After some turmoil in the US stock markets, Shopify's share price has since pulled back to the $91-$92/share range. This would suggest the stock price is now fairly valued.However, if you only buy stocks with a margin of safety below fair value, $91-$92/share is not quite cheap enough. A 25% margin of safety would imply a price below $70/share.Let us know in the comments. What needs to happen to the company or the macro environment for Shopify to drop below $70/share, but not deter you from buying it?Our 10-Year Free Cash Flow AssumptionGiven our revenue to EBITDA assumptions provided in previous articles, we can drive down to operating cash flow which Shopify already is generating on a positive basis. Operating cash flow excludes share-based compensation (SBC) as this is a non-cash expense. However, given SBC makes up ~10% of operating expenses and will eventually dilute the share count, we take it as a cost against cash flow.Lastly, we account for capital expenditures by removing 4% of revenue from operating cash flow to get to our forecast for FCF excluding share-based compensation. We will refer to this as FCF-SBC.In 2017, we forecast FCF-SBC to turn positive in 2021. Quickly growing from $79 million in 2021 to $1.1 billion in 2026 as the business model leverage takes hold. It's the flywheel spinning faster and faster.Our DCF assumptions:10% discount rate3% organic terminal growth of FCF-SBCDiluted share count of 96.57 million shares outstanding. We added the newly offered equity shares (including the over-allotment) to the diluted shares from 1Q17.

After our 10-year forecast, is 3% growth into perpetuity fair for a company like Shopify?Valuation and RecommendationWe forecast Shopify to become a billion-dollar FCF machine in 10 years. Check out our previous work on revenue, costs and EBITDA to see how we came to this conclusion.Our discounted cash flow model is based on a 10% discount rate and 3% terminal growth rate of free cash flow excluding share-based compensation.We get a fair value for Shopify of US$91/share. At today's price, we would say Shopify is trading at fair value given the known information available. Buying today would indicate you believe at least one of three things.1) You believe Shopify can execute, to at least, the forecast we have laid out over the next 10 years and are happy with a 10% annual return.2) You believe there are ""unknown"" factors or services we have not accounted for, which can yield upside to our forecast. This could include management's vision, a technology or market paradigm shift, acceleration of online retail adoption by consumers or many other unknowns.3) You believe we are being too conservative with our assumptions, either with how we forecast revenue, cost, discount rate, long-term growth, or any number of other assumptions outlined in our previous articles.We fall into buckets 1 and 2. We believe Shopify can at least execute to our forecast plus we believe in the long-term vision of the company to introduce new innovations and services. We don't know the economics of unknown innovations, so we cannot fairly price them into our forecast.We are long-term shareholders of Shopify.As new material information is released, we will update our DCF valuation.

4075782,103149,2017-05-23T14:54:21-04:00,"Shopify could be added to the flagship S&P/TSX Composite Index in June. This could create demand for over 5 million shares according to Scotia Capital.When we do the math, it looks like Shopify more than satisfies the ""inclusion"" requirements.As long-term shareholders, we recommend accumulating shares on stock price dips.","A report from The Globe And Mail indicates Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) could soon be added to a major Canadian index [the flagship S&P/TSX Composite Index].In the article, according to Scotia Capital, ""Scotia estimates passive investors such as index funds will buy approximately 5 percent of Shopify's stock, or 5.4 million shares if the company joins the S&P/TSX composite.""The S&P/TSX Composite Index is a group of stocks listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The selection for inclusion is based on 3 main factors:1) Market Capitalization of at least 0.05% of the index and greater than $1/share.With Shopify's market cap at around CAD $11 billion and CAD $122/share, it falls above the average market cap of the index, and more than satisfies the rule by being about 0.47% of the index or 9x over the market cap requirement.2) Domicile in Canada. Shopify is headquartered in Canada, with most of its employees in Canada. It is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada and files with Canadian security regulators.3) Liquidity. Total shares traded on a Canadian Exchange over the last 12 months must equal at least 50% of the total available float-adjusted shares outstanding. The float adjustment excludes shares held by ""strategic (control) shareholders,"" like executives, directors, private equity, holders of over 5%, etc.The Globe and Mail article cites a change in the liquidity rule as a catalyst. As a US and Canadian dual-listed stock, Shopify sees most of its trading volume on the US exchange. This volume has not previously been counted towards eligibility. If US volume is included, the article suggests Shopify could be added to the benchmarking index.The next additions will be after market close on June 16. We do not believe the rule will be changed by then. The consultation and survey voting deadline is June 9, 2017, only a week prior to June 16. The S&P will likely take more than a week to compile the results of the survey and come to a clear decision on the new rules if new rules are implemented.Regardless of a rule change, we still believe Shopify could be added to the benchmarking index on June 16, 2017, after market.Shopify had 90 million diluted shares outstanding in 1Q17 [pre-equity raise]. If we remove the insider holdings of 16 million shares, and FMR's holding of 11.5 million shares [over 5%], we are left with 62.6 million shares in our adjusted float.We added up Shopify's Canadian exchange traded volume data from Google Finance. Total volume for the last 12 months was 35.7 million shares.This gives us a ratio of 57%, which is greater than the minimum 50% requirement.There are still a few days remaining until the cut off at the end of May, but even with zero trading over the next 7 trading days, our calculations give us a ratio of 56%, squarely over the requirement.ConclusionWe are not recommending you ""time the market"" on this ""index addition"" catalyst. But we want you to be aware that there is potentially a lot of shares coming off the market in the next month, through a substantial demand catalyst.This supply of shares is likely going to be tied up for the long term in index funds, ETFs and benchmarking mutual funds. This leaves less supply for the short-term trader, likely making the share price even more volatile than it already is.We recommend buying Shopify for the long term, on any dips in the share price. We see this company continuing to deliver impressive growth for 10+ years. We believe management has the vision and execution ability to maintain the innovation of a start-up but break through typical growing pains of a maturing business.If you want to learn more about our long-term model on Shopify, we recommend:Most Popular: Shopify: 10-Year Revenue ForecastAuthor Recommendation: Shopify: Cheap or ExpensiveFollow us, if you want to get our insights in real time."
4072335,28141,2017-05-11T16:26:43-04:00,Valuation calculated by industry M&A activity.Reconstructed in both revenue segments: Subscription Solutions and Merchant Solutions.Private market valuation of range of $44-52 per share.,"Continued from my first article, Shortify Shopify - Part 1I discuss another reconstruction of value for Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).Competitive LandscapeThe top five e-commerce platforms command 53% of share of the top 1 million websites. This fragmentation in the marketplace leaves room for the top to consolidate market share, however, this also illustrates the inexistent barriers-to-entry on the low end. For example, WooCommerce and Magento Community provide a significant competitive e-com platform that are free. These competitive forces will hurt profitability and adoption for fee-based platforms.In the enterprise space, it is no surprise that Oracle Commerce (NYSE:ORCL), Demandware (now Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)), Magento Commerce (the old eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) enterprise), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) dominate market share. The competition for enterprise will be fierce and would require substantial amounts of investment by Shopify to break-through.Short ThesisShopify's valuation has been painted in one broad stroke. When deconstructed and properly examined, my research illustrates that today's nosebleed valuation is not supported by M&A comps either.M&A comps assist investors by revealing what an industry ""insider"" would pay to acquire a company outright or a controlling stake. Based on the valuation below, shareholders should consider taking some profits while the enterprising speculator has been given a solid entry point for a short.M&A CompsIn the past couple of years, there has been M&A activity to help assist in the private market value of a company like Shopify. We are fortunate to have acquisitions by both types of plays: private equity buyout and synergistic acquisitions by public companies. Acquisition multiples ranged between 5x to 10x revenue.Valuation is reconstructed by business type, Subscriptions Solutions (core-business) and Merchant Solutions (complimentary-business).Subscription Solutions M&A CompsSalesforce acquires DemandwareIn 2016, Salesforce acquired Demandware for $2.8 billion. Demandware is a cloud-based provider of e-commerce services to businesses big and small. Salesforce renamed the business Salesforce Commerce Cloud. According to figures provided by Salesforce, Gartner estimates digital commerce platform spending will grow 14 percent annually, reaching $8.54 billion by 2020.Average P/S peaked in 2014 at 13x at $60 per share.Oracle acquires ATGIn November of 2010, Oracle acquired ATG for $1 billion. ATG was a growing enterprise e-commerce platform solutions provider that had over 1,000 global enterprise clients and revenues forecasted at $200 million in 2010.eBay Enterprise Goes PrivateIn 2015, eBay's Enterprise was sold for $925 million to Permira Funds and Sterling Partners. This segment generated $1.2 billion in revenue and included some very lucrative businesses that were divided into the following: Enterprise Services, Magento Commerce, Marketing Solutions, and CRM. Their ""Enterprise Services"" business was formerly known as GSI Commerce and acquired by eBay for $2.4 billion in 2011.Magento Commerce is the other significant division that eBay also acquired in 2011 for $180 million. According to filings, Permira Funds bought Magento for only $200 million (source, Permira Funds 2015 annual review page 5).Magento Commerce is a direct competitor to Shopify that has had an impressive business tucked away in eBay. Small to mid-size independent brands and retailers utilize its open-source platforms which has 300 partners and 70,000 developers supporting it. It is estimated that over $50 billion GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) is moving across the Magento platform annually, making it only second to Amazon in size and three times larger than Shopify.In 2015, it looks like Permira acquired Magento for an absolute bargain compared to the M&A comps and market valuations of similar companies.This comparison illustrates the opposite end of the valuation spectrum. On one side, you have the power of ""promoters"" on new issues like Shopify, and irrational exuberance by investors. On the other end, a forgotten asset scooped up by an opportunistic PE firm during eBay's massive spinoff of PayPal.Merchant Solutions M&A CompsGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) acquires Heartland in 2015 for $4.3 billion. This equates to a sales multiple of 4.8x net revenue.Vantiv (NYSE:VNTV) acquires Mercury Payment Systems in 2014, before Mercury IPOs for $1.65 billion. This equates to a sales multiple of 7x net revenue.Private Market Valuation ReconstructionSHOP's estimated 2017 Subscription Solutions Revenue ($300 million)X Acquisition P/S Multiple (9.3x to 11.8x) = $2.8 to $3.54 billionSHOP's estimated 2017 Merchant Solutions Revenue* ($160 million)  x Acquisition P/S Multiple (7x) = $1.12 billion Private Market Total Valuation Range = $3.9 to $4.7 billionPrivate Market Price Target range: $44 to $52 per share *Merchant Solutions adjusted to Net RevenueConclusion:Based on private market M&A activity, Shopify looks extremely rich to an acquirer."

In the first installment (Shopify: 10-Year Revenue Forecast), we broke down our revenue assumptions for the next 10 years. In the second installment (Shopify: 10-Year Cost Forecast), we drilled down to gross profit. In this article, we will go much deeper. We will cover the three operating expense segments (sales & marketing, research & development, and general & administrative) and drive to an operating income and EBITDA forecast. We will conclude with some valuation interpretations.We see EBITDA margin turning positive in 2020 and growing rapidly through 2026. In 2026, we forecast EBITDA margin of 23%.The Elephant in the RoomThere seems to be a concern with some readers that 10 years is a ""ridiculous"" length of time to forecast. While we agree that in 10 years this model will probably be far from accurate given the introduction of new catalysts and products, what is important is the trends and nuances that the model shows us given today's information.In the last article, we learned that given the adoption of Shopify Payments and the much faster growth of Merchant Solutions revenue, the overall gross margin would decline over the next 10 years. Despite gross margins for each segment either staying flat or increasing, the reason we will see an overall decline is because the lower margin Merchant Solutions revenue will become a much larger proportion of revenue.What Kind of Investor Are We?When we look at a company as an investment, we want to know that it is worth its price in free cash flow. If we cannot forecast positive free cash flow in the future, what is the point of making an investment?As investors, we don't pay for revenues, we pay for profits that can be paid back to investors as dividends (eventually). In the meantime, as investors, we are trusting the company to reinvest its revenue generation in growth.If you have a mature company, then maybe you don't need a 10-year forecast model. But Shopify is in its infancy, it potentially has a huge runway to grow. It is not thinking about driving the bottom line right now. It is thinking about growing the merchant base and creating a huge moat. It might take more than two or five years to create that moat. Fundamentally speaking, Shopify will not show positive profit in that time frame. But if you have a long-term investment profile like we do, a 10-year forecast will help us understand the fundamentals of the business Shopify will become.Technology will change quickly over the next 10 years. But we are investors in Shopify because we believe in its ability to execute and be an influential player in the technology shift.Our Cost ForecastsSales & Marketing Expenses (S&M)Sales & marketing consists of marketing campaigns, partner referral payments related to merchant acquisition, employees and other business development, sales, new merchant onboarding expenses, travel, and corporate overhead. Shopify expects S&M expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time. We assume S&M expenses continue to accelerate through 2019 before slowing down as marketing campaigns see scale advantages.In 2016, S&M was 33% of revenue. We forecast 2017 S&M to be 30% of revenue (Source: 2016 annual report).For our 10-year forecast, we see S&M continuing to increase at a 20% CAGR, though declining to only 10% of revenue as we expect Shopify will see an inflection point in the size of its existing merchant base relative to the onboarding of new merchants.Research & Development Expenses (R&D)Research & development consists of employee expenses for product management, development, and design. It includes contractors, consultants, and corporate overhead. R&D is a necessary cost to continually create innovative features for merchants. Shopify expects R&D expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time. We see R&D expenses continue to accelerate through 2019 before acceleration of growth levels off.In 2016, R&D was 19% of revenue. We forecast 2017 R&D to be 20% of revenue.For our 10-year forecast, we see R&D continuing to increase at a 29% CAGR over the next 10 years, though declining to 13% of revenue.In any industry, as it matures, competition quickly rises to offer similar solutions. We believe it is an eventual outcome in e-commerce platform services as well. It is imperative that Shopify continues to invest heavily in R&D so it can offer its merchants the most innovative solutions first.General & Administrative (G&A)General & administrative consists of employee expenses for finance and accounting, legal, data analytics, administrative, human resources and IT personnel, as well as professional fees, losses related to Shopify Payments and Shopify Capital, and other corporate expenses and overhead. Shopify expects G&A expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time as it develops internal processes and systems to handle support functions.In 2016, G&A was 11% of revenue. We forecast 2017 G&A to be 12% of revenue.For our 10-year forecast, we see G&A continuing to increase at a 25% CAGR over the next 10 years, though declining to just 5% of revenue.Share-Based Compensation (SBC)Share-based compensation is built into the operating expense segments and cost of revenue. A company is only as strong as the people that work for it. We believe Shopify is fostering the right culture.Management has on many occasions talked about the importance of ""trying to play the long game."" (1Q17 Transcript - CEO Tobi Lutke)This is reflective in how employees are compensated. R&D can attribute about 20% of expenses to SBC vested over four years. S&M is only about 3.5% due to non-employee expenses and G&A is about 10%. Given the importance of thought leadership with respect to innovation, allocating more SBC to R&D employees is vital to retaining and development of talent for the long term.In 2015, SBC made up 6% of operating expenses, growing to 9% in 2016. We forecast 2017 at 11%, with SBC staying in the 10-12% range over our 10-year forecast period.Operating Expenses Summed upIn 2016, S&M, R&D, and G&A were 63% of total revenue. In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement to 62%. By the end of our 10-year forecast, we see substantial operating leverage, especially as the existing merchant base grows to scale. We forecast total operating expenses to be only 28% of total revenue in 2026.This substantial lift in operating leverage will help drive significant operating margin.Operating IncomeIn 2016, operating income was negative at -$37 million. We see this getting worse before it gets better. In 2017, we forecast -$55 million versus the management guidance of -$69 million to -$73 million. We see operating loss peaking in 2019 at -$81 million.In 2021, we forecast Shopify will have over one million merchants on its platform. We believe this scale will enable it to deliver positive GAAP operating income in 2021 and it will not look back from there.By the end of our 10-year forecast period, we see a GAAP operating margin of 19% and 2026 operating income of $1.4 billion.EBITDAWorking back to EBITDA, we need amortization and depreciation. Historically it has been ~3.6% of revenue, so we use that assumption through our forecast.This gives us an EBITDA margin of 23% and 2026 EBITDA of $1.7 billion.Summing It All UpWe believe Shopify is building a business to last, utilizing long-term employee incentive plans and a culture focused on making others look better. To be the best, you have to hire the best and compensate them accordingly. In 2016, the company spent a lot of money on S&M, R&D, and G&A equal to 63% of total revenue.We expect SHOP to continue to invest in the highest quality people and perpetuate its entrepreneurial culture. In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement in operating expenses to 62% of revenueBy the end of our 10-year forecast, we see substantial operating leverage, as the existing merchant base grows to scale. We forecast total operating expenses to be only 28% of total revenue in 2026.We see 2026 GAAP operating margin of 19% and operating income of $1.4 billion. Finally, this delivers 2026 EBITDA margin of 23% and EBITDA of $1.7 billion.Valuation & RecommendationGiven Shopify's continued spending on rapid growth, near-term EBITDA forecasts are negative.At today's stock price, we calculate 2022 EV/EBITDA of 21x. However, once EBITDA turns positive, we forecast it to grow rapidly at 46% CAGR from 2022 to 2026. We calculate 2026 EV/EBITDA of 5x.If you own the stock today, our forecast suggests you will be paying five times 2026 EBITDA. We are forecasting 2026 EBITDA growth of 32% y/y. If EBITDA is growing at that pace, the stock is likely to trade much higher than 5x EBITDA."
4073324,103149,2017-05-15T14:19:00-04:00,"We break down 2017 revenue and make an attempt at a 10-year revenue forecast.Four ""known unknowns"" that could be upsides we don’t price in. We think Magento is scared.Solution to the Law of Large Numbers. The ""Acceleration of Growth"" method helps us make measured forecasts of revenue growth, with high double to low triple-digit historical growth.“What’s going to be left of retailers is essentially a form of entertainment” - CEO of Shopify.In 10 years, we forecast revenue of $7.6 billion versus 2017 guidance of $615 million to $630 million.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is an e-commerce platform which breaks down the technical and cost barriers of starting a business. Shopify cuts the cost of building a website and getting your product in front of customers. Instead of paying thousands of dollars upfront, Shopify offers its solution on a monthly subscription starting at $29. This is especially valuable for an entrepreneur trying to self-fund a business.In this note, we break down our forecast for 2017 revenue vs. management guidance. We think there is upside to guidance. Then, we show you how Shopify goes from generating $389 million in 2016 to $7.6 billion in our 2026 forecast.There is a compelling case to own Shopify for the long term.Revenue DecompSubscription SolutionsShopify generates revenues from subscriptions to the platform, purchases of apps, themes, and domain registrations.In 4Q16, Shopify added a record 52,500 net new merchants (see transcripts on SA for 3Q16 and 4Q16), bringing its total to ~377,500 merchants at the end of 2016. In addition, they disclosed they had ~2,500 high value merchants on Shopify Plus (according to Shopify's 2016 annual report).In 1Q17, Shopify again added a record number of net new merchants but did not disclose exactly how many. The record implies adding at least 52,500 net new merchants in 1Q17, bringing the total to at least 430,000 merchants on Shopify (source: 2016 annual report and 3Q16 MD&A).In 2016, we calculated Shopify generated ~$610 per merchant in subscription revenue, calculated using average merchants over the period.At a rate of 50,000 net new merchants per quarter, Shopify could add ~200,000 new merchants in 2017, assuming no further acceleration of growth. At $610 per merchant, we forecast Shopify could add ~$61 million to Subscription Solution revenue from net new merchants in 2017 (see our math in the diagram below).The subscription revenue contribution from the 377,500 existing merchants should contribute $232 million in 2017.Our forecast of 2017 Subscription Solution revenue is $292 million or +55% y/y (2016: $188.6 million).Source: AuthorDoes 50,000 net new merchants per quarter sound ambitious?We do agree it is a bullish assumption relative to the recent history (see chart below). However, Shopify has executed well in the past, during a time where it has added 50-60% net new merchants each year. Our assumption of 200,000 net new merchants in 2017 would imply a 53% growth rate. This is within the historical executable range, giving us confidence in their ability to deliver on our forecast.Also, Shopify's total addressable market in its key geographies is 10 million merchants (Source: Prospectus). In all geographies, some of which Shopify does not compete in, there are 46 million merchants. If Shopify only adds 100,000 net new merchants in 2017, we would be disappointed and would reassess our forecasts.Source: Quarterly reports, AuthorMerchant SolutionsShopify also generates revenue from every transaction processed by its merchants, either through Shopify Payments or a third-party provider (like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)). For transactions processed with Shopify Payments, Shopify records revenue of 2.4%-2.9% for all Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) transactions and 3.3%-3.5% for all American Express (NYSE:AXP) transactions. The full amount of the transaction fee is recorded as revenue on Shopify's income statement.We use market share statistics of Visa, MasterCard, and American Express to get a weighted average transaction fee of 2.68%.For transactions processed through third-party providers, Shopify records revenue of 0.15% to 2% (according to their pricing page) depending on the subscription level.As a side note, transactions processed through Shopify Payments contributes significantly to ""pass through"" revenue. We estimate revenue from Shopify Payments generates ~10-15% gross margin (versus Merchant Solutions gross margin of ~30%). We assume transactions through third-party providers is almost pure profit, as Shopify does not have much cost associated with those transactions. As Shopify Payments increases as a proportion of total Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), gross margin will see downward pressure. The offset to this decline would be from other revenue sources with higher margins, like Shopify Capital, Shopify Shipping, POS, and other transactional based services.Given the costs of interchange and profitability requirements for payment processors, we believe Shopify makes about the same in gross profit dollars with either Shopify Payments or a third-party provider. So it does not matter who processes the transaction, the impact on profitability should be similar for the same GMV.On the 1Q17 conference call, we were told ""more than 50% of GMV"" comes from the Advance and Plus plans. As a proxy for gross profit dollars per GMV, we use the average of the third-party provider transaction fee. We calculate this proxy to be 0.325% of GMV.To test this assumption, we consider that Visa/MasterCard interchange rates can range from 1% to 3%, but with many products in the 2% range. American Express is higher at around 2.9%. This leaves about 0.5%-0.6% to divvy up between Shopify and its payment processor, Stripe. Therefore, we think 0.325% is fair.In 2016, 37% of GMV was transacted through Shopify Payments. We assume this penetration rate will creep up to 38% by the end of 2017.Merchant Solutions revenue is based on GMV, the dollar value of transactions processed by all Shopify Merchants. GMV growth is influenced by two main factors.1) New merchants coming onto the platform.When new merchants come onto the platform GMV contribution is delayed, as many are new businesses still trying to find their market and customers. Since we don't have cohort data from Shopify, we adjust for this by using a trailing merchant count. For 2016, we use the 2Q16 merchant count of 300,000. This adjustment assumes new merchants don't immediately contribute to GMV. At the end of 2016, we calculated the average merchant generated just over $50,000 in sales ($15.4 billion GMV from 2016 Annual Report divided by 300,000 merchants from 2Q16 Report).Taking the merchant additions assumption of 50,000 per quarter at $50,000 in sales per year, our forecast adds ~$5 billion additional GMV per year from new merchants (we use triangle math again).2) Existing merchant sales growth.A year early in 2015, we calculated the average sales per merchant was $44,000. So, 2016 saw growth of 17% y/y. Given a base GMV of $18.8 billion (377,500 merchants x $50,000), we forecast existing merchant GMV growing by ~$3 billion in 2017 (17% of $18.8 billion).Is $50,000 per merchant too optimistic?Our calculations indicate 1Q17 was $53,800 per merchant on a trailing 12-month basis, while 1Q16 was $44,900 per merchant. This is growth of 20% y/y.There are a few factors involved in this growth.1) Most are small businesses, which are taking market share. When a company takes market share they inherently grow above the market rate.2) Shopify is targeting established, high-revenue generating merchants to migrate to its platform (see below discussion on Magento).3) Shopify is adding new ways to make it easier for customers to find its merchants (like the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) partnership).Summing the growth from new merchant additions and existing merchant growth, and taking the base GMV of $18.8 billion, we forecast GMV growing to ~$27 billion by the end of 2017 from $15.4 billion in 2016, +75% y/y.We apply the average transaction fee of 2.68% to 38% of GMV to get the revenue contribution from Shopify Payments. We add the average third-party provider transaction fee of 0.325% to 62% of GMV. And finally an assumption of other Merchant Solution revenue ramping up to $38 million in 2017 (~$9.5 million per quarter vs. $7.4 million in 1Q17).Our forecast of 2017 Merchant Solution revenue is $367 million or +83% y/y (2016: $200.7 million).Total Revenue Forecast for 2017Our total revenue forecast for 2017 is $659 million. This compares to current management guidance of $615-$630 million. Our forecast implies a 6% upside to the midpoint of management guidance.A word on Shopify guidance:Shopify has consistently provided revenue guidance, but has consistently underestimated their actual results.On quarterly revenue guidance, we calculated Shopify has, on average, guided 7% lower than their actual results at the midpoint. The company has four tries every year to provide guidance for the full year. As expected, as they lock in revenues throughout the year guidance becomes closer to the actual. However, the first attempt during 4Q15 was 20% lower than the actual for 2016.We cannot determine if Shopify has changed the methodology to how they provide guidance. If Shopify continues to use the same methodology and stays on the same path of growth, we see our forecast as well within the realm of possibilities.Known UnknownsWhat assumptions have we left out that could accelerate growth above these historical assumptions.1) Shopify Payments Penetration. Shopify could increase the take rate by migrating more merchants over to Shopify Payments. In 1Q17, only 38% of GMV was transacted over Shopify Payments. With the gap between full penetration so far away, there is plenty of room for the take rate to improve.2) Upside from programs like Shopify Capital and Shopify Shipping. Shopify Capital has made $60 million of cash advances to Shopify Merchants (Source: 1Q17 transcript). $11 million advanced in April 2017. Shopify Capital gives $5,000-$50,000 in cash advances in return for receivables of some amount greater than the cash advances (example: for a $5,000 cash advance, Shopify gains receivables of $5,650). Source: Shopify Capital. Every day, Shopify takes 10% of the merchant's revenue (directly from their bank account) until the receivables reach zero. Full remittance typically happens over a seven- to nine-month period.ROI is hard to forecast given the variance in payback period and potential bad loans. However, to mitigate some risk, Shopify has entered into an agreement with a third party to insure merchant cash advances. Revenue from Shopify Capital falls into Merchant Solutions revenue. As these revenues do not add to GMV, they will improve gross margin and take rate over time.3) Increasing Shopify Plus migration of high value, established merchants. As the advertising for Magento exemplifies (below), Shopify only has 12 merchants on the Internet Retailer 1,000 list while Magento has 200. Shopify Plus has a long way to go. If Shopify is successful in its targeted campaigns to Magento merchants, there could be significant upside both to Subscription Solutions and Merchant Solutions.And let's not forget the other 788 on that top 1,000 list that could be future Shopify merchants.We think Magento is seeing a significant impact from Shopify's marketing campaign. Otherwise an incumbent like Magento would not be advertising in this way. And while you could say Shopify campaigning against Magento says the same thing, just take a look at the tone of their campaigns below. Shopify is offering to migrate Magento merchants, which we see as an attack, while Magento is only trying to protect its ""incumbent"" status.Source: MagentoSource: Shopify4) The shift of purchases from brick and mortar to e-commerce. In 2016, US e-commerce sales were $395 billion according to the US Census Bureau, +15% y/y and accounting for only 8.1% of total retail sales. As the shift to online sales continues to rise, Shopify should see more GMV being transacted over its platform. Total retail sales in the US were $4.8 trillion in 2016. There is plenty of room for growth as e-commerce penetrates further into the overall retail space.Inherently you could say this trend is built into our forecast model, but our forecast does not imply a further acceleration of this trend. E-commerce has moved past the Innovators phase of the technology adoption life cycle into the Early Adopter phase. When e-commerce approaches Early Majority and Late Majority phases, merchant additions and GMV could see accelerated growth even faster than we have already experienced.Source: WikipediaThe Methodology - Forecasting Using Acceleration of GrowthWe look at long-term growth of our revenue drivers, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and GMV.The growth of the dollar value of growth is a measure of accelerating or decelerating growth. For those mathematically inclined, growth is the first derivative and acceleration is the second derivative. You can skip to the next section if you understand how the math works.Hopefully, this is better explained with an example:Source: Annual reports, AuthorIn 2016, Shopify ended the year with MRR of $18.5 million, annualized to $222 million ($18.5 million x 12).In 2015, the annualized MRR was $136.3 million. And 2014 was $78.9 million.The y/y growth in dollars was thus:$85.7 million in 2016 ($222 million - $136.3 million), and$57.4 million in 2015 ($136.3 million - $78.9 million).The Acceleration of Growth in 2016 was thus:$28.3 million ($85.7 million [2016] - $57.4 million [2015])This $28.3 million tells us that subscription solutions revenue growth is accelerating. It grew more in revenue dollars than last year by $28.3 million.In the chart below, 2016's MRR was $222 million (light blue), its y/y growth in dollars was $85.7 million (red), and the acceleration of growth was $28.3 million (yellow). 2016 acceleration of growth is the difference between the red bars in 2016 and 2015.Source: Annual reports, AuthorUsing the acceleration of growth method will help us make more measured forecasts of revenue growth. For a company with historical growth rates in the high-double digits to low triple digits the law of large numbers starts taking a greater effect on the growth rate. Using historical growth rates will not be a good proxy for future growth.The 10-Year ForecastSubscription SolutionsWe assume annualized MRR acceleration of growth is $30 million from 2017-2021, with the acceleration of growth falling to $0 in 2022 to 2026. Our $30 million assumption is equal to the historical acceleration of growth we calculated in 1Q17 and slightly faster than in 2016 at $28.3 million. A sensitivity analysis indicates that if we reduce our assumption by $5 million, total revenue declines by 2% in 2026.To convert this into annual revenue forecasts takes a few steps. If it's too technical, skip down to the result.1. Add $30 million to last year's dollar value of growth ($85.7 million [2016] + $30 million = $115.7 million) to get 2017's dollar value of growth.We are expecting Shopify to at least grow by the same dollar amount as the previous year. Plus we are expecting Shopify to grow by an additional $30 million.2. Add $115.7 million to last year's annualized MRR ($222 million [2016] + $115.7 million = $337.7 million) to get 2017's annualized MRR.We add the total amount of dollar growth to the previous year's actual revenue to get next year's revenue.3. Divide $337.7 million by 12 to get an MRR of $28.1 million for 2017.4. To be more precise we need to repeat this process for each forecast quarter.5. Multiply each quarter's MRR by 3 to get the quarterly revenue.6. As actual revenue has often differed from the quarterly MRR, we add a variance factor of $0.4 million per quarter (the average of the historical variance).7. Sum the four quarters of each year to determine the full-year Subscription Solutions revenue forecasts.The result. In 10 years, we forecast Subscription Solution revenue in excess of $2 billion with over 4.3 million merchants. About 10x growth over the next 10 years or 27% CAGR.Merchant SolutionsUsing a similar methodology to the Subscription Solutions forecast. We assume the annual acceleration of growth of GMV to be $4 billion for the entire forecast period. We convert this into Merchant Solutions revenue by applying the same methodology as discussed in the 2017 revenue forecast. In short, calculating the Shopify Payments revenue, third-party payments revenue, and other revenues.Our acceleration of growth assumption of $4 billion in GMV is based on 2016 at $3.8 billion and 1Q17 trailing 12 months at $4 billion.As we have discussed in the ""known unknowns"" section, the shift of consumer purchases from brick and mortar to online should support the growth of GMV. There is even a potential for further acceleration of GMV growth as the technology life cycle moves into Early Majority and Late Majority phases. As a result, we do not ratchet down the GMV acceleration of growth as we believe keeping this level of acceleration is already conservative.Further analysis of GMV per merchant indicates that y/y growth per merchant will gradually decelerate to only 2% by 2022 and 1% by 2026. While in line with GDP growth and CPI, considering these are mostly small/medium-sized businesses, we could expect growth to be higher (due to market share gains). Nonetheless, we stick with this assumption. It is more conservative given the law of large numbers and diminishing marginal impacts from more merchant competition reducing the economic surplus.We assume Shopify Payments penetration (Gross Processing Value or GPV) to increase by 1% per year from 38% in 2017 to 47% by 2026.We assume other Merchant Solution revenue will substantially increase as Shopify Capital, Shopify Shipping, POS, and other services are added to the platform. In 2017, we assume these other revenues will make up 10% of Merchant Solutions revenue, growing to ~20% by 2026.The result. In 10 years, we forecast Merchant Solution revenue in excess of $5.4 billion with GMV growing to over $300 billion. About 27x growth over the next 10 years of 39% CAGR.Merchant Solutions growing nearly 3x as much as Subscription Solutions. Does that make sense?We are assuming GPV gains more traction. More transactions over Shopify Payments increases ""pass through"" revenues. This is one reason why the Merchant Solutions revenue is growing so fast.Based on our forecast for GMV growth and merchant growth, we forecast GMV per merchant will increase by 50% during this 10-year forecast. 40% of the increase is attributable to inflation (assumed at 2% CAGR). 60% of the increase is attributable to consumers deciding to allocate more of their spending to online purchases versus at a mall or local shop.Finally, our forecast of 4.3 million merchants by 2026 is still less than 10% of the global online merchants. We think Shopify will have to dial down the merchant growth spend at some point to go for profitability. Slowing merchant acquisition does not impact the macro shift of consumer spending, so GMV per merchant should continue to rise.Will consumers really spend more online?Anecdotal evidence of the coming of e-commerce (whether we like it or not...)Last month I tried to buy tennis shoes. I walked into at least 10 different shoe stores in North America and Asia. After three weeks I gave up. I bought tennis shoes online for the first time. I tried to resist the forces of online shopping, but ultimately gave in, due to limited selection. In 10 years when the demand at brick and mortar shops declines even further, finding the options and varieties you want in-store may get even worse.As the CEO of Shopify said on the 1Q17 conference call.Summing it all up2016 revenue was $389 million. Management is guiding for 2017 revenue of $615-$630 million, 60% y/y at the midpoint. We are forecasting 2017 revenue of $659 million, 6% over management guidance.In 10 years, we forecast revenue of $7.6 billion. Over 10x management's 2017 revenue guidance. You can imagine how much cash this company will be pumping out with over $7 billion in revenue. That's a story for another day. Hit the follow button to get that story when it comes out.Valuation and RecommendationAt the current price, we calculate Shopify's implied EV/revenue valuation at 12x 2017, which from first glance is very expensive. But based on our forecasts, if the stock price (and EV) does not change in five years it will be valued at only 3x revenue, and in 10 years only 1x revenue.With a five- and 10-year valuation perspective, I am a long-term buy and hold investor of Shopify.Are our assumptions too aggressive or conservative?

4072163,21815,2017-05-11T10:42:55-04:00,"Shopify is a fast growing company, but its share price is growing much faster.There was already almost an order of magnitude between the two growth rates the last four months.But rather than a slow-down, the share price is actually accelerating, going parabolic.We simply argue that something will have to give sooner rather than later.","We have reached the parabolic euphoria stage in the inexorable rise of the shares of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and sooner rather than later, something will have to give. The rally in the shares has been rather monumental:There are, of course, good reasons for this. As we argued in an earlier article, the company is executing very well and management is keeping the eye firmly on the long-term. As we discussed in that earlier article, the company is still investing heavily into making the platform even better.Given the growth rate, that seems to be working. For instance, one of the latest initiatives, Shopify Plus, a solution for bigger clients with more demanding resource needs is off to a flying start. The company is now adjusting the pricing to a formula that is more tailored to the usage of resources.Shopify also introduced a wholesale channel for Shopify Plus merchants and it will introduce a point-of-sale card reader next month which will be free to all merchants new to Shopify Point-of-Sale. Shopify Capital (cash advancements) is also flying from $30M at the end of Q4 to $49M at the end of Q1 to $60M at the end of April (per Q1CC).The Q1 results once again came above guidance, revenues growing at 75% rather than the 65% range which the company had guided. Speaking of which, the company increased guidance for the year (per PR):We're not writing this how fantastic this all is, we have done that in earlier articles and we are hardly alone in that on Seeking Alpha. But we have some concerns which mainly related to the parabolic rise of the share price. We think that cannot last:GrowthWhile the company is still in the hyper-growth phase, the law of large numbers dictates that this will slow down. In fact, in Q4 the company guided 'only' 50% growth or so for 2017 but after the first quarter that has been increased, and it might very well still increase.But slow down it is, as this is already happening. Q1 revenue growth (75%), while still absolutely fantastic, it constitutes already a considerable slowdown from the previous year when revenues were still growing at near triple digits.MarginsWhile there is a good deal of operating leverage (S&M and R&D growing slower than revenues), there are other forces at work which hamper margins. The subscription service revenues is the part that generates roughly 3x the margins compared to the merchant solutions (high 70s versus the mid 20s).But the latter are growing faster, in Q1 subscriptions grew by 60% whilst merchant solutions grew by 92%. The two effects sort of cancel one another out.It remains to be seen whether significant leverage will materialize in the business model, for now it isn't really there yet in the aggregate. Margins in merchant solutions are increasing a bit because shipping and capital grow faster and carry higher margins, so there is hope for the future.ProfitabilityAs you might have guessed from the previous graph, operating margins are still solidly negative (nearly -10%) and flatlining. The company is still producing substantial losses, especially on a GAAP basis.This year there will still be substantial losses, according to company guidance. Adjusted operating loss of $14-18M, rising to a GAAP loss of $69M-$73M due mostly to share based compensation of $55M. The latter is in the order of 8% of revenue, a not insubstantial amount and one might keep in mind that this also increases the share count.One might keep this graph in mind:No, the number of outstanding shares don't grow nearly as fast as revenue, but they are growing at a substantial pace nevertheless.Parabolic share priceIf one looks at the chart above, one notices that the share price has been in a solid upward channel which doubled the share price in four months.This is an 800% rise or so on an annualized basis. We don't think the shares can outgrow the underlying revenue growth at such a whopping margin forever (especially given the substantial increase in outstanding shares), but rather than slowing down, the share price growth has even accelerated of late.The shares are also really overbought (RSI is in the 80s). While that in and by itself doesn't necessarily predict any imminent demise, we ask the question can this really continue like this?For how much longer can the share price increase by roughly an order of magnitude versus underlying revenue growth, let alone profitability growth?ValuationRetail seems to be betting on the next Amazon, no matter what. We're not entirely convinced that Shopify is comparable, it's market seems a bit more contestable to us.But at today's price, you're buying already substantially into the future. Price/sales and price/book are at 18 and 20, respectively. Of course, with fast growing revenues the P/S will come down rapidly, some suggested.Well, perhaps. But the past four months or so, the share price has risen 10x faster than the company's revenues, the growth of which are decelerating while the share price is actually even accelerating. Something will simply have to give at a certain point.ScrutinyThe company has clearly got the attention of investors, but with that also comes a bit more scrutiny. SA contributor Parker Logan argues that the top line is inflated:If he's right (we refer you to the article to make up your own mind) than the revenue growth, which seems to be the most important metric at the moment for investors, might be quite a bit less than what the company publishes.ConclusionWe have no doubt that the company is executing very well and that there still is substantial growth ahead of the company. However, growth is decelerating and a path to profitability is quite a bit more murky, and in the meantime the share count is also growing quite a bit.Taking these realities into consideration, shares appreciating at 10x the level of underlying revenue growth is simply not tenable, especially in the light of the latest acceleration."
4071818,28141,2017-05-10T15:04:40-04:00,Market is incorrectly valuing Merchant Solutions Segment.P/S multiple is overstated when correctly adjusting revenue.A peer reconstruction of value indicates an overvaluation of 100%.,"Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) provides a compelling platform to easily develop e-commerce websites with no knowledge of programming. Its typical customer is a small business. It runs on the SaaS model where the customer will pay a monthly fee plus some additional charges for premium services and equipment.Short ThesisShopify's revenue generated by its core business (Subscription Solutions) has been overtaken by its complementary business (Merchant Solutions). This complementary business has generated enormous growth and fueled an irrational valuation. Meanwhile, I expect its core business growth to start slowing and competition to intensify.Shopify Revenue by Segment (Source: SHOP 20-Fs)Shopify's valuation has been painted in one broad stroke. When deconstructed and properly examined, its numbers paint a different story. Furthermore, executive management has chosen accounting practices that inflate revenue and gross profit margin. Shopify's shares can easily fall 50% based on the reconstruction of the P/S valuation.Merchant Solutions Segment Accounting PracticesShopify Payments provides payment processing services to its subscribers and makes up ~85% of Merchant Solutions revenue. Executive management has chosen to recognize revenue at the gross transaction fee. The majority of publicly-traded payment processors (GPN, VNTV, EVTC) recognize revenue at net transaction fee, which deducts the interchange rate. While this practice crushes gross margins, it inflates revenue. For new issues, it can be argued that revenue growth is more desirable and this accounting practice has assisted in Shopify's nose-bleed valuation.Below, I adjust the revenue if reported at net transaction fee:Current P/S TTM: 18xAdjusted P/S TTM: 28xThis accounting practice is not illegal and is used by another new issue, Square (NYSE:SQ). However, Square at least discloses non-GAAP net revenue guidance/metrics (along with other public payment processors) to investors and analysts. This net revenue guidance provides a clearer picture of growth and profitability.While this by itself can be uncontroversial, executive management decided it needed to protect its gross margins as well:This unorthodox accounting practice is not shared by any of its peers in merchant processing. Therefore, shareholders should take caution; executive management is earning a reputation of manipulating financials to enhance results.Public Market Sales Multiple ValuationValuing Subscription Solutions Segment (Core Business)Utilizing the EV/sales comp provides an accurate comparison to SaaS and CMS peers:I believe Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) provides the best publicly-traded comparison. Wix's subscription services currently target less e-commerce oriented customers; however, encompass the same small-business/self-employed demographic. It is guided to grow similarly to SHOP in 2017.Utilizing WIX's sales multiple for Shopify's Subscription Solutions, we would see the following:Valuing the Merchant Solutions Segment (Non-Core)Utilizing the EV/sales comp provides a more accurate comparison since many of SHOP's peers in merchant processing are mature and hold significant amounts of debt.Square is a fast-growing peer and has a discounted EV/sales ratio. The reason for this is because the market is correctly adjusting its valuation based on its gross revenue recognition practices (same as total system services) and growth.Utilizing Square's sales multiple for Shopify's Merchant Solutions, we would see the following:The argument can be made that SHOP's Merchant Solutions P/S multiple should be double of SQ's because it is growing twice as fast. This would approximately double the MS value from $9.50 to $20.Reconstructed Shopify Price/Sales Multiple ValuationThis reconstruction of the sales multiple would currently overvalue Shopify by over $45-55 per share.Reconstruction Market Value: $34-44 per share."
4068631,103020,2017-05-03T14:58:17-04:00,Strong cash position and increased sales guidance.Reduction in cost of revenues but an increase in operating expense ratios.Slowing down of stock-based compensation.,"Even with a compounded annual revenue growth rate of 67%, with the present operating ratios, Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) will struggle to make a profit. Unless Shopify can substantially grow its high margin subscription revenue, and/or reduce its operating ratios, in particular operating expense (which may be difficult to do because of stock-based compensation) then there are going to be years of widening losses. The share price is beyond inflated and investors should lock in profits.THE GOOD NEWS- Sales Guidance has been increased to $615 to $630 million for 2017.- Share Count. The increase in stock-based compensation (SBC) has slowed down to 1.24% (Q1 2017: Q4 2016). (SBC has a meaningful impact on operating costs, and tangentially investors should ignore non-GAAP based ""adjusted"" earnings. This short, excellent article explains why.- Cash Position. Shopify has about $400 million cash on hand, enough for 5 years (GAAP) operations at the projected 2017 GAAP cash burn rate, or about 20 years non-GAAP. In view of the enthusiasm for the company going forward, there should be no difficulty in raising further financing but of course that will carry the corresponding share dilution.- Cost Of Revenues Ratio has marginally improved to 0.43 compared to the last 2 years (2015: .45 and 2016: .46).THE BAD NEWS- Operating Expense Ratio (% of Revenue) has widened to 0.68 compared to the last 2 years (2015:.65 and 2016: .63).PROJECTED PROFITABILITY/(LOSSES)To project future profits/(losses) using the same spreadsheet per our previous Seeking Alpha article on Shopify (Shopify Is Overvalued - Take Profits), we have made these assumptions:- 2017 revenue is $650 million- CAGR is 67% (2017: $650 2016: $389)- Cost of Revenue Ratio is 0.43- Operating Expense Ratio is 0.68- Share Count grows by 5% paWith these assumptions, the spreadsheet predicts a 2017 net GAAP loss of $73 million, almost exactly per the guidance given in the Q1 2017 report ($72 million).The spreadsheet also assumes an annual 5% share dilution because of SBC, which is critical to Shopify to retain staff. As can be seen, this scenario produces an array of widening losses.We have then tweaked the spreadsheet to see what operating ratios would change the situation, with this result (cost of revenue ratio reduced to 0.40 and operating expense ratio reduced by 13% to 0.59):As can be seen even with these improvements, which brings Shopify into profit, the P/E multiple is not market-related until 7 or more years out. In fact, per the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, the SBC accounts for 10.6% of the operating expense. Shopify is in a cleft stick, as they need to keep on awarding SBC to retain and recruit new talent as the company grows so we would expect this aspect to follow revenue growth.There is a significant additional risk. On the one hand, one can argue that as the platform gains traction, the CAGR could increase, even to 3 figures. However, exactly the opposite argument can be made that it may be increasingly difficult to maintain or exceed such lofty growth history, particularly as the TAM runway shortens. A slowing down of growth will not sit well with investors, many of whom are super hyped up on the prospects of the Shopify Platform.TAKEAWAYRight now, the market is just paying for revenue growth and hoped for profitability years out and not looking much further. There's a lot of smoke as the market sucks in (at an inflated stock price) more retail investors reading headlines who are dreaming of Shopify riches. This may eventually come to pass, but it is probably going to take years, and the current PPS is basically absurd. We repeat the mantra from our previous article that investors should lock in profits.One recalls Mr. Micawber's famous, and oft-quoted, recipe for happiness from Charles Dickens' David Copperfield:"
4067298,21815,2017-05-01T01:37:40-04:00,"The shares of Shopify, already tremendously valued, rallied another 50% in the past three months.We fear this sets us up for an earnings disappointment.We provide some pointers in what to look for.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) will present first quarter earnings on May the second in after hours. At first sight, this is a dicey proposition with plenty of space for disappointment for three reasons:ValuationThe rich valuation is immediately obvious. At $76 per share, the company has a market cap of $6.54 billion, whilst 2016 revenues were just a fraction of that ($389M). The company guided 2017 revenue as between $580 million-$600 million; so this gives it a price/sales ratio of over 11.That's very steep for a company which isn't profitable, and still seems pretty far away from reaching profitability as well. Don't be fooled by the small loss in Q4, since that's mostly due to seasonality. The company still expects an operating loss of $18 million-$22 million for 2017, and what's more, there is a planned $55 million payout in terms of share compensation.So there is no escaping that the shares are very richly valued. Given the growth rate and the position in the market, a high valuation is warranted though, even if we're not quite sure it should be this high.The company is the clear market leader in helping companies moving online, and its platform is so good that even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gave up on something similar and partners with Shopify instead (even if this isn't an exclusive partnership).So we think the valuation is based on three main planks:GrowthThe company has guided revenue growth for 2017 well below what it realized in previous years - years of often triple-digit revenue growth. In 2016, revenues grew by 90%, but this year, they're only expected to grow by 49%-54%.Clearly, investors are considerably more optimistic than that:As you can see, the shares are up 50% since February. Q4 growth versus Q4 2015 was still 85.8% (handily beating company guidance of 73% revenue growth), if the Q1 number (versus Q1 2016) comes well below that, we fear investors will be disappointed; such was the magnitude of the rally.There are, of course, a host of drivers of the growth, like (by no means exhaustive):Shopify Plus seems especially interesting as this was off to a flying start (per Q3 CC):In a short space of time, the company has collected 2500 corporate clients in Shopify Plus. Q4 alone was responsible for 1500 of these new signings (per Q4 CC). One thing to keep an eye on is the move to flexible pricing for Shopify Plus (a 0.25% fee of sales, varying from $2000 to a maximum of $40,000 per month, thanks to SA contributor Richmond Howard for discovering these details in what's a fine article).LeverageGrowth matters not just for maintaining investor optimism; it matters also to increase its market position and achieve leverage. The company has two main revenue sources:Leverage is produced by revenue growth, as sales and marketing (S&M), general and administrative expense (G&M), and research and development (R&D) grow slower, these costs become a decreasing proportion of revenue, and this should expand margins.However, this is at least in part countered by the fact that revenue from merchant solutions grow considerably faster than the revenue generated by subscription services, whilst the latter produce significantly higher margins (79% versus 26%).The R&D and G&A show little leverage, as it's constant as a percentage of revenues, S&M do indeed show leverage. Given the difference in margins between the two categories of revenues, how are gross margins developing? Well:Basically they have declined, the leverage coming from rising revenue is trumped by the fact that lower margin revenue (merchant solutions) grows faster than high margin revenue (subscriptions).Q1 guidanceThe company expects revenue in the range of $120 million-$122 million and an adjusted operating loss of $9 million-$11 million. If we compare that to Q1 2016, when revenue was $72.72 million, the growth they are guiding for is 65%-67.7%. That is already quite a slowdown from the growth in Q1 2016 (94.7%).ConclusionHaving recommended the shares only a short while ago at a much lower price (February 23 at roughly $55.5), we would not buy before earnings. Given the tremendous rally the past two months in the face of the company guiding growth significantly lower, we think investors expect hardly any slowdown in growth.Therefore, a big growth number seems necessary to beat the expectations. We think that growth should be at least 75%-80% for the shares not to sink materially. If growth is indeed in the mid-60s like the company guided, there is likely to be a pretty good selloff.However, unless growth really disappoints a lot, we think that any post-earnings blues in the share price offers a nice long-term perspective, as we still have every reason to think this is the dominant market player in this space.After all, 65% growth would still be rather phenomenal and keep the market domination and leverage narratives still alive in our view. The problem is simply that too much seems to have been built into the share price at present."
4070564,102634,2017-05-08T08:54:40-04:00,First quarter results beat expectations.2017 will be another year of growth for Shopify.Shopify looks to outperform.,"In 2017, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) has been a top performing stock rising over 100%. With impressive earnings releases in the last couple of quarters, the stock price has increased at a rapid pace. Can Shopify meet growing expectations in the coming months? Are there any warning signs investors should be aware of? I will analyze the first quarter earnings report to determine if the momentum-fueled rally will continue.First Quarter EarningsOn May 3, Shopify reported their first quarter results. Total revenue reached $127.4 million, a 75% increase from the comparable quarter in 2016. Subscription revenue jumped 60% year-over-year to $62.1 million, with the merchant membership hitting 400,000. In addition, the monthly recurring revenue was $20.7 million compared with $12.8 million as of March 31, 2016. Revenue for the merchant solutions segment topped $65.3 million, signifying year-over-year growth of 92%. The gross merchandise volume soared 81% to $4.8 billion. This was lower than the 102% increase from Q1 in 2016. According to management, the decrease was a normal seasonal decline. Gross payments volume grew to $1.8 billion and accounted for 38% of gross merchandise volume processed in the quarter. Still Shopify remains unprofitable with GAAP operating loss of $14.5 million and adjusted operating loss at $4.3 million.Management AnalysisDuring the earnings conference call, management was confident enough in the first quarter results to raise guidance. Revenues are now expected to reach between $615 million and $630 million, up from prior estimates of $580 million to $600 million. GAAP operating loss will be in the range of $69 million to $73 million, down from $73 million to $77 million. While adjusted operating loss should hit $14 million to $18 million, versus $18 million to $22 million. I think the improved guidance is a positive signal that management expects further growth. CFO Russ Jones touted a record quarter of new merchant additions and anticipated that momentum will continue into Q2. Currently, the biggest growth drivers for Shopify are Shopify Payments, Shipping and Capital. Shopify Payments accounted for $1.8 billion of the $4.8 billion gross merchandise volume in the quarter. As CFO Russ Jones explained ""In terms of payment volume, it continues to grow. There's an incentive for merchants new to the platform to also adopt Shopify Payments."" Shopify Shipping has seen tremendous growth too with nearly one in four merchants with orders originating in the US utilizing the service. The adoption of cash advances by merchants eligible for Shopify Capital increased to $49 million by the end of the first quarter and now totals more than $60 million as of April 30, 2017. Another big contributor in Q1 was Shopify Plus. The service offers a tailored scalable commerce platform for large corporations. Some existing clients include Fossil Group, Live Nation and Harley Quinn. Based on Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Shopify Plus was up 150% year-over-year and accounted for $3.5 million or 17% of MRR. In the coming quarters, I believe Shopify Payments, Shipping and Capital will continue to push revenue forward. A couple of weeks ago, Shopify organized the Unite conference in San Francisco. Over 1,000 app developers and web designers were on hand to see the latest features including Shopify Point-of-Sale Card Reader, Shopify Pay, Whole Channel for Plus and New Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). COO Harry Finkelstein explained Shopify's innovation push stating ""Together with our partners, we are combining our passion for entrepreneurship with our passion for technology to make starting and growing a retail operation as easy as possible."" I think Shopify will remain the leading commerce platform by developing new features and receiving feedback from businesses. Another key partnership for Shopify is with Amazon. Currently, merchants are able to sync Shopify products to Amazon listings and cross-sell in minutes. This feature has increased activity with the Shopify platform which totaled 12 billion interactions over the past 10 years.ConclusionOverall, I am satisfied with management's effort in growing the Shopify platform. At this time, one of my biggest concerns is Shopify remaining unprofitable. As with other growth companies, the operating loss of $4.3 million and GAAP operating loss of $14.5 million are due to investments in growth. This quarter, Shopify spent roughly $45 million on sales and marketing, and increased its customer count by over 25,000. In the long term, I think Shopify will be able to spend less in operating expenses as the merchant count grows and key products like Shopify Payment are adopted by more customers. Right now, I understand management's number one priority is growth and profit will come as the business matures. CEO Tobi Lutke explained his vision for the future stating ""In order to build long-term value, we decided to forgo short-term revenue opportunities and nurture the people who were putting their trust in Shopify."" I believe Shopify understands its success is tied to the success of its customers and this mindset will benefit everyone, including investors. The bottom line is Shopify's core business has healthy gross margins and could be profitable in 2017 if it weren't investing heavily in sales and marketing."
4069084,98236,2017-05-04T12:03:48-04:00,"Shopify reported the results of its Q1 the other day.Results continued a patter of over-attainment on both the top line and earnings.Guidance was also increased, mainly to take account of the Q1 over-attainment.Some analysts are concerned about share valuation and have presented a scenario with rapid reversion to mean in terms of growth cadence.The thesis is likely to prove inaccurate based on the company's new initiatives into many areas to facilitate E-commerce.","Shopify-The ABC's of the powerhouse of E-Commerce platformsWhy write an article on Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) in the wake of another strong quarter? Possibly because it is instructive to see how real growth companies look. Possibly because the shares were actually downgraded by one analyst yesterday and another analyst downgraded the shares in the wake of earnings to sell. And possibly because the company presents an object lesson in what to expect from growth enterprises that you will not see in analyst reports.There is one issue that analysts and investors have to ponder in considering this name-how much are the shares worth. By now, Shopify is acknowledged to be the leader in its space. The downgrade from Merrill Lynch alluded to above was based on ""the need to retain valuation discipline.""I have two problems with the thesis presented by the analyst. One of those is the supposition that price targets are like soldiers and that to get things correct it is merely necessary to use a formula (usually Discount to Present Value or some variant) although in this case the analyst has cited some measure of premium to average EV/S.Interestingly, in the case of this particular research note, Merrill raised its price target from $62 to $84. Since the stock is $82, the potential upside is less than 5%. What happened to the appreciation between $62 when the analyst made the shares a hold and now is left unsaid. If the price target methodology produces such shockingly awful results, the case for using it going forward is pretty fraught. (In fact the shares are up by 90% YTD and up by 187% over the past year, and most assuredly that appreciation was far greater than the price targets of almost all analysts who follow the name.)And that gets me to the second cavil. Simply put, most analysts, with a natural bias regarding reversion to the mean, will not ""get"" the opportunity for a business like Shopify which is tearing up the playbook on how potential entrepreneurs become merchants. No one knows how large that market is because no one before has ever been able to open a business using these kinds of tools. And the recent addition of a POS device, as well as shipping, payments and capital to the mix of tools available from Shopify simply makes it harder still to define the TAM for this space.Shopify has 2 basic buckets in which its collects revenue. These are Subscription Solutions which is basically the monthly fees that merchants pay the company for the use of its platform and Merchant Solutions, the charges the company collects for specific services, most importantly including the charge that the company receives for payments through the site. Merchant solutions is slightly larger these days compared to Subscription Solutions and is growing noticeably more rapidly. It is one reason why I think the company's growth rate is likely to maintain high levels far longer than the consensus. The company's gross merchandise volume grew by 81% year on year The 11 points of difference between GMV and revenue growth related to other merchant solutions such as capital and shipping that are starting to contribute noticeably to revenue. One of the key differentiators that will likely enable SHOP to maintain its growth rate at higher levels than forecast by analysts is that it has become a one stop shop for aspiring web merchants with more services that can simplify the life of an aspiring retail entrepreneur. And the services to which users can subscribe include both those developed by SHOP and its network of who are using its platform and API's to offer SHOP customers lots of custom solutions.At this point, as the analysis linked here shows, Shopify is said to have a 7% market share. There are significant problems with the study. The market leader in terms of # of sites, Woo Commerce gives away its product and does not have a fully functional E-Commerce platform. Magneto, with an 8% share, is losing customers and SHOP has been successful in its marketing campaigns to attract Magneto users. Woo and Magneto together have a 47% share. How much of that 47% is available to SHOP? What might the cadence be in terms of SHOP take-aways.Of course, the company has just reported its results for fiscal Q1 which affords contributors the opportunity to use the newly published results as a backdrop with which to display the company's virtues…and whatever issues perceived by some observers. The results were apparently stronger than expected by analysts and investors as the shares appreciated by 7% in the wake of earnings.Most observers have long since come to the belief that SHOP will beat expectations and raise guidance consistently. In terms of providing readers with trading advice, I find it well-nigh impossible to know what constitutes an adequate beat or a large enough raise. To be sure, this quarter was a more significant beat than many in the company's history.The company increased its revenue forecast by 5% for the year, after beating revenue expectations for the just announced quarter by about 5% in Q1. At the mid-point of guidance, that would bring full year top-line growth to 60%. That compares to 75% growth in Q1 and probably leaves the company with some additional potential to exceed published expectations for the balance of the year. It is also likely that analysts will raise 2018 top-lines estimates noticeably above the current expectation for 37% growth in 2018.In the case of the Merrill report previously cited, the analyst increased his 2017 estimate to be congruent with management guidance and increased his 2018 forecast to maintain the same percentage growth rate embodied in his old analysis. Why might revenue growth decrease from 60% to 35% next year and then decelerate further to 30% in 2019. And if revenue growth did decelerate in that fashion, how fast would earnings growth really be. The company just went through a quarter in which its opex growth was about 75%. Presumably that kind of growth was to support rapid growth in the future. My own guess is that the growth will not slow down at anywhere near the rate assumed by some. I assume that the company expects to beat the guidance it has provided consistently. And it will, indeed, need to beat guidance to support a stock price that has been one of the better performers in the universe that I follow.So, the reason to write an article about SHOP is that the company continues to find ways to extend its hyper growth streak and over-attain expectations. It is highly unlikely to be able to continue to see its share price grow at the rates of the recent past. The shares are valued at more than 11X EV/S, although the ""S"" is a very questionable number that will almost inevitably be altered in the course of the coming quarterly earnings announcements. But it still has the opportunity to appreciate as investors re-think what a reasonable growth rate expectation is for the company. It is totally likely, I believe, to see the current 37% consensus forecast for 2017 to become 50% and that would go a long way to providing positive alpha for this name.The formula for hyper-growthThe formula includes dominance of one of the more rapidly growing spaces in the software world, a charismatic leader who has built a highly effective team that has pushed the organization to focus on growth-and not least of all a willingness to spend at rates that simply are beyond the comfort zone for some observers/analysts.More electrons have been spilled on the subject of the end of brick and mortar retailing. I don't want to add any unnecessary electrons to that debate. But Shopify, as well as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is the other side of that equation. That Amazon is and will remain the gorilla of e-Commerce is very likely. But Shopify has made it possible for merchants to set up a store that functions well and can provide a service to consumers. It is still a new frontier in retailing.Shopify spending continued growing at an unabated cadence this quarter and GAAP losses grew while GAAP opex grew at the same overall rate as revenue. Gross margins were able to grow about 100 bps because the company's Merchant Solutions, which have higher gross margins than what the company calls Subscription Services, is growing a bit more rapidly and has become a slightly greater percentage of total revenues and has continued to grow gross margins in the process.I think at this point, the story of Shopify is known by many growth stock investors but remains a bit less known by investors as a while. The company simply has a better solution for most users who want to build an E-commerce on the web and haven't a clue as to how to go about the task.Many times in preparing articles I comment about competitive positioning using available material from industry consultants. I have no real direct way of determining whether or not the virtualization offered by Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) on a desktop is better than that offered by VMWare (VMWWhile I don't want to pose as an expert on web site construction tools, I think I have a little bit more foundation which I use beyond the rather bloodless commentary seen in analyst reports. I have used Shopify and it works well and is as advertised-reliable and user-friendly. Most of the competition is far less capable and has far older technology with less effective user interfaces. The fact is that Q1 saw a record increase in the number of merchants added by the company. Obviously records like that are going to have to be set more often than not for percentage growth to continue at the rates that it has, but the ability the company is having in continuing to attract customers is probably a testimony the functionality of its offering as much as anything else.While setting up a web store using Shopify is not quite as self-service as advertised, it can be done quite rapidly and a prospective merchant can be enabled with all that is required to open a business from an operational point of view. That is a capability that has never before existed and is certainly a far cry than what is required to set up a bricks and mortar store.The size of the E-Commerce space as a whole is probably unknowable at this point. A business with no historical parameters is hard business to forecast as there are no signposts of comparables or historical precedents to use. In the case of a company like Shopify that is consistently adding new services for its merchants, it is even harder to accurately project a long term growth rate.Some of the newer services such as Capital and Shipping that round the offering are providing a small but noticeable improvement in gross margins. It is very likely going forward that these new services will contribute meaningfully to growth in ways dimly understood at the moment.Is the company Pivoting Up-Market?One of the principal growth opportunities for Shopify is a pivot upmarket. Shopify's future, in whole or part is going to be played out in the next few years within its offering of ShopifyPlus. The company is beginning to achieve revenue traction from its Plus offering. The company doesn't specifically report the results of the Plus offering but it is said to be about 10% of revenues. Last quarter the company started to offer what it calls Wholesale Channel for Plus. This is an offering that allows merchants to create a separate storefront from which the merchant can offer wholesale prices.But Plus is mainly designed for merchants who have surpassed volume levels that are traditional for basic Shopify. Within Plus are stores for brands such as GE, Red Bull, Nestle and even Tesla. I have linked a 3rd party review of ShopifyPlus that was prepared in February that probably answers many questions about why the platform is likely to add to SHOP's growth.At one point, Plus service was designed as an offering for the SHOP installed base who could migrate seamlessly as their operations expanded and their GMV became substantial. Pricing today is such that the platform has been attracting net new merchants. The company has a promotion these days in which it offers Shopify Plus free to Magneto customers for a 6 months' span.Plus is sold based on several major value propositions. It has developed a very extensive eco-system that allows even the largest retailers to develop a custom store that incorporates highly specific features that are important to some particular users.The company's eco-system-this is real the target for the eco-system-will turn out to be a principle advantage for plus customers For the most part SHOP has made ease of migration and launch key component of its offering. And it really has been a pioneer in the multi-channel capabilities of the service. In addition, Plus offers the ability to deal with surges of up to 10,000 checkouts/hour and a high level of security. I have provided a link to a rather thorough review here. As can be seen, the reviewer likes the fact that the service essentially outsources the requirements for a company to have its own e-commerce capabilities.The thing about ShopifyPlus from the point of view of investors is that it produces revenues per user that average something more than 20X the price of Shopify. (Shopify offers all kinds of plans for all kinds of use cases. Plus itself offers loads of different service options but the most basic capability starts at $2000/month.) I think that if one is projecting a growth trajectory, it is key for this company to break beyond the SMB space-it simply a matter of market size. It has some large customers with whom this writer has never heard-but that is more a function of the conservatism of the writer.Shopify Plus is really aimed at successful retail entrepreneurs who already have a successful store and are seeking to establish a web presence. In some instances, the potential customer has jury-built his/her own web show front but it isn't working well and takes substantial management resources. In other cases, Plus is the initial platform to which the merchants go in establishing a web presence.In any event, the potential size of this market-and it really does appear to have different parameters when compared to the company's SMB homeland-may be larger than the potential size of the company's original focus on SMB start-ups. Those analysts who choose to forecast rapidly declining percentage growth rates do so without considering the potential opportunity that SHOP has outside of the SMB space with substantial enterprises who are looking for a service that is reliable, scalable, customizable and can eliminate the pains of supporting a home grown platform.The question of valuationValuation is most certainly no science despite the best efforts of some to portray price targets as being much more than a whim and a prayer. I will not try to make the case that SHOP shares are cheap. The company has 90.2 million shares outstanding which reflects the capital raise the company did last summer. At the current market price of about $82. That yields a market capitalization of about $7.4 billion. The company has $395 million of cash and no debt. So the enterprise value is around $7 billion. Current year sales have been projected by the company to be a bit over $620 million at the current guidance range. They will most likely be higher. But an EV/S of greater than 11X is an outlier, even in this market.The company is now forecasting a non-GAAP EPS loss of $.07 for this current quarter. This would appear to be quite conservative. Because of seasonality, Q1 can be expected to be the nadir of revenues from merchant solutions. Part of the forecast is built on revenue assumptions that do not seem to be realistic. It would, I think, be surprising if quarterly revenues rose by only 12% sequentially, both because of the record new subscribers who chose SHOP in the just past quarter as well as the seasonality that has been historically in evidence with regards to Merchant solutions revenues. I would be surprised as well, if the company weren't able to improve marginally on its Q1 non-GAAP EPS. But no one buying these shares today is doing so based on its' projected P/E for the next couple of years. Potential investors want to see hyper-growth and to achieve hyper-growth it is more or less inevitable that the company will build up sales and marketing and research and development. The expansion of Shopify Capital, particularly as well as shipping and of course pay will probably yield a higher level of gross margins in the future. But Capital is likely to require some more substantial levels of general and administrative expense.The climb to respectable operating margins is going to be a long one. It should be noted that stock based comp expense, while small at 7% of revenues increased by 2.5X year on year. Part of this relates to the very strong share price appreciation and part of it relates to the rapid increase in staff, almost all of whom get stock awards when they join the company.Shopify generated $4 million of operating cash (CFFO) last quarter. The company doesn't forecast that metric and regardless, it hasn't reached a level of significance that would determine an investment decision. Cash flow last quarter was created because of stock-based comp., some contribution from balance sheet items and a larger contribution from deferred revenues. But at the end of the day, this has not been and will not be a cash flow story. The company will have to achieve material improvements in operating profits and that is not going to be a quick climb.Yes, the shares are expensive when looked and compared to what are called comparable companies. But the company is growing 2x or more the rate of those comparable companies. Of course the shares are not likely to double every 4 months or I will be forced to sell mine, much though I do not wish to do so. But for those investors looking at perhaps the absolute best set of expectations to be seen in what I consider the enterprise software space, look no further. The quarter was strong, the outlook provided by management is eminently beatable and the company is just at the start of its life in terms of disrupting the retail space. I am willing to sacrifice quite a bit to invest in a company with that kind of opportunity."
4067815,100666,2017-05-02T10:36:51-04:00,"Shopify is an eCommerce platform with a lot of potential.Some key data about the stock and what you can learn from these data..Shopify lives up to all my qualitative demands: a good story, a visionary CEO, it is innovating, has a long-term vision, triple and double digit growth ahead and it has.Shopify is a possible multibagger for the next years and decades, whatever the May 2 earnings bring.","In my last article, I wrote about why you should own growth stocks in your portfolio. That doesn't mean that I write dividend stocks off, far from it, but I just think that if you have a long time horizon, you could get some multibaggers if you pick just a few good growth stocks and basically keep them for the very long term (think decades). I have explained what I look for with growth stocks. I forgot to mention just one simple thing: smaller market cap. If a company has a $400 B market cap, it is more difficult to triple than if it has just a $4B market cap.The first growth stock to buy now and hold for a very long time, may be on the radar of many investors: Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). Maybe you are already a stockholder or maybe you are holding off because you think the stock is overpriced. The good thing is: if you invest for the very long term, an 'expensive' stock doesn't mean that much. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been expensive all the way from its split-adjusted $1.50 back in 1997.First a short introduction for those who don't know Shopify:In plain language: Shopify helps retailers to boost sales on the web, on Facebook and through mobile communication. It does everything from setting up the digital store, the advertisements, the orders, the stock inventory, the payments, etc. The retailers pay a subscription. I like subscription companies, because if they are good at what they do, people tend to stay. Other examples of subscription stocks: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and from Amazon: Prime and AWS. These are just a few.There is also Shopify Plus for bigger clients. In the company's own words:The margins are higher on the smaller retailers, but the numbers in dollars of the biggest are of course more impressive.This is Shopify's stock price evolution since its IPO:Some key data of the stock:There is a lot to learn from these data. Some highlights:As you can see in this simplywall.st graph, the company is not expected to be earnings positive until somewhere in the beginning of the next decade.So, if you consider to by Shopify shares, it must almost by definition be for the long term, because purely mathematical, this is a bad investment. But if you look at the qualitative side of the picture, I see something else. And for growth stocks the qualitative element is often more important than just the numbers and ratios, often to the aversion of more conservative investors.I see a company that invests heavily in itself to grow. This is the R&D money that has been spent since the IPO:So about 20% of all the revenue goes into R&D. Let's check the other criteria that I have provided in my previous article.1. The company must have a good story. Now this may seem petty, but companies that have ideas that they can articulate well and make investors enthusiastic about will probably have the same conviction in trying to win their customers.Shopify has a good story. It is easy to pitch this company. 'It will make your business online sales boom.' The company is smart enough to devote a whole page of their website to success stories, such as that of Angelus Direct's:These stories inspire people to try it themselves. Small startups or more traditional brick-and-mortar retailers may be inspired by these stories.2. A visionary CEOOne of the most valuable aspects of growth stocks is having a visionary CEO, a great leader that has exceptional qualities as to where the company is heading. In the case of Shopify this is Tobi Lütke.(Source: Simplywall.st)And the man has an interesting story. Lütke was born in Germany and got his first computer (allegedly a Commodore 64) at the age six. When he was 11 or 12 he already rewrote the code of his computer games. He dropped out of high school at the age of 16 because he found computers much more fun. When he was 21 he moved to Canada for a girl and his love for snowboarding.There he started Snowdevil, a snowboard shop, from the garage of his parents-in-law in 2004. Since Lütke didn't like the technology to sell his snowboard equipment, he changed it thoroughly and ended up founding Shopify in 2006. In 2008, when his co-founder left the company, Lütke had to become the CEO. At first reluctantly, but he felt he learned more about being a CEO every day and that is why he stayed. In less than 10 years time he was able to grow Shopify to a company with a market cap of more than $6B. And if you are not convinced yet, listen to his interview here. (In the beginning he is somewhat nervous, being the computer geek he is, but after 15 minutes or so, he starts the more visionary talk).3. An innovating companyA growth stock must be innovating. If the company doesn't innovate, it doesn't have a growth stock. This again certainly applies to Shopify. Lütke himself found that the existing online shop software was not good enough and especially not simple. Shopify makes it simple for the online entrepreneur. They handle everything and the entrepreneur can do what he wants to do: concentrate on his product and grow his business. That is innovation right in the area of commerce where the future is: more diversification through the internet. People don't want the same as all the others anymore. They want something unique and easy and online retailers can provide that. Diversification (and price) is also what made Amazon big.4. A long-term visionWhether I pick DGI stocks or growth stocks, I don't change my strategy: I buy stocks for the long road. Mostly I am a buy-and-hold guy. In my bio here on SA, there is the sentence that I don't think in years but rather in decades. As a consequence, I pick stocks of companies that are leaders in a certain area and will probably be the leader in five or ten years' time as well. I am pretty convinced that Shopify will be the leader in this segment in five or ten years time as well.If you ask people what the future of retail is, the general answer will be Amazon. Well, instead of typing every single item you want to sell into Amazon, you can simply use Shopify. It will keep score of your stock inventory, handle the order, take care of the payments and basically integrate every single detail from your Amazon selling.5. At least double-digit growth over the next five yearsThis seems a quantifiable and simple benchmark, but it is not. What I mean is that you mostly should not look simply to EPS. Because of the heavy investing that comes with building out an empire, the EPS of high growth stocks are often futile or even negative. That doesn't matter as long as there is growth in the revenues.FAST graphs shows that Shopify's growth will be rather in the triple digits then in the double digits for the next five years. Only the fifth year gives double digits, but that is because there is no estimate yet.6. The three OsThe three Os are some of the most important qualities for growth stocks: they really should have as much as possible of what I call the three Os: overachieving, owning, and overdelivering.Lütke's story itself shows he is an overachiever. And what about these quotes?(Source: NYTimes.com)In the interview I mentioned above (in the visionary CEO part) you can find several somewhat concealed features of an overachiever too. Concealed because Lütke is a German and lives in Canada, two societies in which openly pronounced overachieving is looked at rather negatively?The owning has already been discussed earlier. According to Seeking Alpha the insiders own about 7% of the company. But if you look at simplywall.st, you see this structure:Here you can see that the company insiders hold more than 20% of the stock. This is because Shopify has, just as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), a dual class structure for its stock, making sure that insiders (and/or early investors) can still make most of the decisions about the strategic future for the company. So more than enough of ownership here.As to overdelivering we should look at Shopify's short history of earnings delivery:(Source: streetinsider.com)As you can see in those two years, Shopify has not let its investors down. Its average beat was more than 50%. That is what I call overdelivering!Multibagger?Traditionally the market tends to give premium prices for high growth stocks. Shopify is a high growth stock. But with a market cap of just $6B, it could be a tenbagger or so over the next decade(s). I think that more and more retail will be individually customized and online could force offline to the second place. Those are secular trends that are unstoppable, in my opinion. Not in five years or so, but over the next few decades, this will simply be the reality. Since Shopify is seen as the best eCommerce platform there is still a lot of room to grow until you have a multibagger stock. There will be bump in the road, for sure, but that is the case for all stocks and even more for growth stocks.Conclusion and earningsI write this article before Shopify's earnings release on May 2, 2017. I don't care all that much what the reaction of the market will be to Shopify's results. I will keep on building my position in this great quality growth stock. If it falls, great, I can buy at a lower price then. If it goes up because it overdelivers again, great too. In 20 years time it won't matter all that much.Over the next few articles, I will highlight some other growth stocks that could be potential multibaggers.

4068736,103092,2017-05-03T18:05:06-04:00,"I break down the Q1 earnings call and identify key drivers for future growth.Even at the current prices, Shopify is still a buy.150% YOY revenue growth from Shopify Plus.","Last Thursday, I published my first ever article on Seeking Alpha, ""Will Shopify Continue to Outperform?"" presenting the case for Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) long-term success. If you are considering an investment in Shopify stock, I highly recommend reading the article to gain an understanding of its revenue streams and the massive retail opportunity the company has before itself. As part of your due diligence, I would also recommend reading the following articles.I ended my article with an earnings prediction calling for a beat in revenues and a substantial rise in full-year guidance.The numbers came in strong, with a big earnings beat for revenue as well as EPS, and the company gave us a significant $15-50 million raise to year-end revenue guidance.The Financial Highlights for the Quarter:Source: Shopify Announces First-Quarter 2017 Financial Results, Seeking AlphaThe market responded as expected, and after a roller coaster of a day, we ended at $82.98, surging up nearly 14% since my Buy call at $72.88 last Thursday at the time of writing this.Source: YChartsShopify is a Long-Term BuyToday, I am reiterating my long-term call on Shopify with even greater conviction. Potential investors should have the opportunity to acquire shares under $80 as the price fluctuates before the next stock price run-up.Over the next few weeks, we will likely see analysts raise their price targets for Shopify from an average of $76.86 to a range of $80-100. As the market recognizes the growth potential of the company, we will witness the stock price break out to further highs.Earnings Report Broken DownTuesday was a great day for Shopify stockholders, as the company surged nearly 8%, but the best news of the day for me came during the conference call with the Shopify team. They outlined new sales channels, positive margin expansion, platform growth for plus and non-plus users, and a number of small gems that point to sustained explosive growth in revenue.Allow me to break these down as concisely as possible:1. Record Platform GrowthIn the Q1 earnings call, the Shopify team announced that they would no longer be giving quarterly updates on the number of merchants the platform has. Normally, this may give reason to be concerned, but I personally believe they are withholding this number to keep market expectations in check.On the call, they did state that they had a ""Record number of merchants join the platform in the period,"" and after one analyst asked for clarification, they stated that this number did, in fact, exceed Q4 merchant add growth.A record quarter would mean at least 50,000 merchants added in Q1 alone. At a minimum, the company now has at least 425,000 users, and with 3 more quarters to add throughout the year, we can expect it to easily break 500k users this year. If this quarterly merchant acquisition is maintained, it will end the year with over 575,000 users.Let's try to get an idea of where the year-end revenue may end up.Unfortunately, we don't have much guidance from the earnings call to determine ARPU, but my prediction based on prior numbers is $1176, giving me a full-year revenue estimate of $676.2 million. This number has the potential to swing higher if ARPU rises for the year due to the pricing change for Shopify Plus and other revenue drivers.This prediction would give us 74% YOY revenue growth from the $389.5 million reported for 2016.2. Shopify Plus Revenue up 150% YOY in Q1In my last article, I mentioned the pricing structure change for Shopify Plus merchants as one of two major catalysts for the company as 2017 unfolds:In the Q1 press release, we were given one small line regarding the Plus platform's contribution for the quarter:At first glance, growth from 11% to 17% of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is nothing to be impressed by, but when we consider the growth in quarterly revenue from $72.7 million to $127.4 million, we can calculate a YoY increase of 150% for Shopify Plus. This is largely due to the growth in merchants as well as the new pricing structure.The caveat worth mentioning here is that CFO Russ Jones stated that the Plus fees collected in excess of the $2000 minimum monthly payment may end being counted as Merchant Solutions revenue. This does not affect the total revenue, but it could give merchant solutions margins a nice boost.As the company continues to grow, I believe the Shopify Plus platform still represents one of its greatest growth opportunities, especially as more large B&M retailers shift their focus to e-commerce.3. Wholesale Channel for Plus UsersShopify's business model is simple: Develop the product, introduce new sales channels, grow the user base, find new strategic partnerships, and tighten their margins through operational efficiencies.On the earnings call, the company announced that it would be introducing a new wholesale channel for Shopify Plus users looking to do more B2B sales. It is confident existing users will take well to this, as they recognize there has been a ""long-standing need for merchants to seamlessly tap in to their wholesale market.""This will also open the door to new companies who deal entirely in the Business-to-Business market. It won't have an immediate material impact, but each new sales channel is an opportunity to bolster new merchant acquisition.The Biggest Risk Going ForwardThe biggest risk that Shareholders Unite outlined for us is that the presently overvalued stock price is dependent on the company continuing to blow out quarters.All of us strong bulls need to recognize that if Shopify had come in at or below earnings yesterday morning, the stock would be tanking just like AMD has in the last 48 hours. Stocks that are overvalued can continue to go up, as many have stated in reference to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).My entire prediction last week was based on the company beating its own forecast for the 6th straight time. There will come a quarter where it fails to do so, and when it does, investors can expect a significant pullback as Shareholders Unite has predicted. It could happen next quarter, a year from now or 5 years from now. This is a risk long-term investors must be willing to stomach.I personally believe 2017 will be another hyper-growth year for Shopify, and then in 2018 we will begin to see slowing in growth as the law of large numbers takes over. If you believe, as I do, that the company has several more quarters of stock appreciation before the growth slows, then now is the time to buy.Buy Recommendation and Target PriceOver the long term, there is no question that Shopify's stock price will continue to appreciate. There is no other company I am more confident in over the next 5-10 years. It is well positioned to take advantage of an exploding shift to online retail.I recommend a Buy at current prices for investors looking to make SHOP a long-term hold in their portfolio. I am personally overweight in SHOP, but will pick up additional shares if the stock dips back down to $75.Author Note: If you are interested in getting to-the-minute updates on my coverage on Shopify as well as future coverage of other investment opportunities, please hit the bright orange ""Follow"" button just below this article.

4066156,103092,2017-04-27T13:42:03-04:00,Shopify's revenue sources explained: Monthly Recurring Revenue and Gross Merchandise Value.Earnings prediction: $129.5 million in revenue for Q1 and full year 2017 guidance of $620 million.Catalysts for future growth: Global retail trends & Shopify Plus pricing change.,"What is Shopify?Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is the provider of a cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses. Plainly speaking, companies and individuals use the software to design, set up, and manage all of their sales channels from online and social media to brick and mortar and pop-up shops.Shopify simplifies the online selling experience for their merchants by handling the back-end work such as processing payments, integrating payment options, shipping products, and maintaining site security, which frees up the entrepreneurs and companies to do what they do best - focus on their product and making sales.Last reported, they had over 375,000 active merchants (users/stores) with massive companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Budweiser (NYSE:BUD), GE (NYSE:GE), Red Bull, as well as popular brands like Chubbies, Death Wish Coffee, the LA Lakers, and Madsen bikes. Lastly, they have a growing list of ""personality"" brands such as Daymond John, Kylie Cosmetics, and Third Eye Blind.Shopify as a Long-Term InvestmentI believe that Shopify is the perfect play for investors willing to buy and hold for the long term. The company is an industry leader positioned to capture the growing online retail business. As the company continues to innovate its software, grow its user base, and establish more strategic partnerships, we will witness the stock price appreciation that investors dream about.What I hope to prove in my analysis to follow is that the price you are paying for the stock today is fair based on the trajectory Shopify is folllowing. Even with the incredible growth over the last year, this is still a chance to get in on the ground floor.Given the run-up the stock price has experienced, there is a chance that we will see a slight pullback as some early investors take profits. We may also see some temporary consolidation in the $65-75 range as the Shopify growth story unfolds.Regardless, I am recommending a buy at the current price of $72.88 for those willing to invest long term. After the earnings report next week, this may be the last chance to buy at this price. If earnings come in at or below analyst expectations, then investors may see a pullback opportunity.The Growth StoryShopify has had one of the biggest growth stories on the market since its IPO nearly 2 years ago. Over the past year its stock price has grown 132% from $31.47 to $72.88 at the time I write this. They have done this through continuous product innovation, establishment of strategic partnerships, and development of new channels for their exploding number of users to sell in.In 2016 alone, a net of 133,000 new merchants began selling on Shopify. In this same time frame, the average revenue per user grew from $1,077 in 2015 to $1,243 in 2016.Source:s2.q4cdn.com/024715446/files/doc_present... for all unattributed slidesRevenues have been on an exponential run since the company was founded. The company has forecasted that 2017 will bring in between $580-600 million in revenue, although I personally believe they will blow this number out of the water.How do they make money?Shopify makes money in two ways. Allow me to break them down as simply as possible.1. Subscriptions Solutions through Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)Each of their 375,000+ merchants pay a monthly subscription fee ranging from $25 to $299 to use the software. The more successful the merchant's businesses are, the more their product needs will grow, thus advancing them up the tier to more expensive pricing options.Each tier comes with a different set of user benefits and perks. In 2016, Shopify brought in $188.6 million in revenue from their Subscription Solutions (+68% YOY), with an average of $18.5 million in Q4 Monthly Recurring Revenue (+63% YOY).This stout MRR growth can be attributed to the strong growth in the numbers of merchants at higher subscription levels. I share my take below on the possible catalysts that could drive this growth even further through 2017 and beyond. Hint: It has to do with the change in pricing for Shopify Plus users mentioned in the Q4 2016 Earnings Call.2. Merchant Solutions through Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)The second way Shopify generates revenue is through their ""Merchant Solutions"".One of the major benefits of the software is the ability to accept payments through an individual or business's online store rather than having to set up a separate relationship or software to process payments. When a customer utilizes this function, they are able to have a clear, up to date view of their performance.Here's the process:These fees add up.In 2016 alone, Shopify processed $15.4 billion in payments, known as Gross Merchandise Volume or GMV. The company's GMV has grown by an average of 116% a year since 2012.On the 2016 Q4 Earnings call, Chief Financial Officer, Russ Jones, shared that this fee, known as the ""take rate"" grew to 1.34% of GMV in Q4 2016, up from 1.25% in Q4 of 2015.Last year these fees added up to over $200 million and make up the greater percentage of yearly revenue. As GMV continues to grow at an explosive rate we can expect Shopify's yearly revenues to track along with it. As merchant's GMV increases they will move up in the tiered Subscription plans.Addressing the Valuation""The Valuation is too High!""""The Stock is overpriced!""""The company isn't even profitable!""""What if the market crashes?""These are the concerns I have seen repeatedly stated by those who are on the bear side of the fence. Seeking Alpha author Giltedge outlines some of these concerns in his article, ""Shopify Is Overvalued-Take Profits"". To his credit, he makes some great points and investors who are up 200-300% might do well to trim their positions.However the basis of his argument is that Shopify's revenue growth will slow to 50%. In their last earnings report they forecasted revenues of $580-600 million, which would only represent YOY revenue growth of 54%. I believe they are being honest in their predictions, but will continue to beat even their own estimates.In Q4 they reported full year revenue of $389 million, which was 90% revenue growth over 2015. Their initial projection of $325 million was only 58% over the previous year's revenue. The valuation Giltedge lays out is fair, but I believe it neglects the likely possibility that Shopify will continue to generate far more revenue than they are forecasting.The question you have to answer for yourself is, ""Where will this company be in 5 years? 10 years?""I believe their price per share will continue to remain overvalued based on standard metrics, but you aren't buying this stock for the value today, but for the value it will be as it continues to grow and dominate the industry. When I factor in the growth potential of the company, I believe the present valuation is fair and that the stock price will continue to soar, although it may temporarily experience consolidation within the $65-$75 range.For patient investors with a longer-term, 3-5 year time horizon, the upside could be lucrative.Potential Catalysts for Continued Growth1. Global Trends in RetailThere's no question that the retail industry has been undergoing a seismic shift from brick and mortar stores to online. Retailers that failed to develop their e-commerce business early enough have seen massive declines in sales and revenues.Source: https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/trend/2017-retail-trendsOnline sales growth over the last three years has demolished the growth rate of total retail, and that gap is only widening. Retail overall is not dying, however the industry is shifting to online. Macys (NYSE:M) is closing over 100 stores this year and plans to invest the $250+ million cost savings into its digital business.The US Government Census reports some slightly different numbers than PWC, but they are even more favorable to the case for this industry transition.According to the report,As online retail continues to explode, Shopify is sure to be at the center of that growth with over 375,000 merchants selling around the world. And they are just getting started.Source: https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/12/7-fascinating-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about.aspxShopify recognizes the massive opportunity before them and they are taking steps to seize it. In 2016 the company added over 1000 employees, bringing its total to 1900 and they plan to do the same in 2017.CFO, Russ Jones stated on the last earnings call, ""We are entering 2017 with twice as many employees, thousands of additional partners and tens of thousands of new merchants, a stronger leadership position and a market opportunity that is even greater than it was a year ago.""2. Shopify Plus Pricing ChangeWhen Shopify launched their software, their target clients were the small-medium sized business and that remains the case today. However, I think over the next year we will see some bigger names in retail adopt Shopify as a way to simplify their sales across all of their channels and to eliminate their costs in maintaining back offices full of in-house developers.Shopify Plus is the company's most premium subscription tier. At the end of 2016 the company announced changes to their Shopify Plus pricing structure. Beginning February 1st, 2017 all new Shopify accounts will be under the new plan, and all existing users will have 6 months from then to upgrade or cancel their account. The letter sent to all existing customers can be found here and is worth the read.The new pricing structure will start at $2000 a month and will be capped at $40,000 per month. Below is a screenshot of Loren Padelford's, VP & GM of Shopify Plus, explaining the pricing change.Source: epatr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Lor...The company added 1500 users to the Plus program in 2016 and as they continue to attract new users, investors will see this pricing change drive the current MRR of $18.5 million significantly higher. These revenues will start to have a major impact on Q3 and Q4 2017 earnings.Earnings PredictionNext week, Shopify will report their earnings for 2017 Q1. The company has forecasted revenues of $120-122 million and the analysts' consensus is safely in that range at $121.57 million.My prediction is that Shopify will post its 6th straight earnings beat and will report revenues of $129.5 million.Since the IPO, Shopify has increased their guidance for the full year 5% each quarter. Based on this trend, my prediction is that on next week's earning call, they will increase their full year 2017 revenue guidance from $580-600 million to $620 million.Recommendation ReiteratedI believe that Shopify is poised to break out to further stock price highs as the market recognizes the growth potential of the company. With the catalysts accounted for, along with my expectation of another earnings beat, I am recommending a buy at the current price of $72.88. After the earnings report next week, this may be the last chance to buy at this price.Author NoteSeeking Alpha has had an enormous impact on my investing success over the last six years.

4062262,103020,2017-04-13T12:07:00-04:00,"Shopify is substantially overpriced at a PPS of +/- $70.Current valuation only makes sense around 2020 assuming a CAGR of 50% in annual revenues.Investors should take profits now and await a meaningful pullback in PPS before reinvesting.If Shopify can maintain a CAGR of 50%, a hockey stick rise in PPS may occur from 2023.","Here's Why Shopify is Currently OverpricedBy every available metric, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is currently overpriced, even compared to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) (a popular comparison choice) which itself is very expensive. According to Morningstar, Price/Sales is almost 3 times the industry average, and over 4 times Amazon's; Price/Cash Flow is a staggering 34 times the industry average and over 15 times Amazon's. According to our calculations, the forward P/Es are 196 in 2017 and 131 in 2018 compared to 97 for Amazon.Let's delve in more detail into the present and projected metrics:Present MetricsShopify is not presently making a profit, and is ploughing earnings back into building up the merchant base and improving the overall platform. However, it has hinted that it may turn a profit in the 4th quarter of 2017. So there is no P/E metric.Here are the valuation metrics from Morningstar based on the current share price of +/- $69.Source: MorningstarBy comparison here are the equivalent metrics for Amazon, to which Shopify is constantly compared:Source: MorningstarBased on these metrics, the SHOP Price/Sales ratio is 4.6x AMZN's and the Price/Cash Flow is 15.6x AMZN's. And it could be argued that AMZN is beyond expensive. In fact, at its current P/E, you would need to live until 2200 before you get your money back from net earnings.Based on this simple yet quick analysis, one can conclude that SHOP is drastically overpriced at the current share price and 2016 results, unless very substantial forward years' earnings materialize to justify the valuation gap.Let's quickly try to see how these might play out…Projected MetricsYou can see Shopify's latest Quarterly and Full year 2016 Financial results here.Projected growth rates in gross revenues, cost of revenue and operating expense are, of course, open to any interpretation; but as a starting point, we can consider the most recent growth rates of 2016 over 2015 as well as 2017 guidance for revenue and look at the relative percentages of revenue for cost of revenue and operating expenses over a 5-year period to make reasonable assumptions…... Revenue GrowthWhile Morningstar shows the revenue growth YOY 2016/2015 was 90%, the guidance given for 2017 is $600 million which represents a substantial slowing in revenue growth rate to 54%. We have assumed a growth rate factor of 50% compounded annually to project revenues as the growth rate may further slacken as revenues ratchet up. In some respects, Shopify has set itself up as a hard act to follow. The staunchest of Shopify bulls should be happy with that assumption which works out to a 10-fold increase in sales revenue over 7 years from a base of 4-5 million merchants.… Cost of RevenuesAs regards cost of revenues, here is the 5-year track record of cost of revenues as a percentage of gross revenue, which have been derived using the Morningstar data referenced above:2012 2013 2014 2015 201620 27 41 45 46A 45% cost of revenue was used for the 7-year projection. These costs will likely directly follow revenue growth so one should be comfortable with that assumption. We feel it is more prudent to use the last 2 years' results which reflect better the traction the business is generating as well as the resulting cost of revenues.… Operating ExpensesAs regards operating expenses, here is the 5-year track record of operating expenses as a percentage of gross revenue which again have been derived using the Morningstar data referenced above:percentage of gross revenue:2012 2013 2014 2015 201684 83 80 65 63Again, using the last 2 years' data as a measure of operating expenses, let's give Shopify the benefit of the doubt and assume a factor of 50% assuming it can get this down by 10% or more…… P/E ProjectionsPutting these into a basic spreadsheet, one can start to try to predict P/Es (that good old fashioned reliable indicator of overall value) over the next 7 years:(No account is taken of any growth in the share float either through the need to raise new financing or the use of share-based compensation. The share float increased from 62 million to 84 million 2015/2016, a whopping increase of 36%. Increases in share count will, of course, reduce net profit/share over the period.)As a yardstick, we could use Salesforce forward P/E ratio of 65 at the time of writing and even that is high. That would mean the current share price of +/- $70 would only make sense if one bakes in at least 4 years of growth at a CAGR of 50%. Of course, the situation would be radically different, if the compounded revenue growth is greater than 50%, or if the cost of revenues and operating expenses pan out better than the projection. But that's anybody's guess (it may happen but probably won't) and the numbers above are based on the data to hand.Outlook for Shopify PPSAs background, Shopify can do no wrong it seems. Cloud-based, merchant-centric, payment-friendly, shipping-friendly, mobile-friendly, partner-friendly, app-friendly, integration with Amazon, Facebook Messenger, and Apple Pay, easy to install and use and affordable, what merchant seeking to sell online wouldn't opt for its services and then having done so the platform is as sticky as melted toffee?Shopify has posted very impressive YOY growth figures. Investors have climbed into the shares, which allied with the small share float (84 million shares) have driven the stock price very quickly up to $70 and beyond.There is no question Shopify is taking the small to mid-size e-commerce market by storm and already there is some spill-over into the large corporates (through Shopify Plus) who are maybe getting restless with maintaining expensive IT back offices to support their web presence. It's like a multi-faceted diamond that sparkles on every side no matter how you turn it.Shopify is being constantly pumped on paid subscription newsletters as being the next Amazon offering huge potential gains to early investors.Yet, what tends to be overlooked in these promotions is that you had to be an extremely patient AMZN investor, holding for a long period of a decade or more to enjoy the eventual meteoric rise of the stock price and surely many an AMZN investor didn't have the patience to stay the course…Amazon Share Price (Source: Morningstar)However, if one has the patience, as can be seen from the spreadsheet above, if the same ratios are maintained or improved past 2021, there is every possibility of a hockey stick or exponential rise in net profits and PPS a la Amazon.ConclusionWhilst Shopify appears to have a bright and exciting future, it is presently substantially overpriced, based on prudent assumptions derived from the past 2 years' financial results and investors would be wise to bank profits. This is probably not a good short idea right now due to the unbridled enthusiasm in the market for the stock. Investors should be patient for a better entry point as well as waiting to see whether Shopify can maintain such a high CAGR and to maintain or improve the assumed operating ratios projected above."
4056076,20256,2017-03-17T07:45:53-04:00,"Trading and investing often use different methods and time frames.Despite this, strong trading picks may reflect aspects of the fundamental picture that are not obvious from measures like PE multiples.Guest expert and legendary deep value investor Robert Marcin joins the group this week.The group adds some new ideas and reviews a past pick.","Investors who use valuation do it in an absolute sense - the way we do in our Great Stocks program. But what about traders? When the market sets a price that is much different, it reflects broad-based opinion that the typical valuation method is not accurate. Our models sometimes pick that up. Our trading model picks are based upon technical factors, but these often reflect valuation versus the past or versus other stocks/sectors.Our guest expert this week is Robert Marcin, the founder and general partner of Defiance Asset Management. Formerly, Marcin was a partner at Miller, Anderson & Sherrerd and a managing director at Morgan Stanley, where he managed the MAS Value fund (currently Morgan Stanley Institutional Value). We invite our readers to follow him on Scutify.This Week - Oscar Eats OutThis week’s picks are especially interesting from a value perspective. Our technical models often sense a change in valuation – which they find attractive. Robert has a different take.OscarOscar: This week, I like the restaurants sector. We’ll use Bloomin’ Brands (BLMN) as an example:Price has been highly variable, though its current price matches up almost exactly with its 200-day moving average. That’s part of the reason why I would move to make this part of a restaurants sector holding for the next month. I predict modest gains, likely near the $20 level.Robert: Bloomin' Brands is an inexpensive stock, but with little fundamental catalyst to drive shares higher unless it’s simply broad restaurant exposure one is looking for.Oscar: I am shooting for the broad exposure, but I like the price here too.Robert: The stock is cheap at 12.5x earnings and 7x EV/EBITDA, but with little growth in revenues or earnings forecasted, there’s not a lot of conceptual appeal here for a sustained move higher.Oscar: How about my $20 target? What are my risks here?Robert: The stock is still down a bunch and can bounce back toward the old highs of the mid-$20s, but a holding company for Outback, Carabbas, Bonefish and Flemings doesn’t sizzle like the latter’s steaks. Risk here includes high debt and restaurant industry overcapacity, which seems to have hit the entire category with price discounting.Oscar: Ouch. The stock may not sizzle, but that was quite a burn.FelixFelix:I’m comfortable with my current holdings, so I’d like to look back at my first pick of the year. On 1/5/17, I got into Shopify (SHOP) around the $50 range. Since then, the returns have far exceeded expectations. Let’s take a look:We’re currently sitting around $64.84 after only two short months. The 50-day moving average, of course, has spiked accordingly. While I generally try to hold positions for months (if not years), I might reevaluate here in light of recent gains.Robert: This is the pure play growth company in the group, with its business model of cloud-based multi-channel commerce platform services still expanding rapidly. Some 400,000 small and mid-sized businesses/startups who want access to e-commerce and retail get their services for modest monthly fees and sell sell sell to the world on most major internet platforms.Felix: Sounds like a glowing review! Jeff is usually a bit tougher on us.Robert: Well, now that you mention it… revenue growth has been 100% per annum but is now slowing down to 50% as the company hit $400ish mm in sales last year and are projected to hit $600 mm this. The stock is expensive at 10x sales with the company at breakeven levels as it spends/invests to grow.Felix: Expensive? I’ve been sensing a lot of growth in this sector. Don’t you think this one has a little room to run?Robert: As a pure play, beat and raise growth company, the stock clearly has the hearts and minds of growth and momentum investors. If one is bullish on stocks, there’s no reason this standout should stop here if their growth continues at such a torrid pace. Primary risk here is very high valuation.HolmesHolmes: After searching more than 700 stocks for the last 5 trading days… I have not found a single stock that fits in my risk/reward schema. So, this week I’m sitting on the sidelines hoping some of my previous picks will carry the load.I don’t attach any meaning to not finding a name this week. But I do think this might be a hint for me to head out for a long overdue vacation.J: I thought you just came back from vacation.H: And I thought you were off this week.AthenaAthena: My momentum play this week is Citigroup (C). Here’s the chart:As usual, I’m buying after a recent pop, with hopes of another spike over the next couple of weeks. February was a good month, and the 200-day moving average suggests a continued rate of steady growth.Robert: Citi is my favorite of the bunch. It's a cheap stock 10x EPS and .9x book value) with improving fundamentals and a chart that seems ready to break out. The bank has a wonderful, global franchise as well as strong domestic businesses also, yet has been under-earning versus peers, so there’s profit margin expansion potential here.Athena: Well alright! Anything I’m not seeing here?Robert: This company should benefit from Trump Administration regulatory reforms and the Fed’s rate hiking process as well. Also, legal expense seems to have peaked and should decline, adding more to bottom line. It’s at the high end of a range, but I would expect it to break above $60 convincingly and run from here.Athena: What kind of risks might I have here?Robert: Risks include a low dividend yield versus peers and negative impact from trade wars/restrictions as it's the most internationally exposed.Athena: I can deal with that – for two weeks.Background on the Stock ExchangeEach week Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends. Since they are all traders they love to discuss their best current ideas before the game starts. They like to call this their “Stock Exchange.” (Check it out for more background). Their methods are excellent, as you know if you have been following the series. Since the time frames and risk profiles differ, so do the stock ideas. You get to be a fly on the wall from my report. I am the only human present, and the only one using any fundamental analysis.The result? Several expert ideas each week from traders, and a brief comment on the fundamentals from the human investor. The models are named to make it easy to remember their trading personalities. Each week features a different expert or stock.QuestionsIf you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector, even those we did not mention, just ask! Put questions in the comments. Address them to a specific expert if you wish. Each has a specialty. Who is your favorite? (You can choose Robert, although our feelings will not be hurt very much if you prefer one of the models).ConclusionFinding value stocks is difficult work. By definition, you’re looking at positions that are currently unloved. It can take time before the market catches up with the potential you see in the stock. The key question is whether you can afford to ride it out until the market agrees with your assessment.It often seems that short-term traders are ignoring a stock’s fundamentals. This week’s examples illustrate that value is sometimes reflected in the charts."
4062331,102888,2017-04-13T15:08:26-04:00,"Shopify is up 3% today as rumors circulate that the company is being eyed as a potential takeover target.Whether or not the rumors materialize into anything tangible, if nothing else, they highlight Shopify's appeal.Win-Win for SHOP Investors - If Acquisition Materializes, it would have to be at a nice premium, and if not, shares have gained on the news.","Earlier today, I got a breaking news email alert regarding Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) from Seeking Alpha entitled ""Shopify jumps on loose takeover chatter."" Indeed, shares of the Canadian company are up over 3% today. Interestingly, the alert clarified that there was no concrete reporting on the matter yet but one can obviously discern that rumors are out there making the rounds.This type of speculation is unsurprising, as the high-flying e-commerce stock has been firing on all cylinders and would offer a very attractive growth vehicle to many types of entities. This is just speculation on my part but based on the news Shopify could be an appealing target for companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (Shopify has recently worked with Amazon and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to integrate its merchants with Amazon Marketplace and Facebook Messenger, so the channels of communication are certainly open); which is sometimes used as a comparison for Shopify, perhaps one of the many larger software-as-a-service companies, or perhaps even a legacy tech company with slowing growth looking to goose its long-term growth numbers and generate some excitement amongst its own shareholder base. Adding to its palatability as a takeover target, with a market cap of roughly $6.4 billion, Shopify is still small enough that a large cap tech company could acquire it without too much of a hassle.While this news is obviously fascinating and a cause for excitement for Shopify's investors, it is important for long-term shareholders to remember that whether any type of acquisition comes into fruition or not, the long-term outlook for the stock is still bright and Shopify is still a high-quality growth story on its own merit, regardless of takeover chatter. Any investment in a company should at least first be based on the quality of the business and the fundamentals and valuation of the company itself as opposed to the possibility of a possible acquisition, and regardless of whether any M&A activity happens or not, Shopify stands on its own feet in this regard as well, so an acquisition would be more like 'icing on the cake' as opposed to a necessary catalyst for investors to wait on for gains.Taking a step back and looking at this from further out, I don't view a takeover being particularly likely at this time, as Shopify's management team seems to strongly believe in the company's long-term future and we are just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of e-commerce and Shopify's Total Addressable Market. In many ways, shareholders could even be better off with the company turning down an offer, as it will be a strong signal to the market that management believes the company to be worth significantly more than the offer valuation. In my opinion, this type of chatter is a win-win for Shopify shareholders, because if there were to be some type of takeover, I would imagine it would be at an outsized premium, and if not, which I see as the more likely outcome for now, it still gives a boost to the share price and gets the company's name out there in front of more investors who may reevaluate it in a new context.From my conversations both in person and here on this website with the savvy investors and readers of the Seeking Alpha community who follow Shopify, I get the impression that much of SHOP's shareholder base is in it for the long term, so I don't foresee the stock selling off much if and when the takeover rumors fizzle out or fail to materialize. On the off chance that shares of Shopify did go down a bit afterwards, I would just use it as an opportunity to add to my position and I think many others would do the same. With Shopify already up 66% just this year, on top of a spectacular 2016, there has not been much of a chance to take advantage of the shares 'taking a breather' to add to my position in quite some time. The company will release its first-quarter financial earnings results on May 2nd, so that will give us some concrete data as well as some new color to monitor the company's progress with.Note: For my previous thoughts on Shopify, see my previous article, Shopify - Just the Tip of the Iceberg from March 6th; shares are up roughly 18% over that timeframe.*Disclaimer - these are my own thoughts and opinions on the tickers mentioned and I would encourage all readers and investors to do their own due diligence on the companies mentioned before investing."

4052657,21815,2017-03-07T10:36:18-05:00,"Cloud platforms open the possibility for significant economies of scale, scope and network effects.When these forces are strong, a virtuous cycle can ensue in which the company's position becomes difficult to dislodge.We are comparing two such companies for their potential on these dimensions.","The cloud is a fast growing part of the economy, and it's not hard to see why as it offers numerous advantages. It's global, continuously scalable, offers the opportunity to outsource part, or even most of company ICT staff and resources, offer new business models for software (SaaS, etc.).One of these new business models is the cloud platform where companies build and partner around their core product in order to create economies of scale, scope and network effects, achieving something of a virtuous cycle.Cloud platforms often command premium valuations and it's not hard to see why:Here we look at one could platform company, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and see how it compares to another, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), on these dimensions.Workday Workday is a leading provider of human capital management ('HCM') software platform. It's main competitors are Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which acquired PeopleSoft and NetSuite, and SAP. They recently landed big customers in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).Workday offers recurring revenues, these make up the vast majority of its revenues, in Q4:With clients such as Amazon, Wal-Mart, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and BP (NYSE:BP) as customers, there is no doubt that the business model has a global reach.But while Workday offers what is the leading HCM platform, they have not yet reached a position which benefits from economies of scale, scope, or network effects.Growth is decelerating a bit, although the picture is muddied because the full year guidance on revenue growth (27%-29%) is considerably higher than that of cash flow (20%). The latter should be taken as a proxy to bookings growth, data which the company no longer provides due to the early adoption of the ASC606 accounting standard.While sales and marketing have enjoyed a declining percentage of sales, they have moved up in the recent quarter:And research and development is on a continuous increasing path as a percentage of revenueProduct development reached a whopping 45% of revenues in Q3, only to sink a little bit to 44% of revenues in Q4 2017. And there are other worrying trends, like EBITDA and net income:Bulls will likely point out that the company sits on a net cash position of $1.5B and generated $228M in free cash flow in fiscal 2017. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less certain capital expenditures other than owned real estate projects.Operating cash flow was $349M and this is set to grow to $420M in fiscal year 2018, a 20% growth rate.However, that sounds better than it is, as it doesn't cover stuff like share based compensation, which is, well, rather huge and growing, from $69M or 21% of revenues in Q4 2016 to $106M or 24$ of revenues in Q4 2017 to a predicted 26-27% of revenues in fiscal 2018. No scale here either.With (slightly) less fast growth in revenues to what could be a slowdown in the overall market (according to SA contributor Bert Hochfeld) and several metrics like stock based compensation and R&D actually increasing as a percentage of sales, we're a long way off from economies of scale.Indeed, the operating loss is still a whopping 24.7% of revenue in Q4 fiscal 2017, although that was somewhat less than the 27.8% of revenue in the previous quarter. But still, the trend is up, last year it was 22.9% of revenue.They will also be hiring up to 1500 new people, or 29%. No economies of scale here either, at least not yet.What about economies of scope? Well, the company does offer other applications like financial management, payroll and analytics, so with some imagination one could argue it's a full blown enterprise software package.There are hints of an ecosystem in the professional services (from the latest 10Q):But this too requires a lot of investment (from the Q4CC):Professional Services also are expected to grow at half the rate of subscriptions (15% versus 30-32%), and carry much lower margins.Perhaps it's just us, but we see only the faintest of platforms here. We think the conclusion is justified that Workday hasn't yet achieved economies of scale or scope, let alone having developed a platform for third party applications creating something of a virtuous cycle.That doesn't mean that Workday isn't the leading HCM software Package, it just means there isn't much of a platform effect. Not in scale, scope, or network effects. We also don't see any of that developing in a material sense anytime soon. Some of the required metrics are actually getting worse, not better.In the light of that, the stock commands a rather premium valuation. Let's compare it briefly with a company which we think is further along the platform evolution path, Shopify.ShopifyWe wrote extensively about this company recently (here), so for readers interested in other aspects of this very well run company we refer to that article. Here we just look at the platform economics.Shopify already enjoys considerable economies of scale. While it is still heavily investing in improving its platform, and also engages in heavy spending on sales and marketing (given the competitive nature of its industry), both product development and S&M are declining compared to revenues:The leverage has tapered off though, that's undeniable. But the company is generating more of a platform, in multiple ways:Now, it is likely that cloud ecommerce intrinsically offers more platform opportunities compared to cloud human capital management, but the difference is still notable. With its continuous additions (applications, third-party solutions, partners, sales channels, etc.) Shopify is solidifying its lead and opening a virtuous cycle, while we see little of that happening at Workday.Last but not least, Shopify is also growing much faster than Workday, with revenue growth of 90% in fiscal 2016 for Shopify whilst ""only"" 35% for Workday.Going forward, the growth gap seems to get smaller. Shopify has guided for 50% growth this year whilst Workday has guided for 27-29% revenue growth. But cash flow growth is guided at 20% and this is supposed to be the proxy for bookings.ValuationShopify is already enjoying some economies of scale and scope and seems closer to reaping platform economies, compared to Workday. It is also growing much faster and closer to profitability, as losses are decreasing.Shopify commands serious valuation premiums though, it's trading at over 13 times sales and book value. But Workday isn't all that far off, it trades at over 10 times sales but almost 15 times book value.ConclusionWhile both Shopify as well as Workday are leaders in their category, we think Shopify trumps Workday on a number of metrics and should command a considerable valuation premium which isn't really there at present.We think that for the near future, Shopify is likely to perform considerably better, but keep in mind that neither of these shares is anywhere near cheap."
4052363,102888,2017-03-06T13:46:23-05:00,"Up 140% over the past year, Shopify still has room to run.Shopify is still under the radar of the average investor.As exposure grows, expect influx of new investors.","One can hardly kick back on the couch and watch CNBC or browse through their favorite financial publication these days for more than a few minutes before they come across discussion of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and rightfully so, as the online retail juggernaut has skyrocketed from under $300 in January 2015 to the lofty price of $849 at the time of this article's publication.Whether it's a roundtable discussion about how Amazon is putting the traditional retail business model of companies like Macy's (NYSE:M) in peril, or a news flash about CEO Jeff Bezos exploring the logistics of delivering packages to the moon, Amazon is everywhere.But for investors who want to capitalize on the undeniable secular growth trend of e-commerce, but who either missed the boat on Amazon or are wary of its nosebleed valuation, is there another road less traveled that they could embark on to get exposure to the e-commerce tidal wave? One that has impressive momentum and an ascendant stock price, but just not as frothy of a gain as Amazon?Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), a Canadian-based provider of cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform designed for small- and medium-sized businesses with a market cap of just $5 billion, could provide just such an avenue for investors looking to get in on this theme. Shopify is up 95% since I began accumulating my position in the company last March. However, despite this recent run, I am not planning on selling any time soon because I believe the stock price still has plenty of room to appreciate.While a 95% gain does indeed sound like a big gain and perhaps time to sell, consider that it's not uncommon for hot names in the tech sector to accumulate even bigger gains, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which has gained approximately 1100% from its lows last January to its recent highs near $15 a share. If Shopify was a company producing cement or petrochemicals, I would most likely sell after a 95% gain, but in the volatile and fast-moving world of tech-investing, 95% just doesn't somehow seem quite as dramatic.However, I am even more bullish on Shopify given that the stock went on this impressive run while receiving very little coverage from the financial media. Other hot tech names over the last several years, whether a home run like Amazon or a stock that eventually flopped like GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), or Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), seem to be hot topics that generate passionate debate on a daily basis on channels like CNBC and in investing publications, and the stocks seem to sustain themselves on this buzz and attention.On the other hand, anecdotally, I have never read, heard, or seen any mention of Shopify in the wide variety of investment media, whether it be in print, online, or on television and radio, that I consume on a daily basis. I've heard a myriad of people fervently discussing the Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) IPO over the past week, even people in front of me in line for lunch, and the stock has soared out of the gate, with many retail investors presumably eager to get in on the name as it is a company they know about and are excited about.With Shopify being so underexposed compared to these more glitzy names, despite the fact that it has outperformed many of them, my thesis is that once the sustained strong performance catches the eyes of people like the hosts on CNBC or the authors of Barron's, the stock will receive a fresh wave of attention, and thus influx of capital, from both retail and institutional investors who will be eager to be a part of the buzz.The company recently announced its full-year financial results for 2016, and boasted of 90% revenue growth and 99% growth in gross merchandise. As an added bonus, just because I started the article by highlighting Shopify as an alternative to Amazon in terms of gaining exposure to e-commerce, that doesn't mean that Shopify's investors can't also benefit from Amazon's rise - according to the company's fourth-quarter results, an important highlight of the fourth quarter was that:Since this integration just took place in December, I suspect that we are just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of benefits and synergies from the move for Shopify. In addition to this promising move with Amazon, Shopify also enables users to sell over other popular platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger and Pinterest.It also recently added the ability to allow merchants to accept payment via Apple Pay. With ongoing collaborations with many of the most prominent names in the online world such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pinterest underway, clearly Shopify is at the forefront of the industry. These big names would not want to work with Shopify if it wasn't a unique and value-additive platform.Investment OutlookThe stock recently hit a 52-week and all-time high of $64.36 after its impressive quarterly results were announced. Since then, the stock has pulled back a bit to $60.29, most likely because some investors wanted to take advantage of the surge and take some profits. However, the pullback of around $4 could offer a nice entry point for new investors who have been waiting on the sidelines and looking for a brief respite from the surging sales prices.If the stock goes below $60 into the high $50s, this would just make for an even more attractive buying opportunity. A gain to $66, just $2 over the previous high, would give even a new investor starting a position today, who missed out on the last year of momentum, a chance to make a 10% return on their investment in the short term.Longer-term, as the partnerships with Amazon, Facebook and the others begin to bear more fruit, and as the platform continues to add more merchants as e-commerce continues its long, steady march higher, combined with the company attaining profitability, my personal price target on where I would begin to think about taking profits and looking for a newer, more verdant opportunity would be somewhere in the $75 to $80 range, about a 25-30% gain from current highs."
4048955,21815,2017-02-23T13:38:55-05:00,"Shopify has grown at near triple-digit rate the past years. This year, growth will slow down, but not by much.The company's focus is on the long-term build-out of its platform; solving problems for its merchants gives it an edge.However, shares are steeply valued already.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), the Canadian e-commerce platform, started off as a retailer for snowboards. It was purposely built because its founder and CEO, Tobi Lütke, couldn't find suitable software for the site, so he built his own.Since then, it has rapidly evolved into a general e-commerce platform, offering a complete set of solutions to merchants. In terms of business strategy, Shopify offers what's known as a ""total solution,"" not just a product or a service. Its revenue consists of two categories:The basic offering already covers everything you need to set up an e-commerce business, but via merchant solutions, additional services can be obtained when needed, like:There is a host of additional stuff, from CRM (customer relationship management) to inventory management and business analytics. Shopify often partners with third-party providers (for instance, it has 70 payment gateways, stuff like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, banks, credit cards, etc.). It also has an app store where a third-party offers in excess of 1,200 apps.GrowthThe strong growth of the company is a sign that its ""total solution"" strategy and relentless merchant focus is working. SHOP has been adding merchants at a relentless clip.In 2013, the company serviced 84,000 merchants. This has grown to over 375,000 merchants at the end of 2016, 2,500 of which are much bigger customers for the Shopify Plus platform.The platform amasses great reviews (see here and here for instance). There is a host of competition (3DCart, Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), Volusion, Woo, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Bigcommerce, etc.). Some of the competition is even free, like WooCommerce, a plug-in for WordPress. But you'll have to pay for stuff (like hosting) that comes bundled with Shopify, so ""free"" is a relative concept.Its much more recent Shopify Plus program is also off to a flying start (from the Q4 CC):Not only is the number of merchants still growing fast, but also the amount they sell, at least the biggest ones, from the Q4 CC:In the third quarter, average revenue per merchant was up 28% per year (per Q3 CC).Management Philosophy and StrategyManagement is clearly focused on the long-term success of the company, which means building a dominant platform and fending off competition. The way to achieve that is to relentlessly focus on solving problems for merchants.The following quote from COO Harley Finkelstein perhaps best sums up its business philosophy (from the Q4 CC):In order to achieve this, it is building partnerships (with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), payments providers, shipping providers, etc.) in order to expand the range of services and sales channels.Another feature of this policy is that the company is willing to forego short-term profitability in order to improve on its longer-term prospects and those of its merchants. This means that the company keeps investing heavily in R&D and marketing and sales.Since there are clearly increasing returns possible (through economies of scale and scope), building the best platform by solving problems for merchants and making the whole experience as frictionless as possible is clearly the right approach.We think that strong financial metrics follow organizational excellence and a well-executed business strategy, not the other way around. So we, just as the market, are not too worried by heavy investment and losses, as long as we see clear signs that the investments are paying off in terms of growth and customer satisfaction. So far, there is little doubt that the latter is happening.But the strategy also works in a narrow sense. Because of economies of scale, there is a slow decline of the necessary investments to improve the platform as a percentage of revenue despite remaining elevated on a dollar basis.Growth DriversPartnersAmazon is perhaps the most notable of partners as it basically ended its own Webstore in order to partner with Shopify (keep in mind this isn't an exclusive partnership). So it's now a lot easier for Shopify merchants to sell on Amazon even if some 40% were already selling here and on other online markets.It's an important plank in Shopify's multi-channel strategy. It's also important to note that it doesn't generate direct revenue, and the sales volume generated on Amazon doesn't count as Shopify volume. It's simply adding an important channel for its merchants, underlying its business philosophy to provide the most useful platform for its customers.Facebook is another important partner, providing the execution part behind many of the Facebook buy buttons you'll come across. It's now also integrated in Facebook Messenger, giving merchants an opportunity to go into dialogue with customers, provide order confirmations and sell directly from the app.Of course, it has a whole host of other partners providing all kinds of services like payments (Apple Pay, PayPal, etc.), fulfilment, analytics, shipping etc.There are also partner programs:Finances2016 figures once again were fantastic (from the company PR):So the company has yet to make profit, although it came close to adjusted operational break-even in Q4 2016, but to some extent that's inflated because of seasonality (and leaving out a whopping amount of stock-based compensation in the order of $15M).2017 GuidanceThe company expects:Concerns and RisksShopify enjoys two broad categories of revenues:Some margin pressure comes from the fact that the lower margin merchant solutions grows considerably faster than the high-margin subscription services (with margins approaching 80%).Merchant solutions provided less than a quarter of revenues in 2013; at the end of last year, it was already almost half of revenues. However, the merchant solutions margins are expected to improve because of the success of higher-margin solutions like shipping and capital, and increasing economies of scale in others like payments.Although it services only 2,500 merchants, the company rakes in much higher subscription fees ($2,000 per month plus a variable part, 0.25% of GMV according to usage for merchants above $10M in GMV).There is of course a competitive risk. There are numerous e-commerce platforms for retailers to choose from. However, we think this risk is fairly muted, given Shopify's position, but it's always possible a big player with deep pockets embarks on a significant effort to leverage its cash and relationships.One could think of a player like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which seems particularly well placed in the universe of competitors. It has promised to create one million jobs in the US by opening up its vast e-commerce platform to more US small businesses.On the other hand, when discussing the integration of Amazon, the company notified that this would open the way for other marketplace integrations, perhaps Alibaba can be one of these.ValuationAnother concern is simply valuation. At the time of writing, the shares are going for $63+, giving the company a market capitalization of $5.65B. That's almost 10 times this year's sales, pretty steep for a company that still makes considerable losses (especially on a GAAP basis).Even EBITDA is still fairly negative (minus $22.72M last year).We also think the shares are due for a breather. At the time of writing, they are really heavily overbought (an RSI of 90, which is fairly rare).The company has been compared to Amazon, and indeed it does share some features, like its long-term vision of prioritizing the platform above shorter-term profitability. On the other hand, the company doesn't have a fast-growing profitable segment like Amazon Web Services, and it isn't nearly as dominant as AMZN in e-commerce, needless to say.We think the shares are a buy, but we would wait for them to cool off a little."

REALLY??? 9 consonants and only 3 vowels. This specialty biopharmaceutical has fallen hard, but I'm sensing some ""green shoots.""The current low price represents a multiple bottom hit a couple of times over the last year before rallying. I don't see a lot of upside in this unless the stock can break the most recent high of about 82. However, what I like about this is that I can run a tight stop loss, with maybe $2 of downside risk vs. $10-15 of upside profit.J: Did you read the recent NYT article about the company? They are a possible new target in the overpriced drug crusade.H: You know that I don't read.J: How did you know about the consonants and vowels?H: I watch Vanna every night.J: Does the drug pricing issue bother you?H: News often creates dips. I figure out which are worth buying.J: Last week you highlighted Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). That is off to a good start.H: I still hold it, but with a trailing stop to maintain my profits.AthenaCypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) caught my eye this week. This one was in a nosedive through the month of October, but has bounced back considerably through the end of the year. Based on the shape of the 200-day moving average, I conclude that we haven't hit the peak just yet. As usual, I would expect to hold this one only for a short time - maybe 2-4 weeks.J: For once, you have picked a stock where I can almost agree. The valuation is reasonable and the dividend of 3.8% is good. The FAST graph shows the excellent earnings growth and the underlying value.A: Each week I explain that your earnings and ratios are not good indicators.J: Have you ever heard of Warren Buffett?A: There are many ways to make money in stocks. His favorite holding period is forever. I lose interest after a few weeks.J: Are you concerned about the role of chip stocks in modern devices? The Internet of Things?A: What I need to know is clear from the stock price and volume - and also my methods for filtering out the noise. You cannot gain my wisdom if you spend your time listening to fools.FelixI will begin with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list.My list provides rankings within each zone, as well as the basics about buy, hold, and sell. The list includes the top overall vote-getters from our (free) subscription list as well as some new requests I got during the week.J: I see that the number of stocks keeps changing.F: The list is quite dynamic. Some of those included did not get a rating last week. I encourage my fans to submit requests.J: Is that because of your incentive bonus?F: My principal motivation is to help.J: Maybe we'll get some good suggestions about what to include. What is your featured stock for this week?F: I see promising long-term potential from Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). I don't deny there have been ups and downs; however, the stock has been able to sustain its significant gains from late summer of 2016. That kind of durability (as seen in the 50-Day Moving Average) is important to me as I look for long-term holdings.J: This is what we call a ""story"" stock - no earnings and no history. You are investing on faith alone.F: As I keep explaining, you are too fussy.J: I am fussier than you?F: Yes - when it comes to stock picking.OscarHere are my ratings for the top reader interests. There are still four open slots, so keep the questions coming.J: Interesting. What do you have for us this week?O: Nothing.J: What? Are you spending all of your time watching football? Your fantasy league is over.O: I am trying, but you tell me not to force it when there is nothing new.J: True.O: We often get caught up in the day-to-day when it comes to market moves. Many investors find themselves twisting in the wind without solid methods of their own. It is useful to step back and take a view from the cheap seats.This article from Bloomberg is a great example. Not only are traders trying to predict what Trump will do in office - they're shorting companies they think he might blast on Twitter! In this case, we see over $150 million invested in the iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (NASDAQ:IGF) - presumably anticipating a bipartisan bill to fix up roads and bridges. However, it quickly became clear that IGF was disproportionately composed of utility stocks. Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas writes:J: Good point.O: Over the past few weeks, I've written about airlines, REIT hotels, and diversified media. I'm still comfortable with these picks, and I don't feel any pressure to shoehorn in a new recommendation. I win because I stick with my methods.ConclusionThis week is an interesting implementation of the theory from the last few installments of Stock Exchange. The gang is having no trouble finding ideas, at a time when many others are stymied. That said, Oscar shows the discipline we need in a system. Do not reach for something that does not really fit.There are plenty of trading ideas, and no need to ""stretch"" your system."
4010125,94986,2016-10-04T16:13:17-04:00,Shopify stands to capitalise on long term macro trends.High valuation but very strong growth prospects.Building a strong economic moat through aggressive marketing.,"Entrepreneurs just like investors are risk takers. They sacrifice capital for the promise of future benefits. Nearly everyone has had a dream of starting their own business, of growing and nurturing it. Maybe It could become the next Apple? maybe Nike? Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is unique because it allows investors to capitalise on the value creating process of entrepreneurism. It develops software for online stores, primarily used by aspiring small and middle sized enterprises (SMEs) looking to ecommerce to drive sales.Shopify's Q2 2016 results saw revenue growth of 93% year-on-year. At the end of the 2015 FY the company had a 5YR revenue CAGR of 53.6%. While still unprofitable, net income improved from a loss of $22.31M to a smaller loss of $18.79M in the 2015 FY. Further, the company possess net cash of $167M on its balance sheet and raised a further $287M through an august 2015 share offering. This means Shopify possesses the ability to finance consecutive losses as they aggressively grow revenue and seek to dominate the market for ecommerce providers.Source: markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/f...Shopify has had consecutive losses for the last 5 financial years, a trend which looks set to continue into the 2016 FY. This is because relatively low barriers to entry, perfect information around subscription costs and an undifferentiated end product has created an intensely competitive market for ecommerce facilitators.Source: trends.builtwith.com/shopThis facet underlies the main reason for Spotify's unprofitability. At a current market share of 9%, it is the third largest ecommerce facilitator behind Magento and WooCommerce.The company at the end of the 2015 FY possessed a 53% gross profit margin and generated gross profits of $46M in Q2 2016. However, sales and marketing spend at $29M takes up 63% of Q2 2016 gross profit. This is the major factor in Shopify's unprofitability. Management are taking a long term view with the company as heavy marketing spend should translate to establishing future market dominance, strengthening the size of their economic moat, and creating a competitive environment that stifles competition. Crucially, this creates strong brand equity and consumer trust and could help Shopify become the de facto provider of ecommerce solutions to merchants seeking to sell online.Shopify's trades on a lofty trailing 12-month price to sales ratio of 12.4. Using the 2016 revenue guidance figure of $367M reduces this to 9.56. The company is well placed to rapidly grow revenue into the foreseeable future, and should have expect to realise revenue of $1.20B in the 2020 FY, a CAGR of 34.5% from the current FY. Furthermore, Shopify's Q2 2016 results put monthly recurring revenue (MRR) at $14.4M, up 70% on the previous year's Q2. The number of merchants has also increased from 175,000 to 300,000 over the same period. Gross merchandise value (GMV) for Q2 2016 was $3.40B up 106% compared to Q2 2015.Going forward, the company stands to benefit from the rise of two macro trends: the rise of ecommerce and the entrepreneur. The Kauffman Index of start-up activity puts the number of new businesses launched each month in the US at 550,000, an upward trend attributed to new cultural and economic forces. The spectre of the 2008 financial recession has meant sustained financial difficulty for millions of households and the need to diversify sources of household income, thus more people than ever are choosing to start their own businesses. The relatively low capital requirement of ecommerce has established it as the most viable route.What economic moat does Shopify currently possess? Analysts from CIBC World Markets setup online businesses on Shopify and 7 of its competitors. They established Shopify as the best solution for online businesses. Its strength lies with its extreme ease of use, SEO and customer support. It also dominates the online marketing space with its plethora of blogs and resources. The latter being a vast range of guides, videos and podcasts. I setup an online apparel store on Shopify to test its features and was particularly impressed by the ease of use, especially as I had zero experience in web design.Investors should express caution over buying into an unprofitable company in a highly competitive space, especially as net loss per share of .10 in Q2 2016 was up from .06 in Q2 2015. However, Shopify offers a unique opportunity to invest in the determination of man to succeed in the advent of the internet. By facilitating a means to a prosperous more independent future, Shopify inspires entrepreneurship. Thus, I would recommend its shares as a buy, as it enables portfolio exposure to the rise of global ecommerce. Although, this future potential is reflected in its premium valuation, thus investors would be wise to evaluate the risk and reward against their risk appetite."

My updated target of $55 represents a base case of around 28% upside from present levels.","In early November Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) reported yet another stellar quarter of results with total y/y revenue growth of 89%, primarily driven by a 114% jump in revenue from the company's merchant solutions segment. Of note, the continued adoption of Shopify Capital for merchants looking for seed capital and the new integration of Canada Post with Shopify Shipping continues to drive the merchant solutions segment as merchants gradually look to condense their resources into one e-commerce platform. Further, a beat and raise for the third consecutive quarter this year adds to the already solid credibility that management has built for itself. That said, I am raising my 12-month price target to $55, representing further upside of ~28%.Highlights from the QuarterModel UpdateThe company is now guiding for fourth quarter revenue to come in between $120 - $122 million and also updated full year 2016 guidance to $379 - $381 million. For Q4, I am now modeling for ~$121 million in total revenue, representing y/y and sequential q/q growth of 72% and ~22%, respectively. That said, my FY 2016 total revenue projection is at the midpoint of company's guidance, which would represent ~85% growth from FY 2015.Moving on to 2017, I expect Q1 to be seasonally softer compared to the rest of the year, yet still am projecting above consensus for Q1 - Q3. Management will provide an outlook for 2017 on the Q4 2016 call. I am projecting FY 2017 revenue to come in around $565 million, representing growth of around 49% from FY 2016. Below, I have charted a comparison between my personal estimates against consensus for the next five quarters.Figure 1: Personal vs. Consensus Revenue Estimates(Source: Bloomberg, personal estimates)Figure 2: Shopify Updated Income Statement Projections(Source: Company filings, personal estimates)Valuation SummaryI am switching over from utilizing the NTM EV/Revenue multiple to a 2017 EV/Revenue multiple for my valuation.

4023256,98236,2016-11-14T15:14:30-05:00,"Shopify reported the results of its Q3 about two weeks ago.Another quarter, another blowout, with revenues rising almost 90%.The company is showing significant expansion outside of the SMB space with its Shopify Plus offering.SHOP is seeing nascent traction with its capital offering and making good progress with its shipping service.The company appears to be continuing to outclass competitors both in terms of functionality and market share growth.","Shopify - An Opportunity for Long-Term Investors to Acquire Shares in the Wake of an Extremely Strong QuarterI guess we have all heard humorous stories about the practice of and the results from re-gifting. Apparently, there are now even rules for the practice. I never seem to have figured in that equation. Most of the gifts I get are usually either books or wine. I have had a couple of bottles of re-gifted wine that I was hard-pressed not to open and pour down the drain. I suppose my displeasure has shown - I don't get re-gifted wine these days. I just tell everyone I enjoy Krug and see what happens.Books are cheap enough that they needn't be re-gifted. Clothes - well the picture you see of me in these articles doesn't show the full extent of my girth - so that is another category I seldom get. I would need two of each article stitched together and that would never work in a re-gifting scenario.When looking at the recent price action of Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) shares in the wake of its recent quarterly report, I wondered if the sellers of the shares might be engaging in a form of re-gifting. Perhaps that is stretching the term a bit - the shares aren't free and their owners have made a great deal of money on their investment - but I think that over time, investors will look back on the current valuation as a bargain, perhaps akin to a re-gift. If the analogy doesn't appeal, perhaps the balance of the article, which focuses on the investment case for this name, will repay the interest of readers.For those unfamiliar with the name, Shopify is a small company, based in Canada, that is rapidly getting larger with a revenue run rate that should reach almost $500 million on an annual basis this current quarter.Shopify has created what many believe to be the leading e-commerce platform there is at the moment and its dominance of the space appears to be growing at an accelerating rate. It has the tools and the platform that let aspiring and established e-commerce merchants build their stores that can operate from anyplace including their phone, social media, in a store or in the trunk of one's car. I took the latter capability from the company's web site. Having never bought anything from the trunk of a car, I am not sure just how pervasive that venue might be for retail commerce.Last week Shopify reported the results of its September ending quarter. I am inclined to believe that as the years come and go, there will never again be a quarter quite so strong relative to expectations or to plan or in just pure growth terms. Without meaning to sound extravagant, it seems to me at this point that the company is on its way to becoming the iconic e-commerce vendor of the next several years. Later in the article, I write about some of its competitors, but I think that some of its comparables are businesses like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), dominant businesses in strong categories. Yes, this is a competitive space, and there are plenty of competitors, but Shopify is doing significantly better than its rivals. And yet here we are more than a week after the earnings were released and the shares are down by 8%.As I will discuss in the balance of this article, there were no spots of any kind on the quarter that Shopify released. The shares might seem expensive to some - the same way the shares of Amazon or Google or Facebook have been expensive to others at different times. Category leaders are always going to seem expensive.About one week ago, in the wake of the impressive quarterly results described in this article, Shopify's shares turned down significantly, and I started to try to trace the source of their weakness. It wasn't some altruistic thirst for knowledge. I own the shares, and while momentum growth stocks do not always follow logical share price progressions, this bit of disappointment seemed particularly egregious.It turned out, or so I was told, that VCs had made a large distribution to their own shareholders and thus the supply/demand equation had been disrupted. The company sold a secondary offering in August and part of that offering included the sale by Bessemer, one of the VC investors, of 2.5 million shares. There had been a round of VC investment in late 2013 led by OMERS Ventures and Insight Ventures and seems likely those investors were distributing shares. The net result has been the same. The company's shares have been stuck within a narrow range now for several months, and even the fantastic quarter just reported hadn't been adequate to move the shares.I wondered to myself if the VCs making the distribution were making a gift of those shares to us who are without the charmed circle of VC investors. Indeed, VCs are not known for their eleemosynary disposition. I drew on the concept of re-gifting as perhaps an explanation. Not really - just my sense of humor looking for an outlet. Usually VCs distribute shares to their underlying investors who then sell them because of a contractual obligation to do so and that is most likely the case for OMERS, which is the private equity arm of a Canadian pension fund management entity, which needs cash to pay its retirees.There are some readers who don't like to see sales of shares by entities that might be looked upon as insiders. But VCs are more or less obligated to distribute or sell shares of their investments in a fixed time period and that is particularly true if their underlying beneficiaries are retirees.But I think that investors should take advantage of the temporary supply/imbalance of the shares and consider that it is akin to a form of re-gifting. The potential for the company and the share is significant over the coming years, I believe.The Quarter from HeavenOne often hears about something being a particular experience from hell. The late political campaign was described that way and with good reason. So far as the last quarter and Shopify are concerned, the quarter was the quarter from heaven. Everything worked, or so it seemed.Here are a few of the specifics. Revenues increased by just short of 90%, a significant over-attainment compared to prior expectations. That result marked revenue growth consistent with the performance of the first half of the year; the dreaded reversion to the mean in terms of growth has yet to start. The company's gross merchandise volume (GMV) sold on its platform more than doubled. The company raised its full-year guidance for the third time this year.There are a couple of points that need to be noted. Shopify is pivoting to larger merchants. It still concentrates on the SMB segment, but a bit more on ""M"" and less on ""S."" Partially, because of that focus, the growth of the company's account base was ""only"" 8% sequentially. That said, Q3 is a seasonal low point for the formation of new internet stores.SHOP derives revenue from both subscriptions users pay for building and operating their stores and the percentage it obtains from the GMV transacted on its platform. At this point, subscriptions have a higher gross profit percentage than do the revenues derived from transactions. As a result of the pivot, the company is getting a greater percentage of its revenues from transactions than from subscriptions, and this has led to gross profit margins that have declined. Looked at a bit more carefully, the gross profit on each segment of revenues is rising in terms of percentages, partially because of how this company reports revenues from its newer services, but the changing mix is impacting overall gross margin percentages. Overall, GAAP gross margins were 52% of revenues, down from 54% the prior year. Sequentially, gross margins marginally from the prior quarter's 53.3% ratio. I imagine that over time and with increasing scale and as new subscriber ads become a smaller percentage of revenue, the company will achieve typical 75-80% non-GAAP gross margins.The company is accelerating the growth of its research and development spend which rose 93% last quarter on a GAAP basis. That being said, the GAAP research and development expense ratio of 19% is not outlandish in the enterprise IT space for a company of this scale. Much of this growth was probably contract development done by a firm called Boltmade, which is to be the core of future development work on Shopify Plus. This is the second acquisition Shopify has made in which it acquired a stable of developers to enhance the growth of its development capabilities. The acquisition of Boltmade will drive research and development costs sequentially higher in Q4 and the company continues to post job opportunities for its new development center built around that company. Much of the elevated level of research and development spending may also have related to the extension of SHOP's mobile capabilities. Aspiring merchants can now start a store on the SHOP mobile platform. Other key deliverables announced last quarter were the availability of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay on the platform and the further integration of Facebook Messenger. These enhancements are apparently being converted into revenue growth; as long as that continues the level of research and development spending while elevated also seems prudent.The growth of sales and marketing expense at 44% year over year is a sign of the potential profitability of the model. The 33% GAAP spend on sales and marketing is far less burdensome a ratio than other companies with a subscription revenue model. General and administrative costs were elevated last quarter because of the expenses connected with the company's secondary offering. That said, general and administrative costs were a bit less than 10% of revenues.Like most companies, SHOP provides stakeholders with an investor deck but it has not seen fit to provide a target operating model in that presentation. But there is not substantial reason to believe that over time, the company will not be among the more profitable subscription-based software vendors given its current spending ratios and typical trends for other vendors with a similar model.During the quarter, Gail Goodman, a well-known and well-regarded figure in the e-commerce space and a founder of Constant Contact, now a subsidiary of Endurance International (NASDAQ:EIGI), joined the board. Ms. Goodman was able to sell CTCT for $1.1 billion to Endurance, a EV/S multiple of about 3.5X for a company whose growth had decelerated to around 10%. No wonder she is well regarded.A very nice quarter for SHOP and one with both quantitative milestones and qualitative achievements. The shares really are not recognizing the business realities of the quarter.The Strategy And The TacticsShopify has an easy-to-understand, well-defined strategy. It is all about becoming the iconic company with the iconic platform for small and medium e-commerce businesses to consumer stores. As I recently (May 2016) wrote an article that tried to look at the company's market position and competitive strengths and weaknesses, I won't try to reprise that content. There are lots of different surveys that try to analyze the e-commerce market and most of them do not slice and dice the data in a way that is helpful for investors. Gartner, in its e-commerce survey, describes SHOP as a niche player. The fact is that SHOP basically is the iconic company in that niche which might readily be considered an independent category. Other surveys identify companies by the number of their users, and rather value of revenue transacted. This tends to favor companies that offer very limited solutions such as WooCommerce. Perhaps the best study I saw was from a site called Website ToolTester.com. I do not purport to offer anyone advice as to whose software to use in building a store. But this blog would certainly emphasize the advantages that SHOP brings to the market compared to competitors, and the chart showing its competitive scores (mentions) is well worth looking at if one is a potential investor.Overall, in just reading the various review sites, it is hard to escape the conclusions that Shopify is the market leader, that it is taking share from its competitors, that the company has a dominating presence and except for a couple of features most prospective B to C e-commerce sites will get quite a bit more functionality for the same price using SHOP and most users actually know that. A ""store"" based on the SHOP platform is easy to set up, easy to learn and is available on mobile devices with a very broad range of functionality including multilingual support and integration with WordPress. It seems to this author to offer just about everything needed for an affordable price in an easy-to-use package.The most important tactic for SHOP has been and remains its ability to expand its addressable market by offering additional, ancillary functionality on its platform. E-commerce sales in the US in Q2 were $98 billion and grew 4.5% sequentially and 16% year on year. Of that amount, Amazon represented almost $18 billion. Obviously SHOP has to dramatically increase its wallet share from web merchants in order to match expectations.The SMB opportunity is just another piece of the remaining $320 billion in annual e-commerce sales given that almost all traditional retailers have web stores. Many investors think of SHOP as an SMB focused vendor and historically that has been the case. But the fact is that some years ago, SHOP began a pivot so that it is in the enterprise business and it has started to acquire much larger users than has heretofore been the case. Large users include brands such as Nestle and Lady Gaga in addition to many others, and these kinds of stores can generate annual revenues surpassing six figures. While obviously, the runway for SHOP is not infinite, it has become substantially greater than is the popular perception, I believe. Currently, e-commerce sales are growing about 15%/year in the US with the SMB segment growing a bit faster than the total according to analyst reports.With that backdrop, the tactics that Shopify is pursuing seem pretty straightforward: 1) Sell existing customers more services such as ""capital"" and ""shipping;"" 2) Build a large ecosystem that makes it difficult for smaller competitors to match all of the functionality that is being offered on the Shopify platform and 3) Pivot sales efforts to the most scalable platform offerings so that GMV growth significantly exceeds expense growth.The thing about the SMB space is that there are lots of very small customers. How many, I don't have an exact statistic to hand, but market analysts suggest that a company such as WooCommerce has more than 3X the ""users"" when compared to SHOP and yet it doesn't generate all that much revenue. At some point, generating subscriber additions becomes an inefficient way of growing revenue and that point has been almost certainly reached by SHOP. The strategy SHOP is using is to sell existing customers more functionality, and it is focused on a few features at this point. Mobile, which just became available at the end of the September quarter, is part of it. SHOP Shipping is now being used by 20% of SHOP users. It clearly has the potential to be a significant generator of revenue growth for the company and represents a good deal for many SHOP users.At this point SHOP Capital is a minor venture for the company. It certainly has the potential to see the kind of growth that a similar service has enjoyed thus far for Square (NYSE:SQ). The company has secured an agreement with the Export Development Canada that essentially insures the credit that it is extending. At this point, Capital's outstanding advances are just $15 million, which is said to be a sharp increase since the end of Q3. Currently, the revenue streams from both Shipping and Capital are reported on a net basis and therefore increase gross margins. At some point that is likely to change.Will SHOP eventually match the uptake SQ has enjoyed with $1 billion of loan production that Square has achieved? Given both the strength of the SHOP platform and the built-in advantages of advancing money to customers who use the platform to receive payment, the opportunity certainly exists and the specifics of providing credit to a borrower already using the SHOP platform with which to collect money is an enticing and very profitable opportunity. Based on the commentary on the conference call at this point, the company hasn't sought outside investors to fund advances to its borrowers and intends to use some of the proceeds from the recent secondary to fund the advances. If the program really gets going, SHOP like SQ is going to need recruit outside investors to supply capital and simply charge a mark-up on the loans. It is difficult to beat the rates that can be offered by e-commerce providers to third-party capital sources. I do not think that investors totally appreciate the scope of either opportunity and feel it is not embedded in consensus forecasts.SHOP's management apparently recognized the need for a pivot several years ago. The company introduced Shopify Plus about two years ago. While related to the core technology of Shopify, Plus appeals to a different market segment and its growth is likely to have a different trajectory than the company's initial platform. The company has purchased Boltmade, which is basically designed to staff the necessary expansion of developers for the Plus platform and the company has said that Boltmade is going to be a noticeable factor in R&D spend in the quarter as it was, most likely, in Q3.Plus is used by both large and medium size businesses, but also by relatively well-known enterprises. Last quarter, the new Plus customers included a shop called Fretsy, of which I have never heard, but which is apparently a major retail presence, and brands of which I actually have heard such as Penguin Random House, the American Kennel Club, the Game of Thrones Store and T-Mobile.About half of the users of Plus have migrated from the basic Shopify store, but new names are becoming an even faster growing segment. According to one industry consultant, Shopify Plus plans actually cost users about $2,000/month for a typical merchant and can readily cost quite a bit more depending on the features and traffic levels. That is obviously a far different market segment than that served by Shopify's basic platform (Basic Shopify costs as little as $29/month while the standard product costs $79 month. There are features, particularly those provided by partners that raise the average revenue per month paid by a typical Shopify merchant). For a variety of reasons including penetration, the average transaction revenue per user rose 28% in this last quarter compared to the prior year. Most of that increase was a function of successful users of the basic SHOP platform, but the key factor was brands establishing stores and using the Shopify Plus platform.Plus typically competes against Magento Enterprise and BigCommerce Enterprise. I am not going to try to determine whether it is functionally better than its competitors in the space. The particular article which is linked above basically suggests that Plus is equal to or better than the competition. The author stretched to be even-handed, but that is what it was - a stretch. He is clearly in love with what Shopify has created - and why not as he has developed a nice business, apparently, consulting with users to implement Plus.There is no real practical way to identify the market potential for Plus as opposed to core Shopify. Plus users generate much higher monthly recurring revenues, but they also generate several times as much transaction volume per user when compared to core Shopify. I think it is fair to conclude that a significant component of the company's potential growth going forward is going to be a function of how fast it can both migrate existing clients and recruit new clients to the Plus platform. The other material metric to look at will be the success the company has in raising its penetration of Shopify Payments across its entire customer base.As I mentioned, the third tactic for this company is its partner ecosystem. SHOP has a specific partner program for Plus and it has something called an accelerator program that is operating in a few cities where the company has actually leased WeWork office for its partners and developers. SHOP's partners have been able to plug holes in the company's offering such as its integration with WordPress and they have been the backbone of its non-English offerings.Valuation and All ThatShopify is not a company that is unknown or whose light is hid under some bushel basket. It is covered by 20 analysts and its average rating is a buy with a price target 25% greater than the current share price. While the results of the recent quarter led to a greater level of revenue growth forecasts, it really didn't change the earnings estimates materially although there was some movement in consensus earnings estimates. But no investor is buying SHOP's shares because of the estimates that show losses decreasing from $.13/share this year to $.05/share next year. It is possible that the earnings estimates will prove to be conservative - certainly the potential margins that can be made from mobile, Capital and Shipping are not really factored into the forecast because the company doesn't provide a forecast for those particular lines of business.But the company is going to invest heavily in Plus, particularly, but anything else that management thinks is necessary to solidify its market position. For investors looking for a company that will soon generate lots of margins and cash flow, this is not the right investment. The CFO, Russ Jones and the CEO and COO were not bashful in saying that the company is still in heavy investment mode, which is CFO speak for don't expect a profit inflection in the near future.The shares are being bought for the growth the company can achieve and that is why I have spent quite as much space in trying to identify the reasons I believe that it can achieve rapid growth even beyond current expectations. The company has an aspiration of being the next Amazon or Google and has strategy and tactics toward that end. That is why investors buy and own the shares. There is no current way that standard valuation metrics are going to persuade most investors that they need to own these shares.I own them because I like the bet. Others will not be so sanguine.The company is forecasting 73% revenue growth this quarter. It is a bit hard to second guess a quarterly estimate, but this is a company that is based on retail sales, and seasonality is probably stronger than management is willing to forecast. In addition, the company's just introduced mobile capabilities certainly are pregnant with potential. The retail climate in North America seems to be a bit stronger than in the recent past, and in addition the increasing penetration of the company's payment service is driving very high growth in the its GMV.The published consensus forecast for 2017 growth is 47%. I think that the forecast is probably not totally reasonable in that it implies growth deceleration to around 30% by the end of next year. I do not think it is logically consistent to believe that a company with growth slowing at that rate might be a decent investment. But I will look at some metrics using the consensus even if the consensus likely underestimates what seems to me to be the most likely case for results.In the wake of the secondary, the company has about 85 million shares outstanding, which compute to a market capitalization of about $3.4 billion. The company has about $400 million in cash in the wake of the secondary share offering in August. So, the enterprise value is around $3 billion. The EV/S for the current year revenue works out to be about 7.8X, and on the published consensus, revenues expected for 2017, the EV/S works out to be 5.3X, and probably less based on my own expectations. That is a pretty reasonable ratio for a business growing at 50% and dominating its category.The company is generating a marginal amount of CFFO, but all of it and more is coming from stock-based comp, which is not insubstantial at 15% of revenues. I would expect that the company will continue to expend high levels of stock-based comp as it ramps R&D, and on-boards the employees who had worked for Boltmade and staffs its development center in Waterloo, Ontario. Again, for those readers/investors who are focused on stock-based comp., the trends in that area for this company will not be pleasing over the next year.So, at least for the next year, or perhaps longer, investors are going to have to look at EV/S and to look at the company's profit potential rather than expect to see specific mileposts in terms of either reported profitability or cash flow. I am happy to make the trade-off between current profitability and growth and own the shares. I feel financial management and a commitment to maximize long-term returns to shareholders are strong.That being said, I doubt that this company would entertain acquisition offers at this point in its lifecycle. I imagine there are more than a few interested consolidators who would be willing to pay a substantial premium. The commentary of the founder and CEO, Tobi Lutke, just doesn't seem receptive to any but the wildest offer at this point.This is a company out to build an iconic franchise and taking the steps to accomplish that. I think the strategy is right, and the potential returns, when they come, will be substantial. But the words ""when they come"" are for real. I do not expect earnings or cash flow for this company in the near future. Investors will need to determine if they can wait for the return. I think the wait will be well worth."
4039033,98236,2017-01-24T13:27:46-05:00,Shopify is one of the major companies facilitating the transformation of retail from the physical to digital world.The company recently announced a more significant partnership with Amazon where Shopify users can offer their products on Amazon as part of using the Shopify app.It has several underappreciated growth opportunities that seem likely to keep percentage growth at extraordinary levels for the next couple of years.Shopify is in the process of developing a significant ecosystem and other capabilities to provide it with a sustainable competitive moat.The company has a highly profitable business model at scale with high levels of fixed costs and investment and very high incremental margins as growth persists.,"Shopify - I have seen the future, and it worksThe above is a quote from John Reed, a well-known journalist and author of the early 20th Century. His observations turned out to be one of the less fortunate portraits drawn of the Bolshevik Revolution. Mr. Reed was one of the early bohemians, and while he died at age 32, his life was packed with adventure, and many young people are still interested in his life and work. Sadly for Mr. Reed, continuing exposure to the revolution opened his eyes, and he died starting to realize the extent to which communism and its manifestation in Russia had betrayed the citizens of that country.One of the questions I get asked from time to time is, ""Is it time to sell it yet?"" Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has appreciated by 88% since you first wrote about it in May. Can it still be a buy? There is more than a little luck involved in the timing involved in identifying a name, doing some research and publishing an article. Shopify has grown very rapidly over the past eight months, and its valuation hasn't gotten excessive because its growth has been so fast, but of course, I do not expect it will appreciate by 88% in the next eight months.But I never wrote about the company in the context of it being a trade. It was then, and it continues to be, the leading company that creates platforms for merchants who want to develop e-commerce businesses. Initially, the company focused on the smaller merchants. Now it has sold its solutions to some enterprises that offer well-known brands and has relationships with a few larger enterprises. I own the shares, and for me it is a long-term runner and I won't try to figure out the perturbations that are inevitable in a name of this kind.That being said, my expectation is that SHOP will post an upside that is noticeable when it reports quarterly results in a few weeks. I think the opportunity the company has from its mobile launch is underappreciated and will be a factor. I think overall trends in the economy regarding online shopping will drive results. And I'm hopeful to see some enterprise brands choose Shopify Plus as a way forward in their digital transformation process. I'm less positive about the trajectory of the company's expense growth. SHOP still has lots of job postings, which is about the only way anyone can try to guess at expense growth. And lots of its sales teams ought to be receiving some form of bonus or commission acceleration payment. I think it is possible that the company reports breakeven results, but I am looking to see more than 21% sequential growth given the strength apparent in online sales last quarter.One of the better ways to play the retailing revolutionI suppose there would be those who would say that Shopify and its success is very far away from Jack Reed's career, but I do think the title is apposite. Reed talked about the promise of the Russian Revolution to a world that had seen the excesses of the Tsarist Autocracy and its consequences. He got it wrong, but was starting to understand the brutality of communism before his untimely death.Shopify is one of the architects of the retailing future, and its strategy is clearly working. Many readers want to invest in retail - it is, after all, the largest component of our economy, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will ultimately be the largest retailer in the world - yes, it still has some ways to go, but it will almost surely become the world largest retailer sometime in the next several year. But for some it has a valuation that seems hard to justify - although I am a shareholder and believe the company to be run the way I want my investments to be run. But for those looking to invest in retail and play the segment in a derivative way, I think the shares of SHOP are well worth the valuation and the time necessary to get to know the company.I have written about this company several times in the past, but a couple of readers have asked for an update in front of earnings, not yet currently scheduled but likely to be reported in the middle of February. The shares have been strong lately, particularly in the wake of the announcement of the company's renewed and deepened partnership with Amazon. So far, SHOP has maintained such a torrid growth rate that it is actually one of those names that appears to be ""growing into"" its valuation, although last quarter, growth slipped to 89%, down from growth above 90%-plus the prior four quarters.SHOP is covered by 25 analysts - an extraordinary coverage level for a company of its size. While the average rating from these analysts is a buy, pretty much an average rating to post on First Call, the consensus price target is only $51. The issue is very simply that it is almost impossible for a serious person to recommend these shares when using anything like a consensus estimate.The consensus has growth decelerating sharply in the quarter to be reported in February and decelerating more sharply still throughout the course of 2017. Notionally, the company would see its growth rate decline to the low 30%'s range based on the full-year consensus forecast of 48% growth and the first-quarter growth forecast of 61%. Given that declining growth is to come without any material level of profitability, it has proven to be impossible for analysts to recommend these shares based on estimates they feel comfortable projecting.Obviously, SHOP has had a history of beating estimates and its own forecasts substantially, and I imagine it will continue to report numbers that are not really within even hailing distance of the consensus. That is part of what makes investing in companies like these difficult for some investors.My own training simply doesn't allow me to ignore numbers and write that investors should buy the shares because this is ""good"" or a ""leading"" company blessed with loads of sales momentum. In a recent report, I wrote about a tool I had found that is published by CS that relates valuation to growth and to sales efficiency.SHOP spends a lot of money on sales and marketing. It is just now starting to achieve some level of sales efficiency that should improve its rating on the CS forecast tool significantly.Last quarter, the company spent about 33% of its revenues on sales and marketing. But that is a little less than its revenue growth rate, and the trend of the percentage increase for sales and marketing spend is beginning to abate with the sequential quarter increase of just 11%. The sequential sales increase was 15% last quarter, suggesting the company is beginning to see an improvement in the efficiency it is getting from its sales investment.Overall, I think SHOP shares, despite their recent appreciation of 16% since the start of the year, remain ""investible"" primarily because I think the consensus estimates will prove to be unduly conservative. Its 1-year appreciation of 113% probably can't be duplicated in 2017, but as I will try to present, this is a long-term holding that I believe is likely to outperform the market and its comparative index, the IGV, for years to come.Shopify is a well-known name amongst growth investors and perhaps a less well-known name amongst investors that specialize in the retail sector. At the end of the day, however, this is a company whose future is tied to the future of retailing. It is worth trying to understand the components of the growth story and the company's potential but under-recognized positive elements.It's 2017 - What does Shopify do for an encore?So far this year, the big news at this company is that it has solidified and broadened its partnership with Amazon. Specifically, Shopify merchants selling in USD are now able to sell their products on Amazon - a significant benefit for merchants - and that will save them a fair amount of time and effort. The capability was made generally available last month, so it will not materially impact Q4 results, and I would not anticipate that the company will explicitly project incremental volumes it will be able to achieve because of this additional offering.Many Shopify users have already been selling their products on Amazon. The press release said that 40% of Shopify merchants were already selling in an online marketplaces. This newly announced capability just makes it simpler for Shopify customers to sell on Amazon and gives them an additional channel. The share price reaction that ensued upon the announcement had more to do, I think, with a broader recognition of the company's expanding leadership position in its e-commerce space than the specifics of revenues and EPS that are likely to come from the agreement.The shares appreciated quite a bit in the wake of the announcement (more than 10% in a couple of days), although I am a bit concerned that investors are looking for more than they are going to find. It will be difficult to quantify just how many new customers will have chosen Shopify because of the Amazon capability. It is really just another piece of a rather extensive set of offerings.2017 is likely to be a year in which the company's mobile business starts to produce significant revenue traction. Again, quantifying the size of the company's mobile opportunity is reasonably impossible at this point. But I think the record of both Square (NYSE:SQ) and particularly of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are suggestions of what the size of the mobile opportunity can be for any major participant working with merchants to provide them with another channel to sell their products. For the kinds of merchants that are the target market for Shopify's basic offering, mobile is either important, or in some cases, it will be the capability that allows a merchant to pursue his venture. The ability that Shopify merchants have to use Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and presumably other mobile payment offerings is also very likely to produce an accelerated growth of merchants using the capability.It is those kinds of extensions to the company's core offering that have the potential to maintain revenue growth at much greater levels than some forecasters anticipate.Shopify PlusOne of the most important strategies that will enable Shopify to grow at rates significantly in excess of those projected is the success of the Shopify Plus platform. In carefully looking at the company's numbers, it is apparent that for the percentage growth rate it wants to achieve, i.e., far greater than the exit grow rate in the low 30% range at the end of 2017, it will need to move substantially up market.In that regard is the company's monthly recurring revenue (MRR) metric. MRR rose to $16.3 million last quarter, up by 67% compared to the year-earlier period. That produced average monthly subscription revenue of about $50/month, which is up just 2% from a year ago. One of the keys to continuing percentage growth at torrid rates is not to sell more customers per reporting period but to increase the average revenue per customer. And the way to make that happen is to ensure that Shopify Plus starts to become a significant contributor to revenues.Unremarked last quarter was the small acquisition of Boltmade, which is a small, geographically adjacent software development business with 21 employees that has been a contributor to the development of Shopify Plus. Shopify, while certainly not neglecting its core business, will find it difficult to sustain the scorching growth rates it has grown accustomed to doing the same things in the same markets. But there is a huge unserved or underserved market of brands that really does not have a full-blown digital strategy. I think it is apparent at this point in the evolution of the digital marketplace that going it alone is a sub-optimal strategy for almost all enterprises trying to adapt to the new formulas for commerce. They just don't do it well.Shopify Plus is already a significant offering for Shopify, with brands including Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Red Bull and Budweiser using the platform for their e-commerce strategy. Other brands that signed up recently include T-Mobile, Bluemercury and Lady Gaga, as well as Nestle, which plans to create stores of some kind to extend its brand marketing. The link above shows a bunch of stores from sellers that this very non-millennial has never heard of. I take it they are considered to be amongst the coolest of shopping venues for the rising generation.Pricing for Shopify Plus is based on a monthly fee with no additional transaction charges, which is a typical strategy for selling to larger customers who would never pay a commerce or transaction fee. The platform is designed to be totally scalable for merchants and brands, and there are some customers who have half a million unique visitors per day. It is intended as the ultimate outsourcing platform for a wide variety of merchants, and it is what is necessary to take the company to the next level.Shopify Plus has been the vehicle the company has used to develop an ecosystem. I suspect lots of readers have read about ecosystems too often and pass over the phrase with glazed eyes and perhaps a sip of the grape. Ecosystems do a few things for their originators. They generate revenue, of course, they satisfy users and they build a significant competitive moat.As I mentioned, those contemplating investments or holding positions in Shopify have to believe that the company will noticeably exceed the consensus outlook. That is not likely to happen in terms of the number of new merchants using the company's solution. For example, in answering one question during the course of the conference call the company held back in November, the issue was whether it could equal the additions it achieved in Q4 2015. The answer of the CEO was that he expected strong adds during the quarter that will be reported next month, but in fact the cost of recruiting new users at an increasing rate is probably not economical.What is most important is for users to buy more products from Shopify, and the only realistic way that is going to happen is through the partner program, coupled with a higher penetration of users moving to Shopify Payments and Shopify Shipping. It is imperative to see the average monthly spend that the company's customers pay it show accelerating increases. I think the wallet share that Shopify can capture from its Shopify Plus users will be a principal factor in sustaining the company's percentage growth, and that can't happen without a successful ecosystem that can offer users much greater functionality than what is offered by Shopify through its internal development.In order to see revenue growth substantially above the 47% that is in the consensus forecast, I expect that user additions will be more or less stable, that the company will sell more products to its base and that its users will achieve a higher average gross payment volume. And I am counting on seeing Shopify Plus start to show much more significant penetration of larger enterprises, as they perceive there are significant productivity and speed advantages in that platform compared to the results they would be able to achieve on their own.The Path to ProfitabilityThe biggest issue that investors face in considering SHOP shares relates to the company's profitability. It is the basic reason why price targets are so constrained.Without being pedantic and over-simplistic, there are many levers that Shopify has to become a highly profitable business. One of the more significant will be the adoption of Apple Pay by a higher proportion of the company's merchants. Apple Pay carries exceptionally high incremental margins, and most of the incremental revenue will show up in gross margins. In addition, the revenues that SHOP can generate from its partner programs will also come with very high margins.Overall, gross margins have not seen an increase, because a higher proportion of revenues are coming from subscription revenues than from merchant revenues. But over time, there is more margin leverage in merchant solutions than in subscription solutions as the offerings scale, and that should help overall gross margins to increase significantly.I do not expect that there is likely to be any short-term leverage in research and development spending. It showed accelerated growth in Q3 reaching 19% of revenues on a GAAP basis. I am expecting that the ratio will be no better than flat in Q4 despite an expected 21% increase in sequential revenues.On the other hand, I expect the growth in general and administrative expense will start to fall from currently elevated levels. It is running at double year-earlier levels, but the rate of sequential increase slowed sharply in Q3, and I see that happening over coming quarters.The least certain forecast remains the spend on sales and marketing. It isn't that the ratio is so bloated compared to other companies. But it is obviously the highest expense ratio of the company, and margin growth is going to have to rely on leverage of this metric in some significant fashion. As pointed out, Shopify has substantial underpenetrated growth opportunities, and landing merchants at this stage is ultimately a long-term profit opportunity not completely acknowledged. But pursuing larger enterprises and focusing on marketing to that group should have some salutary impact on sales and marketing expense ratios over coming years.While I do believe Shopify will raise its guidance for revenues for 2017 by some noticeable amount, I am less certain the company will forecast much more than nominal profitability for 2017. I am more inclined to believe the impact of the major trends that will enhance profitability will be seen in 2018 and beyond.ValuationShopify is not an unknown investment, and the company's deal with Amazon has further enhanced its reputation and visibility. I wouldn't expect that it would be cheap, and it isn't.The company, in the wake of the secondary offering sold in Q3, has a current market capitalization of $4.2 billion. Cash on the balance sheet was $400 million at the end of Q3, so the enterprise value of the company is $3.8 billion. The consensus sales estimate for 2017 is $562 million, although as I mentioned, I think the number to be exceptionally low. The high estimate for revenues is $609 million. I think a number near $600 million makes better sense in terms of how the growth rate will be realized. At the consensus revenue forecast, the EV/S is 6.8X. At a revenue expectation, I think more realistically, the EV/S ratio is 6.4X.Shopify was cash flow-positive through the first nine months of the year, although the positive cash flow was a result of stock-based comp. The company as it is currently structured doesn't generate any significant level of deferred revenues, and amortization and depreciation is not a major factor in the company's financial statements.Over the long term, cash flow and free cash flow are going to track net income quite closely. When the company becomes profitable in a meaningful fashion, its cash flow will rise. Till then, it will not generate a great deal of CFFO.SHOP has a valuation that places it above the average in terms of its valuation compared to its Unit Economics, i.e., the metric considered by the CS tool. Its valuation is between Workday (NYSE:WDAY) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), although I think if the analysis used a 55% rather than a 45% growth rate, the results would be different.The question of ""what is in the stock"" is not one that I have the ability to readily answer. I expect an upside, I expect better guidance and I imagine so do the vast preponderance of investors and observers who follow the name. The question of how much is enough is again not something that I can readily answer.But I think for investors wanting to invest in the future of retailing and who are looking to make a long-term commitment, SHOP shares still make sense. I think over the next 12 months, they are likely to continue to produce positive alpha."
3999173,98236,2016-08-12T11:57:28-04:00,"Last week, SHOP reported another exceptionally strong quarter with all revenue metrics and some financial metrics beating prior expectations.The company increased growth estimates but expectations for 2017 remain at levels that are likely to be handily beaten.The company is seeing huge growth in GMV but it is also seeing rapid growth from new users and from users contracting for additional services.The company has become more and more entrenched a the category leader in this space and it has been able to outdo its competitors in terms of ease of use.The company's partnership with Amazon, its international opportunities, its opportunities in AI and in the market beyond its SMB space are demand drivers that should contribute upside in the future.","Q: How many world records can Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) set in terms of its growth and customer additions?A: It is hard to neglect the Olympic Games. There are so many records set and so many examples of the successful pursuit of excellence. I remember bits and pieces of different games. The horrible tragedy in Munich in 1972. The games in Los Angeles and the Russian boycott as well the miracle of our hockey team in 1980, the London games of 2012 and the creation of the London Eye. And of course the inspiring story of Jesse Owens and his triumphs in Berlin in 1936. (No, I wasn't there, but there have been more than enough TV dramas relating to the success of Jesse Owens and recently the shame of Avery Brundage.)But there are other ""games"" so to speak and other champions. One such champion is Shopify which recently released its Q2 results. When people talk about champions in a space, Shopify simply has to come to mind as one of the world record holders in the race to enable the SMB retail space for the digital world. And so far, as it goes, its Q2 results are one of the greatest examples of growth for a subscription revenue company that is likely to be seen at any time in the near future. I will review the specifics of the earnings release further into this article, but I think it is fair to say that there were no disappointed stakeholders.The CEO, Tobi Lutke believes that his company will be to retail E-Commerce for SMB as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been for social media, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been for search and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has for E-Commerce. He brings a certain messianic perspective to running this business, not in a bad way, but in the sense of believing that he and his company have the opportunity and the mission to scale tall buildings at a single bound and create a world composed of successful E-Commerce merchants.I often write about Total Available Markets (TAM's) and runways regarding the different companies about which I investigate and of course there are really the size of the market is one of the principle factors in evaluating the probability of success for a company in a nascent market. In this case, I think it is adequate to say that the TAM is enormous and the runway is long.About one year ago, Credit Suisse initiated its coverage of SHOP and suggested that its TAM was $5.3 billion. At that point, most analysts were neutral on the name with an average price target of less than $32. Back then, the company reported it had 162,000 merchants using its software.Fast forward to the results released the other day by SHOP and the company now has more than 300,000 users. At the moment, the North American SMB merchant space is supposed to consist of 10 million users who have retail businesses with fewer than 500 employees. SHOP announced that its customer count had reached 300,000 and the company is clearly the share leader in the space.Those are impressive statistics to be sure, and self-evidently have exceeded prior expectations, but one of the more salient features of this company's business has been its rapid transmogrification in terms of the market that it addresses and the solutions that it sells.But of equal interest and importance, are the avenues the company is pursuing to expand its TAM. I will just mention of few of these initiatives at this point and will return to some of them later depending on their salience to the overall thesis of this article. Of greatest importance is the solution that the company describes as Shopify Plus. Shopify Plus is an e-commerce platform for high volume retailers. It is based on a business model that doesn't include transaction fees. It is likely that over time, the revenue potential of Shopify Plus will be at least as large as the traditional solutions offered by the company.The company nowadays offers it merchants solutions for payments and has just initiated a service offering called Shopify Capital which is a credit facility that allows current Shopify merchants to obtain small loans secured by a certain percentage of future payments through the Shopify payment service.Will this company achieve the coveted status of defining a category? While it doesn't explicitly offer a CRM solution, much of what it does, facilitates the most efficient interaction with customers and prospects and its software certainly tracks customer interactions and opportunities. As the referenced article indicates, Shopify integrates well with the Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) platform to afford users a tool that significantly enhances the CRM process for many of its customers.It also, through partners, facilitates E-Commerce shipping. About one year ago it became the Amazon partner of choice in building web stores that use several Amazon services and it is Amazon's preferred migration partner. The potential impact of that position will probably be best seen in 2017 as the product itself goes into general availability just before the end of the year.Will Shopify wind up with a position in E-Commerce services that rivals category leaders such as FB, Google and Amazon itself. For sure, the SHOP CEO will win the prize for the mnost distinctive headgear in the E-Commerce world. But overall, and regardless of headgear, hoodies or other kinds of unusual clothing, I think the chances favor this company in such an endeavor. Are there are any issues or knowable pitfalls that might be impediments to the growth of this company. I had originally written about this company on the Seeking Alpha site in May. I was optimistic regarding the company's prospects back then and I wanted to see how the thesis was playing out in a very fast moving environment. And so I wanted to do a deeper dive than is generally possible through the interchanges provided by conference calls and press releases in terms of understanding the company and its strategy and positioning. I had the chance to conduct a one on one interview with the company's Director of Investor Relations, Katie Keita yesterday afternoon to discuss the company's recent progress and its future outlook.Q: What do quarterly results from a force of nature actually look like?A: SHOP reported revenue growth of 93% year on year in its most recent quarter. Overall, its Gross Merchandise Value grew by 106%. This was the 4 th quarter in a row in which revenue growth exceeded 90%. A few other salient statistics include the 121% growth in what the company calls its Merchant Solutions which primarily represents the growth of the company's payments business. The company processed more than $1 billion in payments during its Q2.The company is in the process of launching an integrated marketplace channel with Amazon that is now in controlled release and which should be generally available before the end of this year. Results so far have not included any significant revenue from that partnership.One of the things about company's like this is that the TAM they are addressing doesn't stay still. The company launched Shopify Plus a couple of years ago and it is driving significant revenue growth by allowing SHOP to address the needs of potential users above its traditional platform. The company is getting an increasing proportion of its new business from company's such as Boeing, Hallmark and Justin Bieber (I will forebear any commentary about that latter success-I suppose I could say that they are both Canadian). Shopify Plus is a game changer with regards to TAM and Shopify Kit which I will write about later also has that potential.The company increased its revenue guidance to $365 million which would represent 78% growth for the full year. The company's new EPS forecast calls for a smaller non-GAAP loss this year with break-even non-GAAP earnings in sight by the end of 2017.I think it might be overkill at this point, but looked on a sequential basis, there were significant signs of progress in both gross margins and in managing expenses. In particular, while sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 2016 was about 20%, sequential growth in sales and marketing was only 3.5%. Overall, operating expenses grew by 12% sequentially on a GAAP basis, so there was some sequential progress on a path to profitability.Like many other companies, the plague of stock based comp infests this company's financial reports. The company was cash flow positive despite the very rapid growth and operating cash flow increased sharply from negligible in Q1 to about almost $6 million in Aq. But stock based comp rose by about 50% sequentially and stock based comp was more than 100% of operating cash flow in Q2. The company's capex grew substantially both year on year and sequentially reflecting the need for increased facilities of all kinds as the company scales dramatically.While the company has already started to manage sales and marketing costs in a visible fashion, primarily as the GMV rises without the need for additional sales resources, the same has yet to be seen in either research and development or in general and administrative costs. The ability the company has to reach its non-GAAP profit goal by the end of next year is going to depend on discipline in managing those lines of expense. There is an element of frisson regarding the company's shares that is inevitable so long as it is attempting to juggle growth and a path to profitability.The consensus price target for the shares amongst the 14 analysts who report their recommendations on 1 st call is $41 which hardly seems to justify the average rating of the shares which rests between buy and strong buy. The shares have appreciated by 50% since I originally wrote about them and have reached an all-time high-although that doesn't mean that much as the company's shares have been publicly traded for just 15 months.Q: The detail of the Q&A with Ms. KeitaA: Ms. Keita has gone from the top job in investor relations at EMC (EMC) which she held until last year to working in a similar capacity for Shopify. Two of the principle issues I wanted to drill down on had to do with just how long this hyper-growth phase might last and if there were competitors either current or potential who might derail the progress of this company. One doesn't expect totally objective answers to those kinds of questions and in that I was not disappointed.I do think, based on our conversation that the consensus estimates for 2017 revenue growth are likely to prove significantly conservative. Ms. Keita said that it would not be reasonable for the company's dollar growth to slow down next year. The current analyst consensus calls for dollar growth in 2017 of $134 million and that would compare to $141 million in dollar growth estimated for this year. I think that based on Ms. Keita's comments, it would be reasonable to believe that a forecast for 2017 revenues would be at least $500 million and probably a noticeable bit higher than that, rather than the current consensus estimates of $481 million in revenues that are expected in that period.Obviously Ms. Keita gets the question regarding competition meeting after meeting after meeting and she has the answer down pretty pat. But for the most part, regardless of who is telling the story, it seems to be true. Potential merchants can build their web stores using many different tools. But the fact is that if users want a multi-channel tool that is intuitive and looks pretty there are no great alternatives to Shopify at the moment. I asked about Bigcommerce which is about as close as it gets to what Shopify does and was told that Shopify produces a far superior product. That opinion is endorsed by other 3 rd party analysts such as nchannel.Ms. Keita talked about a program that Shopify uses in which it gives a fee equal to 20% of the license revenues generated for the life of a customer for referrals. She said that unlike her prior employer, this company lives and breathes user satisfaction and that its CEO is emotionally committed to the success of the merchants using the SHOP platform.The awards that SHOP gives to the merchants who best exemplify the ideal SHOP merchant are part of the process. This past quarter the company gave out 5 awards in its Build a Business competition for 5 entrepreneurs selling the most over any two-month period using the Shopify platform. I was not precisely certain as to what hand-forged carbon fiber rings are or what they do but the winner of the contest was a company called Carbon6. (It turns out that the rings are a form of jewelry worn as a ring-sort of like a craft piece-and if readers buy these designs they will enrich SHOP as well as the Carbon6 company.)One significant growth opportunity that has really not yet been exploited to any significant degree is international. The company has had international capabilities of some kind almost since the company was formed, but they have been rudimentary, nascent and not an area of focus. That is just starting to change now and Ms. Keita cited that the company now translates merchant blogs on-line. While we never discussed the available market overseas, it seems clear that it represents a growth dimension that has neither been fully exploited or even partially incorporated into company forecasts.About 5 months ago, Shopify began to offer a lending program that resembles that offered by Square (NYSE:SQ). The details of the program are pretty similar to those of SQ in that merchants can simply tick a button on their dashboard and receive a loan. The qualifications for the borrower are predetermined and the data to support the loan is available to SHOP from the transactions that are flowing through its E-Commerce platform. At the moment, borrowings by Shopify customers are less than $10 million and Ms. Katia expressed that the company strategy is for the loans it makes to be enablers of merchant growth that will lead to greater GMV in a virtuous circle. She said that the Shopify program is not intended to generate significant levels of profit but to help merchants improve their performance and to add to the stickiness of merchant accounts. But that does not mean that the loans are free and the overall rates are about the same as SQ charges. Through the end of the second quarter, the required capital for the advances has been handled in-house but at some point the company plans to fund the loans using third parties. Whether the program ramps to the size it is at Square or if it elicits the same level of controversy were themes that were not fully addressed in our conversation.We discussed the company's Kit. Kit is the name of the company's service that applies artificial intelligence technology to the use by SHOP merchants of advertising and promotions on multiple channels. Kit is a service that had been developed by a company acquired by Shopify a bit more than a year ago and it, along with hundreds of other services, is available from the SHOP on-line store. Kit is supposed to be something like a digital assistant for a small merchant. The service which costs $10/month for basic functionality essentially automates the process of posting updates to different on-line marketing channels based on proprietary algorithms that optimize marketing activity and marketing spend. At $10/month, Kit does not currently produce huge amounts of revenue but it is another service that is popular with the user base and which enhances stickiness. The company has 69 pages of apps that can be bought in its on-line store. I asked about this one (Kit) as it seems to be a focus for the company and was called out during the recent conference call.Not that I expected an answer of substance, but I inquired about the potential for the acquisition of SHOP in this wave of acquisitions that has been sweeping through the IT space for the last several months. I wasn't expecting much, but the answer I got was interesting. Ms. Keita said that Tobi Lutke, company founder and CEO, expects that SHOP will be around as an independent business for the balance of the century. Mr. Lutke, as is known by some, has a very typical background for an entrepreneur in this space. Instead of wearing a 'hoodie,' he wears an engineer's cap. His core competency, other than running SHOP, has been that of a programmer and he started using computers when he was 6. Although he is married and has 3 children, it came through in this discussion that the creation and the growth of this company is to be his life's work. I think it would be a mistake for investors to place much percentage chance on the acquisition potential for this company based on what Ms. Keita had to say.I asked Ms. Keita about the potential for Salesforce to move into this space. As mentioned above, they already integrate seamlessly with the SHOP application. She believes that the culture of that company and its go to market approach are strong barriers in terms of keeping CRM company from moving down market. She suggested that the there are no successful examples of larger companies moving into the SMB market although there are company's such as SAP (NYSE:SAP) who maintain a presence in SMB space despite their genesis selling their solutions in large enterprises.We talked about the potential cyclicality of the business. I said that there have been concerns articulated amongst investors that relate SHOP's potential performance during a recession. Ms. Keita said that the company had enjoyed strong performance during the great recession but of course that was in a phase of the development of SHOP when it was still essentially a start-up with minimal market presence. Overall, despite some counter-cyclical elements in the company's positioning, most particularly including its low prices, the company would most likely see its results correlated, to a greater or lesser degree, with recessionary influences. The growth in GMV is certainly correlated to retail sales and incremental payment volumes have a potentially strong impact on profitability. But the company has a tremendous number of levers it can pull to maintain growth during a recession-not enough to forestall any impact but enough to ameliorate the worst impacts.Q: What do the valuation metrics look like in the wake of the sharp share price appreciation?A: One of the more difficult things to do in terms of analyzing valuations is to be trapped without either earnings or cash flow on which to fall back. The company currently has an enterprise value of just below $3 billion. As mentioned earlier, while the current estimate for 2017 revenue is less than $500 million, a far more realistic estimate would be in the range of $520 million. While an EV/S of just below 6 is not a bargain on the surface, it will surely become one if the company is seen as becoming the category standard in a space with a huge market opportunity. The company has had a history of exceeding consensus expectations since it has been public and the beats have ranged from 33% to 80%. My belief is that the company will attempt to manage expectations in such a way as to continue that trend. So, I expect that most earnings releases will prove to be catalysts.I also think that the company, as it becomes more well known in the investment community, will attract positive coverage from more analysts. Its geographical location in Ottawa has perhaps negatively impacted the number of analysts who have covered the company. While the shares are at a new all-time high, their performance over the past 12 months has been far more modest with a share price appreciation of just 13%. So, there is some upside looking at historic valuation metrics. While based on my discussion, I think that the possibility for this company to be acquired in the next year is not great, other companies in the space will be acquired and are likely to be acquired at valuations that are significantly greater than the current valuation of this company.I think that the best strategy is for investors to acquire part of a position now and to be opportunistic but disciplined in acquiring more shares. But I expect to see many share price target resets in the coming weeks and months that take account for some of the company's lesser understood and under-appreciated growth initiatives.Summing UpAt current prices, many investors will pause before acquiring SHOP shares believing that the valuation has gotten stretched. That is potentially true although it is well to note that its valuation in terms of EV/S is clearly below levels of a year earlier. I think a strategy of scaling into this name on a disciplined basis, but starting a position at this time, makes the best sense in addressing this company as a potential investment."
3995636,102008,2016-08-04T08:21:41-04:00,"Adjusted loss came in lighter than expected with revenues exceeding guidance by over $6 million.Growth is occurring both organically as well as internally as existing customers graduate to higher plans, contributing to higher average revenue per merchant.I am updating my target to ~$43/share and believe that a takeout is likely given continuous M&A action in the sector as evident by Oracle’s recent acquisition of NetSuite.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) impressed investors yet again Wednesday morning reporting second quarter revenue of $86.6 million, smashing the company's own guidance by nearly 8%. Growth in the merchant solutions portion of the business truly emphasizes the phenomenal outperformance during the quarter, with revenue growing ~121% as merchants seem to be taking advantage of options like in-house shipping, payments, and the general idea of vertical integration which Shopify continues to push as a method for milking additional revenue from merchants while maintain the simplicity of the platform. Actual EPS and revenue were well above the estimates I laid out on my last note with EPS coming in at $(0.04) versus my projection of $(0.09) and the street's $(0.08). After a thorough read-through of the quarter and revision to my model, I am increasing my 12-month target to ~$43/share while still utilizing the 7.5x NTM EV/Revenue multiple mentioned in my previous analysis.Focus Shifts Towards Growth in Premium Merchants via Shopify PlusAside from being the fourth consecutive quarter where revenue grew over 90% on a y/y basis, Shopify Plus has emerged as a bright spot with its faster than expected growth in terms of adding well-known brands and translating that growth into a broad increase in both gross merchandise volume (GMV) and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for the company as a whole. Management stated that on the call that the growth in Shopify Plus clearly drove the 12.5% increase in MRR on a sequential q/q basis and ~70% growth on a y/y basis, which yet again underscores the engagement level that the platform has achieved with most customers. Perhaps the biggest surprise to either the street or my own views comes when considering the split of new Shopify Plus customers, which management stated to be around 50/50 amongst existing lower-level merchants and newer customers like Adele, Justin Bieber, and Boeing. Moreover, this shift in the amount of user on lower levels plans has had a positive impact on average revenue per merchant (ARPM), which is a figure that is a bit ambiguous because the company does not explicitly state the exact number of merchants added/maintained. Running along with the company's reports that the merchant base is ""over 300,000"", it appears that ~25,000 new merchants were added during Q2, with average revenue per merchant jumping nearly 9% to $28.40 from $26.40 in Q1 (using provided 275K and 300K). Furthermore, ARPM is up over 13% from Q2 2015 when the company sported around 175,000 merchants. Note, the total addressable market remains large for the company and I believe that the level of engagement and retention that the company has been able to maintain should aid in its endeavors of attacking larger portions of the market.Profitability Re-Affirmed for Q4 2017 and a ""Re"" Revision of FY 2016 GuidanceThe company continues to deliver on its promise of lowering operating leverage to stay on track for profitability as early as Q4 2017. That said, GAAP operating margin improved three basis points to -10% and Non-GAAP operating margin improved to around -4% from -8% in the first quarter of 2016. Management did re-confirm their previous timeline of being profitable in Q4 2017 on the conference call.In my last piece regarding the company around two weeks ago, I mentioned the ability of management to consistently execute on the goals they lay out, specifically concerning operating metrics and revenue guidance. Recall, I mentioned that I wouldn't be surprised if the company raised guidance for a second time this year due to 1) The nature of being a ""hyper-growth"" company and 2) Previous conservative approaches by the company and its ability to deliver on expanding sales channels, etc. Lo and behold, the company did in fact raise guidance once again, this time guiding for FY 2016 revenue to come in ""between $361-$367 million."" This revision should solidify two core pillars of the company's investment thesis which are 1) That the premium valuation is in fact justifiable as evident by consistent 90%+ revenue growth on y/y bases and 2) While the company has very little penetration when considering the broad TAM, there still are avenues for rapid growth in the short term.Updated Valuation and M&A CommentaryI have updated my forecast through the end of 2017 and have projected Q3 revenue to come in around $1.6 million higher than the range of $93-$95 million provided. Additionally, I am now forecasting 13% and 15% growth in the subscriptions solutions business for Q3 and Q4 due to seasonality (seen historically), & 10% and 7% growth in the merchant solutions portion. My estimates of ~$363 million in FY 2016 revenue fall in-line with the updated guidance for the full year.Figure 1: Shopify Updated Income Statement Projections(Source: Company filings, personal estimates)Staying consistent with my previous valuation, I am sticking with a multiple of 7.5x EV/ NTM revenue estimates and am raising my fair-value to $43/share, implying further upside of ~16%. Note, this premium 7.5x multiple assumes consistent mid-teens revenue growth in the subscriptions solutions business and also factors in some M&A value. I believe that the chances of M&A have only gone up with last week's announcement of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) taking over NetSuite (NYSE:N) at nearly 9x forward EV/Revenue. Potential acquirees would need to note that Shopify will gradually become more expensive as time progresses assuming the company is able to sustain its current growth rates. In that case, management would control the cards of the game and would be able to leverage a sweetened deal, ultimately favoring Shopify and its shareholders.Figure 2: Shopify Updated Valuation Summary(Source: Company filings, personal estimates)Note: Data as of market close, August 4th, 2016."
3961494,28551,2016-03-28T18:31:52-04:00,E-commerce is a rapidly growing business.This winner-takes-all industry is consolidating.Shopify is well positioned in the e-commerce space.,"The digital revolution and the share economy are turning us all into entrepreneurs.* In the new economy, entrepreneurs will be the norm, not the exception.While our fathers typically worked their whole lives for the same company, my generation, the Baby Boomers, cut the bond between corporations and their employees. Life-long loyalty to an organization was replaced with loyalty to one's own career. This required mobility and a mercenary approach to employment opportunities.The next generation is going a step further. The millennials will be more in control of their professional lives than any generation in modern history. The digital economy is offering so many ways to create an income that a nine-to-five job and a tedious daily commute is starting to look like an oddity. Already, many millennials are choosing to be independent workers in the Uber economy, supplementing their regular income by monetizing their homes through AirBnB. But even if these activities generate sufficient income, most will want to start some business online in their spare time.It is so easy to launch a small company with global reach on the internet. Very little capital and no manpower is required, increasing the likelihood of a successful launch, even if the start-up phase takes a while. All the required services can be bought on line. From web design to payment facilities, from accounting to marketing services, it is all available for a fee. Better yet, small entrepreneurs now have access to all-in-one e-commerce solutions.One-stop shopping for entrepreneurs is a rapidly growing industry with a few big players emerging. They include Bigcommerce, Volusion and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), each offering a large panoply of services. Start-ups can get a customized look of their store, integrated payments, an easy way to add and remove products, good analytics, customer support, etc. The largest of them all, Shopify, also excels at using Search Engine Optimization and offers a large choice of apps.Consolidation of the E-Commerce Solution Industry.With internet services - search, social, shopping - becoming winner-takes-all businesses, this is a good time to take a look at SHOP. This Canadian company is the largest player catering to the rapidly growing world of do-it-yourself business creation. It claims 243,000 customers. Sales last year doubled and for 2016 SHOP surprised on the upside with projections well above the Street's. That's not all. Powering up in the race for dominance, Shopify continues to aggressively invest the totality of its earnings to consolidate its front-runner position.This strategy seems to be working. SHOP is clearly crowding out would-be competitors in the e-commerce solution space. Last summer, shortly after eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) abandoned its Magento Go and ProStore subsidiaries, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that they too were closing down their struggling Webstore, advising third-party sellers to migrate to Shopify. One can hardly come up with a better endorsement than that.A Growth IndustryE-commerce is still a young industry. It has many years of rapid growth ahead as it rides the wave of ""entrepreneurialization"" of the economy. Furthermore, this business appears recession proof. Demand for e-commerce services actually tend to go up in economic downturns as laid-off people look for alternative ways to make a living. This explains Shopify's very good performance after the financial crisis of 2008.Today, users are demanding more and more from e-commerce platforms, narrowing the field. It is no longer enough to offer an easy setup, some level of customization and standard features. Even small online store businesses now have a long list of fundamental requirements including mobile friendliness, social media integration, good user experience, search engine optimization, modules for content marketing and customer support.Medium-sized companies need even more complex services such as blogging platforms, inventory management, return management and shipment tracking. They also require software for offering coupons and promotions or need a multilingual website with multiple currency options. Integrating a product with Amazon or any social media may be standard practice, but larger companies may want to have the option to buy programatic advertising. Every business should have an email dedicated to support, but bigger ones may need Live Chat.Shopify offers the whole range of services. Through their Shopify Plus software they now sell to larger companies, including subsidiaries of the likes of GE and Anheuser Bush Inbev, or big brands like The Ellen DeGeneris Show. This level of sophistication and complexity makes it increasingly difficult for new entrants to challenge them.Valuation.Companies at this stage of their growth need to be valued on a multiple of their top line, not their bottom line. It is not that this business cannot be profitable, but rather that it would be a mistake to make profits. If they don't put all their profits back into the business in order to grow faster than their competition, they risk losing their front-runner status and rapidly become obsolete. Hence an EV to sales of 6 seems a reasonable price to pay for promising future earnings.(*see my previous article here)."
3989510,102008,2016-07-19T14:09:12-04:00,"The cloud software space is back “in style” due to recent M&A deals, upbeat company guidance, and gradual multiple expansion.Hyper-growth company Shopify trades at ~7.1x EV/NTM revenue estimates, a generous premium for growing revenues 95% y/y from 2014-2015, but deserves an even higher valuation based on management’s flawless execution.Potential upside stands at ~14% to ~$37/share, derived using a EV/NTM revenue multiple of 7.5x and NTM revenue projections of ~$377 million.","Ottawa-based social commerce platform and SaaS provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has sprung back to life as the cloud software sector has regained juice as an attractive investment vehicle despite sporting lofty premiums for most companies. Additionally, recent M&A deals like Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) and demandware (NYSE:DWRE) have sparked an influx of capital back into the sector, signaling that the idea of the cloud is indeed the future and not simply a fad like many turned to believe over the past few years. Despite trading at ~7.1x EV/NTM revenue estimates, Shopify remains undervalued given its ability to capitalize on extensive marketing efforts, attract new merchants to its platform, and expand its offerings over a variety of sales channels.Figure 1: Shopify Sales Channels(Source: Company Investor Deck, May 2016)Recent M&A Underscores A Competitive Deal EnvironmentIt's clear that the SaaS business model is becoming increasingly prevalent (if not already) amongst the large cloud players as well as a shift in subscription based products versus one-time volume licensing. Names like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) have seen changes in earnings and revenue momentum as a result of this migration, which has sparked a renewed interest amongst other players as well. Regarding a smaller name like Shopify, larger players are becoming increasingly defensive in hopes of safeguarding their imprints on a specific market or simply have increased their appetites for deals in other areas. Recent deals like Marketo being taken private by Vista Equity Partners for ~5.5x EV/NTM revenue estimates and demandware being acquired by salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) for ~8.5x EV/NTM revenue estimates highlight the competitive environment these companies now operate in. Despite demonstrating revenue growth of 95% and 109% FY revenue growth in 2015 and 2014 respectively, Shopify trades at a seemingly modest EV/NTM revenue estimates multiple of only ~7.1x (guiding for 66% revenue growth y/y for 2015-2016). Notably, demandware was taken out at an ~8.5x multiple, despite guiding for full-year revenue to increase by only 26% from 2015 to 2016. Per the schedule 14D-9 filing with the SEC that provides an overview of the acquisition process, there appears to have been another bidder (""Party X"") for demandware, which salesforce.com in turn ended up outbidding by ~7%. CEO Marc Benioff had this to say following the announcement of the deal in June:The competitiveness of the deal environment only translates as a good omen for Shopify as it would be able to provide solid revenue growth to an acquirer who in turn would be able to manage operating expenses and R&D much more efficiently. Scarcity value can play a significant role in deal-making, and Shopify ranks much higher than the majority of its peers when comparing revenue growth and potential for additional market expansion.Figure 2: Peer FY 2016 revenue guidance and EV/2016 revenue estimate multiples(Source: Company filings, Estimize Wall Street Consensus Estimates)Business OverviewShopify operates with two primary offerings - 1) subscription solutions: which are monthly subscription plans for various sizes of businesses to setup a storefront across multiple channels and interact with customers, and 2) merchant solutions: which is an initiative that is constantly receiving updates and provides merchants with payment processing and shipping management, all under the Shopify domain. More recently, the company has been able to grow its merchant solutions subscriber base and shift its profit model away from heavily relying on its subscription solutions business (from 60%/40% split to 53%/47%).Moreover, the company allows merchants to operate in a variety of channels including physical stores, online stores, and social media outlets. I believe the company's ability to convince and lure customers into using the Shopify ""domain"" and omni-channel platform can be the ultimate driver for additional merchant growth and future profitability. Due to the nature of the SaaS business model, upwards scalability and merchant growth drive operating and profit margins upward, which would aid the company in its efforts in becoming profitable. Shares sold off sharply following the company's Q1 earnings release when the company announced a larger than expected loss, which does indeed look unhealthy on the surface.However, the sharp increase in operating expenditures was met with adequate sales, merchant, and GMV (gross merchandise volume) growth, which should relieve most concerns about the ability of the company to manage expenses and reach its ultimate goal of turning a profit. To put the quarter in perspective, the company's merchant base grew ~71% on a y/y basis with GMV growing by ~105% on a y/y basis. In terms of revenue/earnings quality, MRR (monthly recurring revenue, calculated by # of merchants X avg. plan rev.) increased by ~73%. MRR is thought to be a metric of higher-integrity and validity in areas where companies offer subscription based solutions because of the potential volatility in number of total merchants/customers on a sequential basis.Research conducted by Booz & Company (now referred to as ""Strategy&"") estimates that social commerce revenues came in at ~$30 billion in 2015, and project these numbers to nearly triple by 2020. Furthermore, sales attributable to mobile transactions are only expected to increase, which compliments Shopify's move of having mobile sales responsible for over 50% of total revenue for the first time.Figure 3: Social Commerce Revenues Worldwide, 2011-2015(Source: Booz & Company and eMarketer)To put this into perspective, a comparison can be made to a similar situation that Facebook encountered during the smartphone boom starting in 2010, when the app first launched on mobile phones. Over the next five years, Facebook's MAU (monthly active users) split went from 40% on mobile to over 90% as of Q1 2016. An identical trend with shopping is also expected as merchants initiate offerings over a variety of social media fronts and native applications. Notably, Shopify just introduced the platform's integration with Facebook messenger, allowing businesses to directly contact customers via Facebook. Being the first and only platform to do so, management did admit that some new merchant additions were attributable to the fact that this integration was the convincing factor in switching over to Shopify, which is always a positive sign given the company continues to open up fresh connection gateways.Valuation and MetricsAfter modeling the company's income statement out to the end of 2017, I project the company to be profitable on a non-GAAP, net and comprehensive basis in Q4 2017, which is also in line with management's projections regarding EBITDA profitability which were stated on the Q1 earnings conference call. Profitability is expected to be driven by moderate decreases in both sales and marketing expenses as well as R&D, but primarily by consistent revenue growth of ~15% for the subscription solutions business, low-mid single digit growth in merchant solutions, and ~10% sequential total revenue growth on a q/q basis throughout 2017.I project adjusted EPS to come in at ~$0.09/share vs. consensus estimates of $0.08/share. My estimates for FY2016 revenue of ~$340.7 million are at the mid-point of company guidance despite my projections of adjusted operating loss being on the upper-range of guidance. I believe that the company's operating expenses will shift and take a more conservative route in the latter part of 2016 and into 2017 (as % of revenue), ultimately going into Q4 2017 where I believe the company will eventually be profitable on a Non-GAAP basis.Moreover, I wouldn't be surprised if management raises guidance for a second time this year during the Q2 earnings release. Recall, initial revenue guidance was for around $320-$330 million in full year revenue for 2016 before the company revised it to ~$337-$347 million. The raise was particularly surprising given the fact that Q1 had historically been a weak quarter due to seasonal trends which highlights impressive execution on management's part.Figure 4: Shopify Projected Income Statement (Base Case)(Source: Company filings, personal estimates)My model projects a 3% increase in share count for Q2 2016, a 2% increase for both Q3 and Q4 2016, and increases of 1% onwards on a sequential q/q basis. Additionally, my model estimates GAAP to Non-GAAP adjustments to be relatively similar to those in prior quarters and are adjusted for seasonal trends as well. Cells that are highlighted green indicate my personal assumptions.Shares took a sharp dive on an intra-day basis just as any other high-beta name during the Brexit sell-off, but part of the sell-off may have been due to the ~7.5% revenue exposure to the United Kingdom, which the company has trimmed down from 9% in 2014. If the trend continues, the company should be shielded from any dramatic panic or hit to the business due to currency headwinds or commerce changes as a result of Brexit.Figure 5: Revenue Breakdown by Geography (% of total revenue)(Source: Company filings)The market is likely mispricing Shopify due to concerns over margins which are valid in the short run yet still substantially overblown in my view. For a hyper-growth company to scale up and efficiently manage resources, adequate time is needed to grow the customer base to a point where margins can expand and gross profit per customer can increase. Further, while many of its peers boast substantially higher gross margins as evident by figure 2, all but two have guided for less than half of what Shopify's has guided for FY2016 revenue in terms of percentage growth. Just as P/E ratios and other metrics deserve to be viewed and analyzed from a forward or NTM (next twelve months) perspective, margin issues should not be brought up in the short term. Moreover, the company has proved that it is capable of managing other metrics like operating leverage, which it has gradually toned down from 82% in 2012 to 58% in 2015.With my estimates for revenue in the NTM coming to ~$377 million and applying a 7.5x EV/revenue forward revenue multiple, I arrive at a value of ~$37/share (14% upside), equating to a market cap and enterprise value of ~$2.96 billion and $2.83 billion, respectively.Figure 6: Shopify Valuation Summary (Base Case)(Source: Company filings, personal estimates)In the event that the company fails to deliver upwards of ~13%-15% revenue growth for subscription solutions and ~4%-5% revenue growth for merchant solutions throughout the next four quarters, my bear case model brings down the target price to ~$30/share, reflecting downside of ~6% from current levels. Bear case projected q/q sequential growth rates for subscription solutions and merchant solutions range from 11%-13% and 2%-3%, respectively.Figure 7: Shopify Valuation Summary (Bear Case)(Source: Company filings, personal estimates)Note: Data as of the market close on July 18."
3860536,98366,2016-02-03T11:41:56-05:00,Kauffman research indicates that small business activity is on the rise.Most businesses need an ecommerce website. We believe Shopify is the best-in-class.We think the company will beat analyst estimates of a loss of 18 cents per share.Price target of $25.00 offers upside of 10.5%.,"According to Kauffman Foundation research small businesses activity is growing in 49 out of 50 U.S. states. This rising level of entrepreneurship could create a demand for ecommerce solutions that Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) provides. As a provider of cloud-based commerce platforms for small businesses, Shopify is a one-stop shop for a business's ecommerce needs. It provides businesses with everything from the website design, through to payment solutions. There are numerous revenue streams for the company, which include subscriptions, payment handling, and add-ons such as premium web designs and apps.For some businesses, a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page is enough. But for others, especially if involved in ecommerce, they need a stronger online presence. This is where Shopify fits into the small business ecosystem. Compared to a web developer that may charge thousands of dollars, Shopify is an affordable option with very little hassle. When running a business the last thing the business owner will want to worry about is the web design. Few would even have the skill set to perform such a task. When you can get a professional looking design, shown below, and payment gateway for $29 per month (or +$40 for a physical payment solution), it starts to make a lot of sense.Source: Shopify.comWe feel small business owners will undoubtedly want to keep operation costs down. Especially when you're just starting up and the world of statistics is against you. Bloomberg estimates that 8 out of 10 new businesses fail within the first 18 months. Perhaps Shopify could help reduce that rate?There are a number of fundamental reasons why a new business fails. Idea is of course central to the success of a business. You can't expect to sell sand in a desert, the idea has to have value for consumers. Start-up costs are another factor. Unless a business has a wealthy and generous backer, it will most likely start on a very small budget and its burn rate won't have an especially long time horizon. Paying for a web developer not only takes time but it takes money. Eliminating this and using Shopify not only saves money, it also can reduce the time to market. It is conceivable that you could launch a business within 24 hours through the Shopify platform and a decent camera.Speaking of burn rate, Shopify is still a loss-making operation. We expect this to change in its fiscal 2017. Investors should not be concerned by the losses though, as it has more than adequate levels of cash in its reserves. Currently, the balance sheet shows cash and equivalents of $115.31 million, and we expect the company to report a full year loss of approximately $12.9 million, or negative 17 cents per share on revenue of $200 million, in its upcoming earnings release on February 17.Source: YchartsOur forecast would mean an earnings beat by one cent versus the average analyst estimate of negative 18 cents per share. Due to the rise in small businesses, we are very bullish and think next year will be ahead of consensus by 7 cents. A loss of 10 cents per share is expected by analysts but we envisage a loss of just 3 cents per share or $2.3 million.We feel this is supported by the level of growth we are witnessing. In March, the company had 150,000 stores on its platform. By September, this had increased to over 200,000. We expect this to have climbed to over 225,000 today, and see this growth continuing in 2016. The integration for merchants into Facebook, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) pages will further enhance its appeal to business owners who we believe will already be swayed to the platform we consider to be the best-in-class. Shopify's total revenue in the third quarter of 2015 rose by 93% year over year to $52.8 million. Its subscription revenue was $29.6 and its merchant solutions revenue came in at $23.2 million due to an increase in Shopify payments. Year over year this meant growth of 67% and 141%, respectively.This for us is definitely a fledgling company that for the most part is flying under the radar. Wedbush Securities recently placed a $25.00 price target on the shares. This is further supported by Morgan Stanley's recent outperform recommendation also. A $25.00 price target represents 10.5% upside, and we feel convinced it will reach it.We intend to hold Shopify for the long term and envisage long-term gains far exceeding the 10.5% expected return this year."
3975004,98236,2016-05-13T16:50:00-04:00,"Shopify is the 600-pound gorilla in its particular space, that of building e-commerce platforms for SMB retailers.Shopify has grown its revenues by 4X in three years and is on track to grow revenues seven times in three years.The company appears to have some significant defenses against numerous competitors.The company, while not using much stock-based comp, continues to experience both GAAP and non-GAAP losses.The company has an interesting initiative in terms of what it calls its Merchant Cash Advantage program which offer cash advances to its current client base.","How am I going to endure reading about another small e-commerce vendor that doesn't make money and is going to change the world?There's a pretty simple answer to that question and it relates to whether or not there is positive alpha to be had from a name like this. This is most certainly not a name to appeal to value or income investors. And this is not the first company that will cross into a land of ""normal"" valuations. If you are looking for those kinds of names, this is not for you.On the other hand, there are just not that many companies in any field that can grow by seven times in three years. The reason to keep reading is to make a determination as to what kind of growth is going to be possible for this company over the next three years and whether or not the people that run Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) are going to take the necessary steps to balance growth and profitability. Obviously at some point, investors are going to need to see real numbers and I will explore what the business model might look like at scale. Overall, my conclusion is that growth is likely to continue at very high levels as I will explain below. I do think it is reasonable to assume that there's a path to profitability at this company but its speed is perhaps slower than is desired by many, and that is not going to satisfy all investors.The investment world is just chock full of e-commerce platforms that are out to change the world. Not all of them are going to make it and not all of them are going to implode. Investors are looking for competitive moats where there are no moats and profitability before scale is feasible. In writing about and evaluating many of these stories - and for the most part they are of the immaturity where they are just stories - it is hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.Shopify is a name that has more or less exploded on the scene in the last couple of years. Its revenues have quadrupled since 2013 and are forecast to grow another 70% this year which will put them at seven times the level they were in 2013 and many observers anticipate that the forecast is likely to prove conservative. In addition to the revenue growth, the number of merchants using the platform has risen to 275,000. Sub adds in the first quarter were a record of 32,000 much of that increase coming from the confluence between social media sites and some of the solutions that Shopify offers.Needless to say, profits have been a bit more elusive. Stock-based comp at about 5% of revenues is relatively modest. On the other hand, this isn't quite a traditional enterprise software company as its revenues come from transactions are far more than subscription revenues. That has meant that deferred revenue balances are modest as well and the concept of net bookings is not useful in this analysis. The company is essentially at breakeven operating cash flow but capex is minor as well.The company's financial outlook is not suggesting that it's going to achieve non-GAAP profitability anytime soon. If you want that in an investment recommendation, investing in Shopify shares is not for you. It's Q1 earnings release essentially consisted of a significant revenue beat of about 10% coupled with a marginal reduction in the non-GAAP loss for the quarter compared to prior consensus expectations.Shopify's guidance during last week's earnings release was essentially more of the same. Revenue guidance for the full year is now $342 million at the mid-point up from a prior estimate of $325 million. But the company is far away from leverage at scale as the GAAP loss is forecast to be $$44 million at the mid-point compared to a prior estimate of $39 million.Many investors are impatient with that kind of business formula and the shares dropped 13% in the wake of earnings compared to a change in the IGV-Software Index of +2%. Of course, in the current market environment, investors in the tech space are impatient about many things including beating earnings if the beat doesn't involve an increase in revenue guidance.By any conventional value metrics, this company's shares are not cheap. The EV/S is 5.6X which is hardly the most expensive valuation in the software world but neither the P/E or the free cash flow yield can be used to support valuations.In some ways, this company can be compared to Square (NYSE:SQ) although its business is not built around card readers and POS terminals. Its customer base is essentially ""online"" stores rather than physical locations although some of its customers operate both a web store and a physical store. A bit more than half of the transactions it manages come from mobile devices. But its CEO, while having nowhere near the fame of Square's Jack Dorsey has his idiosyncrasies. Company CEO and founder Tobi Lutke may not wear a hoodie, but his headgear is perhaps unorthodox for the CEO of a public company. The rest of the management team is about what one might expect from a young, upstart Canadian software company. Not a single tie to be found in the group.I think the basic questions to be explored here are does this company have a unique offering? Does it have any kind of real product or marketing moat? And is there a path to profitability that doesn't involve an impossibly long waiting period?Just why is this e-commerce platform different or better than all of the other e-commerce platforms out there?It is probably a good idea to start with a description of what this company actually does. In that regard, the name is actually a bit helpful. Essentially, the company helps aspiring web merchants build and manage their web sites. There can be a fair level of customization in the process. The company facilitates the use of mobile devices for shipping. It does offer a POS solution for those web merchants who have need to take payments directly. The company charges as little as $9/month although its standard offering costs $29/month and the Pro version costs $79/month. Shopify can setup a logistics solution for their customer base and nowadays can guarantee next day delivery. The basic service allows the aspiring merchants to sell on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), accept credit card payments and to have a buy button on their website. There is a retail package add-on for $40/month which enables Shopify customers to have the ability to operate a physical store that has the standard POS technology required these days and the ability to accept payments.The company also charges its merchants a fee for accepting credit cards and gets them paid in a timely fashion. At the moment, revenues from the two different revenue streams are about equal, but inevitably, if the company is successful, the stream that it calls merchant solutions will grow more rapidly as its base of installed customers continues to rise. Again, not terribly surprisingly, gross margins on subscriptions are 79% and gross margins on merchant solutions are far lower at 26%. It is, and will continue to be, lots easier to collect revenues from subscriptions than to process payments.Shopify offers many different services such as chat to help its merchants better sell what they have to offer and it actually offers some primitive analytics and has recently acquired a minuscule CRM vendor. It is a lengthy list and it would be tedious to go through all of it. But if you are a small retail business setting up for the first time, Shopify has a host of things from hardware to pretty themes for your site that you can buy - and it probably has more, if not necessarily better, features than anyone else in the space.The market for web commerce solutions has plenty of competition. Almost anyone wanting to open a retail business these days is going to need both a web site and a way to take payments. The days of renting a store and acquiring a POS terminal are long since passed. The number of start-ups with the expertise to ""build their own"" is low and it would be hard for anyone to justify not outsourcing the task to specialist companies who have been there and done. Significant competitors include BigCommerce, Magneto, WooCommerce with WordPress, WixeCommerce and Weebly eCommerce. And as many competitors as there are in the space, there are almost as many services that offer advice as to which platform to buy. I don't propose to do a feature/function comparison. I am not trying to write a guide to buy e-commerce platforms. In a nutshell, the BigCommerce is probably the closest to what Shopify offers, the Magneto and WooCommerce solutions are Open Source and probably will require developers and are far less robust overall, and the last two solutions are more basic drag and drop tools for building e-commerce web sites. There are other platforms as well including Volusion, Demandware (NYSE:DWRE), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Nexternal.One major factor in Shopify's success is its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon surprisingly decided to get out of the web site business and is trying to move its Webstore users to Shopify. It is a pretty far-ranging partnership in which Amazon is trying to migrate its customers to the Shopify platform. This company has been aggressive in recruiting an eco-system. It has partnerships with FB, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and many others. None of the partnerships is exclusive but in all of the cases Shopify was first to embrace these other companies and it is reaping a disproportionate share of the reward.The other major advantage that Shopify enjoys is scale. This company is far better known than its competitors. It is able to spend far more on advertising and promotion. This story is a familiar litany of the first mover advantages in tech, where it is difficult to compete with the 600-pound gorilla because he is 600 pounds and you are puny. Having never used any of the competitive solutions, or the Shopify solution either, I have no objective way of telling readers whose product will build a better web site in the shortest time period without the involvement of IT professionals.What I think is self-evident to most is that the Shopify solution is at least equal in most comparison analysis and perhaps does have some advantages in its ability to design attractive web sites. Their pricing is comparable to those of the other major products on offer. Products that are at least as good if not better than the competition, partnerships with Amazon and other web commerce companies significant first mover and scale advantages. It is a pretty reasonable moat. Technology moats can look splendid on the outside but can be ephemeral. Advantages in marketing, positioning and overall reputation can last a long time. Shopify is at least ""good enough"" so that it continues to gain in mindshare compared to its competitors and mindshare is probably the best moat that anyone can build.Another major advantage of scale is the size of the partner ecosystem that Shopify has been able to build. I am not sure that there is one partner or the other that I might highlight, but because Shopify has so many customers, 275,000 at last count, it is going to attract more partners to its ecosystem when compared to its far smaller competitors. Partnering with Shopify affords far more opportunity than - partnerships with most of the other vendors in the space.The combination of partner features and the core Shopify technology has enabled the company to start to build its cohort of the company's premium service, Shopify Plus. Shopify Plus costs users more than twice the monthly fee when compared to the core Shopify offering and it is a major margin opportunity for the company. Brands such as Nescafe, Jones Soda (OTCQB:JSDA), the Golf Channel and Ellen DeGeneres are now using the platform and while they are not typical users, the capabilities that the combination of solutions built by partners + the Shopify platform has allowed some larger users to take advantage of capabilities unavailable from smaller competitors.Finally, I think it is relevant to talk about the Shopify Merchant Cash Advantage offering. Of course, there are a huge number of potential lenders to SMBs. The problem is simply that the old style lending paradigm for these kinds of customers is totally broken. Banks still aren't lending without interminable waits and massive documentation. And the so-called ""VC"" lenders are able to charge exorbitant interest rates. Given the position that Shopify has in the market, it is far better situated to make loans to its customer base and to minimize credit losses. It can do that and most of its smaller competitors cannot. That is a very significant competitive advantage and one that is likely to grow significantly.What is the path to profitability and how long is the wait? And what are the risks of a black swan that just changes this category completely and eviscerates Shopify's advantages?The company's goal is to reach non-GAAP profitability in Q4 of 2017 and they reiterated that plan on the call last week. Shopify CFO Russ Jones said several times during the call that 2016 was a year for investments and in CFO speak that essentially means not to expect material operating leverage this year. Lutke talked about the company rarely putting together specific projections for specific investments and said that when it came to initiatives, the company starts off small and if the initiative works, it gets more resources until it starts to slow down. Maybe not a traditional way of doing things but typical of an entrepreneurial culture.I don't think there is any particular secret regarding the path to profitability for Shopify. Sales and marketing grew by 115% year on year last quarter and total revenue grew by 95%. Sales and Marketing is currently 39% of revenues. R&D is 19 % of revenues. The only expense category that isn't dramatically elevated is G&A at 10% of revenues.I don't think that it will be very difficult for this company to constrain the growth in sales and marketing almost at any pace it determines. This is not a typical enterprise software vendor that has hundreds of sales reps and an involved field sales hierarchy. This company has paid for leads and it spends a lot in fostering partner relationships. It spent $2 million last quarter on just a single partner event called Unite.While R&D is people-centric in terms of its expense, cutting the ratio back for a company growing 95%/year is not a huge amount of constraint. Indeed, as the absolute size of the company increases, it becomes more difficult to hire the number of R&D personnel necessary to support outsize growth in R&D spend. And this is a Canadian company, with headquarters in Ottawa. Many developers are simply not used to long, cold winters. The average January temperature in Ottawa is 13F and the weather web site describes the January weather as being frigid 55% of the time.The path to profitability is not incredibly long. Last quarter, the GAAP margin was -12%. The non-GAAP margin was -8%. The expense ratio cuts necessary to reach non-GAAP profitability are certainly in the manageable range. The only issue that this company is likely to have in terms of reaching non-GAAP profitability is the inevitable decline in gross margins as the company's Merchant Solutions business grows more rapidly than Subscription Solutions. Like many smaller tech startups companies that have recently gone public, Shopify has a business model goal of 20% non-GAAP operating margins. While I am sure that such a goal is reachable, the question is going to be the growth rate under the circumstances of constrained marketing and development spending.The biggest risk that this company faces is that it gets all of its revenue from the retail sector. It is hardly a black swan, but it is, nonetheless, a swan of some color. Less retail spending, lower transaction volumes and lower percentage increases in the rate of subscription revenue growth are all concomitants that Shopify would face were retail sales to decline. The company will not escape a significant cyclical downturn because its customers are highly exposed to discretionary retail spending.I think the second largest risk this company has relates to the position it already has in the mobile market. One of the reasons this company has grown quite as fast as it has, was that it took a large bet on retailers building sites on mobile devices earlier than many of its competitors. The growth in mobile as a percentage of total transactions has leveled off in the US although it continues to rise overseas. Going forward, the company will not have the tailwind it has enjoyed from rising volumes of mobile transactions.The final issue to talk about is how does this company keep its growth elevated as it continues to scale. Obviously even with 275,000 customers, it has a trivial percentage of the overall SMB space in retail. And its initiatives with its plus service might be a far greater source of revenue going forward than has been the case heretofore. And the impact of its partnerships with many much larger companies that sell on the web is just starting to have an impact. But like most tech vendors, it wants another leg under its stool.For this company that leg is likely to be its SMB finance business, Merchant Cash Advance. One can envisage simply awesome projections for a business in which the cost of acquiring clients is close to zero. There are, no doubt, some infrastructure expenses that the company has already started to incur for making cash advance loans to its clients. This company has enormous advantages compared to most other lenders in that it has a far better view into its prospective borrowers than anyone else is likely to have. These days, data scientists are in a position to use customer data to forecast loan losses far more effectively than heretofore has been the case. And the company is in the best position of any lender to achieve repayment by simply deducting repayments from the sales that its borrowers transact through its payment network.Obviously, there is a risk that investors who will be needed to fund this program at scale, may have different risk assessments than Shopify. Look no further than Square to see how that happens. But overall, the opportunity to achieve substantial net interest spreads for Shopify is quite tempting. How it will play out, and how investors will choose to value net interest income is something that is not easy to forecast before there is any material track record.Summing Up!Shopify is another e-commerce web site. It is the leading vendor in its space of building web sites for SMB retailers who are either starting up or who are graduating to a higher plane of success. The company gets revenues by selling subscriptions to its clients and by taking a fee on their sales, either as part of their payments platform or directly. Growth has been spectacular and this company quadrupled its revenues between 2013-2015 and continues to grow rapidly. It has built a formidable partner network including FB, Amazon, Twitter and Pinterest. The company has proven to be a very conservative forecaster since it has gone public, and it has significantly increased its growth forecast for this year.The company has lots of competitors and it has some significant moats against those competitors including its scale which has brought it advantages in terms of its visibility within the community of potential users. It has enjoyed significant first mover advantages, particularly in building mobile web sites for its customers. The competitive moat seems destined to survive for years into the futures.The company has declared that 2016 is to be a year of investment which means that despite huge sales growth operating margins will remain negative. The company expects to reach non-GAAP profitability in the last quarter of 2017 and there is little reason to doubt that the company will reach such a target.The company is just starting to build out the infrastructure required to build a cash advance business within its current user base. The opportunities for that business are very considerable and the company has many advantages over some potential customers in the SMB loan space.This company's valuation and lack of visible profits until the end of 2017 may not be to the liking of some investors. On the other hand, the company's growth at some level of scale is one of the most rapid I have seen in some time. The business model calling for 20% operating margins certainly appears achievable at this point. Shopify shares reached a low valuation earlier this year of just below $20 during the tech panic. The shares have declined again since the earnings release when some investors were disappointed by the 2-year path to profitability. I think this is a favorable time for investors to consider making a commitment to SHOP shares at these levels."
3725716,95376,2015-12-01T19:40:41-05:00,"Shopify excites investors with its continuously improving revenue growth and GMV.The e-commerce solutions provider is banking on its unique proposition and esteemed products, reporting another impressive quarter of revenues; 93% YoY growth in revenues for 3Q.The GMV grew by over 100%, solidifying the merchant solutions growth with the adoption of payments and SaaS/subscriptions. The accelerated MRR is the reflection of strengthening growth year over year.We reiterate our ""Outperform"" rating with a price target of $36, which might suggest higher EV/Sales multiple, but premium valuation remains justified with the company's huge market potential.","Price ObjectiveShopify (NYSE:SHOP) impresses all, with another quarter of astonishingly good numbers across the board, be it revenues, earnings per share (EPS) or gross merchandise volumes (GMV). One does not remain unmoved by the company's consistently improving stats. The numbers make us curious to know the sorcery with which the Ottawa-based Canadian commerce company is enchanting everybody, including merchants, retailers and end consumers.One thing is clear, SHOP is doing things right as it is set to go along with its strategic business model of subscription stores. So, with an all-in-one set-to-soar e-commerce solution, Shopify is in our shiny catalogue of long-run forecasts with a ""Buy"" status. We confidently rate Shopify as ""Outperform"" with a target price of $36 per share, representing an upside potential of 36% from Monday's closing price of $26.34.Why Is It Happening?Now, let us tell you the investor-enticing story of why one should see SHOP as a highly positive prospect for the long term.Shopify started its operations in 2004 with a problem-solving approach and launched its e-commerce platform in 2006, which soon rose to acclaim with its convenient scaling-up ability. The brilliance of the platform allowed it to integrate seamlessly with other systems through APIs. Soon, third-party apps were launched on App Store that could connect with Shopify's online stores and they made a significant impact.This stirred the minds behind Shopify, and it regressed back to its basic problem-solving approach, which aided it to devise a strategy to launch its own mobile app. The Shopify app was then rolled out in 2010 on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and picked up like a blooming rose, as it diversified the scope of the platform and brought mobility of use. The reason behind it was that the merchants and POS sellers had an unparalleled access to their online stores, right then and there on their mobiles. It not only enabled them to manage their offerings on the go, but also opened up a parallel channel of convenient selling and managing.From that point onwards, SHOP never looked back. It raised funding (Series C funding) of $100 million in 2013, was listed #3 in Deloitte's Fast 50 in Canada in 2014, and generated $105 million in revenue that year; double the previous year's annual revenues. But wait for the cherry on top; 3QFY 2015 became the best of the rest for SHOP with an amazingly high revenue growth of 93% YoY and GMV growth of 101% YoY. So, in view of this, we forecast 86.4% YoY revenue growth for FY '15.Success Is EarnedThe company's exclusive platform providing unparalleled e-commerce solutions with easy-to-subscribe online stores is its USP, driving the vehicle of growth fast yet steady. Keeping in view the competency of SHOP, we forecast the EBITDA margin to enter the positive territory in FY '16 and stabilize just over 20% in the long term.The company with a hosting of over 120,000 online sellers and merchants has its own Shopify Payments, which works pretty well in its friendly domestic environment and allows sellers to accept credit cards without the hassle of requiring and integrating a third-party payment gateway.Another breakthrough for the company came in when in September 2015 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) web-store closed its operations for sellers and named Shopify as its preferred migration vendor. This added a spin to the cycle of progressive growth, which was already moving in the right direction. GMV grew by over 100%, solidifying the merchant solutions growth with the adoption of payments and SaaS/subscriptions. Along with that, the accelerated MRR is the reflection of the strengthening growth in subscriptions, which is largely due to the company's consolidated offering of an exclusive e-commerce platform, with impressively good management services and highly merchant-friendly UI.The Rosy PictureYou know a company has thought it through when it offers a very distinctive line of offerings, complements it with considerable support services and delivers the promised value. Additionally, SHOP has good brains working to scale up the operations of the platform to accommodate valuable integrations. More importantly, it keeps the experience exceptionally good both for the customers (the merchants and online sellers) and the end-consumers.We see a promising picture for SHOP in the foreseeable future. Our calculations suggest 2016E EV/Sales multiple of 11.2x and 2017E EV/Sales multiple of 7.7x. These might seem overrated as compared to peers, but we believe that premium valuation remains justified as the company not only carries a prospective basket of superior solutions, but also has a huge market potential. The scope and scale of the business can be maximized given that the company aggressively implements the tactics of strategic marketing, especially by enhancing its presence on social media podiums and employing digital marketing techniques. The momentum can take advantage of snowballing and can stream in sturdy revenues. Thus, our predicted growth valuation and impressive long-run buy status for SHOP.Financial ValuationThe following is an excerpt of our financial model for Shopify. All the figures below are given in $ millions except for percentages.Figure 1 Source: Company Data, PVR EstimateThe calculations for WACC are illustrated in the table below:Figure 2 Source: Company Data, PVR EstimatesWith regard to capital structure, the company does not have any debt on its books. By applying the discounted cash flow (NYSE:DCF) valuation method, assuming terminal free cash flow to firm (FCFF) growth of 4% and WACC of 9.92%, the enterprise value turns out to be $3.24 billion.

3964177,97496,2016-04-09T16:06:57-04:00,Shopify is well-situated in a growing industry.Shopify's dominating position in the SMB market could make it a potential acquisition target.Recent correction in the stock price is unwarranted.Shopify's recurring revenue stream and vast ecosystem is a competitive advantage.,"OverviewFounded in 2006, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is a leading Canada-based company that provides cloud-based software for small and medium-sized businesses.Well-Situated in a Growing MarketCurrently, there is an industry-wide shift from retail brick and mortar stores to online shopping, with 236% growth in US e-commerce sales since 2009. As consumers shift their attention online, businesses must therefore react by increasing spending on cloud services and infrastructure, such as website maintenance and renovations. As seen in Exhibit A, worldwide cloud services spending has nearly quadrupled from 2009-2015, a testament to the changing industry.Exhibit ASource: IDCShopify is well-positioned to reap the benefits of the changing industry: It's in the heart of the cloud services business, and as businesses continue to spend, Shopify will continue to grow. In addition, there has been a demographic shift to mobile commerce, with a 58.2% CAGR since 2010, as pictured in Exhibit B.Exhibit BSource: Barclay's Capital, ""US Internet Trends""In addition, Exhibit C displays the saturation of the social media market by age group.Exhibit CSource: Pew Research CenterThis is extremely important to Shopify: It's well-positioned to take advantage of the shift to mobile e-commerce. Approximately 61% of the traffic and 46% of the orders on the Shopify platform came from mobile devices in December 2015. Shopify is also the first e-commerce provider to add the ability for social media platform selling. Over 25% of Shopify merchants have enabled social media selling - this segment is growing rapidly. Given Shopify's user friendly mobile platform and integration with social media, it's well-positioned to grow along with the changing demographics.Potential Acquisition TargetShopify continues to grow within the SMB market: Gross merchandise volume growing at 105% YoY, revenue growth 97% YoY, and monthly recurring revenue growth of 72%. Shopify's number of users, relative to its competitors, is shown in Exhibit D.Exhibit DShopify is a dominating force in the SMB market. At the enterprise level, Magento is unlikely to move down and compete with Shopify in SMB. In addition, Magento Go was once the leading software in the SMB market, but recently discontinued after being acquired from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) due to losing market share to Shopify. Magento advised its clients to move to the Shopify platform.The thesis is that Shopify's dominating position makes it a compelling acquisition target, and it has. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is making an attempt to aggressively push into cloud services and has assembled a working list of potential acquisition targets, with Shopify as a notable one on that list. In addition, sources close to the matter note that Alphabet admits and warrants a premium valuation for Shopify's spectacular growth, if it were to acquire Shopify.Unwarranted CorrectionShopify has had a massive correction in its valuation, down from a 52-week high of $42.13. While Shopify still trades at a premium, the premium appears warranted, based on superior growth rates, trading at a PEG ratio of merely 1.8. Shopify's multiple has contracted significantly relative to the overall SaaS sector, while it is expected to grow meaningfully faster than the group. Shopify's EV/2016E revenue multiple has contracted nearly 65% to around 4x since the summer, which is more than twice the 30% reduction of the group average, despite my expectation for 48.5% FY16 revenue remaining 114% faster than the 22% average. The correction can be attributed to the tendency of institutional buyers to sell off high multiple names in a broad market downturn.Competitive MoatShopify's recurring revenue type business model - subscription plus fee-based transaction - makes it very appealing. It provides the ability to predict revenue, and enables the company to maximize efficiency and scalability. Shopify is developing a vast ecosystem, including applications, software. Once a business is a merchant and engaged in the ecosystem, it is highly unlikely that business will switch to a different provider. Recurring revenue for Shopify continues to grow, as seen in Exhibit E.Exhibit ERisks1. Multiples: Market RiskGiven the nature of tech growth companies, they are often associated with higher multiples. While these multiples are sometimes warranted, in a market selloff, they often selloff more than the broader market. While this is definitely short-term risk, it should not be considered in conjunction with the long-term prospects for Shopify.2. Regression to the MeanThere is risk that the growth rates will regress to a more normalized rate; however, given the current company structure and catalysts, this seems unlikely, in the near term.CatalystsValuationI performed a discounted cash flow analysis on Shopify. First, I determined Shopify's weighted average cost of capital, WACC, with a cost of debt of 2.25%, equity risk premium of 9% and a risk-free rate of 0.25%. I determined the cost of equity using comparables and company data. Exhibit F, G and H detail my WACC calculations and assumptions, as well as the sensitivity analysis with WACC and terminal FCF growth rate.Exhibit FExhibit GExhibit HFinally, I inputted the WACC into the DCF model to determine an equity value of US$2.8B. This implies upside of roughly 22.13%, with a target price of US$35.11, and a terminal FCF growth rate of 4%. Exhibit I, J and K detail my DCF analysis, including assumptions and forecasts.Exhibit IExhibit JExhibit KAfter conducting an immense amount of due diligence on Shopify, I have determined an implied upside of roughly 22.13%. My research includes a top-down analysis of industry metrics, company-specific analysis on the catalysts that will drive growth, and a quantitative analysis to determine the intrinsic value of the company. Throughout my research, I remained conservative in my estimates for FCF and EBITDA growth moving forward. Shopify's combination of a great position in a growing industry, growing competitive advantage, compelling valuation and characteristics of an acquisition target make it at at these levels a stock with limited downside and great potential for upside."

Its platform gives its clients a single view of their business and customers from a variety of sales channels, including tablet, Web and mobile storefronts, social media storefronts, pop-up shops, and brick-and-mortar storefronts. Their software gives merchants the capability to manage products and inventory, build customer relationships, process orders and payments, and utilize analytics and reporting.The company went public on May 21, and the market valued it at $1.27 billion. The interface gives SMEs the capability to easily and quickly launch a fully functional, branded e-commerce site, usually in days rather than weeks or months. Its pro-edition costs only $79 per month.In June, Shopify announced deals that would allow its merchants to sell products on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Pinterest through their new buy button features. In addition, Shopify announced in September that it had been selected as the preferred migration provider for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Webstore merchants. Adding to its prospects, Shopify also reported a partnership with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), giving its merchants the opportunity to sell products across the popular social media site.Shopify makes approximately $600 in gross profit annually from each merchant account. The company notes that the cost of acquiring a new merchant through sales and marketing averages around $1,000, making the break-even point over 12 months.As of March 2015, the company had 162,261 merchants from approximately 150 countries subscribed to their cloud services. The represents a 68.2 percent increase over the same period in 2014. Last year, Shopify processed $3.8 billion in gross merchandise volume, and its platform can handle 10,000 requests per second.The company used the net proceeds of the IPO for general corporate purposes.Formerly known as Jaded Pixel Technologies, Shopify changed its name in November 2011. It has approximately 630 employees, and it is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada.Management Team With Strong Track RecordsCEO Tobias Lutke co-founded Shopify in September 2004.

3209276,70065,2015-05-25T11:01:20-04:00,"Shopify currently has 162,261 merchants using its software with annual revenue per merchant of approximately $1,000.This equates to market share of 1.6% of the total addressable market described in its prospectus.It is challenging to estimate how large Shopify's market share can become, so scenarios are helpful.Risk appears to be skewed to the upside with my target price at $36.","Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) claims that there are ""10 million merchants with less than 500 employees operating in our key geographies,"" according to its recent F-1 Filing.If we are to take this as its total addressable market ""TAM,"" then we can do some quick scenarios to see how big the company might actually get.Shopify currently has 162,261 merchants using its software with annual revenue per merchant of approximately $1,000. This equates to market share of 1.6% of the TAM.If we extrapolate the number of subscribers based on Shopify's total potential market share, we can arrive at some interesting insights on valuation.Scenario AIf Shopify were able to obtain a 20% share of the market compared to its current 1.6%, the below spreadsheet shows what its revenue might look like.If we make some favourable assumptions such as TAM growth of 5% per year, revenue per merchant growth of 5% per year, and total market share of 20% by 2023, Shopify would have revenue of $4.6 billion. This implies a value for Shopify that is greater than its current market cap of approximately $2 billion.Scenario BIf, however, we make some more conservative assumptions about Shopify's growth trajectory and market share potential, we may arrive at a different conclusion. If Shopify tops out at 10% market share (an increase of over 500% from its current market share), then revenue would be about $1.2 billion in 2019. In my view, this puts Shopify closer to fair value at its current ~$2 billion market cap.Scenario CIf we conduct a downside scenario with growth capping at 5% market share (an increase of over 200% from its current market share), then there could be some significant downside in the company's share price.In this scenario, we see revenue reaching about $800 million by 2020, which implies the stock is significantly overvalued today.Scenario DLastly, in a blue sky scenario, we can see how if Shopify can capture up to 1/3 or 33.33% of its TAM it could easily have revenue in excess of $8 billion by 2025, implying a significantly higher share price than it's trading at today.On balance, if we take these three scenarios and apply a probability weighting to each of them, we can arrive at an estimate of value. The probabilities are based on Shopify's historical growth trajectory and the likelihood of it changing significantly.In each of the above scenarios, I estimate the following net present value of the company, assuming the company is cash flow positive by 2019, and has a normalized free cash flow margin of 15% in the long term. Below are the NPVs at a 12% discount rate.This results in an expected value of $2.7 billion, and with 74 million shares outstanding, equates to a target price of $36/share.The point of this exercise is not to create goal posts that are wide enough to drive a truck through. It is to point out that valuing Shopify requires an enormous bet on its growth rate and the market share it can achieve. Based on the stock's trading post-IPO, the market appears to be pricing in at least 1,000,000 merchants on Shopify by 2018, or ~8% market share.All eyes will be on topline growth over the coming quarters as investors place their bets."

It can be a hard stock to value at current levels because it has been trading for just under a year with no true P/E and its true potential may be unrealized as the stock has dropped nearly -23% since going public last May. Shopify is a company that allows digital retailers to launch their own high quality e-commerce site through an intuitive easy to use interface. There are tons of small businesses that are looking to get a professional website to sell their goods. Shopify currently has over 200,000 businesses supported by its platform that helped them sell over $12 billion worth of merchandise. Shopify could be a huge bargain right now considering its growth potential.Beat down IPO has huge growth potentialLike most Canadian stocks in 2015, Shopify was oversold and declined 23% lower than its IPO price. Shopify actually beat analyst expectations in the last earnings report but still sold off along with the majority of the market. Shopify currently specializes in creating a platform for small businesses to sell their goods online. Where the growth is coming from is in looking to target larger businesses with their ""Shopify Plus"" subscription. Once it can lock these businesses in, then they will be collecting subscription fees which will generate a huge cash flow that will make Shopify a large dividend payer once its growth is capped many years down the road. Shopify has had great reviews from its consumers and is looking to make their platform even better going forward with features such as POS (point of sale) transactions which will increase business efficiency and revenue. By constantly improving the platform and adding new features, Shopify puts itself ahead of the curve by being able to attract and keep existing business. At current levels, Shopify is tough to value as it has been posting negative earnings, it is important to note that this is a profitable company but right now R&D is cutting into a huge chunk of their gross profit. The P/B is 8.9 which is expensive when compared to the industry average of 4.9. There is no P/E on the stock due to negative earnings and investors may want to wait until Shopify can prove that they can generate a continuous stream of increased earnings.The risk: Tough competition and quite expensive although lower than its IPO priceBigCommerce, GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) and Volusion are three other big players in the field and Shopify faces tough competition from these firms. There is no stopping a business owner from switching between any one of these and the true market leader will have the best platform at a competitive price. Shopify looks pretty expensive at current levels with a forward P/E of 774.9, P/S of 9.0 and P/CF of 100.6. Shopify expects $200 million in revenue in fiscal 2015 while its market cap is $1.74 billion, that's a profit margin of just 11.5% which would theoretically give the stock a trailing P/E near 100. If you're a young Canadian investor looking to add some aggressive growth stocks to your portfolio, this may be it as the growth may be gigantic over the next few years. However, at the current price I would not recommend doing so as I believe the stock will continue to decline going into 2016 as there looks to be no relief in sight for the TSX. You may be able to get a better entry point when the TSX isn't bleeding billions of dollars of wealth a day in its bear market. Then you may be able to add this growth prospect to your portfolio."

It will be just the second time SHOP has had an earnings report since its IPO in May. After its first earnings report, SHOP's stock price went up 12% in one day, thanks in large part to much better-than-expected revenues. For Q2, SHOP beat its revenue projection by a whopping 18%.Before that Q2 report, revenues were projected to grow 61% year over year, which would have been a significant deceleration from the 90+ percent revenue growth SHOP had seen in previous quarters. In fact, the company reported 90% revenue growth. We're seeing a somewhat similar situation heading into Q3 earnings, with analysts (following company guidance) projecting 74% revenue growth. Looking ahead to Q4, the deceleration is even more pronounced, with SHOP expected to have just 50% revenue growth over the holiday quarter.Social data suggests that SHOP might again beat expectations. According to TickerTags, tweet volume for the ""shopify"" tag is up more than 100% in July, August, and September 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. In terms of raw numbers, that's roughly 100K tweets in 2015 versus around 46K tweets in 2014:That big spike in May 2015 was caused by SHOP's IPO. Setting aside that week, SHOP's recent tweet volume peaked in September and early October.Of course, that doesn't mean the company absolutely will beat expectations. some of that tweet volume undoubtedly was connected to financial news (including reports of deals with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)), and that news is almost certainly priced into SHOP's stock already. And Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) provides a cautionary tale about companies with recent IPOs: it had a strong earnings report yesterday, but its stock is down significantly today.So by no means should an investor rely on this Twitter data alone in making a decision about whether to invest in SHOP. But the data suggests that SHOP might very well beat expectations, which could drive the price of the stock higher in the short term."

3661166,24963,2015-11-08T00:23:46-05:00,"Shopify is on a tear; On a year-over-year basis the Company reported Q3 2015 revenue growth of 93%.
        Recent partnership announcements with Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Amazon, UBER and others could prove very lucrative in the long-run given the market for social commerce is so massive.
        In my opinion the company's shares are wildly overvalued (dividing Shopify’s $2.18B enterprise valuation by $81.23M of recurring revenue implies a 26.8x valuation multiple).
        Although I’m critical of the company’s current valuation, you may be surprised to hear that I am one of the 200,000+ merchants using its product.","In Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) Q3 2015 earnings report, the Company told us that 56.1% ($29.6M/$52.8M) of its revenue comes from 'Subscription Solutions' (a.k.a. Software-as-a-Service) and the balance 43.9% ($29.6M/$52.8M) from 'Merchant Solutions'. Why is this important?Having recently represented a seller of an Inc. 500 Fastest Growing in the sale of its SaaS business, I know from negotiating valuation with sophisticated strategic and financial buyers (e.g. private equity groups) that investors won't pay a premium SaaS valuation for any revenue that: (1) Isn't Software-as-a-Service, or (2) Has a low customer retention rate. In the case of Shopify 43.9% of the Company's revenue isn't recurring, and its customer retention rate (reported at over 100.0%) was calculated in a non-traditional manner that in my opinion significantly overstates retention.Why I think Shopify stock could drop 40%In Buy or Sell Shopify? What You Need To Know About Amazon's Favorite Ecommerce Firm I stated that over a sample of 38 public Software-as-a-Service companies, enterprise value / revenue valuation multiples ranged between 2.0x and 28.9x, with a median of 6.8x and mean of 8.0x. If we counted all of Shopify's revenue as recurring (what I believe the market is doing right now) the Company shares currently trade at 15.1x revenue. However only $81.23M ($144.8M * 56.1%) is recurring.Dividing Shopify's $2.18B enterprise valuation by $81.23M of recurring revenue implies a 26.8x valuation multiple. That's ridiculously high to me in light of the fact that merchant retention is 'consistent with what we would associate with early stage businesses' (page 55 of Form F-1).Of course there is value in the low margin Merchant Solutions (Merchant Payment) business, but overall Shopify loses money and the merchant payment business is wildly competitive so I'm not inclined to assign a nose bleed valuation to that segment of the business.101.0% customer retention rate 'may be calculated in a manner different than (that) used by other companies'(Financial table presented in F-1 Filing)(As described in Form 6-K)Key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions include Monthly Recurring Revenue and Gross Merchandise Volume. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies. We calculate Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, at the end of each period by multiplying the number of merchants who have subscription plans with us at the period end date by the average monthly subscription plan fee revenue in effect on the last day of that period, assuming they maintain their subscription plans the following month. MRR allows us to average our various pricing plans and billing periods into a single, consistent number that we can track over time. We also analyze the factors that make up MRR, specifically the number of paying merchants using our platform and changes in our average revenue earned from subscription plan fees per paying merchant. In addition, we use MRR to forecast and predict monthly, quarterly and annual subscription solutions revenue. We had $ 9.8 million of MRR as at September 30, 2015 .The Big PictureAlthough I'm critical of the company's valuation, you may be surprised to hear that I am one of the 200,000+ merchants using its product (See ShoppablePics.com). In my experience a key point of differentiation that I've found is that merchants are able to sell products through Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. Given the market for social commerce is so massive (FB has 1.5 billion monthly active, Instagram and Twitter are in the 300 million monthly active range) it's likely that Shopify will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and ultimately become profitable. Until that happens though I would be a seller and not buyer of the stock."

The company went public in May, 2015 with $25.68 stock price. At the moment of writing the article, the stock price was at the level of $35.66 (+40%) and showed a good performance within several months from IPO. Is there any potential left in this stock? What's the fair value of the company?Operating metricsShopify is a B2B solution, therefore I analyze several important operating metrics that reflects the business effectiveness. These operating metrics are the following:Number of Shopify's merchants is growing: 41k in 2012 vs. 145k in 2014 (+251%). However, the growth rate is falling down, but that's the result of low base. I assume that by the end of this year the company will be able to achieve around 226k of merchants in a system.Average revenue per account grew up by around 1% in 2014 after 2% reduction in 2013; it means that ARPA is kind of stable measure. However, in a process of business growing I assume that the ARPA will be growing around 1% each year.(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)As soon as we have the number of clients and marketing expenses, we can check the dynamic of marketing expenses per one new client. Shopify had 38% increase in expenses per one new client in 2014, however the company achieved the decrease of marketing expenses percentage as of revenue - from 47% in 2013 to 44% in 2014. According to the first quarter results, the company increased the marketing expenses per one new client by less than 1% and I assume that it is going to keep this trend in 2015 and 2016. However, when this market will be more competitive it will be very difficult to the company attract new clients with low marketing budgets. Therefore, I think that after 2016 Shopify will increase the marketing expenses per client by 5-7%.(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)Financials and valuationTo sum up, I made the following assumptions in order to evaluate the fair stock price:As a result of these estimations, Shopify is able to achieve the positive $11M EBITDA in 2017.(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)The valuation process for such platform is also very challenging, because it's very difficult to choose the most applicable multiple. If we check the stats of the closest competitors - Demandware (NYSE:DWRE), Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO), HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) - all the companies are traded around 7x-11x Revenue. I have tried to keep the range 5x-10x for the Shopify and got the following results as the output of my financial model:(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)OpinionI issue a strong BUY recommendation and I think that Shopify has a great potential due to matching the enormous increase in customer base and decrease of the costs (marketing, product development etc.). Long-term target stock price is around $41-$44.Note: if you are disagree with my assumptions, you can move the control buttons in my financial model."

The IPO is attracting significant investor interest as the IPO price rose from the prospectus range of $12-$14 per share to $17 per share. In initial coverage, the business outlook and current performance looked very favorable for investment. However, at the current $17 IPO price target, the resulting market valuation would be $1.3 billion - a drastic valuation for a still relatively new and small start-up. Investors should proceed with caution being aware of the very drastic valuation and the fact that excitement is sometimes short lived for the next hot tech IPO.Financial PerformanceShopify has produced stunning growth in a quickly emerging and rapidly developing market. The company services small- and mid-sized businesses with payment solutions and commerce platforms for both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce models. The company's most notable performance is the fact that it has more than quadrupled revenue over the past 2 years. The company finished 2014 with $105 million in revenue, and posted $37 million for the first quarter of 2015. On a simplified annualized basis, Q1 2015 represents $149 million in revenue assuming. Q1 2014 made up approximately 17% of full year 2014 revenue. The same relationship in 2015 would imply annualized revenues as high as $218 million.Source: Shopify F-1The big concern with Shopify's current financial performance is profits. The company has continued to post widening operating losses. The company's operating margin grew from -6.4% in 2012 to -8.5% in 2013 and jumped to -20.6% in 2014. The increasing costs are mostly due to significant spending in sales and marketing. The sustainability of current growth rates may come at significant operating costs. The company posted a net loss of $22 million in 2014.CompsThe market for e-commerce and payment solutions is quickly growing. On Shopify's own website, the company lists 19 different alternatives to its business. Competitors range from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Webstores to GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) to well-funded and highly backed Bigcommerce. Shopify's solution is arguably one of most comprehensive solutions that gives businesses some of the best control over their brand and positioning. The highly fragmented market will likely compete for various niches until one solution emerges as the clear leader or unbeatable price.Source: Google FinanceComparing Shopify's IPO to other mid-size e-commerce companies reveals the loftiness of its valuation. GoDaddy made its IPO earlier in 2015 to much excitement and has experienced success since and did not command the same valuation as Shopify. Based on Shopify's IPO price and annualized 2015 revenues, it is valued between 6-8.7x sales. Comparable peers average 4.7x sales, with VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) commanding the highest valuation at 7.4x price-to-sales. Most companies in the industry also do not post positive earnings, and therefore do not trade at any PE ratio. Investors should be aware of the overall risk and performance of the industry and the aggressiveness of Shopify's valuation.SummaryShopify is a leader in a fast-growing industry. The company has huge upside potential, but it looks like IPO investors will pay a lofty premium. With significant competition it is unclear who will emerge as the dominant force, and it may remain uncertain for some time. Investors that decide to buy Shopify should be cognizant of the aggressive valuation and risks and closely monitor the company's performance."

However, the volume of GMV processed through the platform is an indicator of the success of merchants and the strength of the platform.SeasonalitySHOPs merchant solutions revenues are directionally correlated with the level of GMV (gross merchant volumes) that merchants process through the platform.Merchants historically have processed additional GMV during the holiday season. As a result, SHOP has historically generated higher merchant solutions revenues in the fourth quarter than in other quarters.Single viewThe Shopify platform provides merchants with a single view of their business and customers across all of their sales channels and enables them to manage products and inventory, process orders and payments, build customer relationships and leverage analytics and reporting.Merchants can also use Shopify Mobile, SHOP's iPhone and Android application, to manage their business on the go.Technology and the internet are transforming commerceConsumers now expect to be able to transact anywhere, anytime on any device and the experience needs to be simple, seamless and secure. Consumers quickly become accustomed to the standards set by the largest and most innovative merchants and expect a comparable experience with all merchants, even those that have only been in business for one day.Without the latest technology, it is difficult for merchants to meet the rising demands of consumers.PlatformSHOP built its platform from the ground up to address the growing challenges facing merchants with the aim of making previously complex tasks simple.The Shopify platform has been engineered to enterprise-level standards and functionality while being designed for simplicity and ease-of-use. SHOP's platform provides merchants with an intuitive user experience that requires no up-front training to implement and use, enabling merchants to set up their shops in less than 15 minutes.SHOP helps its merchants own their brand and make the consumer experience memorable.SHOP believes the Shopify platform is mission critical for all of its merchants and they depend on SHOP for the latest technology.Manages large spikes in trafficSHOP's platform is able to manage large spikes in traffic that accompany events such as new product releases, holiday shopping seasons and flash sales, and has been benchmarked to process at least 10,000 requests per second based on results from platform load testing.SHOP is constantly innovating and enhancing its platform. SHOP's continuously deployed, multi-tenant architecture ensures that all of its merchants are always using the latest technology.EcosystemA rich ecosystem of app developers, theme designers and other partners has evolved around the Shopify platform.The platform's functionality is highly extensible and can be expanded through SHOP's application program interface, or API, and the over 900 apps available in the Shopify App Store.This ecosystem helps drive the growth of SHOP's merchant base, which in turn further accelerates growth of the ecosystem.Intellectual propertySHOP has been issued trademark registrations in the United States and Canada covering the trademarks ""A shop in minutes, a business for life,"" ""S & Design"" ""S Shopify & Design,"" and ""Shopify.""SHOP has been issued trademark registrations in the European Union covering the trademark ""S & Design"" and in Australia covering the trademark ""Shopify"".

3233016,25120,2015-06-04T10:30:14-04:00,"Shopify underwent a successful public offering last week.The company's marketplace is gaining real traction with SMEs, as losses are narrowing rapidly.While the business looks very promising and is set to grow in the foreseeable future, a high valuation is already pricing in a lot of good news.I am cautious at current levels because a lot of growth is required to justify the current valuation, creating very little appeal in terms of risks and potential rewards.","Investors in Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) have been very pleased with the public offering of the marketplace firm. The company's solutions are in great demand with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in North America and Europe. This results in spectacular growth as losses are narrowing already.While this looks promising, shares have doubled from the midpoint of the preliminary offering range which has raised expectations to very high levels. While I cannot rule out that Shopify will live upto these expectations I refrain from investing given the very elevated risks of the company.A Business Serving SMEsShopify is aiding small and medium businesses with its software platform which allows these companies to run their business online.Consumers expect to be able to make online transactions in a simple and secure way. This requires quite some large technology and software investments which small and medium sized businesses simply can not afford. For that reason, Shopify offers its software for mobile, tablets and even social media formats in a convenient package.With the software, business owners can offer a consistent experience to customers across different channels, while having insight in one view. The company claims that the software is so simple and intuitive that users can start using the applications within just 15 minutes. Besides the simple platform, Shopify has an ecosystem with over 900 apps while users can extend the platform with the API as well. I am not a user of the service myself, yet the demos look quite nice if you ask me.The Current Business And PotentialAt the end of the first quarter, Shopify had just over 162,000 merchants on its platform, a 68% increase on an annual basis. Shopify's software and marketplace solutions allow users to make some decent money. Gross merchandise volumes which have been enabled by the platform grew by 133% to $3.8 billion in 2014. Growth slowed down to a still very healthy 108% in the first quarter, with merchandise volumes coming in at $1.3 billion.This implies that each user generates average merchandise volumes of $8,000 per quarter. With these annualized sales of $32k it is understandable that small internet merchants can not buy expensive software. That does not imply that Shopify provides its services for very cheap prices. Average annualized revenues per user come in around $1,000 per year. This is equivalent to 3% of the average revenues per merchant although it allows for easy transactions, scalability, online payment solutions, etc.Shopify hopes to expand its services to both existing and new customers. The 162k merchants using the service sounds like a huge number, as Shopify stresses that it has some 10 million SMEs as potential customers in its targeted geographical areas.Valuation Is Demanding After IPO RunThe Canadian-based business sold nearly 9 million shares in the IPO which included the over-allotment option. The offering price of $17 per share looked favorable compared to the preliminary $12-$14 guidance. After the offering, Shopify has roughly 75 million shares outstanding which trade at $27 per share after the successful debt.At around $27 per share, Shopify is valued at $2.0 billion. It must be said that Shopify will operate wit have net cash load of roughly $200 million following the offering, translating into an enterprise valuation of roughly $1.8 billion.At the current price level, the enterprise valuation of the company has more than doubled compared to the initial preliminary offering guidance, especially when considering the relative high net cash position. This just illustrates that expectations of investors in the technology sector are rather high at the moment.The business generated sales of $105 million in 2014 which marked a 109% increase compared to the year before. Net losses nearly five-folded to $22.3 million. First quarter revenues in 2015 rose by nearly 99% to $37.3 million while the net loss narrowed by nearly 30% to $4.5 million. In recent quarters Shopify has been making real progress at limiting the losses, which is a promising sign.Based on the annualized sales for the first quarter, the enterprise valuation comes in at around 12 times sales. While this is a high multiple, these sales are still growing at roughly 100%. The real question is how profitable the business really can become, and how quickly it can do it.Final ThoughtsShopify is creating a strong niche position in the market for small and medium-sized internet-based businesses. The trouble is that the company is facing a long-term threat, in my opinion. I see the internet as a ""winner takes it all"" market, although there will, of course, always be room for a rather large niche market.By now the company's solutions allow for gross merchandise volume of more than $5 billion on an annualized basis. If the company can potentially service 500,000 customers 5 years down the road, with each of those customers generating merchandise volumes of $100k, merchandise volumes could hit $50 billion. With a 2% take rate, Shopify could potentially post sales of a billion by 2020 in a very favorable scenario.If the company could deliver on 20-30% operating margins, net profits could come in at $130 to $200 million. Such a rosy picture could, of course, easily justify the current valuation -- and quite a bit more.The trouble is that this scenario is rather unlikely, as it requires the continuation of the current steep revenue curve for a long period of time. Potential intensified competition from other platforms can be expected, given the relative high fees per customer. Other players will be keen to monetize these potential revenue streams as well.As a result, the risks to this investment relate more to the valuation and the business model rather than the current losses. The reported losses are narrowing quickly and Shopify has raised quite a lot of cash. As a result, investors do run real risks related to valuation multiple compression and potential intensified competition.While investors can double their money by 2020 if merchandise sales increase to $50 billion, Shopify has a lot to provide before investors stand to make some decent money as well. As a result the risks exceed the potential rewards by a large degree, making me very cautious.That said, the balance sheet is very strong, and Shopify continues to grow at a very quick pace, at least for now. As a result I will keep an eye on the developments in the coming quarters although I am not contemplating initiating a position at current levels."

In the first quarter, GMV increased 107.8% to $1.3 billion. Total revenue for Shopify increased $111.9% to $105.0 million in 2014. First quarter revenue increased 98.5% to $37.3 million.Here is a better breakdown of revenue for 2014 and the first quarter of 2015:As you can see from the chart, the company is seeing explosive growth on both a yearly and quarter over quarter basis. The growth is also coming from both subscription revenue and merchant revenue. Merchant services could also be a sign of what is still to come as the program launched in August of 2013 and is still rolling out to different regions.For its Shopify Payments, the company offers merchant solutions that include payment processing and the ability to accept credit cards online and offline for its customers. For this service, Shopify gets transaction fees, referral fees, and payment processing fees. This business segment grew to $38.4 million in 2014, up front $11.9 million in 2013 and $4.5 million in 2012.As of March 31st, Shopify provides its services to 162,261 merchants in 150 countries. This represented growth of 68.2% from the prior year. Despite the strong user growth, the company believes it has a vast untapped market that could show further growth in the future. AMI Partners projects there are 10 million merchants with less than 500 employees in Shopify's key geographic reach. Shopify has customers in key markets in the United State, Canada, United Kingdom, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2014, 69% of revenue came from the United States merchants.Shopify lists the following as its growth strategies going forward:· Grow our base of merchants· Grow our merchants' revenue· Continuous innovation and expansion of our platform· Continue to grow and develop our ecosystem· Continue to expand our partner programs· Continue to build for the long-termListed in the long-term plans are international expansion, strategic partnerships, and selective acquisitions.Now Shopify is a wonderful company and I think worth an investment at the projected $1 billion valuation. However, I think shares could price above range and see a sharp increase in their opening trading value, which could lead to overvaluation.Rival Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) recently hit the public markets. After pricing at $16 a share, the company saw shares skyrocket to $35.74 on their opening day. That is the highest shares have traded, as they have fallen back down to the $20 level since that time. Despite the decline, Etsy still has a valuation of $2.3 billion on the public market. Etsy also offers small businesses e-tailing solutions. The biggest difference is Etsy operates more like Ebay where users create stores and then get some of their sales from the Etsy platform and large user base of the company. Shopify is more like a Godaddy or other website company that helps you build a site or platform, but then relies on you to do the work and get customers.Another competitor to watch out for is Big Commerce. The company counts 60,000 vendors as customers. That number is around half of Shopify's base, but is coming from a company quite a bit newer to the market than Shopify. Also consider that Big Commerce just completed a $50 million funding round with the backing of American Express and Softbank. Big Commerce has partnerships with Alibaba, NCR, Lightspeed, and Poynt. It appears Big Commerce could be the newest hot growth company in the industry and could be taking some of that potential market away from Shopify. Big Commerce also made a decent acquisition for the market, which could help it lure more customers.So what's the conclusion on buying Shopify shares in their debut? I love Shopify shares in the $12 to $14 range, as it values the company at around $1 billion. However, once we get closer to the $20 level I think shares will hit, the company becomes less attractive and perhaps overvalued. Competition is fierce in the market and companies struggle to make a profit, despite the high growth in revenue. Shareholders of Etsy have already put the company on notice that it wasn't worth the $3.5 billion it once was valued at.According to the last round of funding for Big Commerce, there are seven to ten million retailers that still have no online presence. It will take years to get all of them up to speed with e-commerce stores. This growth could be split among several companies, making Shopify one of many companies to benefit. So remember when buying shares of Shopify, that the triple digit revenue increases won't be around forever, and the competition is continuing to pop up in the market."
3193236,88266,2015-05-18T16:48:34-04:00,The Shopify IPO allows investors to gain a return from the strong growth of e-commerce.The company has many untapped markets left.The shares offer high potential returns if management can continue strong growth and eventually turn a profit.,"After reviewing Shopify's (NYSE:SHOP) FORM F-1 extensively, I have summarized all the main points and reviewed the company, its risks, competitors, share price and the current state of the e-commerce industry in this article. As a previous user of Shopify myself when launching my e-commerce business, I can speak to its solid platform, ease of use and outstanding customer support.OverviewShopify is Canada's first internet startup since the dot com crash to reach a billion-dollar valuation, and one of only 39 firms created in the US and Canada since 2003 to reach a billion-dollar valuation. It is a cloud-based commerce platform that allows brands to run their business across all sales channels from their websites to brick-and-mortar stores. The platform allows brands to manage their products and inventory, and process payments and orders. Shopify allows brands to handle spikes and dips in sales from their websites with ease, and is used by over 160,000 stores in 150 countries by brands from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Wikipedia, WWF to mom-and-pop stores.BusinessFig. 1: Shopify's growthFig. 2: Shopify's growth in merchants and merchant salesShopify has, on average, almost doubled its merchant base every year for the past 3 years, and more than doubled merchant revenue every single year for the past 3 years. The company has stated that it has identified over 46 million merchants worldwide with less than 500 employees, which it sees as its target market. This leaves significant growth potential ahead for Shopify from its current 160,000 customers, even if it were to only capture a small percentage of this overall market.Fig. 3: Shopify's financial statementShopify breaks down its revenue into Subscription Services and Merchant Solutions, which I describe in more detail below. Total revenues from Subscription Services and Merchant Solutions have grown by over 100% every year for the past 3 years. That trend looks set to continue for 2015, when looking at the 3 months ended March 31 revenue for 2014 and 2015, which show slightly under 100% growth.Merchant Solutions revenue growth has been outpacing overall revenue growth at Shopify, and it looks like that is set to continue, when looking at the 3 months ended March 31, 2015 compared to a year ago. It is also promising to see that during the same time frame, Shopify has significantly reduced losses compared to a year ago.Fig. 4: Shopify's revenue by regionShopify derives 84% of its revenues from Canada, USA and the UK. This is a weakness, but also an opportunity for the company. Canada, USA and the UK make up only 36% percent of e-commerce sales in the top 10 e-commerce markets, and there lies significant opportunity ahead for Shopify if the company can tap into the size and growth of other markets.Shopify is in a unique position in that it can monetize and capture all e-commerce growth without being focused on any particular segment and the risks that would bring. The company has stated that no customer represented 1% or more of its revenues in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Shopify has strong customer loyalty, and works with its 160,000+ stores to build their brands through free tools, guides, video content, books and a blog. By ensuring the success of its customers, the company also ensures its own success by creating customers who will upgrade to more expensive plans and process many more payments and orders. Shopify's employees own 20% of the company, and are encouraged to act like owners and help build long-term value for the company.The E-Commerce IndustryFig 5: E-Commerce growth by year worldwideThe e-commerce industry has seen spectacular growth worldwide in the past few years, and it looks like that trend is set to continue, which augurs well for Shopify.Fig 6: E-Commerce sales as percent of total sales of top 10 e-commerce marketsAnalyzing the above data shows the potential for Shopify to grow. 84% of the company's revenue comes from just 36% of the top 10 e-commerce markets (Canada, USA and the UK).On top of that, the markets with the most e-commerce potential are the following (all countries Shopify currently has little presence in):RisksShopify outlined many potential risks in its F-1 filing, and I go over the ones that I believe are the most likely to occur out of all of them:CompetitionShopify's main competitors are Bigcommerce, Magento and WooCommerce. I did a quick search using Google Trends to get a rough idea of how they stack up.Fig 7: Google Trends data for Shopify's biggest competitorsBigcommerce:Bigcommerce boasts that it has 90,000+ stores, compared to 160,000+ at Shopify. Google Trends, however, shows fairly consistent use of Bigcommerce worldwide for the past 2 years, while Shopify has seen a steady increase. I did a Google search for ""Bigcommerce VS Shopify"" and read the top 5 articles that did a comparison of both platforms. 3 of the 5 articles swayed towards Shopify as their preferred platform, while 2 articles maintained a neutral view.Magento:Magento has 240,000+ stores, compared to 160,000+ at Shopify. Magento boasts that Vizio, Olympus, Rosetta Stone and Nespresso are some of its customers. Google Trends shows it as the clear winner for the past 2 years; however, it looks like that has begun to change recently. I did a Google search for ""Magento VS Shopify"" and read the top 5 articles (excluding the one written by Shopify) that compared both platforms. One article picked Magento as the winner, while 4 preferred Shopify.WooCommerce:WooCommerce has 663,153 websites using its platform, compared to 160,000+ at Shopify. Google Trends shows it steadily increasing at an almost identical rate to Shopify. I did a Google search for ""WooCommerce VS Shopify"" and read the top 5 articles (again, excluding the one written by Shopify) that compared both platforms. One article picked Shopify as the winner, 1 picked WooCommerce and the other 3 remained fairly neutral overall. WooCommerce appears to be widely used by small brands, and does not boast of any large names using its platform.Shopify will gain user growth by being the platform of choice when business owners perform the Google searches I did, when looking for a platform to host their store on. While Shopify was the clear winner against Bigcommerce and Magento, it will need to up its game against WooCommerce if it wants to be the best hands down. However, with e-commerce growth at 17.7% this year, followed by 15.9% next year, opportunities will abound for Shopify and WooCommerce to see significant growth in the years ahead without having to be at each other's throats.Share ValueFig. 8: Shopify's change in share valueShopify has gone from a fair value of $0.36 per share in 2012 to $10.72 today. To get a very rough idea of what it should be worth on the market, I looked for companies with similar revenues and similar revenue growth, while being slightly unprofitable. I opened up Finviz and did a screening with the requirements of the stocks having a market cap under $10 billion, being in the technology sector, sales growth of over 30% and insider ownership over 10%. I got back a list of companies and found two that most resembled Shopify. The companies were HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) and Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), on which I go into a little more detail below:HubSpotPaycomShopify has over double the revenue growth of both HubSpot and Paycom, but showed and slightly lower revenues for 2014; however, in 2015, it should see revenue exceed both these companies. By taking the median revenue multiple of HubSpot and Paycom and multiplying it by Shopify's 2014 revenue of $105 million, we get a $1.445 billion market cap. Based on shares at $15 giving a $1 billion market cap, this would give a rough value of $21.67 for its shares currently, and $43.20 this time next year if the company can double revenue once again this year and market conditions don't change. This may change, however, if Shopify management chooses to pursue a secondary offering down the road and original shareholders' shares get diluted.SummaryI think Shopify is a fantastic play to benefit from the mass switchover to e-commerce. Unlike investing in specific e-commerce, like an investment in Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) would bring, investing in Shopify allows you to capture the overall e-commerce growth without needing to worry about certain industry fluctuations. The company's lead in the marketplace, consistent strong growth year-over-year in revenues and users, e-commerce growth worldwide, and the employees' stake in the success of the company make me very bullish on this IPO over the next few years. The main risks, however, remain the company's ability to turn a profit going forward, its ability to manage growth effectively and potential competition."
3089296,61281,2015-04-22T06:34:10-04:00,"Commerce services provider Shopify filed for IPO last week to raise $100M in a valuation of $1B.Shopify offers a combination of commerce and SaaS solutions, and investors should consider comparable peers in each market, such as Wix and Etsy.In case actual IPO valuation goes through the roof, investors should consider Wix or one of the leading e-commerce platforms as an alternative to Shopify.","Canadian commerce services provider Shopify (Pending:SHOP) filed for an IPO last week, seeking to raise $100M in the NYSE and the TSX. Shopify offers a comprehensive SaaS solution for small and medium-sized merchants to manage their stores across all platforms and channels, either online or in brick-and-mortar locations. These services include e-commerce website creation, payment processing, marketing tools, inventory management tools, in-store transactions support, and more. Shopify presents impressive triple-digit top-line growth year-over-year, coupled with a worsening bottom line and dropping monetization rates of the gross merchandise value sold in its network.Shopify combines the advanced features of an e-commerce platform for the services required to set up and maintain a commerce business either online or in-store. As Shopify is a combination of two businesses, investors considering buying into this IPO should weigh whether it is a better investment than a comparable pure-play e-commerce peer, like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), or whether it's a better investment than an SMB services provider peer, like Wix (NASDAQ:WIX).Shopify BusinessShopify offers a comprehensive solution for merchants to manage their business online. The company generates revenue from two revenue streams: subscription solutions and merchant solutions. The subscription solutions segment includes revenue from services targeted at setting up the merchant's store such as Shopify subscription, domain registration, store themes, and integrated web apps. Subscription packages range between $14 per month for the starter plan, and $179 per month for the unlimited plan. When merchants are interested only in online or offline stores, they receive lower prices. Packages vary in storage space, payment processing rates, and different advanced features. As shown in chart 1 below, the subscription solutions segment accounts for 60% of Shopify's revenues in Q1'15 and grows at a quarterly rate of 15%.The merchant solutions segment includes revenue from services targeted at enabling merchants' online or in-store sales, such as payment processing fees, transaction fees, and point-of-sales hardware sales. Each package has different payment processing rates that range from 2.9%+30c to 2.25%+30c for subscribers who use Shopify Payments in their store. A customer that chooses to use a different payment processing service, such as PayPal, will be charged a transaction fee that varies from 0% to 2%. As shown in chart 1, the merchant solutions segment accounts for 40% of the company's revenues and grows rapidly at a quarterly rate of 32%.Comparable Peer Analysis: EtsyShopify filed for IPO two days before Etsy, the crafts and art marketplace, went public and among the many e-commerce companies listed it is probably the best comparable peer to Shopify. Etsy and Shopify offer similar services for small and medium-sized merchants who can create their online stores using these platforms and receive various supporting services from the platform. Such services include payment processing, inventory management tools, customer relations tools, and in-person point-of-sale support. There are three main differences between Etsy and Shopify:As start-ups, comparison relies greatly on their stage of evolution, it is important to mention that both companies were founded around the same time: Etsy in 2005 in New York and Shopify in 2006 in Ottawa, Canada. Due to the profiles of the companies, they have different GMV potentials: Etsy, which is focused on an e-commerce niche of hand-made crafts and arts, has a lower potential GMV than Shopify, which is focused on general SMB merchants. In 2014, more than $1.9B of merchandise were sold throughout the Etsy network that is half of the merchandise sold throughout Shopify's network ($3.76B). However, as mentioned above, Etsy is able to generate more revenue from every GMV dollar that goes through its platform, mainly because the company charges both payment processing fees and transaction fees from most transactions, while Shopify charges only one of the fees.As shown in Chart 2 below, even though Shopify's GMV was higher in 2013 and 2014, Etsy's revenues are higher in those years, driving the monetization rate to more than 10% out of GMV compared to only 2.8% from Shopify in 2014.Even though Shopify's monetization rates are significantly lower than Etsy and continue to drop, Shopify increases its GMV and revenues at a substantially faster pace than Etsy, as shown in the table above. This trend of revenue year-over-year growth suggests that Shopify will be able to meet Etsy's revenue level soon by more than doubling its annual GMV each year.When comparing Etsy and Shopify, valuation is a highly important factor, and Shopify does not present a significantly more attractive valuation than Etsy. Etsy has a market cap of $2.8B, with an 11.9 P/S ratio, while Shopify is expected to go public at a $1B valuation that represents a P/S ratio of $123M with TTM revenues. However, if Shopify's IPO shared price increases on the first day of trading not by 100%, as in Etsy's case, but ""only"" by 40%, then both companies would have similar price-to-sales ratios and Shopify would have much more attractive growth rates. Investors concerned with the dropping monetization rates should notice that in Q1'15, Shopify already has a monetization rate of 2.79%, which is flat in 2014. However, the first quarter of every year usually presents the lowest quarter-over-quarter increase in the e-commerce business, suggesting that monetization rates will increase throughout the year.Comparable Peer Analysis: WixAs it is clear by now that Shopify is not a regular e-commerce platform but an SMB cloud-based service provider, it may be more appropriate to compare it to another company that sees itself in the same way, Wix. Wix started as a website-building platform and has evolved ever since into a comprehensive SMB services platform, as stated by its CFO in a recent interview. Wix provides SMBs with a cloud-based platform to manage their entire business online and has a unique offering for an e-commerce website under the vertical product WixStores, which includes online store creation, payment processing services, marketing tools, inventory tools, and customer relations tools. In the past, Wix and Shopify partnered to offer a Shopify app within the Wix website builder, which enabled SMBs to create an online store within their Wix site. However, Wix's current e-commerce solution, WixStores, provides a competing product and targets a part of Shopify's audience. WixStores and Shopify have three main differences:Wix has a number of advantages over Shopify: it has lower monthly rates on its e-commerce plans, it does not charge the sellers for the transactions going through the site, and it has no limitation on the number of products offered. However, it lacks the in-store purchasing capabilities, fraud analysis tools, advanced reporting capabilities, and the support in discounts/coupons/gift cards that Shopify has. While Wix uses an e-commerce solution to attract freemium users to upgrade to the premium plans, for Shopify this is the core business. Shopify's customers may pay more for their monthly subscriptions, but they receive a wider package that meets their entire needs and supports any aspect of their store that may justify the higher fee.I see Wix offering fraud analysis tools, reporting tools, and coupons support as it adds software features to their site. However, they lack the e-commerce specializing and in-store solutions that many merchants look for. Therefore, WixStores might suit a beginning merchant with its initial store, but in order to grow its business this merchant needs Shopify's capabilities. In the long run, I do not think Wix is trying to compete with Shopify only to convert those ultra-small merchants to their premium plans, and in that, Wix will probably succeed.On top of Wix's advantages that were mentioned above, it also has a more attractive price-to-sales ratio of 5.5 and an impressive 70% revenue CAGR. However, investors looking to benefit from the boom of e-commerce should not choose Wix, but a more distinct e-commerce player.ConclusionsCommerce service provider Shopify filed for an IPO last week. The SaaS Company presents impressive three-digit growth rates in its top line year-over-year, as well as doubling the GMV each year, but this growth might be stunted by the limitation of its open source software infrastructure. Shopify is a prominent investment alternative for investors looking for a fast-growth company that has both strong SaaS and e-commerce solutions. When comparing a Shopify investment to an investment in Wix+Etsy, Shopify has a more attractive valuation than Etsy and a higher top line growth rate. In Wix's case, its e-commerce solution may attract some ultra-small merchants, but it does not appeal to the bigger merchants.Shopify is a better investment than separate investments in Wix and Etsy. However, in case Shopify's IPO valuation is too high and unattractive, investors should either consider Wix or one of the other leading e-commerce platforms as alternatives."

The competition among providers of ecommerce solutions and platforms is intense. Shopify competes with other similar services that offer businesses the opportunity to create their own online marketplace with tools such as online storefronts, payment processing tools, and apps for checkout terminals.

The universal platform enables both ecommerce and brick-and-mortar transactions through web, social and mobile channels. The omnibus-channel solution not only revolutionizes small-business sales efforts, it also increases and improves customers' purchasing experiences. At the end of the first quarter, the company boasted 162k merchant customers in approximately 150 countries, processing $3.8 billion in Gross Merchandise Value, a year-over-year increase of over 130%. Growth is being fueled by merchant's adoption, end-consumer trends, and small and medium-size online growth. Shopify's growth prospects, profitability, and unique market position should justify a strong valuation, which may leave significant upside potential for early investors.GrowthShopify's success is evident in their steady, rapid growth. Revenue has quadrupled since 2012, growing from $23 million to over $105 million. Using annual trends from 2014, Q1 results indicate that Shopify could be on pace to exceed $200 million this year. Gross profit has also steadily grown, however sales and marketing expenses have ate away at profitability. Significant sales expense for a fast growth start-up should not scare investors, especially given strong retention.Source: Shopify F-1Shopify has prevailed very well in the United States, which makes up just over 2/3 of their revenue. However, the company has deployed very well geographically with a presence in most major markets and significant year-over-year growth. A strong global position and brand will be critical to the company's ongoing success and growth. As consumer trends continue to drive storefront changes as well as ecommerce habits, more businesses will look for solutions like Shopify's.Source: Shopify F-1RetentionKey to Shopify's value proposition is strong customer retention. Past customer cohorts also grow through both underlying gross merchandise sales and adoption of more Shopify services. The story goes like: Shopify finds a small business customer that needs a retail solution, the small business succeeds and expands to ecommerce and now uses Shopify for both channels, and finally that small business adds four new locations. All of the underlying growth in the small business market and good retention propel rapid growth amongst Shopify's platforms.Source: Shopify F-1Key to Shopify's future success will be creating adaptable platforms that can service and adjust to larger businesses' needs. The threat that the company faces is losing customers not because the customers did not like Shopify's services, but because they need new solutions.Debt and CashOne thing that will really excite investors is the limited amount of leverage currently carried by Shopify. The company does have a $25 million revolving note, but no significant short or long-term obligations. The company also boasts very strong cash flows. In 2014, the company used Cash for a large capital investment in plant and equipment expansion and a conversion of cash into higher yielding investment accounts.Source: Shopify F-1The ability to increase leverage will be very lucrative to future prospects. Adding debt in the future can assist with growth and acquisitions. Limited debt also makes fast growing companies excellent candidates for leveraged buyouts and potential acquisition targets. Regardless of the future outcome, this financial position puts a high growth company on track for high market valuations.Source: Shopify F-1SummaryReuters has reported that Shopify could be listed with valuations over $1 billion. This should be easily achievable given that payment processors like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) both trade in excess of 10x sales. Investors should note that the company could be pricing simultaneous offers on both the New York and Toronto stock exchanges. Therefore any offering will not only be diluted, but also needs to be evaluated together for valuation purposes. The company offers great prospects for investors in an emerging segment of the market."

4375467,35401,2020-09-21T10:49:22-04:00,SharpSpring is a fast growing SaaS company.SHSP trades at a low multiple of revenue at 3x.Peer HubSpot trades at 12x revenue and is growing at the same rate.,"SharpSpring (SHSP) is a SaaS software company displaying fast revenue growth trading at a low Enterprise Value / Revenue multiple of 3x on 2021E sales. Its closest competitor is HubSpot (HUBS) that trades at 12x 2021E sales with approximately the same revenue growth rate as SharpSpring. Granted HubSpot has more scale and is making money, but SharpSpring has higher growth potential as a small firm and a clear path to profitability.SharpSpring is a cloud-based marketing technology company. The SharpSpring platform is designed to improve the way that businesses communicate with their prospects and customers to increase sales. The Company's flagship marketing automation platform uses advanced features such as web tracking, lead scoring and automated workflow to help businesses deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. The SharpSpring platform is designed and built as a Software as a Service (or SaaS) offering. The company provides its products on a subscription basis, with additional fees charged if specified volume limits are exceeded by its customers.SharpSpring primarily sells to small to mid-sized digital marketing agencies which then resell its products to their end customers. The company sells 3-packs and 10-packs which allow its digital marketing agency customers to resell to 3 and 10 end customers respectively. SharpSpring is the low-price leader in the industry and its products sell for roughly 1/10 the price of HubSpot or Marketo, another large marketing automation vendor (owned by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)). For a while, SHSP was catching up in terms of functionality as SharpSpring is only 6 years old compared to HubSpot which is 18 years old. At this point, SharpSpring has essentially caught up product-wise and this is confirmed by high third-party ratings of its software. The digital marketing agency market is large with an estimated 100,000 English speaking digital marketing agencies in the world. SharpSpring has about 2,000 of these currently and HubSpot has a similar number, as well. SharpSpring also sells directly to some enterprises with about 500 customers of this type currently.SharpSpring's customers are by and large small businesses, many of which have suffered from the pandemic. The company had a 50% revenue growth target for 2020 coming into the year, but this has declined to 30% due to the COVID-19 situation. Organically, the company should have 20% growth this year, the remaining coming from an acquisition of Perfect Audience in Q4 2019. The Perfect Audience platform is a product and service offering to small businesses for display retargeting. Perfect Audience is designed for rapid deployment and offers customers an easy-to-use interface to implement and optimize campaigns across all major networks and devices.The turmoil in the Small and Medium sized business (""SMB"") segment can be seen in some of SharpSpring's metrics. Net Dollar Retention Rate, which includes churn and upsell, dipped to 92% in the 2nd quarter from a 99% rate last year. New customers added to the platform came in at 276 versus 321 in Q1 and 290 last year. These customers were a little bigger than usual so annualized recurring revenue (""ARR"") did not suffer as much as its retention metrics.HubSpot also serves this market and its revenue growth slowed from 31% in Q1 2020 to 25% in Q2 and is predicted to slow further to 21% in Q3 and 17% in Q4. Analysts forecast revenue growth to be 21% in 2021, very close to the 20% forecast for SharpSpring.So where is SharpSpring on profitability? The company decreased its operating loss last quarter to $900,000 from a loss of $2.5 million in the previous quarter. This was caused by a significant uptick in gross margin to 74% from 66% last quarter and 71% last year. In addition, the company cut costs in sales and marketing (less travel expenses, a common theme in many companies) and in research and development (due to the relative competition of its product capability). SharpSpring believes that a) the gross margin improvement is sustainable and b) they can operate on a leaner model in the future. There is tremendous operating leverage in the business as it has high gross margins, it is growing very fast, and it has fully built out its product set (after 6 years of development).SharpSpring's peer group of SaaS companies trades at much higher multiples than it does. Most SaaS companies trade at 6 - 8x sales and above. As mentioned earlier, HUBS trades at 12x sales. A 12x sales multiple on SharpSpring's 2021 sales of $36 million would imply a $442 million market cap for SHSP or $38 per share, a near quadruple from its current $10.50 share price. At a more pedestrian 8x sales, SHSP would trade at $26 per share, a 150% uplift from current levels. While the company is currently slightly unprofitable today, 20% operating margins in a few years are not out of the question with 20%+ revenue growth, 74% gross margins, and tight operating expense control.A takeover by a larger entity is also a possible outcome. There have been several takeovers in the space, the largest recent one being Adobe's purchase of Marketo. As this category of software has multiple products and facets, it is very difficult for new entrants to get into the space. It would be much easier for a larger entity to make a bite-sized purchase of SharpSpring than to attempt to build a comparable product.What risks are there in this situation? The first is a non-obvious one, as the company is located in Gainesville, Florida, it is difficult to attract seasoned talent. New employees out of the University of Florida are easy to come by, but it is difficult to get a seasoned vet to relocate there. This risk may be tempered by the fact that most people are working from home anyway so it may not be necessary to relocate at all. Second, SharpSpring is a young company with a new customer base which leads to higher churn than a more established group of customers. As time goes by, this will become a smaller issue as well. Finally, SharpSpring sells to the SMB market which is in a tough spot right now. Many small businesses are closing or tightening their belts due to the pandemic. The good thing for SharpSpring is that its software is the engine that drives sales at these companies, and will be one of the last things that go in a cost cutting exercise. Finally, liquidity is currently somewhat of an issue for institutional buyers as SHSP only trades 85,000 shares a day on average. However, if I am right about the rerating of this stock, then liquidity will improve dramatically, perhaps not to the extent of APPS which went from trading 100,000 shares a day at $1.80 to trading 7 million shares a day at $32, but a large increase in its own right."
4372722,35181,2020-09-04T19:57:05-04:00,"Strong performance during the pandemic with Q2 2020 YoY revenue growth of +31.7% while gross profit increased 39%.This company has $15 million in cash and should be ample to tide it through pandemic and recession.The stock is one of the most undervalued on a relative basis.Despite the positive factors, the very negative free cash flow margin of -36% makes investing in this company a difficult proposition.","SharpSpring, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHSP) is a small player in SaaS-based marketing automation tools, allowing customers to nurture potential customers from an early stage of contact until they become qualified sales leads. The company competes against much larger players such as HubSpot (HUBS) and Salesforce.com (CRM).There are several things that I like about SharpSpring, including its performance so far during the pandemic, the improved gross margin, and its very low stock valuation. The company had a very good YoY Q2 2020 revenue growth of 31.7% in a difficult economic environment. The revenue growth does include results from recently acquired Perfect Audience, an online advertising retargeting company.The company management appears to be committed to improving margins, and in the most recent quarter, the gross profit margin jumped 6% from 66% to 74%, primarily as a result of increased product price increase, expanding customer base, and the acquisition of Perfect Audience.(Source: Portfolio123)SharpSpring ended the quarter with more than $15 million in cash and cash equivalents, which should be enough for the company to survive the pandemic and recession and still be in good shape. The strong cash position is a result of the combination of reduced spending, 10% salary cuts, bonus suspensions, drawing down $1.9 million on its line of credit, $1.6 million tax refund, and a $3.4 million loan from the Small Business Association under the SBA Paycheck Protection Loan program.The plot below illustrates how SharpSpring stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward EV/Sales versus forward revenue growth. Note: Please refer to a recent article for more information on the scatter plot-relative valuation technique.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)SharpSpring is situated well below the best fit line on the scatter plot, suggesting that the stock is extremely undervalued on a relative basis relative to its peers based on expected future revenue growth and its forward sales multiple.The industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In SharpSpring's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 25% - 36% = -11%SharpSpring fails miserably on the Rule of 40, suggesting that it does not have a healthy balance between growth and profitability. Note that this metric is calculated on a trailing-twelve-month basis. The extremely negative free cash flow margin of -36% makes investing in this company a non-starter for me.This level of negative free cash flow ultimately requires the company to refuel on a regular basis, either via share dilution or increased debts. In SharpSpring’s case, it has been diluting shares over the years.(Source: Portfolio123)The figure below illustrates why share dilution is not a good thing. The three charts show sales divided by the number of diluted shares for SharpSpring, HubSpot, and Salesforce.com over the last five years.From the above charts, you can see that SharpSpring’s competitors have consistently grown sales per diluted share over the years, while SharpSpring has not. This lack of growth is not beneficial to shareholders.Share dilution traces back to negative free cash flow, which currently sits at -36%. Let’s keep in mind that this is a very small company, and some “chunkiness” in results should be expected. But the negative free cash flow can’t be explained away by the size of the company. The phenomenon has persisted for many years and has to be built into the company management style. SharpSpring needs to do better if it wants my vote of confidence.SharpSpring is a small player in SaaS-based automated marketing tools, allowing companies to engage with customers at an early stage in their relationship. The idea is to nurture the company/customer relationship to the point where it becomes a qualified sales lead.SharpSpring has a lot of things going for it, including great revenue growth in a difficult economic environment, a large pool of cash that will allow it to survive the pandemic and recession, and a very low share price valuation.Despite these positive attributes, the company has one glaring issue, and that is its extremely negative free cash flow margin of -36%. This causes it to fail the Rule of 40 software metric by a wide margin and, ultimately, has translated into share dilution. Despite fairly substantial sales growth, the sales growth per diluted share has been stagnant. Therefore, I am providing a neutral rating for this company. I look forward to the day when SharpSpring takes positive action in improving its free cash flow."
4350565,104952,2020-05-28T11:53:21-04:00,"Despite market validation, the overall growth opportunity seems unattractive.As a $20 million-a-year SaaS CRM business, SharpSpring's 17% recurring revenue growth in 2019 is below par.Growth may not be sustainable. The business burned through ~3 million and 8 million of OCF in the last two years, which were 20% and 36% of revenues consecutively.","In our view, SharpSpring (SHSP) has a valid SaaS offering that fits into its agency niche marketing automation CRM market. However, we see limited upside potential in the business due to the market saturation, competition, and the scalability of its go-to-market. Despite our long-term bullish view on the SaaS CRM market in general, we found it difficult to be bullish on SharpSpring.The company’s unique value propositions are its agency-focused business and the low price of its offering. As we have mentioned, these propositions seem to be valid for now. Overall revenue growth has been steady at 20% to 25% in recent times as the company continues to land new clients.(source: the company’s Q1 2020 presentation)Moreover, with the company confidently expecting revenue of $31 million at the end of the year, growth would accelerate to ~37%. More recently, the company also acquired PerfectAudience, an online advertising retargeting company formerly owned by Marin Software (MRIN). The acquisition presents some strategic values, considering the company’s large client base of digital marketing agencies. An enriched bundled marketing automation and retargeting offering, for instance, will allow the company to increase its pricing. Indeed, the company already increased its expansion price by ~37% to $275 per month in Q1, without affecting its growth.(source: perfectaudience.com)Furthermore, there are some immediate competitive insights the company can get out of the acquisition, considering PerfectAudience’s existing relationships with HubSpot (HUBS), the company’s fiercest competitor in its niche to-date. For instance, SharpSpring now has strategic access to PerfectAudience’s customers that are also HubSpot clients.The marketing automation, which is part of the greater CRM space, is a highly competitive and saturated space. As a result, while the growth has been steady, the limited upside potential in the digital marketing agency niche industry concerns us.(source: company’s Q1 earnings call slide)Many successful players in the CRM/marketing automation space, such as Pardot or Marketo, have historically tapped into high-valued verticals such as the mid-market and the enterprises while maintaining mainstream adoptions across industries. Based on these success stories, a CRM/marketing automation appears to be a market where the players do not differentiate themselves by building industry-specific offerings to develop their niches. In some cases, they also either had disruptive offerings leveraging new technologies such as AI/machine learning or highly efficient go-to-market approaches, which ended up driving the acquisition premiums. Aside from the diversification of the client base, these strategies often resulted in accelerated, expansionary growth.(source: company’s Q1 earnings call slide)We do not see these differentiations in SharpSpring. We believe that its agency-focused offering is replaceable by that of the niche market leader HubSpot. Furthermore, its move towards a higher-touch go-to-market model will potentially be irrelevant to its price leadership and SMB strategies. Even at present, go-to-market has not been efficient. Gross margin is below par at ~67%, while many strong SaaS companies we covered have at least +80% gross margins. (source: company’s Q1 earnings call slide)Consequently, while SharpSpring has steady growth, it is relatively lackluster compared to other SaaS players within the context of the market, scale, and size. For instance, SharpSpring grew its revenue by ~25% last year, though the growth in the recurring portion was merely 17%. HubSpot, on the other hand, still records +30% growth while having a much larger operation.(source: stockrow)At the moment, we are also uncertain whether the growth will be sustainable. Operating losses widened by 46% last year alone with no visible path to cash-flow profitability. Moreover, to support its cash-burning operations, the company had raised over $23 million in the last two years at the expense of sizable dilutions for shareholders.SharpSpring’s positioning and offering, while valid, do not present an attractive and sustainable growth opportunity. The business has a lackluster growth, profitability, and cash flow generation. A similar +$20 million-a-year SaaS business in the marketing/CRM sector, Buffer, for instance, has been growing strong and self-sustaining for years while consistently achieving over 25% EBITDA margin. Due to the questionable upside potential and moderate fundamentals, SharpSpring looks risky enough despite the attractive ~4.5x P/S. As it stands, we found it difficult to be bullish on the stock."
4326157,35181,2020-02-21T11:25:44-05:00,"SharpSpring has made a small improvement to the net dollar retention rate metric, but it is still very substandard.Free cash flow margin is atrocious.Revenue growth is slowing noticeably.Disruptive business model has its benefits but profitability isn't one of them.","In my previous article on SharpSpring, Inc. (SHSP), I was not impressed by the company's underlying fundamentals.Today, I am back to review SharpSpring's progress in the areas that I identified as being underwhelming, specifically net dollar retention rate and SG&A expenses.In reviewing the latest quarterly results, it appears that the company has made a little progress on the net dollar retention rate, but it is still very substandard. There has been no progress in reducing SG&A expenses. And also of concern is the slowing revenue growth.In a side-by-side comparison with HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), its main competitor, HubSpot wins hands down. Therefore, I am retaining my neutral rating for SharpSpring.SharpSpring has recognized for some time that customer retention is a problem. For instance, in the 2019 Q1 earnings call, management stated:Despite ongoing efforts to improve net retention, very limited progress has been made. It was reported in the 2019 Q3 earnings call that the quarterly net dollar retention rate was approximately 96% as opposed to the 94% reported in the previous quarter. Now keep in mind that this is a quarterly figure. If I understand this correctly, the annualized figure would be in the low 80% range. Compare this statistic to HubSpot, which has an annualized dollar retention rate of 100.7%.(Source: HubSpot)Commenters in my previous article were quick to point out that HubSpot sells directly to businesses while SharpSpring focuses on Agencies that act as a middleman. Fair enough, but SharpSpring does sell directly to businesses and has found them to have the highest attrition.I think it is fair to say that SharpSpring has a leaky bucket that needs to be fixed.In SharpSpring's latest Investor Presentation, the company management presents a very high revenue growth picture of 52% CAGR from 2016 to 2019.(Source: SharpSpring)This is a very misleading statistic as revenue growth in 2015, immediately after SharpSpring was acquired in an acquisition, was well in excess of 100%. In Q3 of 2019, revenue growth has dropped to 17%.HubSpot, on the other hand, grew revenue at a rate of 50+% in 2015 and has retained a growth rate in excess of 30% in 2020.(Source: Portfolio123)Another area of major concern is the level of cash burn. I measure cash burn using the SG&A expense margin. For SharpSpring, the SG&A expense margin is 111%. (Note SG&A expense includes R&D.)(Source: Portfolio123)SharpSpring is spending more on SG&A than it is receiving in revenue. In the long term, this plays out in one of two ways: either increased debt or shareholder dilution.(Source: Portfolio123)In fact, both are occurring. Shareholder dilution of 27% occurred in 2019 and total debt to total equity also increased. Investors should expect more of the same as time goes on.Perhaps the most telling fundamental of all for this company is the free cash flow margin which is -41%.(Source: Portfolio123)How does SharpSpring compare to HubSpot for this very important metric? HubSpot has a 12% free cash flow margin, steadily increasing over time and positive since 2016.(Source: Portfolio123)The last observation that I am going to make today is that the cost of customer acquisition is going in the wrong direction. From 2019 to the present, the CAC has gone from $4,500 to $10,800.2015 Q3:2017 Q4:2018 Q4:2019 Q1:2019 Q2:2019 Q3:SharpSpring is a small company with annual revenue of approximately $23 Million. Most SaaS companies are still privately held at this stage of growth and I believe that this may be one of the issues that SharpSpring has to overcome. Significant growth will be required in order to compete with the big boys such as HubSpot, but to get there will probably require cash infusions. If the company was private, this would mean a round or two of venture capital. But since the company is publicly traded, investors should expect a fair amount of shareholder dilution, especially since the company management is spending a fair amount more than it is taking in with revenue.I see most factors working against this company. This includes an extremely high SG&A expense margin, one of the worst free cash flow margins I have ever seen, poor customer retention and increasing customer acquisition cost. There are other companies out there, such as HubSpot, with significantly better metrics. Therefore, I am giving SharpSpring a neutral rating."
4288531,104697,2019-08-28T19:03:51-04:00,"SHSP's recent weakness in share price has created an attractive buying opportunity for investors.The cloud-based marketing technology company is now trading at 5x EV/Revenues, which is uncommon for a SaaS company with +24% Revenue growth.SharpSpring has secured an attractive position in a rapidly growing market, which it will look to further capitalize on going forwards.","With its share price decreasing more than 50% in the space of 4 months, SharpSpring (SHSP) is now trading at less than 5x EV/Revenues. This cloud company has become an attractively priced player in the rapidly growing Marketing Automation Systems software space.As a company, SharpSpring (SHSP) provides a cloud-based marketing automation solution designed for small and mid-size businesses across the world. It markets and sells its products and services through its own sales teams as well through third-party resellers. At this point in time more than 8000 customers use SharpSpring's solutions to improve communications in relation to product offering and accelerate product sales. It is worth noting that the company was originally known as SMTP Inc when it as founded in 1998 before changing its name to SharpSpring Inc in December 2015. The Company itself is headquartered in Gainesville, Florida. With regard to the industry SharpSpring operates in, the Marketing Automation Systems space, the Company competes against other players such as Hubspot (HUBS), Act-on and Salesforce (CRM) Pardot. In relation to these competitors, Sharspring mainly differentiates itself on product pricing, a difference that it has looked to market to investors.(Source: Company Presentation)The product pricing strategy SharpSpring employs has allowed them to build a valuable customer base of digital marketing agencies. These agencies are often regarded as the standard within the digital industry with more than 300k businesses turning to digital agencies in order to address complex industry wide needs such as driving potential leads to business, converting more leads to sales and accurately measuring marketing ROI (Return On Investment). (Source: Company Presentation)Recently, the Company has seen a rapid decrease in its share price where it went for being traded at its 52-week high of $21.10 to currently around $11 all in the space of 4 months. This decrease has presented an attractive entry point for a high-performing business in a growing market.Data by YChartsWith regard to the Company’s financial model, an important ratio to look at for SaaS (Software-as-a-service) businesses is the CAC:LTV ratio. LTV stands for “lifetime value” per customer and CAC stand for “customer acquisition cost”. The LTV/CAC ratio compares the value of a customer over their lifetime, compared to the cost of acquiring them. This metric compares the value of a new customer over its lifetime relative to the cost of acquiring that customer. If the LTV/CAC ratio is less than 1.0 the company is destroying value; if the ratio is greater than 1.0 it is likely to be creating value. Generally speaking, a ratio greater than 3.0 is considered “good” but there can be some exceptions. SharpSpring currently exhibits an attractive LTV:CAC ratio of 6.8X which is very competitive in this regard.(Source: Company Presentation)Building on attractive customer acquisition economics, SHSP has secured an attractive positioning in a growing market. With an addressable market size of $5.1B in 2018 that is growing +20% annually, the Company has a lot of upside to capture to going forward.(Source: Company Presentation)In addition to operating a growing market, SHSP also has the capability of sustaining its current market position long-term. While the high technical nature of the software space acts as a sizable barrier to entry, restricting new entrants, the current competitors cannot commit to the level of pricing that SharpSpring currently offers its customers, making the Company a difficult target to compete with both for current competitors and potential new entrants. In terms of near-term events that have the potential to shift SharpSpring's share price in a way that better reflects the Company's value proposition and growth prospects going forward, a continued expansion of the current customer base through a wider market adoption of marketing automation software systems could contribute to enhancing SharpSpring's growth prospects. In a recent survey sent out to marketing and communications specialists around the world, only 38% claimed on planning to invest in marketing automation in the following 12 months. In addition, as SHSP acquires more customers over time, the Company will benefit from an increase in customer value as these long-term agency customers mature. This is due to the fact that as SHSP acquires more customers going forwards, the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) portion of company revenues cumulates as well. The Marketing Automation Systems space as seen a considerable amount of M&A activity in recent times due to its attractive growth prospects. In June 2013, ExactTarget, a provider of on-demand email marketing software solutions, was acquired by Salesforce for a 8.6x Sales multiple which corresponded to $2.5B. In September 2018, Marketo, a marketing automation software platform, was acquired by Adobe (ADBE) at a 12x Sales multiple, which corresponded to $4.75B. Marketo itself had been acquired by Vista Equity Partners in May 2016 for a 6.5x Sales multiple which corresponded to $1.79B. The rapid expansion in the value at sale of Marketo can be seen as an indication of the premium the market currently associates with Marketing Automation Software companies.A potential comparable company for SharpSpring is HubSpot (HUBS) as it is a publicly listed competitor that operates in the same software space as SharpSpring. As seen below, a comparison of both companies shows a discrepancy in valuation on an EV/Sales basis, a metric that is commonly used for comparing growing software companies.Data by YChartsWhat is also interesting is that this discrepancy in market valuation is not explained by revenue growth as both companies have been growing at similar speeds over the past few years, with HubSpot growing revenues slightly more quickly than SharpSpring in relative terms. Data by YChartsHowever, the discrepancy in market valuation between SharpSpring and its closest comparable can somewhat be explained by the difference in market capitalization of both companies. HubSpot currently holds a market capitalization of $+8B whereas SharpSpring currently only has a market value of $+100M, which would restrict a lot of institutional investors from being able to invest. SharpSpring currently faces risks similar to the rest of the industry, in addition to company specific ones:With regard to Regulation, Governments in the US/EU have recently displayed increased concern with regard to the tracking and retention of user information which is an important aspect of Marketing Automation Systems as the software registers individual information in order to develop a customer profile. Similar to any company that operates overseas, there is a Foreign Exchange Rate Risk associated with SharpSpring: Approximately 17% of FY18 Revenues were denominated in a Non-USD currency which depending on prevailing exchange rates can increase or hinder overall company revenues which adds to uncertainty.On a more company specific level, SHSP is reliant on agency partners to sell the SharpSpring solution to their clients. Although this group of agency customers is currently well diversified with more than 1800 different customers, the Company's future prospects are dependant on adding additional agency customers and retaining them.With the Company maintaining attractive positioning in a rapidly expanding market, the recent drop in share price has provided potential investors with an attractive entry point that has the potential to capture a great deal of upside. On top of attractive customer acquisition economics and product pricing differentiation, the Company is also operating in a space that has seen a notable amount of M&A activity in recent times. If either the past transaction multiples or the comparable company multiples are to be considered, then SharpSpring is currently trading at a sizable discount. I would recommend anybody interested in the Company acquire shares priced under $12.50."
4287427,35181,2019-08-22T16:00:44-04:00,SharpSpring is very undervalued and has revenue growth of 32% TTM.Net dollar retention rate is 94% while SG&A expenses to sales are high and increasing.HubSpot has better metrics in a side-by-side comparison.SharpSpring needs to work on improving on customer attrition and lowering SG&A expenses before an investment makes sense.,"SharpSpring, Inc. (SHSP) is a small fish in a big pond. With Sales TTM of $21 million and a market cap of $108 million, SharpSpring is competing against the juggernaut HubSpot (HUBS) which has sales TTM of $591 million and a market cap of more than $8 billion.SharpSpring has been able to compete and grow by offering its cloud-based marketing and sales platform at a fraction of the price of its competitors.(Source: SharpSpring)While I find that SharpSpring stock is quite undervalued, I am not overly excited by the underlying fundamentals. In particular, the low net dollar retention rate and rising SG&A expenses are of concern. For these reasons, I am giving SharpSpring a neutral rating. I intend to review this rating in future quarters to see if the company is able to improve the retention rate and reduce SG&A expenses. Also, I want to see if the new product offering called Sales Optimizer is gaining traction and having a positive impact on the company fundamentals.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV, ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, SharpSpring is significantly below the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that SharpSpring is undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40 is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.SharpSpring's revenue grew by 32% for the most recent twelve months, up from 10% in January 2018.(Source: Portfolio123)SharpSpring exhibited a poor free cash flow margin of -41% for the most recent twelve-month period.(Source: Portfolio123)SharpSpring's YoY revenue growth was 32%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was -41%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 32% - 41% = -9%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out significantly less than 40%, I conclude that the company has work to do to bring growth and profitability into balance.Note that the Rule of 40 should be taken with a grain of salt when analyzing such a small company. It is generally more important for companies under $100 million in sales to grow revenue as fast as possible using every sales and marketing dollar available. And that is what SharpSpring is doing. You can tell by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)In the case of SharpSpring, the SG&A expense is 113% of the total revenues. This means that SharpSpring is spending 13% more on SG&A than revenue intake. Curiously, SG&A to Sales TTM has been increasing since 2014, the early stages of the company and product. My understanding is that the increase is meant to address the high customer attrition rate by increasing sales staff and assigning account managers to interface with agencies.Another way to look at cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The operating margin is well below the trend line suggesting that cash burn is much greater than its peers. In fact, SharpSpring is one of the worst stocks in my database for cash burn.I can put the high level of cash burn aside given that this is a small company trying to make it big. But I do want to make sure that the investment makes sense by doing a side-by-side comparison of some key metrics against the company's main competitor, that being HubSpot.Given that HubSpot has a similar rate of revenue growth as SharpSpring, I am struggling to come up with a reason for giving SharpSpring a buy rating. The free cash flow margin is terrible and so is the net dollar retention rate.Hopefully, company management will be able to turn around the customer attrition rate soon, and maybe their new product, Sale Optimizer will assist with that.SharpSpring is David, HubSpot is Goliath. Unfortunately, David's sling isn't big enough to slay Goliath. SharpSpring has poor fundamentals, but I am OK with that given this is such a small company looking to grow as fast as possible. The problem I do have is that HubSpot is a much better prospect on a side-by-side comparison. With similar revenue growth, HubSpot is capturing more market share due to sheer size. HubSpot has positive free cash flow while SharpSpring's free cash flow is very negative. Finally, SharpSpring's net dollar retention rate is substandard and customer attrition is high. I am, therefore, giving SharpSpring a neutral rating. I'll check back in a few months to see how the company is progressing with new product offerings and metrics."
4218559,67473,2018-11-06T05:44:25-05:00,"Greenhaven Road Capital is a long-biased, concentrated hedge fund.  We invest only in our very best ideas – typically 15 long positions or less and a handful of opportunistic short positions.Generally avoiding commodity-based companies, we look for businesses with strong cash flow, normalized earnings, and long term growth horizons.Includes detailed analysis of Greenhaven Road Capital's positions in ETSY, FCAU, SHSP, TRIP, YELP, EVI, BOX.In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses.","Original PostGreenhaven Road Capital commentary for the third quarter ended September 31, 2018 discussing the good and the bad business problems.Dear Fellow Investors,In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses. Individual returns will vary by investor class, so please check your statements. This marks our tenth straight quarter of positive returns. Let me assure you, this is not by design.In fact, if this past quarter had ended a few days later, our modest gains would have turned into losses. I am looking for out of favor and misunderstood companies with a multi-year time horizon. As a concentrated, long biased partnership, we will have down months, quarters, and years. The returns should not be linear, but with a little good fortune, over time we can continue to compound our capital at attractive rates.There are good businesses and bad businesses. Similarly, there are good business problems and bad business problems. Bad business problems include disadvantaged cost structures and overcapitalized competitors who can sustain years of losses in the pursuit of market share. Good business problems include the inability to satisfy demand. In an ideal world, we would short bad businesses with bad business problems, which will eventually be priced in by the market, and own good businesses with good business problems.One of the ""good problems"" is undermonetization, which can take many forms but is essentially some variant of undercharging or not taking full advantage of an existing customer base. For example, ad-supported companies can undermonetize by showing users fewer ads than customers/viewers would tolerate. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) does not monetize WhatsApp despite its hundreds of millions of monthly users and almost $20B price tag.The beauty of undermonetization is that there is typically a relatively simple ""fix"" that only requires tweaks to existing product offerings and/or pricing. Such changes typically are not capital intensive and have less execution risk than would come with launching new products or entering new markets. When pairing the ""good problem"" of undermonetization with a good business that has operating leverage, the results can be quite compelling as the incremental revenue easily converts to incremental profit.Initially, focusing on undermonetizing companies was not intentional. However, as I have reflected on our portfolio, the theme is certainly recurring. If TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) can monetize 2% rather than 1% of their website traffic, our investment should work out quite well. If Yelp (NYSE:YELP) can better monetize the efforts of their existing sales force by offering more flexible contract terms that encourage trial and generate more advertisers with higher lifetime values, our investment should work out quite well (see below for further commentary).If Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) sellers do not revolt and accept the new 5% commission rate instead of the former 3%, our investment should work out quite well. Again, these are tweaks to existing structures. Etsy will continue with the same shopper traffic, the same pool of sellers, and the same exact cost structure - just a few lines of code should increase earnings and revenue dramatically.When undermonetization is addressed in a business with operating leverage, we should see accelerated revenue growth and expanding margins. Given that improving growth and improving margins are catnip for many investors, the third driver of returns, multiple expansion, can work for us as well. Now, not all undermonetization is good or easily fixable, but as internet companies mature, I expect undermonetizing companies will continue to be a fertile hunting ground for new investments. While not the traditional altar for a value investor to pray to, the manner in which improving monetization can flow through the income statement is compelling.Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) - I have said in the past that I look for investments where the valuation makes sense. In my opinion, Fiat Chrysler has reached that point again. The company has transformed itself from a company suffering under the burden of enormous debts that could only think about debt repayment to a very well capitalized company. Fiat Chrysler is currently generating over $100M per week in cash.At the end of this year, their net industrial cash should exceed $2.50 per share. On top of this, after the end of the quarter, the company finally announced the impending sale of their parts business, Magneti Marelli, which will add another $4+ of net cash when it closes early next year. So adjusting for the sale of the parts business, FCAU has approximately 40% of its market capitalization in cash.Today, FCAU trades (ex cash) for less than 3X forward earnings. If we assume that they can achieve their five-year plan, shares ex-cash are trading for less than 1X 2022 earnings. Typically, these valuations only show up for sick and dying businesses.In contrast, Fiat Chrysler's U.S. sales were up 15% Y/Y in September and are up 6% year-to-date. The company also has several product introductions in the pipeline to introduce new models in categories where their brands have not been represented. Of particular interest are the new three-row, seven-passenger Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep Scrambler pickup truck that will be introduced next year.Yes, Fiat Chrysler is a cyclical and capital intensive business, but it has been structured to allow for variability in revenue. At the company's recent Capital Markets Day, management provided guidance that the company could remain profitable even if U.S. auto sales dropped as low as 10M cars. U.S. new car sales dipped to 9M in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, so it is reasonable to expect the company to remain profitable in nearly all but the most draconian scenarios. The question is - how profitable? Fiat's Chairman is not a novice capital allocator. He makes the pilgrimage to Omaha. He finally has real levers to pull at FCAU.How might this play out? There are all indications that the company would like to restore their dividend. It would be interesting to see how FCAU was valued based on a dividend yield. They could easily cover a €1/$1.14 per year dividend - apply a 5% yield to that and you have a $22+ stock. It would not surprise me at all if Elkan initiates a combination of a tender offer and/or buyback to take advantage of the stock's price as I believe he is inclined in the very short term to try and walk the valuation up to be in a stronger position to effect a merger with another OEM to realize the enormous potential synergies.These options have never been available to him, now they are and I think they will be utilized in 2018, hopefully to dramatic effect. As a result, I have layered a small short-dated out-of-the-money option position and an in-the-money option position to allow the fund to profit disproportionately should this scenario occur. I do not purchase options as a regular practice and 90% of options expire worthless, so this cherry on top may disappear, but the opportunity well outweighs the cost. Given the company's current valuation, known catalysts, and orientation of the Chairman, I continue to like the set-up.Etsy - As previously discussed, Etsy has announced a significant price increase to a commission rate of 5%; when combined with the payment processing fee of 3%, the net result is a take rate of approximately 8%. Fortunately, this pales in comparison to the current Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Made rate of 15%. The value proposition to sellers of being able to reach 20M + buyers for a listing fee of 20 cents and only paying the 8% upon a sale of an item remains very compelling.SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) - SharpSpring has become a Top 5 holding through a combination of price appreciation and the purchase of additional shares over several months. SharpSpring is a SaaS (Software as a Service) business that provides marketing automation software primarily for digital marketing agencies who utilize their technology to run sophisticated digital campaigns that include web pages customized based on a visitor's historical activity.Purchasing SharpSpring's software gives a customer licenses for use with up to three clients. The software is also white-labeled so that an agency can present it with their own branding and can upsell if they choose. With this model, SharpSpring has an attractive LTV/CAC ratio typically greater than 6.In English, that means that for every $1 they spend acquiring a customer, that customer will generate $6 in lifetime value. The right way to run this business, in my opinion, is to spend every available dollar on sales and marketing to build the customer base, not worrying about short-term profitability. SharpSpring management agrees, and recently executed a convertible debt offering to access additional resources for marketing.SharpSpring operates in an oligopolistic market with three primary competitors: HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), Act-On, and Pardot (by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)). HubSpot is the largest competitor and in a difficult competitive position relative to SharpSpring. HubSpot has a large customer base paying in excess of $30K per year versus SharpSpring charging less than $5K per year. HubSpot cannot easily slash prices 75% to compete on price, and given the near-parity of the offerings, offering a ""stripped down"" version is also not viable. These dynamics have driven adoption and market share gains for SHSP, particularly among smaller agencies.SharpSpring has benefitted from multiple expansion, but also has executed well. Product revenue grew 40% in their last reported quarter. In a more recent press release, the company announced a record number of new customers in Q3 while maintaining marketing efficiency (their LTV/CAC should remain above 6). There is a very long runway for growth for SharpSpring.The company will benefit from secular tailwinds in an industry growing over 20% per year. There is also a history of acquisitions in the space at premiums to where shares trade today. SharpSpring came to my attention through a conversation with Jeremy Kahan of North Peak, a manager the Partners Fund is invested with.TripAdvisor - TripAdvisor remains the dominant travel research company and maintains the largest installed base for travel apps. The company continues to make progress on their in-destination business for local tours and activities, and has been optimizing ad spending on the hotel business to improve profitability. We continue to hold the shares as it is entirely plausible that TripAdvisor can improve their monetization rates on the $1.3+ trillion in travel spend it influences.The company has announced but not rolled out a new version of the site, which features a personal travel feed that makes it easier to plan and book travel while putting an emphasis on friend and influencer recommendations when available. Like any major overhaul, it has the possibility of improving the experience and economics… or not. Time will tell.Yelp - We discussed Yelp in detail in Greenhaven's Q2 letter. The initial indications are that the transition away from one-year contracts and toward more flexible, ""cancelable at any time"" commitments has gone well. As management said in their quarterly letter to shareholders (Link):There remains the possibility of increased traction of new offerings, improved monetization, operating leverage, and multiple expansion.EnviroStar (NYSEMKT:EVI) - Given SHSP's strength and EVI's price declines, EnviroStar was replaced in the Top 5 during Q3. This remains a very large holding for our partnership, and there continues to be progress. The company has announced five acquisitions so far this year as they continue to execute their buy and build strategy. EVI will not screen cheaply for several reasons, including deal costs, which depress current year earnings, and a larger infrastructure, which depresses short-term margins.As EnviroStar scales, we should see operating leverage and margin expansion as this infrastructure is spread over a larger base of business. As discussed in past letters, there is also a dynamic where acquisitions made late in the year immediately increase the fully diluted share count but only contribute a partial year of revenue and earnings.While short-term earnings may be understated, the long-term potential of EnviroStar remains compelling as they create value with the ability to acquire assets at 5X EBITDA using a stock currency that is in excess of 15X EBITDA. When paired with the ability to improve the acquired companies and a current balance sheet that can accommodate significant debt, this flywheel can turn for a long time.There are a lot of ways to invest. There is a more quantitative method driven by particular ratios such as price to book, price to earnings, and return on invested capital. The investment I am about to describe is driven far more by the qualitative. For such investments, I often gain conviction through a synthesis of my life experiences and hypotheses about the future. To provide the context for our most recent investment, let me lay out three life experiences. They are somewhat disjointed, but are important pieces to the puzzle.The first relevant experience occurred when I was in business school. After the first semester, students got to choose courses that we thought would be interesting, so I signed up for a class called ""Managing a Multinational Organization."" I had previously managed a small company, and was intrigued by the prospect of pulling back the curtain on what managing a multinational company would look like. It was one of the best classes I ever attended… but it does not appear on my transcript.I walked out of the class after 20 minutes and vowed to never try to manage a multinational company myself. The issues of a small company are dramatically magnified when dealing with different languages, cultures, customer preferences, labor laws, regulations, etc. A large enterprise is exponentially more complex than a small business and requires special skills and tools.The second relevant experience came from my time in an operating role at Acelero, the education services company I helped found. We were looking at selling a technology-based product to Head Start programs, but selling this type of product was not something we had done before, so we tried to pick the brains of the smartest entrepreneurs in the space in order to shape our sales and marketing strategy. One day we were able to meet an individual who, in our opinion, had ""cracked the code"" in the education space, having grown from two guys in rented office space to eventually being acquired by a public company.When discussing how to sell in the education space, he said that their sales strategy hinged on identifying what motivated the customer, and addressing those motivations. This is pretty basic and common sense, but, he then went on to say something that proved to be incredibly insightful. To paraphrase:In regulated industries, compliance can drive hundreds of billions of dollars of purchases just because the product checks a box for regulators and allows everyone to keep their jobs.The third life experience also occurred at Acelero. When we first started, we had a paper checkbook in the filing cabinet. We ran payroll monthly using a bookkeeper. It was as low tech as you could get. As we added a few employees, we graduated to Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) where we could phone in our payroll.For a period of growth from 10 to 100 employees, we used a boutique PEO (professional employer organization), and when we crossed 100 employees, we switched over to ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), which was the provider of choice for larger companies. Over time, we did far more than issue paychecks with ADP as their data and systems integrated with our health insurance provider, our retirement plans, and our corporate learning tools.Unfortunately, we grew to hate ADP. We hated the (lack of) service, we hated the pricing, and we hated the user interfaces. However, we stayed with them year after year after year because they were integral to running our finance department, and the complexity and risks of changing payroll providers and interrupting all of those integrations were too high. Removing ADP as the center of this ecosystem felt like the equivalent of attempting a brain transplant - the integrations kept us captive as they created a very significant barrier to exit. We stayed not because we were happy, but it was too hard to leave.So to summarize, my past experiences gave me an admiration for the complexity facing large enterprises, a recognition that - particularly in a regulated industry - purchase decisions are often driven by compliance, and an appreciation for how integrations between vendors for critical systems can effectively lock in a customer. Recently, these experiences, coupled with two other themes that have been running through my research process, laid the foundation for a new investment.The first theme, discussed above, is companies that are ""undermonetizing"" can be attractive investments. The second theme percolating is also an obvious one: data is today's gold, and it is unlikely that companies will, on average, spend less on accessing, sharing, and protecting it. There is real career risk in skimping on data, and data management and cybersecurity have significant tailwinds for the next decade or longer.None of these experiences or themes are blindingly brilliant, but collectively they are the underpinnings for our investment in Box, Inc.Box started 13 years ago out of a USC dorm room as an online file storage company, effectively offering a cloud-based hard drive to store computer files. Today, there are multiple companies that will allow a user to store a virtually unlimited number of files for a nominal amount of money, or even for free. Online file storage is a ""bad"" business as there is little value add and it is effectively a commodity. The founders of Box realized that commodity storage could be a race to the bottom, so relatively early on, they began to focus on the enterprise customers (larger companies), and particularly companies in regulated industries.For large companies in regulated industries such as healthcare or defense, storing information is easy: compliance is the tricky part. Large companies need to control who can access files, and with whom the files can be shared both externally and internally. There needs to be a log of all activity surrounding the file. Who opened it, when and where did they log in from, etc.? There are file retention policies to be enforced. While Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive may work for a small business, the compliance needs of an enterprise quickly strain the functionality of Google.Do you want your health records stored on a free Dropbox account your doctor got by sharing the email address of 5 friends? If you run a defense contractor with 150,000 employees, do you want them using a hodge-podge of Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Google Drive, and OneDrive? Large companies need more robust data storage solutions. They need the ability to share content internally and externally but also to have controls and records of how that sharing occurred. They need the ability to lock files. To gain a sense of the robustness of the Box offering, it is worth perusing this feature comparison datasheet (linked here).Over the last decade, Box has built a customer base of over 87,000 companies with over 10M users that store their data on Box servers, including 69% of the Fortune 500. Box has integrated with 1,400+ applications so far, including Google Suite, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), and Slack. The products and integrations allow files stored with Box to be ""the source of truth,"" which means that while other applications can access files stored on Box, all of the changes are made and kept on the Box version where the security and sharing protocols can be applied. These integrations make it less likely a customer will leave Box, and diminish the chances that a direct or adjacent competitor could create a copycat product.The robustness of Box's current product suite and the lack of credible alternatives has led to very low churn rates: retention is 95%. Because of the addition of new products and the sales of additional seats, we can expect the core base of customers (before any new customer adds) to spend more this year than they did last year. In fact, Box's net dollar retention is running at approximately 108%, so even if no new customers were added, and with some attrition, we would still expect revenue to increase at least 8% before factoring in sales to new customers.Box has a very sticky product, and a large customer base. There is the potential to further monetize the customer base by selling a lot more product and services to the existing base to take advantage of being the holders of critical data. Box is sprinting at this opportunity. The company is spending over $100M a year on R&D. While meeting the compliance use cases of large enterprises is complex, it does not require this level of R&D spending.Box is aggressively building a robust pipeline of new products for release over the next two years, designed to improve how people work with and share information, the security of information, as well as applying automation and machine learning. Here are a couple of links to provide a sense of the future products and how they take advantage of Box's unique position and how far Box will be from a simple file storage company.Box Shield (video linked here) Box Skills (overview video linked here).Box recently added a new board member, Kimberly Hammonds, and in the press release she said,I feel the same way.I have not seen Box written up in any of the traditional venues like SumZero but it was presented by venture capitalist CEO Chamath Palihapitiya at the Ira Sohn conference. He argues that Box is a way for individuals and companies to benefit from the improvements in AI (Artificial Intelligence). Over time, Box customers (who are generally larger and have more types of data spread across more users than customers of other solutions) inevitably will want to apply artificial intelligence to their data.In fact, they will likely want to apply AI solutions from multiple vendors. Box is application agnostic and will be able to integrate with all of the major AI players including Google, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon. Thus, by storing files on Box, companies will have both the security they need and also the flexibility to work with multiple vendors to access and mine their files in different ways. Typically, when I hear a buzz word like AI, a combination of words like vaporware, hype, and short come to mind.In the case of Box, at this point only the expense of creating this functionality has been realized as these integrations have been built and are being tested but have yet to launch. The ability to apply the best AI offerings to data stored on box represents a free call option that could be another barrier to exit that generates revenue and is buzzworthy enough to generate multiple expansion.Box is missing one characteristic that I value: high insider ownership. Box was started by four college-aged friends with limited personal resources. Their first round of funding came from Mark Cuban. Eventually, as the company pursued developing for and selling into the enterprise market, they raised hundreds of millions of dollars in several rounds of financing. As a net result, the co-founder CEO owns approximately $70M in stock and the co-founder CFO just north of $20M. So while collectively they hold less than 5% of the company, they do have ""skin in the game"" and are not simply hired hands.Box operates in a massive market that they refer to as ""Cloud Content Management"" and size at $45B per year. I think no matter how we define it, it is likely growing and worth multiples of Box's current revenue. Last year, Box generated operating cash flow while spending roughly two-thirds of revenue on sales and marketing and product development (54% and 20%, respectively). Over time, a company's value should approximate the rates of return that they can get when they reinvest capital.As discussed before, with a customer base of 87,000 companies, it is easy to see a very high ROI on new product development. I am typically skeptical of sales and marketing spend as it can be a sugar high to drive short-term growth. However, with customer retention rates running in the above 90% and net dollar retention running well above $100, Box is actually probably not spending enough on sales and marketing. There is a slide on page 88 of their investor day deck (link) that shows revenue growth by cohort.It is beautiful. Several different years of customer cohorts have been compounding revenue growth well in excess of 20% per year. Now, marketing effectiveness may deteriorate over time, but the last two years have seen CAGR's of 24% and 20%, and there is still a largely untapped international opportunity as the U.S. constitutes 76% of revenue.All of the above paints the picture of a high-quality business with a bright future. Companies like this are rarely optically cheap. We are currently buying shares at just north of 4X next year's sales, which one could argue is cheap relative to many SaaS peers, (Dropbox and DocuSign have valuations twice as rich) but certainly is not on an absolute basis. I think one of the greatest risk factors here is multiple compression, particularly if growth slows.However, given the product pipeline and sales pipeline, I don't think the slowdown is imminent. In the long run, Box has the opportunity to continuously improve their business through a virtuous cycle of retaining customers and improving monetization. Product improvements lead to greater value add, which leads to greater utilization, greater lock in, lower churn, and higher revenue per user. Revenue growth and margin expansion are highly probable, with multiple expansion a possibility. No additional capital is required to grow.There is a long runway for growth, and multiple opportunities for additional products to be sold into a large and attractive customer base. Continued revenue growth of 20%+ for the foreseeable future, coupled with operating leverage and a very valuable customer base, create an interesting set-up.We ended the quarter with limited short exposure. The fund remains short ETFs targeted at short-term traders, a bond fund where the underlying interest rates received relative to the risk assumed do not pass my common-sense test, and two indices as very modest hedges.In September, we held Greenhaven's annual meeting in New York City. It is a special night for me, as I get the in-person opportunity to share context on the health and direction of the partnership, enjoy the company of our limited partners, and to say thank you. At the meeting, I spoke about three operating principles that have guided the firm over time. The first was to go slow and recognize that doing nothing is usually the right course of action. The second principle is to only pursue the ""Hell Yeahs.""If something does not really excite me, we will leave it to others. The final operating principle is that design matters. How we organize, who we invest with, and how we spend our time are the most critical decisions. The primary filter for all design choices is, ""can it help improve returns?"" This may sound simple, but it is very different than how most large hedge funds operate.Also at the meeting, we gave a small set of gifts to the limited partners in attendance that included the book Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts by Annie Duke. Annie Duke has an interesting background, awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship to study Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.She was also one of the top poker players in the world for two decades, winning over $4M in poker tournaments and a lot more elsewhere. She was also part of a group of players who helped each other improve their decision making. The group was led by a player named Eric Seidel, who has over $38M in tournament winnings.I think this book is well worth reading as it is a nice summary of probabilistic thinking and how to apply it. At the core, many of our investments are, in my estimation, asymmetric. There is a chance we may lose money, but there is a significant chance at a large profit, providing a positive expected value.When I say design matters, and who I spend our time with is important, I mean it. Under the umbrella of the Partners Fund, I am going to convene Annie Duke and the portfolio managers of the funds the Partners Funds is invested in. As I wrote in the invitation to the managers,The day with Annie Duke will be followed by a day of idea sharing among the managers. I don't know exactly what will come of these gatherings, but in my experience, good content and good people are a promising formula. While I believe our best chance at generating returns are with an investment committee of one, I am also keenly aware that the best chance of success will not be acting entirely alone. Rather, our best chances for success will be from the combination of the right limited partners, the right managers in the Partners Fund, and the right outside resources. The Annie Duke day will be another stop on that journey.We have a healthy economy and a portfolio of companies that have the opportunity for revenue growth, margin expansion, and multiple expansion over time. As volatility arises, I will attempt to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. We will continue to invest with a long-time horizon, and we will continue to invest like it is our own money - because it is. Thank you for the opportunity to grow your family capital alongside mine.Sincerely,Scott MillerEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4339291,35181,2020-04-22T23:44:35-04:00,"I expect both customer acquisition cost and lifetime value will come under pressure in the pandemic-driven economy.The timing of the Perfect Audience acquisition was unfortunate, as companies will likely reduce spending on digital advertising, perhaps by 50%.SharpSpring already has a very negative free cash flow margin of -41%. I expect it to have difficulties making an improvement this year.","In my last article on SharpSpring, Inc. (SHSP) just two months ago, I indicated that this company's fundamentals were atrocious. That was before the pandemic. Since then, investors have been mercilessly selling, with the share price dropping 56%.(Source: Seeking Alpha)What was in my opinion a bad investment has become even worse with COVID-19 and the likelihood of a global recession. SharpSpring has a very poor free cash flow margin of -41%, which will be difficult to overcome in the current economic conditions.To make matters worse, SharpSpring recently acquired Perfect Audience, which is dependent on the market for digital advertising.While the Perfect Audience acquisition is more or less a boat anchor at present given the economic downturn, the acquisition was funded by issuing shares to private investors, resulting in a share dilution of 34%.(Source: Portfolio123)SharpSpring's business model is very much dependent on the ratio of customer acquisition cost (CAC) to lifetime value (LTV).(Source: SharpSpring)Both the CAC and LTV are under pressure. The trend in CAC has been higher. From 2015 to 2019, the CAC has gone from $4,500 to $10,800. In the most recent earnings call, it was stated that the CAC for Q4 2019 was approximately $9,900. But the fall in CAC is apparently temporary, as the company is now giving potential HUBS customers $2,600 to try out and subscribe to SharpSpring.The LTV is likely to decline in the present market environment, given that customers subscribe on a monthly basis with no long-term commitment. SharpSpring has a high churn rate, quoting a net retention rate of 97%. I consider anything less than 100% to be substandard. This figure may decline, not only due to the pandemic and recession but also due to the increase in subscription price, which amounts to a 37.5% increase to customers.In short, the higher the churn, the lower the LTV. I expect that the CAC will rise and the LTV will fall this year, making the business model somewhat less attractive. Throw in the very negative free cash flow margin and this spells p-r-o-b-l-e-m.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how SharpSpring stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, SharpSpring is situated well below the best-fit line. This suggests that the company is undervalued on a relative basis.If I now substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales, then my assessment changes.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot indicate that SharpSpring is very overvalued based on next year's earnings estimates. This re-assessment is a direct result of the very negative free cash flow margin.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In SharpSpring's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 22% - 41% = -19%SharpSpring scores well below the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40, meaning that the company is having difficulty achieving a healthy balance between growth and profitability.I believe that SharpSpring is poorly positioned to weather the pandemic and expected global recession. I believe that the CAC / LTV ratio that the company's business model is based on will come under pressure at both ends. The CAC has been rising for the last several years and will continue to rise during the pandemic as businesses show restraint on spending. The LTV will fall due to increased customer churn. SharpSpring's already poor free cash flow margin of -41% will come under further pressure and perhaps make this company non-viable. The acquisition of Perfect Audience probably would have been smart under normal circumstances, but the timing has been unfortunate. I see this investment as a potential boat anchor when companies are not spending on digital advertising. For these reasons, I am giving SharpSpring a Neutral rating."
4059950,66603,2017-04-03T18:09:43-04:00,"Marketing Automation is the future of smart marketing. This Industry has seen 50% annual growth in the last few years, and is still a fertile ground for much more growth.SharpSpring, which only started 3 years ago, has grown to the #2 position in the agencies market. It has also seen 100% growth in the last year.Market didn't fully appreciate the growth because of the past financial metrics, but I will list several dynamics that are worth considering for different future expectations.Overall, a hardworking owner operator, a powerful business model and a fast growing industry can be a powerful combination for a long runway of growth.","Business BackgroundMarketing Automation is a hot industry that has seen very dramatic growth in the last few years. The top players, such as HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) or Marketo, have all had fantastic growth (around 50% top line growth per year). People are adopting this new way of marketing because more and more customer activities are shifted from offline to online, and businesses need a smarter way to do marketing.Source: SharpSpring Investor Presentation December 2016In this space, SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) is a relatively small player. However, given that it only launched its first product in 2014 (7 years later than HubSpot), one could argue that its achievements are also amazing. For example, I remember Act-On was a very promising player in the early years, and many times bigger than SharpSpring. However, at this time, Act-On is about the same size as SharpSpring.In the marketing automation space, SharpSpring is now one of the top 5 or 6 players. Its growth was over 100% in year 2016. That growth was mostly due to its unique business model: leveraging the 3rd party resources in marketing agencies.In any industry, it is hard for a small player to fight much bigger competitors. This is why SharpSpring's founder and CEO Rick Carlson came up with a very interesting business model: by giving marketing agencies 1/10 of the cost, it will leverage the marketing agencies to do the sales, marketing and customer support for him.This model is powerful because it suits a small company very well. Developing the marketing automation business is no easy task. Big players have significant advantage on marketing and sales. After the initial adoption, customer support is also very resource-intensive, since marketing automation has a big learning curve for most beginners. By leveraging the resources of marketing agencies, SharpSpring will be able to essentially outsource much of the marketing, sales and customer support efforts to the 3rd parties.For example, after training a marketing agency, SharpSpring's customer support will be only facing that agency, instead of the clients of agencies. Therefore, once the agencies have learned their way, they will be providing all the support to their customers and free up the human resources in SharpSpring. By giving more incentive to agencies, SharpSpring also enlisted the agencies' support on marketing and sales.The Powerful Business ModelIn the business world, a lot of things are not just measured by money. For example, if a company is to grow the operations organically, it would take more than just money, but also ""time"" to reach a certain scale. Beyond that, there is a question of operating efficiencies when managing a much larger company. And a question of how easily it can be to down scale the operations when needed.This is why I think SharpSpring's business model is very powerful. Essentially it is another form of ""franchise"" model where each agency would become a distributor, pay a percentage fee based on sales (in this case it is a fixed monthly fee based on the number of clients), and handle the operations themselves. For sure, it isn't a franchising model on the surface, but the underlying economics are very similar. As you can see, all the following benefits for the franchising model can also apply here.There are many benefits in this model:1. Fast scale-up.The franchiser doesn't have to worry about taking the time to build up new shops and hire new employees. When a company tries to grow very fast organically, it is hard to hire the right people very fast and not potentially leave a nightmare later.2. Efficient management.By adopting this fully decentralized model, each operating unit is small and can be managed very efficiently. The unit is also financially standalone, making each unit owner/manager fully motivated.3. Lower capital requirement.This model is to enlist many partners and therefore reduce the capital requirement significantly.4. Low operating leverage.These partners don't just provide the capital, they would share the ongoing risks too. This is why the franchiser usually has high gross margin and lower operating leverage.5. Easier to scale down.If scale-up for regular businesses is slow and risky, the scale-down process (if something goes wrong) is painful and even more risky. It could even kill the firm on the way down, especially when they have both high operating leverage and high financial leverage. On the contrary, a franchiser has much less risks when it does need to scale down the business.Of course, not everything is perfect with this kind of model. For instance, once you license out to the 3rd parties, you can't directly control the quality of the service. So if not doing it carefully, it could potentially damage the brand.Fortunately, this is not a big concern for SharpSpring, since marketing automation is facing marketing professionals (agencies), instead of consumers. The brand is not as useful here (when comparing with a regular consumer brand), otherwise the SMB customers would not look for help from an agency in the first place. (In general, brand is more powerful when facing consumers since consumers usually have less time to do researches to discover the true value of a product.)What is the Market Missing?This story is not totally new, and the company has achieved pretty amazing growth, but the share price has been down 10% in the last 12 months, even though the market has been up, so you might be wondering what is going on there and what is the market missing?I think there are two main reasons why the shares were down:1. Although the growth has been amazing, the company is still not profitable, and it has been burning a lot of cash on that growth path.2. Last quarter, the growth number has been down sequentially, from 244 customer additions to 213 additions. Even though the CEO Rick Carlson said he expected modest step-up (in new enrollment) in Q1 2017, the customer additions were roughly flat over the last 4 quarters.If a company didn't see accelerated growth and also burned a lot of cash, it is easy to understand the weakness in the share price.I think those concerns are all reasonable and understandable. In some sense, it is even more assuring, because in this market, it is hard to believe that the market will completely ignore a fast growing company, even when that is a microcap. If the shares are not shooting up after high growth, there has to be a reason. At least the reasons are fairly obvious on the surface.That said, I believe there are still some dynamics the market has missed by focusing on the past financial metrics:1. Unique positioning.Everything being equal, we would of course want to invest in the market leader, but we should also recognize the unique positioning in SharpSpring.First, despite being 50 times smaller than HubSpot in market cap, it is the #2 player in the agencies space for marketing automation. (It has about 1/3 of agency customers when compared with HubSpot).Source: SharpSpring Investor Presentation December 2016Second, its small size, much lower pricing and focus on agencies made big players feel very hard to compete with them.Third, this industry is not as easy to enter as I once believed. This is because marketing automation is rather complex and requires many features and components to work together. One evidence is that there weren't any new players posing threats to SharpSpring in the last 2 years. The feature gap is also getting smaller and smaller between HubSpot and SharpSpring.Source: Marketing Automation InsiderAll these mean that SharpSpring's business model will likely to stay valid for a long time to come. The problem it is facing right now is more of a resource and growth speed problem, than a competition problem.2. ""S"" curve in growth.One interesting phenomena is the ""S"" curve in growth. This applies to both a new industry and a new firm. For marketing automation, I think it is still in the early stages, especially for SMBs. Most small/medium businesses are still using traditional marketing methods. Even the marketing agencies still have many of them not ready to adopt marketing automation yet. However, this is the future of marketing, simply because it is much more powerful.While the industry could see a fast adoption phase later, a new firm such as SharpSpring also has a critical mass to reach. At some point, the awareness could build on itself.3. Lower churn rate.One thing special with marketing automation is that its switching cost is not just high, but also gets higher over time. The learning curve is usually high for both agencies and their clients. But more importantly, once it has been used for some time, just the existing data stored in this platform itself would provide a strong reason to stay with that platform. For this reason, the retention rate should get higher over time.For instance, HubSpot's quarterly retention rate was in high 80's in 2014, but got to high 90's in 2015 and 2016. SharpSpring's past monthly churn rate was 3%, but got to 2.3% in the last quarter. Over time, it is reasonable to expect it to get even lower than that. And this implies both higher net growth and more pricing power.4. The ecosystem and product differentiation.I found it interesting that SharpSpring has even more integrations with other platforms than HubSpot does. As shown below, SharpSpring has both SAP and Oracle integrations, but HubSpot doesn't. Recently, it also added integrations with Shutterstock, Enthusem and PieSync. This can build out an ecosystem and can have more product differentiation, further improving its competitive strength for the long term.Source: Marketing Automation Insider5. Capital free growth and margin expansion.One good thing about SharpSpring's model is that marketing agencies will try to grow their own businesses, and when they grow, it will add to SharpSpring's revenue over time. This is essentially what I call ""capital-free growth"". Also, since SharpSpring only provides support to agencies, but not to agencies' clients, there is some potential margin expansion when the agencies' client base gets bigger (growing revenue, but not growing operating expenses proportionally).Another important thing to point out is that the new customers additions don't include the additions of agencies' clients. Although those additions have much lower pricing than direct sales, it still provides a lot of values: first, it is capital-free growth. Second, it boosts the awareness and market share. Finally, it will also help agencies to focus on SharpSpring instead of other competitors.6. The current cash balance is likely to be enough to fund the future growth and get to cash flow break-even.At the end of 2016, the company has $8.65M cash and no debt. But since the company has just paid $5.7M tax in 2016 as shown in the cash flow statement (because of the divestiture of the SMTP business), it is likely to get back much of the tax in the next few years (in fact, there is $1.35M tax receivable in the current asset). For this reason, I expect the company will have a total of $13 million cash to fund the growth. (This $13 million cash is not the current cash balance, but the cash available to be used in the next few years to sustain the cash burn, as shown in the table above.) As the company grows its scale, its operating losses will get smaller and smaller. In my estimation, it's likely to achieve positive EBITDA within 2 - 3 years, even if we assume no churn-rate reduction and no accelerated growth, and the current cash should be enough to fund the growth in that time frame. (The last quarter had about $1.6M cash burn, but since this figure is getting smaller over time, we may expect $13 million is enough for the next 2-3 years.)All in all, although the past growth has been flat, it doesn't mean the future growth will stay at the same rate and not accelerate instead.In the following figure, we can see although the revenue addition has been flat quarter to quarter in 2016, there was a major step-up when comparing between 2016 and 2015. In 2015, the average revenue addition per quarter was $1.3 - $1.4M, but this figure grows to $1.7 - $1.8M per quarter in 2016.Source: SharpSpring Investor Presentation December 2016RisksAs any early stage growth companies, there is significant risk involved in this company. The main risk is the uncertainty around the growth rate. It is very hard to predict what the future growth rate will look like.If the company can't grow fast enough, the cash burn may be even more than my conservative estimation, and we may see further dilutions in unfavorable terms.ValuationFirst, before closing down GraphicMail and selling SMTP, there were 3 businesses entangled together and very hard to see the trend clearly. This has changed a lot since June 2016, since the sale of SMTP happened in June 2016, and migration of GraphicMail to SharpSpring Mail+ happened in the first half 2016 too. Because SharpSpring Mail+ revenue is only about $200K per quarter, the Q4 2016 financial statements should fully reflect the true economics of the SharpSpring Marketing Automation product.Currently, HubSpot is being traded at 8 times of sales. This seems to be reasonable given the fast growing industry, its past 50% per year growth and long runway in the future. Although SharpSpring doesn't possess the same market leading position and the same liquidity, it could have higher growth prospective and slightly more pricing power (since its price for agencies is only 1/10 of its competitors', the agencies are relatively price insensitive given the lower base price, should both SharpSpring and its competitors increase their prices at the same percentage). As it grows, at some point, it may achieve similar awareness and much better liquidity to support a higher P/S valuation than what it has now.In a pretty conservative scenario, we estimate the revenue has the same linear growth as in 2016 for the next 3 years and also achieve positive EBTIDA in 3 years. This estimation essentially assumes the same linear growth instead of exponential growth and no reduction in churn rate (assumes churn rate to fix at 2.5%). The net revenue addition is assumed to be $0.4M per quarter, after 12 quarters, the run-rate revenue would be ($2.8M + $0.4M * 12) * 4 = $30.4M per year, and 3 times of sales (instead of 8 times in HubSpot's valuation) is $30.4M * 3 = $91.2M market cap. Diluted Share base is assumed to be 10 million shares after 3 years. The share price would be $91.2M / 10M = $9.12. Discount this back 3 years at 10% discount rate gives: $9.12 / 1.1^3 = $6.85 or 51% upside from the current price ($4.55).In a more aggressive scenario, we assume revenue grows 50% per year in the next 3 years, which matches HubSpot's past growth. This 50% per year growth assumption shouldn't be too aggressive since the 2016 revenue growth was 109%. The revenue after 3 years will be $11.2 * 1.5 ^ 3 = $37.8M. (Notice that this figure is not much more than the $30.4M in the linear growth scenario.) If it trades at 5 times of sales (or 8.3 times of gross profit), it would have a market cap of $189M, or $189M / 10M = $18.9 share price. Discount this back 3 years gives: $18.9 / 1.1 ^3 = $14.2 fair value, or 212% upside.ConclusionGenerally speaking, it is very hard to value a high growth company, especially for an early stage one. Both the risk and the reward could be very big. For this kind of situation, it is probably better to take the same strategy as regular VC firms: build a small position and hold onto it for many years or even decades.I do think this specific case stand out by itself for a powerful combination of 3 elements which I usually look for:1. A smart founder operator who works very hard and focused on investing for the long term.In terms of ownership, the CEO Rick Carlson owns 8% of the company, which is not very high, but that is due to a special situation (SMTP bought SharpSpring in 2014). We shouldn't forget the fact that he founded this firm by himself and saw it growing to this stage. He cares about providing the best service to customers and worked very hard on educating the public about SharpSpring and Marketing Automation, as shown in a recent presentation he did in an IZEA Fest event.2. A pretty unique business model that has many merits and could serve as a foundation to power the growth without taking a lot of resources. This business model gives the firm a unique position to effectively compete with the market leader.3. A fast growing industry. Everything being equal, the industry growth can provide some very powerful tail wind. Of course, that usually has to be coupled with good competitive strength in order to be sustainable for a firm.Other than the long growth pathway, it is also quite possible to see a potential acquisition here, since the company is quite small in terms of the market cap, and can be very valuable considering its unique position and existing customer base.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Key features include web tracking, customer relationship management, lead scoring and nurturing, notifications and analytics that measure a marketing campaign's return on investment. Its own marketing efforts have been mainly focused on digital marketing agencies who become customers and are able to resell SharpSpring products to their own clients, paying additional fees as the user count expands beyond the base license agreement.The marketing agencies gain from recommending a marketing automation solution that they can then leverage to provide value-added services, whilst benefiting from the overall stickiness of SharpSpring’s platform. SharpSpring also benefits from focusing on marketing agencies, as they facilitate a lot of the sales, marketing and customer support on the company’s behalf without the associated costs. At the end of Q1 2019, SharpSpring had 1,804 agency customers and over 400 direct end-user customers that it sold directly to.(Source: Company website)To gain a better understanding as to why marketing agencies would partner with SharpSpring, there are some instructive videos provided by one such customer, Conversion Marketing Experts, here and here. One key selling point is shown in the table above where SharpSpring compares its price & terms with companies offering competing products, with HubSpot (HUBS), Pardot (which is part of Salesforce.com (CRM)) and Act-On being its key competitors. Outside of Infusionsoft, SharpSpring is by far the most price-competitive, with flexible contract terms that include monthly options versus the mainly annual plans offered by rivals. Cost is a key consideration for most companies, particularly in the small-to-medium enterprise segment that SharpSpring targets. Conversion Marketing Experts also profiles some key SharpSpring product features that it finds clients value highly. This includes “Lead Scoring,” which enables the sales team to sort through often thousands of leads to focus on those that have the highest chance of converting into sales. There is also a “Life of the Lead,” which is a timeline that tracks every meaningful interaction with a potential customer, from company webpage visits, videos watched, events attended, to what marketing campaigns they have been targeted with and their outcomes. Though over two years old, this presentation by SharpSpring’s CEO, Rick Carlson, outlines the logic and rationale behind the company’s approach to automated marketing. He uses the analogy of when his father brought a car in the 1990s versus when his wife bought a car in present times. The main difference was that 85% of his dad’s buyer journey happened in the car dealership, where a salesperson could answer questions first-hand, whilst simultaneously assessing the buyer (e.g., affordability, interest level, feature preference). For his wife, 85% of her buyer journey was self-guided through various internet searches and visits to car-related websites. SharpSpring tries to bring the best of the previous era's two-way human interaction to the present impersonal online sales approach by trying to hyper-personalize the conversation between buyer and seller through offerings such as adaptive websites, personalized emails, lead qualification based on their behavior (e.g., lead score mentioned above) and customized nurturing as the potential customer is guided through the sales funnel, from initial contact to ideally repeat sales and referrals.(Source: Company March 2019 presentation)As shown in the graphic above, SharpSpring has generated strong revenue growth, whilst expanding gross margins from 59% in Q4 2016 to 72% in Q4 2018. Adjusted EBITDA loss has remained in a very stable range, between USD1.2 million and USD1.7 million a quarter. Revenue growth continued in Q1 2019, with total revenues of USD5.3 million up 27% from the same year-ago period. Gross margins held steady at 71%, and adjusted EBITDA loss totaled USD1.8 million. Due to an equity offering in March 2019, SharpSpring ended the quarter with USD17.8 million in cash, up from USD9.3 million at the end of 2018.The company has a long runway for growth underpinned by the secular shift from offline to online, which is a powerful tailwind for marketing automation as more and more businesses search for cost-effective ways to harness the internet for their marketing strategies. As of Q1 2019, SharpSpring had 7,700 business customers, and it estimates domestically there are 88,000 mid-sized companies (100-500 employees) and 1.1 million small companies (10-99 employees), with more than 50,000+ digital marketing agencies in the USA alone. The marketing automation systems market was estimated to have grown 30%+ in 2018 to USD4.3 billion.Data by YChartsAs SharpSpring is not yet profitable, its main valuation multiple metric would be enterprise value/revenue. The table above shows the EV/revenue (TTM) for SharpSpring and one of its main competitors, HubSpot, over the last few years. HubSpot, being more established and much larger (market cap of USD7.4 billion, versus USD150 million for SharpSpring), is awarded a premium rating. Since early 2018, both companies have benefited from multiple expansion, particularly ShareSpring, which has seen its multiple increase from below 3x to just above 7x at present. Given HubSpot trades at over 12x EV/revenues (TTM) and the 2018 Adobe acquisition of Marketo was priced at 12x revenues, there seems to be room for further multiple expansion for SharpSpring as it continues to establish itself as a significant market player.SharpSpring has a proven growth model providing comparable marketing automation software features at a much lower cost base than its competitors. Its management team has skin in the game and has proven itself very capable. SharpSpring has established itself as the No. 2 player behind HubSpot in the marketing agency vertical in a relatively short period of time, and has ample room to continue to grab market share in a growing market. Its focus on winning digital marketing agencies is working well, and the company is now looking to grow further by expanding clients in agencies, developing and cross-selling new features, and is even contemplating price increases. With a 7.2x LTV:CAC ratio, management is taking the correct steps to aggressively drive new user growth.However, there is a cost to the rapid growth in the form of equity dilution. In March 2019, SharpSpring raised USD10.7 million through an equity offering of around 0.9 million shares at a price of USD13 per share. On May 9, 2019, the company’s USD8 million convertible note issued in March 2018 was retired with an allotment of 1.24 million shares. It is not cheap, but given it has a long growth runaway and attractive economics, I am bullish on SharpSpring."
4236173,67473,2019-01-29T06:39:40-05:00,"Greenhaven Road Capital is a long-biased, concentrated hedge fund. We invest only in our very best ideas – typically 15 long positions or less and a handful of opportunistic short positions.Generally avoiding commodity-based companies, we look for businesses with strong cash flow, normalized earnings, and long term growth horizons.Includes detailed analysis of the fund's positions in KKR, BlueLinx, Fiat Chrysler, Box, SharpSpring, Etsy, Yelp.","Original PostGreenHaven Road Capital commentary for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.Dear Fellow Investors,The fourth quarter was not a profitable one for the partnership. In fact, statistically, it was the least profitable we have had in several years. For investors in the Long-Term Class, returns were approximately -20.7% for the quarter and -10.5% for the year. You may take some solace in the fact that the Russell 2000 was down -22% for the quarter and down -11% for the year.As I have written before, if we want to have the opportunity for significant up quarters, we have to be able to tolerate significant down quarters. We will not get the ups without the downs. Over time, there should be more ups than downs, but there will be both. Despite our Q4 2018 returns, the fund has still outperformed major indices over the last three years, five years, and since inception (eight years). Given the embedded valuations of our holdings, I like our prospects. What goes down can also go up. Our portfolio is stocked with companies I believe have high insider ownership, strong products, attractive valuations, and asymmetric return profiles. While paper losses were incurred in the short term, opportunities were created for the long term.Given that down periods are an inevitability of investing in a concentrated, long-biased fashion, the question is: what do I do during these periods of rapidly declining markets? The simplest solution would be to just time the market. Sell when prices are high, sit out the entirety of the declines, and buy shares right at the bottom just before prices begin their rebound. Sounds good to me. Unfortunately, I don't know how to time the market effectively, nor am I aware of any person or computer that has consistently done so. Inevitably, market timing leads to underinvestment. Portions of the downside are often avoided, but so are the recoveries. Given the positive expected values of our investments over the long term, trying to predict the daily movements of the market is not likely to improve returns. As a result, little effort is devoted to it.Where, then, is effort focused? I try to balance three competing forces during these periods of high volatility and rapidly declining prices. The first is a desire to be a long-term shareholder and just hold tight. Even the highest- quality companies like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) have each had multiple 50%+ drawdowns during their decades of heroic returns. Only those able to endure the pain of such declines actually participated in the 100X+ returns that ultimately were realized by the holders. Doing nothing is far harder than it sounds but is often richly rewarded in the equity markets when you hold a portfolio of companies with high insider ownership, recurring revenue, operating leverage, and the ability to grow with no additional capital.The desire to just hold conflicts with a recognition that volatility creates opportunities. In a period where the average stock in the Russell 2000 is down in excess of 20%, there are hundreds of stocks down 30% or more from their recent highs. A stock that declines 33% has to gain 50% to recoup those losses. Buying fundamentally sound businesses that have sold off for non-fundamental reasons can be a very profitable endeavor. The second competing desire is thus to upgrade our portfolio. Have all of those companies' prospects really diminished by so much so quickly? When my wife hears ""risk off,"" she wants to start stuffing money in our mattress and assume the fetal position - yet in reality, ""risk off"" is shopping time for the value investor. In my past few years of research, I have periodically remarked, ""I would like to own that someday at a better price."" Well, for several companies, ""someday"" came during the fourth quarter. I looked at more companies in greater depth in the fourth quarter than I had in the prior two years.Nearly 90% of stocks in the Russell 2000 were down in the fourth quarter. The overall market was down 12 days in a row at one point. Any ""risk"" taking was met with immediate short-term losses. The final competing force is a desire to survive. I don't mean that I have an intense desire to give into panic, sell everything, and hide under the desk. The fund is my largest investment by orders of magnitude comprising a very, very significant portion of my liquid net worth. I want to invest for decades. I want to be thoughtful about the risks we are taking and make sure that we are disproportionately rewarded. I want to seize opportunities, but to survive markets that can be irrational for long periods of time requires not betting the farm, spreading risks, and seeking asymmetric opportunities where the upside is substantially higher than the downside.Hopefully you just read the previous passages and said to yourself, ""shouldn't the desire to hold, the desire to take advantage of opportunity, and a thoughtful assessment of assumed risks be in place at all times?"" They should be… and they are. Our course of action in the fourth quarter resembled that of every other quarter. While the result was more negative, the process and philosophy were exactly the same. We do not have a new strategy. A portfolio built with a five-year time horizon was not completely tossed because of the volatility of the 64 trading days of the fourth quarter. Rather, we completely exited one position as the original thesis appears to be wrong (more on that later), made some adjustments to existing positions, and initiated three new positions, all with different but I believe highly asymmetric return profiles. If I could recreate the asymmetry of the opportunities available to us in Q4 every quarter, we would all benefit enormously. The seeds of future returns have been planted.During the quarter, we initiated a new position in KKR & Co. (NYSE:KKR), an alternative asset manager founded 42 years ago. Under the leadership of Henry Kravis, the firm has evolved from a single buyout fund to a 1,200- employee asset management firm with offices all over the world. I believe KKR has all of the attributes of a great business.High Insider Ownership: The firm is 40% owned by employees.Recurring Revenue: The fund is increasingly focused on ""permanent"" capital. Currently, 9% of capital is permanent and 80% has eight-plus years of duration at inception.Operating Leverage: Incremental margins are exceptionally high in the asset management business, as compensation is the primary variable cost incurred with each incremental dollar of profit.Aligned Incentives: In addition to 40% insider ownership, the firm has more than $10 billion invested alongside clients in KKR funds. Further, more than half of the KKR AUM is eligible to be charged performance fees. Employees do well when clients do well. Shareholders do well when employees and clients do well.Secular Tailwinds: The alternative asset management industry is growing at approximately 12% per year. I believe that the recent declines in public equities will do nothing to slow pension funds, and others that need to show a path to 8+% annual returns, from allocating away from fixed income and towards private equity - there is no end in sight. Assets have flowed disproportionately to the larger firms, and KKR is taking share within private equity, growing assets at 19% per year since 2004.Runway for Growth: KKR has enormous opportunities for growth, particularly in several large markets such as real estate and infrastructure, where the leading players' AUM is 19X and 10X, respectively, the size of KKR's.Under-earning / Investing in the Future: While KKR has been in business for over four decades, the vast majority of its currently funded strategies have been operating for less than one. Infrastructure; energy; U.S., European, and Asian real estate; Tech and Health Care Growth; Private Credit; and U.S. and European Lending are all less than 10 years old. The economics of a strategy can get substantially better over time. The first fund in a strategy is typically smaller and used to build a track record, and its first year is typically a money-losing period as early management fees often do not offset fundraising expenses. If all goes well, there will be some incentive fees, but the amount is often on the small side because the fund is on the small side. The economics get progressively better as a larger second fund is layered in around year four and potentially an even larger fund is layered in around year eight. Eventually, there can be both sizable management and incentive fees from multiple funds in a strategy, with economics that continue to improve as funds age and grow in size. Given the young age of so many funds at KKR, there is the potential for significantly improved economics over time.Differentiated: KKR has the strongest balance sheet of any of the publicly traded PE firms in terms of cash and investments as a % of total market capitalization. This provides downside protection, but also allows KKR to seed funds and provide additional capital to close deals. The firm also has a Capital Markets group which allows KKR to syndicate deals, reduce cost of capital, and optimize monetization strategies, improving returns and likely generating $500M+ in profitable revenue. KKR is one of a handful of private equity firms that can do ""mega deals"" because of their access to capital on the balance sheet as well as the services of their Capital Markets group.We began purchasing shares in the low $20s and ended purchasing shares in the high teens. What did we get for our money? As of the end of Q3 2018, the firm had $195B in assets under management, and an adjusted book value of $16.68 per share.Let's spend a minute on the balance sheet since it is a large part of the investment thesis. KKR's balance sheet as a percentage of equity value is the highest of any publicly traded asset manager, a fact which is often ignored by sell side analysts as it is easier to compare firms on a P/E basis. KKR uses these internal funds to aggressively seed new funds and invest in existing funds. The asymmetry for the KKR investment is created because of the downside protection provided by the balance sheet and the long duration of the capital it manages.KKR's balance sheet has three attractive components: cash ($2.9B or $3.50 per share), investments ($10.2B or $12+/share), and unrealized carried interest ($1.7B or $2 per share). If you are adding up these totals as we go, you get $17.50 on a $20 stock. Sound too good to be true? Well, there are some liabilities and some ""other assets"" so the stated book value per share is $16.68 per share. In addition, these values are all as of September 30th, before the market swoon. Q4 saw large marked-to-market losses on KKR's investments including the largest holding, First Data Corp. (FDC) (14% portfolio weight as of 9/30), which was down 31% in the quarter. The private companies, which are valued using a mix of public company comparables and discounted cash flows (DCFs), presumably fared far better than First Data Corp. Declines in investment value have a secondary effect of also negatively impacting the unrealized carry. The balance sheet has multiple inputs that we cannot estimate with great precision, but when I back out the parts of ""other investments"" that we don't want to own and make estimates for the impact of the decline of the public markets, there is still north of $13 per share in balance sheet that I am happy to own - in fact, more than happy to own. I personally view the investments on the balance sheet as significantly preferable to cash. Employees own 40% of the company; they also own 40% of these investments and have a track record of compounding capital at high rates. This is their capital, and their incentive compensation is driven off of the returns of the funds in which this capital is invested. It is not unreasonable to believe that the balance sheet investments can compound at double-digit rates (with no fees) for the foreseeable future invested alongside KKR managers.For a company with over $13 per share in attractive balance sheet assets, we also get $195B in assets under management (AUM), almost $60B in dry powder (funds that can be called and added to AUM), and a franchise that is growing market share in an industry that is growing. The firm is lengthening the duration of the capital under management, as well as growing total assets. KKR raised $39B in gross capital in 2017 and should have exceeded this number in 2018 (to be confirmed when the final numbers are released). Even with the number of ""young"" funds the company is currently nurturing, they have still generated after-tax distributable earnings of $1.65 in 2016, $1.66 per share in 2017, and are on pace for $2 in 2018. Ex balance sheet, we are paying sub-4X depressed earnings that should grow. The beauty of KKR is that both components of valuation can grow: the investments and the earnings stream.Earlier I mentioned that KKR has grown AUM at a compounded annual rate of 19% over the past 13 years. While there is some lumpiness in incentive fees, management fees are very stable and growing. The setup is reminiscent of our previous holding of Fortress Investment Group (NYSE:FIG), whose balance sheet was ignored during volatile and ""risk off"" periods (link to our thesis).At the KKR investor day (link to presentation), the company laid out a series of reasonable assumptions (slides 22-23) to double earnings and book value in five years as well as reasonable valuation frameworks (slides 239-246) to derive a $40 stock price as of the July presentation date. Now, there are a lot of ifs and assumptions in here, but I consider it to be a very reasonable path to doubling earnings and book value, and with a little multiple expansion from today's very low base, there is a path to a triple or better in less than five years. I can sleep at night because of the protection provided by the balance sheet, but I dream about the growth in AUM and earnings power that may likely come. In my opinion, this is a fantastic business that became very attractively priced as the market ignored the balance sheet, growth prospects, and earning power of the company. Thank you, Mr. Market. Volatility does have its benefits.In the fourth quarter, we invested in the building products distribution company BlueLinx (NYSE:BXC) for the second time. When we initially invested, the thesis (presented in our Q4 2017 letter) was that were shares were cheap due to non-fundamental factors, including the forced sale of 70% of the company by a private equity fund that was at the end of its life. Despite being a long-term oriented investor, I sold the shares relatively quickly for a substantial gain. I had more faith in the discount to asset value (land) at which the company was trading than I had in the ongoing building products distribution business, which is low margin and cyclical: not my favorite combination. In addition, BlueLinx was subscale relative to competitors and I just thought there were better places to put our capital. Thus, as the valuation gap closed and future returns became less about assets and more about the business, we sold.In March 2018, shortly after we sold the shares, BlueLinx bought its competitor Cedar Creek, which had significant overlap in product lines and geographies. The acquisition created much-needed scale, taking the 10th and 11th largest building distribution companies and combining them to become the 6th largest in the nation and the 3rd largest east of the Rockies. The market loved the deal, which was financed with debt, and sent BXC shares from the high teens to the low $40s in a matter of days as analysts clamored over the potential earnings growth. As stand-alone companies, BlueLinx generated $44M in adjusted EBITDA in 2017 and Cedar Creek generated $60M, so just by combining the two and not issuing any shares, the pro forma company would generate more than twice the EBITDA per share. Even more interesting to forward-looking investors, management showed a path to $50M in cost savings by closing facilities, reducing redundant overhead, and improved purchasing enabled by the larger scale. With the cost savings factored in, on a pro forma basis, the combined BlueLinx + Cedar Creek + cost savings would generate more than $150M in cash per year. After paying interest on the debt, taxes, and CapEx, the company estimated the combined entities would generate $75M in excess cash flow per year. With 9.3M shares outstanding, this is more than $8 per share in free cash flow. Even at $40 per share, this translates into a 20% free cash flow yield to the equity, IF the savings could be realized.At its core, BlueLinx is a self-help story about realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Is $50M in savings realistic? It represents a 1.5% improvement in the gross margin and looks very achievable. In fact, it may be conservative. There have been several positive data points since the March acquisition. For example, at every turn management has reiterated this cost saving goal and their ability to achieve it. In fact, on the last quarterly call, in addition to reiterating their confidence, management stated that they were ahead of schedule in terms of realizations, and under budget. Other data points include the CEO of Cedar Creek deciding to join BlueLinx as COO, relocate his family to Atlanta, and tie his entire bonus to the realization of the cost savings. The company has consolidated more than 10 out of 70 facilities and management has made several open market purchases of stock. Collectively, these data points are all incrementally positive.So, what drove the stock from $42 on September 12th to $21 in early December? There are certainly macro concerns about housing, which fared very poorly during the ""great recession."" As a distributor of building products, revenues are clearly tied to construction activity. If one believes that housing starts are going to be depressed for the next five years, BlueLinx is not a stock to own.However, there is a strong argument to be made that there are demographic tailwinds to housing over time. Single-family housing starts in the United States bottomed out in the recession at just below 450,000 per year and have increased to approximately 850,000 in 2018, nine years later. It is estimated that just over 1M single-family homes per year are required to accommodate population growth and replacement from fires, floods, termites etc., so we have been under-producing new houses for the last decade. The surpluses from before the great recession have been absorbed. Can new housing starts pull back for six months or a year? Absolutely. But with the 10-year bond ending 2018 at a multi-month low and unemployment sub-4%, single-family home starts remaining around 850,000 does not feel wildly optimistic.In 2018, virtually all housing-related stocks sold off, it was just a question of how much. For a housing bear, BlueLinx is an interesting target. The company does not screen well for computers, there are no sell side analysts or consensus estimates, and the historical numbers don't capture any of the potential cost savings described above. As a result of the Cedar Creek acquisition, which has the potential to be wonderful in the long term, current debt has increased dramatically and large one-time expenses are being incurred to close redundant facilities and merge operations. Many of the machines may not factor in the qualitative attributes that attract me. Short interest increased dramatically in the fourth quarter as the BXC price declined. Score one for the machines.BXC short sellers likely focus on the headline debt figures. Following the Cedar Creek acquisition, BlueLinx balance sheet has almost $600M of debt between a $179M term loan and a $415M asset-backed loan (real estate and inventory). On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has generated $80M of adjusted EBITDA. In other words, the stated debt is more than 7X the trailing EBITDA. Neither machines nor humans like low margin, cyclical business with minimal debt coverage.Let's take a minute and look at the balance sheet more closely. There is more than $400M in inventory and $285M in receivables against the previously mentioned $594MM in debt plus $153M in accounts payable. The company is in the process of closing more than 10 distribution centers (out of 70). They have not guided to any reduction in inventory, but it certainly would not surprise me to see the inventory decline and thus reduce the level of the asset- backed loan. There is also an opportunity to shift dollars owed from the asset-backed loan to accounts payable, effectively letting vendors provide more financing. Will the money still be owed? Yes, but it will likely improve how the company screens. The company is also selling two newly-closed redundant facilities that are expected to fetch in excess of $25M. Further, just operating the business will reduce the leverage. The asset sales, inventory reduction, vendor financing, and cash generation from the business should reduce the asset-backed loan by well over $100M (and possibly significantly more) in 2019. While the headline debt appears high, given all of the offsetting and liquid assets - and with the receivables and inventory - the risks of distress are far more remote than the debt to EBITDA coverage ratio would imply.The third factor likely driving the decline in the BXC share price was exposure to the price of lumber, which is volatile and can be driven by macro fears about future housing demand as well as different trade policies. I am by no means an expert in the lumber market and I don't have a view on where it is headed. Over the course of the third quarter, the price of lumber effectively went straight down: a once-in-every-four-years type of move. The fear was this would lead to depressed earnings. Even though the company only carries about 30 days of inventory of commodity goods like plywood, they were losing money on sales since they had paid higher prices for the inventory but were forced to adjust their customer prices to market prices. Management spent a disproportionate amount of time discussing lumber prices on their conference call as investors were clearly focused on it. From my perspective, lumber will go up and down over a three- to five-year timeframe, but it will not be the driving factor in the success of the BlueLinx business or our investment. Machines and investors focused on quarterly earnings can obsess over commodity prices. The company just weathered a once-in-five-years negative move in lumber; this should not be our focus.Yes, BlueLinx's fortunes are in part tied to new house construction, but the non-cyclical ""self-help"" earnings improvements and the nature of the balance sheet provide downside protection. In a softer new home building market, the company would reduce inventory, thus reducing debt levels. In addition, the company can continue to do sale leasebacks of owned properties. If housing starts were to go down 20%, BlueLinx would likely remain profitable and continue to reduce debt. Bankruptcy is far more remote of an event than a simple historical debt/EBITDA calculation would indicate. This is not to say that the share price cannot decline (this was an $8 stock not too long ago), but I believe that on a risk adjusted basis, there is substantially more upside than downside embedded in the prices, even factoring in the cyclicality and debt.Carved into the Mount Rushmore of special-situation investing is Joel Greenblatt, author of ""You Can be a Stock Market Genius,"" former manager of Gotham Capital (which returned over 40% annually for almost two decades), and professor of the hardest class to get into at Columbia Business School. I believe BlueLinx has many of the attributes of a Greenblatt special situation: no sell side analysts, moving parts, insider buying, distorted financial statements, and asymmetry. Perhaps we should not be surprised that the godfather himself was rumored to have attended BlueLinx's annual meeting. I suspect that he approves of BXC. If housing is stable, there is a clear path to a triple. If housing improves or the savings come in better than expected… Thank you, Mr. Market and your machine friends.During Q4, Greenhaven invested in Radisson Hotels AB (STO:RADH), a Swedish-listed equity that provides ownership in the European operations of Radisson Hotels. In August, a deal was announced for Chinese conglomerate Jin Jiang to acquire a majority stake in RADH. Without muddling this letter with all of the game theory and intricacies of Swedish takeover law, when we bought our initial shares at 36 kroner, there was a virtually guaranteed forthcoming offer of 35 kroner to all shareholders and reasons to believe it could be substantially higher (3% downside/20%+ upside). When we bought our second and larger tranche of shares, the price was at just over 40 kroner, keeping pace with Jin Jiang's revised offer of 40 kroner/share with the possibility of a substantially higher bid (1/2% downside/20% upside). In early January, Jin Jang came back with a final bid of 42.50 kroner, which was not as high as I believed possible but generated a double-digit return for Greenhaven with very little risk and in just a few weeks. I would invest in this type of situations - less than 1% downside for significant upside - all day every day if I could. We have reinvested the capital into a new position to be discussed in the next letter.Any confidence that I had in predicting how a Chinese conglomerate would navigate Swedish M&A law was made possible by Brad Hathaway of Far View Capital, in which the Greenhaven Road Partners Fund is invested. Brad presented Radisson Hotels at a Partners Fund dinner early last year, long before Jin Jiang and Greenhaven Road became attracted to the opportunity.Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) - We can add Fiat Chrysler to the long list of companies whose short-term stock price movements bear little relationship to the current operations or future earnings of the company. FCAU stock declined 15% in the quarter despite announcing the long-anticipated sale of the parts division, which contributed roughly 10% of EBITDA for 30% of the value of the company… despite announcing strong U.S. unit volumes every month during the quarter (+15%, +16%, +17%)… despite unveiling the Gladiator, a new Jeep pickup truck (a white space product) that has gotten rave reviews and will likely generate strong margins and profits when it goes on sale in 2019).Going forward, FCAU will have a very strong balance sheet post-sale of the Magneti Marelli parts division. Net of cash, the stock is trading sub 2X EBIT after taking share last year with the new Ram pickup and continued growth in Jeep. I had hopes for a tender offer of shares after the Magneti Marelli sale. That has not yet materialized, but the sale is not expected to close until Q2 2019. Despite all of the negative headlines, the U.S. auto market actually grew in 2018. There has been a prolonged pause in the share price of FCAU, but there has been robust growth in earnings power and net cash on the balance sheet. Fundamentals will matter again. The Agnelli family controls this business. They have a generational timeline, not a quarterly one. Eventually, the gap will close between price and value, and when it does, we are not playing for a 5% move.Radisson Hospitality AB - Discussed above.Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) - was a new position last quarter (link to our Q3 letter). The combination of very low churn (sub 5% per year), a large attractive customer base (69% of the Fortune 500), a pipeline of new very high margin products to sell into this base of customers, and an undemanding valuation provides an interesting set-up for acquisition or long-term compounding.SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) - This SAAS business sells marketing automation tools, acquiring customers at a fraction of their expected long term value (LTV/CAC > 6) with a flagship product that is growing well in excess of 40% per year and a long runway for growth.Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) - This is a healthy two-sided marketplace with improving economics driven by pricing changes that will better monetize the existing traffic. Management is investing in growth, improving the user experience for shoppers and the tools for sellers. We trimmed our position during Q4 because it is the highest multiple stock in our portfolio as well as the most susceptible to multiple compression. Etsy is also one of the best businesses that we own and is carving out a nice position as an alternative to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The fund remains short ETFs targeted at short-term traders, a bond fund where the underlying interest rates received relative to the risk assumed do not pass my common-sense test, and two indices. One of the benefits of the volatility is that the persistent, across-the-board upward march of all stocks has ended and we now have a far better environment for short selling. While we will undoubtedly remain a very long biased fund, it would not surprise me if we added a few shorts over the coming quarters.I make it a practice to inform the partnership of significant new purchases in these letters. I want you to have a sense of what we own and why we own it, thus providing context to our historical and future returns. I tend not to highlight when we exit a company. However, in the case of Yelp (NYSE:YELP), I think it is instructive. Yelp was a top five position for multiple quarters and I spent a fair amount of time in the previous letters explaining how I thought a tweak to their business model - getting rid of one-year contracts for advertisers - would increase trial of their product and ultimately grow their base of advertisers. The thesis passed a common-sense test and, in fact, the company was experiencing growth on a year-over-year basis as well as on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Given the operating leverage in the Yelp business model, I was quite excited by the possibility of sustained growth.What happened? When Yelp reported their quarterly results, their paying advertiser accounts did not grow. They had 194,000 paying advertisers on June 30 and 194,000 on September 30. Not growing for one quarter is not a reason in itself to sell an investment we entered with a three- to five-year time horizon. However, in the context of a company that just made trying the product easier, it was disconcerting to see no growth at all in the number of advertisers. Management cited some operational issues that may in fact reverse themselves, and exiting maybe an over-reaction, but I just could not get over the fact that the advertiser count stayed flat despite the term changes and the activity of Yelp's sales force, which totals over 3,000 people. So even with easier selling terms, three thousand salespeople could not grow the number of advertisers. It took that many people to just replace the advertisers that were leaving. Again, the issues at Yelp maybe temporary, and the Yelp valuation is not demanding, but 3,000+ salespeople running around, meeting business owners, and making phone calls to sell a more consumable package ending that quarter with a net result of no growth in advertisers does not give me cheery thoughts. Ultimately, the thesis that changing the contract terms will have great long-term benefits for the company may be true, but in the intermediate term, there are real product and execution risks.We expect to have K1s ready by the first week of March. If you have any questions in the interim, please reach out to Ally (investorrelations@greenhavenroad.com). For our tax-paying LPs, the K1 should not be a major event as realized gains were largely offset with realized losses.The headlines around us are dire. Our government is not functioning, literally not functioning, as we continue to experience the longest government shutdown in our nation's history. Just about every financial headline is negative. We have the seemingly contradictory narrative of ""interest rates are rising; this is going to kill the economy"" as well as ""interest rates are falling because the economy is weakening."" Of course, implied by both of those headlines is that the economy is currently strong, but that is rarely explicitly stated.The fourth quarter saw the return of the +2% or -2% day in the market with the S&P 500's average daily move exceeding 1% per day. In reality, the fortunes of the companies we are investing in are not rising and falling by 1% per day. The future cash flows of Box are not declining by 1%, 2% or more because of a single tweet emanating from the White House. My job is to make sure we do not conflate negative short-term results with a broken process.In my opinion, there are macro headwinds and multiples may compress, but there are also great companies like KKR that that will adapt and prosper. We only need to find a couple a year and hold on through the noise. Just as I ended the last letter - as volatility arises, I will attempt to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. We will continue to invest with a long time horizon, and we will continue to invest like it is our own money - because it is. Thank you for the opportunity to grow your family capital alongside mine.Sincerely,Scott MillerEditor’s Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

The U.S. focused company is often considered as a budget HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), itself a company worth considering an investment in. Customer reviews of SharpSpring tend to praise its low costs and its active involvement with clients. SharpSpring is also very much the junior to companies like HubSpot in other ways, from its micro-scale market cap of $39.2m, as against HUBS's $2.363bn, its share price, which at $4.47 is 6.5% of HUBS's value, to the returns its stock has generated over the past 12 months: approximately 10%, as against HUBS's 47.28%.At first glance, HubSpot, as an example of a rival in the automated marketing sector, is simply a safer and more attractive investment, and why back a potentially weak horse, when you can bet on the winner? This isn't necessarily a poor assessment, but SHSP does have a potentially significant longer-term upside.SHSP - One Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg.Change, if not volatility, has been the watchword for anyone who's been following SharpSpring over the last several years, as the below graphic illustrates. Bought up by the company SMTP in August 2014, SharpSpring, during the next year effectively ate its parent company up from the inside out. As CEO Rick Carlson noted when SMTP changed its name to that of its erstwhile purchase, SharpSpring went from being ""the smallest piece of the overall business to the largest piece."" This is an impressive feat, made all the more so since it was achieved in just over a year. SHSP was bought by SMTP in August 2014, and by December 1st, 2015, the company had rebranded under the SharpSpring banner.SHSP History - Source: Tech Opportunities/Seeking AlphaSharpSpring, however, isn't just a feel-good narrative about the little acquisition that could. There is a lot to like about the micro-cap Florida-based company. The field SharpSpring operates in, it is true, already has several market leaders, and the company might be considered too small to properly compete in the marketing automation sector. That said, SharpSpring's agency and small business focus gives it a niche in which to operate. Focusing on selling to agencies which represent small businesses allows the company to keep costs low and channels its reach beyond what it could do on its own. SHSP's agency figures, the number of digital agencies it sells to on its books is actually quite a meaningful proportional share of the market. SharpSpring currently has 1,139 agencies on its books, and a total of 5,250 business users. Furthermore, the growth of SHSP's customer base from 2,925 at the end of 2015 to 5,250 by the start of 2017 is an excellent year's work. This means that by the end of 2016, SharpSpring almost doubled its user base and acquired 33% more new customers than it did in 2015. Lastly, and most impressively, SharpSpring, according to a Mirren-RSW/US report, posted the highest 2016 growth in industry usage levels, absorbed the highest proportion of available market share, and increased its core agency market penetration by a spectacular 440%.SHSP CEO, Rick Carlson, looks back on 2016. Source: Bloomberg.SharpSpring ranked second in the automated marketing for agencies space, again according to Mirren-RSW, also saw itself ranked on Deloitte's 2016 Technology Fast 500, and looking closer at the company's yearly performance, the highest returns available came with an April share purchase ($3.16), and an October sale ($5.75). This would have netted you a 45% return on your investment. Not bad for eight months. Since then, the company has twice reached similar highs and twice dropped to present lows, signaling some volatility around the stock. Current lows, it should be said, do not necessarily reflect the company's fundamentals, and with Q4 results in, there is plenty of reason to cheer.Q4 revenues are up 11% year on year, at $2.9m, with full year figures up 26%. Core product revenues have risen 109%. The company has completed the consolidation process following its divestment of SMTP and the aging GraphicMail, and remaining legacy aspects of this process are in managed decline. Q4 gross profit remained stable, but was a lower percentage of total revenue at 59%, down from 64%, and yearly gross profits were up 10% at $7m. Yearly gross margins have, however, fallen, as growth-targeted spending increases.The downside is that, as a company, SharpSpring still makes a net loss, reporting Q4 losses of $2.2m, or -$.26 a share, and yearly losses of $5.2m or -$1.51 a share. It's worth noting, however, that these figures are improvements, of 50 percent and 45 percent, respectively. EBITA losses disappointingly rose from $2.9m to $3.8m (-24%), whilst core losses, excluding amortization, acquisition-related costs, stock compensation expenses, and restructuring expenses, remained stable in value terms at $2.5m, but fell per share from -$.40 to $-.31 (+23%).SHSP Forecast Earnings. Source: NasdaqThere are reasons to be cautious about an investment in SharpSpring. The company, despite its excellent performance, is, in terms of spending power, a sheep amidst the wolves of the industry. Any investment at present, especially if long term in nature, risks dilution, given that SharpSpring is betting on an adjusted EBITDA break-even point being reached in Q4 2017. Cash reserves are falling, down from $11.6m in Q3 to $8.7m in Q4 (-25%). If this trend continues, by Q4 2017, cash reserves will have dwindled to just over $2m, and although CFO Ed Lawton expects ""cash on hand and [SHSP's available] credit facility to remain an adequate source of funds"", medium-term profitability is absolutely key to the company's strategy. Furthermore, owing to the company's size, SharpSpring might find itself forced to accept an M&A offer below a fair value, which would in turn damage any potential stock investment.The above said, with consolidation out of the way, and renewed focus generated by the fact that SharpSpring now has a single purpose: the growth of its marketing platform, there is plenty of upside potential for the company. Targeted investments have been made to support infrastructure and sales growth, which, while they will add to pressures on gross margins, are both necessary and likely to bear fruit. Indeed, SharpSpring's now narrowed focus has already seen increases in lead flow in Q1, as per its March earnings call, and R&D remains an investment focus. The Florida company has also boosted its partnerships, agreeing deals with Shutterstock (NYSE:SSTK), the world's leading stock photo provider, to boost its product offering, and Enthusem, a personalized mail targeting platform, in order to add further personalization to SharpSpring's advertising suite.SHSP CEO, Rick Carlson, Upbeat for 2017. Source: BloombergSHSP - One Month Share Price Performance. Source: Bloomberg.As far as SHSP's current share price performance is concerned, there are some negative indications that would suggest holding fire for the moment. The company's stock has plunged by 18% in the past two days, suggesting that markets have digested the Q4 report and do not like what they have seen. Given that recently released figures are, from a long-term perspective, broadly positive, it is only possible to speculate as to the cause for the recent slump. Investor impatience, or worries about SharpSpring's long-term profitability, given the decline in the company's cash reserves, are certainly possible causes for SHSP's plunging share price. According to Stockinvest.us, trading volume in SHSP has also concurrently increased, however, on falling prices. This increases the risk of the sell-off around St. Patrick's Day continuing. Since January, SharpSpring has been slowly declining in value, with a February rally seemingly now going into reverse, so caution should be exercised in taking a position in the company until prices seem to have stabilized.The FT's Forecast for SHSP. Source: FTPutting aside the present share price decline for SharpSpring, which can also be seen as an opportunity to buy the company at a low, once its stock stabilizes, SHSP offers an interesting long-term investment route into the marketing automation industry. According to MarketsandMarkets, by 2019, this industry will reach $5.5bn in value, with a CAGR of 8.55%. SharpSpring is small, focused, and if it can manage to break even without the need of further capital investment, it is likely to see its share price take off. SHSP is a risky investment, and, despite its many impressive qualities and feats, it may find itself unable to stay the course, but SharpSpring certainly has both the product offering and the scope for growth in 2017.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4005952,101708,2016-09-14T14:24:23-04:00,"Venture capital like opportunity in terms of business stage and investment returns available.Microcap SaaS with unique and sustainable model to win versus higher priced, larger competitors.Participates in attractive and rapidly growing marketing automation space.Adequate downside protection and compensation for very low liquidity while waiting for equity story to be understood.","Our basic thesis for an investment in SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) is straightforward: buying into a differentiated, high-growth SaaS business at a meaningful discount to what venture capital and growth equity firms would pay. Our base case estimates a fair value of $19 per share and a target IRR of 62% through mid-2019.Why Does This Opportunity Exist?Microcap - With a market cap of roughly $40 million, an average daily trading volume of $75,000 and meaningful executive holdings reducing float, SharpSpring actually does fit a definition of ""under the radar."" This is the smallest public security we have ever directly invested in and have dealt with ""trades by appointment only"" dynamic as we have built our long position. In many ways, this is a venture capital/growth equity deal that is orphaned on the public markets.Complicated Story - SharpSpring has undergone a significant number of changes in the last two years (see graphic below), including a name change and new ticker listing from its predecessor business, divesting a cash cow email relay product, completed two acquisitions and appointed a new CEO. Relative to its market capitalization, this has been a story that required ""too much work"" for most institutional investors. We believe the equity story has been simplified greatly via the divestiture of SMTP and exclusive focus on the SharpSpring product line.Competition - SharpSpring competes with large, well-known marketing automation platforms like HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) and Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO). Without a close examination of SharpSpring's differentiated pricing and agency focus, the stock could easily be dismissed as ""too small to win"" versus the market leaders.SharpSpring - Brief OverviewSharpSpring provides marketing automation software. In plain English, software for marketing departments and businesses to automate and more effectively market on multiple channels online (like email, the business's website, social media, lead generation, etc.).The overall marketing automation sector is estimated to be a $1.8 billion market growing 60% annually. Representative competitors familiar to investors include HubSpot, Pardot and ExactTarget (EXTG) by Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Marketo and Eloqua. We encourage readers to review SHSP's Investor Presentation available on its website.SharpSpring's model is differentiated through a primary focus on Small and Medium Business (aka SMB) segment through the digital agency channel. More simply, SHSP targets one digital agency that represents 10 SMBs instead of directly selling to those 10 SMBs. This channel model and associated customer acquisition efficiency allow SHSP to sustainably price its product - the number 1 pain point for end buyers - well below its larger competitors.SHSP has been able to achieve a meaningful market share amongst US digital agencies (see graphic below). Our sector diligence highlighted the profit opportunity for agencies as ""resellers"" of the SHSP product instead of a ""margin free"" cost pass through to clients.We view the agency segment as an attractive (and potentially under-appreciated) area of marketing technology (an area we have actively mapped since 2011). The responsibilities and scope of knowledge a marketer needs to know today are dramatically different than even three years ago. Competencies range from content marketing, multiple social media platforms, analytics, SEO, online advertising, email, and lead generation - all of which have unique and evolving knowledge requirements in their domain. For most small and middle market businesses, it is increasingly hard to maintain these capabilities in-house, leading to widespread adoption of third-party digital marketing agencies.Well Regarded ProductOur analysis of product reviews of SharpSpring has been positive and consistent with a product growing at over 100% annually. Selected quotes from digital agency reviewers on software review platform TrustRadius:We also note that SharpSpring integrates via API with a wide range of software products via the Zapier ""integrations as a service"" platform. In plain English, the scope of integrations offered via Zapier allows SharpSpring to compete on equal footing with the larger platforms.Marketing Automation Industry Channel CheckThe overall growth curve of the marketing automation industry was central to our initial interest in SharpSpring. As a ""channel check"" on industry growth rates, we used Datanyze (a software product that programmatically calculates technology market share via webscraping) to look at monthly product adoption rates:As shown above, the overall marketing automation industry has been gaining roughly 3,000 customers per month since January 2015. At industry-wide price points, this equates to $1.5 billion of annual recurring revenue growth entering the marketing automation sector. This would represent over a market growth rate of 80% - significantly above the 60% figure cited in SHSP's Investor Presentation.We also note that SHSP's ~110% growth rate implies substantial market share gains.Customer Acquisition and Unit EconomicsSharpSping's agency focus and channel model is reflected in customer acquisition costs significantly below its competitors.SHSP is able to earn pre-tax IRRs of nearly 100% on marketing investments. Combined with the $15 million of cash raised through the SMTP divestiture, these returns on marketing spend are a key driver of SHSP's growth potential in a capital efficient manner.Given our bias towards marketing and capital efficiency in potential SaaS investments, we often look favorably upon the ""market drafter"" competing with the ""market builder.""Within marketing automation, HubSpot serves as a market builder; with over $100 million of marketing spend, organizing the highly regarded and well attended InBound marketing conference and the generation of over 1 million leads per year, HUBS provides education and generates awareness among SMB marketers. A portion of this demand generated will end up at the ""market drafter"" for free - for SharpSpring this will often be SMBs that cannot afford the HubSpot product or chose to hire a marketing agency. For this model to work, the ""market drafter"" must be differentiated, particularly in terms of lower cost - SharpSpring meets these criteria.Growth OpportunitiesSharpSpring has build a solid awareness ""from scratch"" with a brand that is much younger versus its peers, as reflected in the Google Trends volume presented below. We note that ""SharpSpring pricing"" is a breaking out search term, reflecting a high purchase interest/intent.However, we believe there are ample growth opportunities for SharpSpring across a number of areas, including search engine optimization (aka SEO), content marketing, branding and PR.We can use SEO as a relevant example with two important search terms - ""HubSpot alternative"" and ""HubSpot vs. SharpSpring."" The linked SharpSpring website content for each ranks poorly in Google results and is poorly optimized for conversion or even collecting visitor information for lead generation purposes.We note that SharpSpring should be less dependent on Google search rankings given its agency model - simply marketers that work in the industry everyday do not begin their marketing software selection process with very generic Google searches.Valuation DiscussionThe public and M&A markets have been quite receptive to the marketing automation space:As active investors in the private software and technology market, we find SharpSpring to be a compelling value opportunity for a growth-stage company. An analogous business - with slightly less revenue, slower growth, less traction and a less compelling end market - is in middle of a Series C fundraise at a revenue multiple in excess of 10x. Pro forma for the SMTP divestiture, SharpSpring is trading at an enterprise value/trailing 12-month core revenue of 2.5x.If SharpSpring were for sale in the private marketplace, we believe a substantial number of growth equity and later stage venture firms would have interest at a price above today's public market value. Those investors would price their investment at a required 4-5x return. This return level is consistent with our own requirements for investing in an ill-liquid and risky microcap.Based upon on our own model forecasts for SharpSpring's performance over the next three years, we believe those equity returns targets are achievable.Base Case - $19.00 per share. Forecasted with substantial but moderating revenue growth rate and an exit multiple of 4x forward revenue.Upside Case - $25.00 per share.Downside Case - $3.00 per share.RisksThere are a number of risks attendant with investing in a microcap at this stage of maturity, including but not limited to:Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3211316,66603,2015-05-27T11:13:00-04:00,"Insiders of SMTP have purchased $5 million of stock in the recent announcement, which is 16% of the market cap.Although SharpSpring is a new entrant in one of the hottest industries, some smart business strategies have helped it achieve amazing growth since the product launch in early 2014.The marketing automation industry is not only fast growing but also has high switching costs and a low churn rate.A detailed valuation model shows that the stock has much more upside potential than the downside risk.While a micro cap may not achieve even half of the multiples of its peers, it could get acquired more easily, especially when the majority owner is a motivated seller.","The Business BackgroundSMTP (SMTP) was one of the early pioneers of cloud-based email services and has now grown over the last decade to provide a wide range of business-to-business marketing and services worldwide. The original SMTP before the recent acquisitions was focused on the email delivery segment. Its service helps to improve the email delivery success rate since many emails are being blocked as junk mails. With SMTP's vast collection of whitelisted IP addresses, businesses can improve their email delivery success rate. The service is offered at a very cheap rate starting at $15 per month.In my opinion, the main competitive strength of SMTP's original email delivery business is in its name. As we all know, SMTP stands for ""Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"" and it's well-known to many people including many regular users of email software. Having this name as the brand name will allow it to show up in Google searches much more often. Essentially, it gives brand name recognition without any marketing/sales cost. In the last five years, the business' revenue almost doubled without much marketing/sales expense. For this reason, the business' original majority owner Semyon Dukach had used it as a cash cow (it used to pay a good dividend) to fund his other venture investments.Recently, however, SMTP's growth has slowed down. To seek further growth in the business, it has to think beyond the original business model. The company made two acquisitions in the second half of 2014. One is GraphicMail, an email marketing service company that primarily serves international markets. The other is SharpSpring, a new marketing automation product which was just launched in early 2014.These two acquisitions are supposed to take the company from just email delivery to one with a fully integrated email and marketing service product. The synergies are supposed to be combining the existing product and brand name with the new sales team in GraphicMail plus the new marketing automation product from SharpSpring. Of course, any acquisition has a ""synergy"" story behind it; whether it is true or not requires a detailed analysis. Also, any synergies also should be quantified in a realistic and conservative analysis and compared with the acquisition price.GraphicMailGraphicMail's latest revenue was about $5 million, and the purchase price also was $5 million. With the price to sales ratio of 1:1, this seems to be a cheap price, although we have to keep in mind that GraphicMail was not highly profitable in the past. The management only mentioned that it was profitable, but didn't mention how profitable it was. Usually, I take the message as ""it was not very profitable at all."" However, management also mentioned that they expect the eventual operating margin to be around 15% after the synergies are realized. This seems to be good news. I consider this number is possible since SMTP's delivery platform will save the backend cost for GraphicMail. Furthermore, it would also allow it to take larger customers given the SMTP delivery platform's high capacity. In fact, in Q1 2015 alone, it brought some large customers with $250,000 in new revenue. This may suggest maybe about a $1 million run rate of new revenue for the year.An even more important synergy seems to be the sales force GraphicMail already had in the international markets, especially the third-party resellers network. This may allow them to cross-sell a good product such as SharpSpring's marketing automation product to international markets. As the CEO Jonathan Strimling said, the international market is more of a greenfield for marketing automation, and these markets are still 1-4 years behind the U.S. market.SharpSpringSharpSpring was founded by its CEO Rick Carlson in late 2011, but it seems that he only got the first round of funding in November 2012. In just one year, the product got into shape and had an initial launch in early 2014. Since then, it had experienced amazing growth for such a small company, quickly getting 250 agency customers and 1,000 integrated websites by the end of 2014.The acquisition price for SharpSpring was $5 million initial payment, plus $10 million earn-out if its annual recurring revenue can reach $5 million by the end of 2015. Essentially, it is buying a high-growth company at 3 times of its sales. Given its high growth rate, high gross margin and low churn rate usually seen in the marketing automation industry, this price should be considered as a fair price.Recent Insider BuyingThe original earn-out deal with SharpSpring owners was 40% stock and 60% cash. This means SMTP will pay out $6 million in cash and $4 million in stock. On May 18th, they announced a new deal where SharpSpring owners will convert half of the potential cash earn-out to SMTP stock at $5.5 per share. In the meantime, the two largest shareholders of SMTP agreed to purchase $2 million worth of stock at $5.5 per share. This means a total of $5 million insider buying.The share price of SMTP immediately went up nearly 10% after this news release, and I believe this price action is warranted for two reasons:1. It shows the confidence of insiders. The owners of SharpSpring originally agreed to sell the business for an exchange of 60% cash and only 40% stock. They may like SMTP stock better now, but certainly not for the reason of selling it right after or in the near future. This is because SMTP is a very illiquid stock and very hard to sell in the open market. Now they voluntarily agreed to exchange half of the cash earn-out for stocks likely only for one reason: they believe SMTP's share price is cheap relative to its growth potential.2. Higher ownership stake in SMTP will allow the owners of SharpSpring to have more incentive to bring the business to the next level. One drawback commonly seen in an acquisition is that the business owner and the employees do not have much incentive to work as hard as before. Even though there was a setup for earn-out, this structure only lasts for one year. Now, the deal becomes 70% stock and 30% cash and will give the owner and the CEO much more incentive to work harder in the coming years.3. Based on the latest SEC filing, at least $1 million of that $3 million stock conversion is from SharpSpring founder and CEO Rick Carlson. This is much more significant than some venture capital fund managers making the same amount of commitment. The reason is that Carlson seems to have limited cash asset himself, so this is a very large commitment. Plus, he knows a lot more about the business and industry than anyone else.Besides this large commitment, other insiders also are buying at the open market. The new CFO Lawton Seymour bought twice at prices ranging from $4.65 to $5.10. Another officer Eckert Joseph also bought 5,000 shares at $5.17. Although the total amount is still relatively small compared to their salary, it is still a good sign.Marketing Automation IndustryThe marketing automation industry is a new industry with very fast growth (almost 50% annual growth for the industry leaders), and it is one of the hottest sectors in today's market, with industry leaders like HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) and Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) being traded at 10 times of sales. In some sense, there are reasons for this optimism as this is a new method of marketing, much smarter than the traditional methods.Besides the high growth, this business also has high switching costs not only in terms of the learning curve but also related to the data accumulated within a specific platform. As we can imagine, transferring the marketing data of each customer from one platform to another platform is difficult and risky for their clients since the platforms usually use different data formats. This high switching cost seems to have been confirmed in the low churn rate found in the industry. Usually, the average monthly churn rate is about 0.7%. Considering the fact that many new customers are just using it for testing and trial purpose, the actual churn rate for the existing established customers may be even lower than that.Currently, SharpSpring is still very small in this space. Its customer base is probably only 5% of HubSpot's. However, it is growing very fast, actually much faster than its peers considering its limited resource. For example, the new customer additions are about 200 per month for SharpSpring and about 1,000 for HubSpot, but relative to its size and spending, HubSpot should have a much higher growth. At the current speed, SharpSpring will triple its size in one year by the end of 2015, reaching more than $5 million in annual recurring revenue, and get into the top 6 of the industry.SharpSpring's Business StrategiesI have always been fascinated by the smart business strategies employed by the new entrants. Using an analogy of warfare, this means a small force can fight against a much larger army. Granted, it is a very hard uphill struggle, and yet many smart players were able to achieve it.Usually, the incumbents in an industry have many advantages:1. Economy of Scale.This advantage is especially significant for an industry with very high fixed costs.2. Easy access to capital.This could be access to equity capital, corporate bond market or bank loans.3. More resource for spending on marketing and sales force.4. Established brand name.The past marketing effort usually has already built an intangible asset on the brand name. Besides that, the market share alone can serve as good evidence for its quality, even though it is often far from the truth.In order to fight with the incumbents behind the well-fortified fortress and a wide moat, I have seen the following strategies the new entrants used to enter a market:1. A differentiated product.There is often a particular market segment not being well served in the past. If the new entrant can capture this market segment and build its own niche market around it, it can enter the market to set up a foothold without much sacrifice on margins.2. Low Price.To lure customers away from the incumbents, the new entrants sometimes use a disruptive pricing model to get attention. This strategy is more effective on a commodity product, but usually also has some effect in other products since there's always a low-end market segment in almost any industry. That said, lower price is hard to achieve since the smaller firm usually already suffers from the disadvantage on economies of scale. Any further price reduction often requires either a huge sacrifice on margins or a completely different business model.3. New technology.Although incumbents are more powerful, they are less nimble to adopt new technologies. This is partly because they are doing great on the existing products and are more afraid of the uncertainties associated with the new technology and its cannibalizing effects, and partly because there is enough sunk cost in the existing technology, both in terms of fixed asset and in terms of human capital invested with a particular technology. There also is an element of bureaucracy, arrogance and complacency that makes big firms less willing to change or slower to change. In the meantime, the new entrants are like newborn babies: they start from the scratch and are willing to adopt the best and most efficient ways.Back to SharpSpring, I found the CEO Rick Carlson to be very smart in his business strategies on how to enter the industry. The marketing automation products are not much different in terms of features. In fact, many of the existing products have about the same set of features. Therefore, they are more competing in terms of marketing/sales effort, the ease of adoption/integration, and the tech support. Carlson was apparently well aware of this fact. He knew that SharpSpring lacked the resources to compete against the big players such as HubSpot or Marketo. Those players have huge resources based on their market valuation in the stock market. They can spend big dollars on marketing/sales, but SharpSpring can't. For this reason, he relied on the following five strategies:1. Leverage third-party resource for marketing.This is the smartest part of the strategy. Given the importance of marketing and the limited resource of SharpSpring, Carlson knows that it is very hard to compete with industry leaders such as HubSpot and Marketo. For this reason, he leverages the third-party resource or third-party resellers to do the marketing instead. In this case, it is the marketing agencies he is relying upon.He gave marketing agencies enough incentives (sometimes at 1/10 of the competitor's pricing) so that he doesn't have to do much of the marketing/sales. Besides marketing, agencies also will take over some of the support work off his shoulders as they have to be responsible for supporting their own customers.2. Offer low price.As mentioned above, SharpSpring's pricing is much cheaper than the big competitors. It is not just cheaper for agencies but also for individual clients as well. Although the exact pricing is not disclosed, I heard from some people that there is a cap on the maximum monthly charges for individual clients. So as the customer grows, its monthly bill will not go linearly with their client base, but capped at a certain amount instead.3. Provide excellent customer support.Marketing automation has a big learning curve for most customers. This makes tech support very important. Again, the CEO is very dedicated to providing the best support to his customers. He is actually willing to give his cell phone number to all the customers. Considering that there are hundreds of customers, this is a big commitment.4. Make product easier to use.When Carlson founded the company, he had one thing in mind: make marketing automation easier to use. I have seen their promotion videos to emphasize on this special feature. This feature also is mentioned in several customers' reviews, although not in all of them.Another nice feature SharpSpring has is to allow easy integration with many different CRM platforms. For those who didn't have a CRM platform, and don't want to pay for one, SharpSpring also provides its own CRM platform free of charge. This feature used to set SharpSpring apart from the other competitors, but HubSpot now provided its own CRM too, although SharpSpring still has the call tracking feature which is not found in HubSpot.5. Merge with SMTP.One thing customers were worrying about was whether SharpSpring would survive in the long term. After all, customers make big commitments when they choose a platform to use. If the company ceases to exist, it is very damaging to its customers. By merging with SMTP, SharpSpring has secured access to the capital market, and the stable income from other diversified businesses also will help to ensure its survival. The boosted confidence level among its customers will certainly increase its competitive strength. In the meantime, it also adds new resources to allow it expand more aggressively.ValuationThe original SMTP's email delivery business brought about $5.75 million revenue and $1.27 million net income in 2013. There was $1.66 million free cash flow in 2013, but excluding the stock-based compensation, the impact of rebalancing the working capital and the temporary effect of tax payment, the real FCF is about $1.1 million. In other words, the net profit margin was 22% and FCF margin was 19%. Apparently, this business is very profitable.If we assume the integrated GraphicMail business can have 15% operating margin or 10% net profit margin, as the management has mentioned in the past, it may yield another $0.5 million after-tax income.We also have to consider the corporate overhead for any of the sum-of-part analysis. As SMTP brings on a full corporate structure, it will certainly increase its personnel costs, which includes salary, bonus and stock-based compensation for the executives. To be conservative, I would estimate the additional cost to be about $1.0 million pre-tax expense, or $0.65 million after-tax expense.The real profit margin from SharpSpring is hard to estimate since this part of the business is in an aggressive growth mode right now instead of a ""maintenance"" mode to just keep its current revenue. Currently, it is expected to be cash flow break-even for the rest of 2015. On the surface, the profit margin may be slightly negative. However, if we think about the true return given the low churn rate of the customers, along with the low cost of maintaining the existing customers, the investment return is actually huge.In 1Q 2015 alone, the ""expected lifetime value"" (net of support cost) is estimated by the management to be $2.8 million for SharpSpring's new add-on customers in that quarter. The added recurring annual revenue is only $1 million. If we consider that $1 million revenue is used to cover the marketing/sales cost, the extra $1.8 million LTV may be considered as the pre-tax investment return. Again, if the cost of getting this return is $1 million, the pre-tax return is 180% of investment. In other words, just one quarter's new customer may give business owners a pre-tax return of $1.8 million, and the annualized pre-tax return on investment would be $7.2 million.For sure, we don't know how the management calculated the expected lifetime value and what churn rate and discount rate have been used. The good news is: when I used 10% discount rate and 1% monthly churn rate, assumed the tech support cost to be 30% of the revenue and chose a cut-off date to be 10 years (assumed no customer will stay around beyond 10 years), I arrived at an LTV value of $2.73 million, which is slightly lower than what the management gave us, but considering that my assumptions are fairly conservative, I believe the management was honest on their numbers.In a bull case scenario, if we assume SharpSpring can reach $5 million revenue by the end of 2015, and invest all its earnings to grow this revenue at 50% a year for five years, like HubSpot did, and stop growth completely after five years, and it can achieve a profit margin of 20% in a maintenance mode by that time, we have its present value as the following:5 * 1.5^5 *0.2 * 15 / (1.1^5) = $70.7 millionHere, we have:2015 revenue * 50% per year growth for 5 years * 20% profit margin in maintenance mode * P/E 15 / discount 10% for five years to now.Growing 50% per year for five years may sound too optimistic, but we have to remember that SharpSpring is still very small, and it is growing very fast right now. If it simply keeps the current enrollment speed, it would grow revenue by 100% in 2016. Even if it grows 50% a year for five years, at the end of the five years, it would still only have a revenue of $37 million, about 25% of HubSpot's current size. Given the increased spending in marketing along the way, the fast industry growth, the increased reputation and the relatively undeveloped international markets, this kind of growth should be possible to achieve (although I would agree that it is based on optimistic projections). Also, assuming it will stop growth after five years is a conservative assumption too.If SharpSpring can be worth $71 million in a bull case, and we value the rest of the business at $14 million (SMTP can generate $1.1 million cash flow, GraphicMail may generate $0.5 million net income, and subtract $0.65 million corporate overhead, we will have $0.95 million total net income, which is worth $14 million at P/E 15), the total market cap in fair value would be:71 + 14 = $85 million.Assuming the outstanding shares will reach 7 million after the dilution effect from earn-out, the share price should be 85/7 = $12.In a bear case scenario, assuming it can keep the current growth and achieve $10 million recurring revenue near the end of 2016, and stop growing completely afterwards, and using a conservative 15% net profit margin to maintain that customer base, its net income will be $1.5 million. Indeed, assuming its growth will stop completely after 2 years is a very conservative model, but as a value investor, I want to be more conservative, or at least I want to consider a downside scenario for my valuations. It also is conservative to assume SharpSpring can only achieve a 15% net profit margin in a maintenance mode. Another conservative assumption here is that I have assumed no growth at all from the original SMTP business and GraphicMail business.Given the assumptions above, the eventual after-tax income by the end of 2016 in a downside scenario will be:$1.1 million from Legacy SMTP + $0.5 million from GraphicMail + $1.5 million from SharpSpring - $0.65 million corporate overhead = $2.45 million by the end of 2016.Using a conservative P/E 15, and discount rate 10% (discount two years back to now), the fair value of the market cap would be $2.45 * 15 * 0.8 = $29.4 million.This translates to a share price of $29.4 /7 = $4.2 per share.In conclusion, from the business owner's perspective, the business is worth $4.2 in a bear case and $12 in a bull case.Risks1. Competition.SharpSpring is still small in its size and in disadvantage when competing with industry leaders. Although its low price and better customer support may set it apart from the others, we should also keep in mind that this industry tends to have a lower barrier of entry, so there may be other new entrants entering the industry later. The good thing is that when the industry grows very fast, the demand may grow even faster than the supply, which makes the competition less intensive.2. The potential in international markets is still unproven.Most of the past growth we have seen in SharpSpring is still within the U.S. market. It is still unclear how successful it can be in international markets. So far, we haven't collected enough evidence to suggest one way or the other, although the current projections didn't assume much on that front either.The Catalysts1. Accelerated Growth.One possible scenario is that once SharpSpring has gained traction in its customer base and had a better reputation, it may actually achieve even faster growth later, especially in overseas market. As it is getting more revenue along the way, it will have more resource to ramp up its marketing effort. The combined effect of more marketing spending, better reputation and bigger market share can make the accelerated growth a good possibility.2. Getting acquired.One good thing for being a micro-cap is that it makes a potential acquisition much easier. Being in one of the hottest sectors, and with its peers traded at 10 times P/S multiple, even if it can achieve 5 times sales multiple valuation, it would still be worth at least $62 million in market cap (assuming $10 million SharpSpring sales by the end of 2016, and assume only 1 times P/S multiple for SMTP and GraphicMail's original businesses), or 42% upside from the current price (after considering the share dilution effect).Although SMTP suffers the disadvantage of illiquidity and may not achieve even half of the peers' P/S multiple, with many software companies being valued at a high P/S multiple right now, it could be acquired with an all-stock offer and become immediately beneficial to the acquirer's shareholders since it could lower the acquirer's P/S ratio (if the acquirer had a higher P/S), improve its growth rate, and more importantly, bring in fresh stories and new hopes to the market. (You might think I have now strayed too far from the value investor's path. Although I would never buy into the craziness, many years of practice in the stock market makes me think that it is not optimal to completely ignore the reality, as ignoring the market valuation is to ignore the potential upside or miss the potential catalysts).Since the original owner Semyon Dukach still controls about 43% of the shares, and he is likely to sell given a good price, the chance of an eventual acquisition is pretty high. In fact, I have heard that maybe he was looking to sell the business in 2013, but failed to achieve a good price.ConclusionOverall, I think SMTP management has done a very good job on those two acquisitions. It was done without overpaying the good businesses, and it brings clear synergies at the same time. I also have carefully compared the CEO Jonathan Strimling's past presentations and projections with the eventual outcome, and so far I haven't found any over-promising or misleading attempts. SMTP's accounting practice also seems to be fairly honest. For example, its acquisition accounting didn't boost its following year's income (year 2015), and instead it actually depressed the GAAP earnings due to the earn-out estimate catch-ups.Apparently, the fair value range of $4.2-$12 is a big range, but that's usually the case for any of the high growth companies. If you believe the product has a bright future, its fair value is very high, but on the other hand, if you think it is only a temporary phenomena, the fair value would be much lower. As for me, I believe the CEO of SharpSpring is smart enough to get us close to the upper half of the valuation range. This belief is based on the smart business strategies I have talked above, along with the fast industry growth. That said, we have to prepare for the downside risk as well. As with many other growth investments, this one gives us a high risk and even higher reward opportunity. In the meantime, I always feel better when the insiders are betting on the same direction as the rest of the shareholders.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2685095,61421,2014-11-17T12:45:00-05:00,"By acquiring two synergistic company in the past three months, the company is on track to more than double revenues next year and increase earnings by 30%.Its over 8% dividend yield makes it attractive all by itself.We believe the stock can more than double based on current business from the new acquisitions alone.","During the quarter ended September 30, 2014 just reported, SMTP (SMTP) acquired SharpSpring, and after the quarter closed, it announced the completion of the acquisition of GraphicMail: two companies that should more than double the company's revenues next year. The company announced revenues of $1.6 million up 11% from last year. This included half a quarter of sales from SharpSpring, a small, high growth start up. Even with SharpSpring included, gross margin was 79% in line with the range of high 70s to low 80s the company usually enjoys and we expect that number to potentially go higher next year, as both acquisitions are high gross margin companies. While the GAAP EPS reported was a loss of $0.02 versus a fully diluted GAAP profit of $0.11 last year, the non-GAAP number of $0.09 was an earnings beat versus our estimate of $0.04 due primarily to the reversal of taxes for the year. Included in the GAAP loss was $166,000 of stock based compensation and $367,000 of one-time expenses due to the acquisitions. This number included accounting and legal costs as well as severance and costs due to the closing of the GraphicMail Miami offices.Q4 ForecastNext quarter we expect more one-time charges, but they should be somewhat less than this quarter. Q4 will show a full quarter of SharpSpring and almost two thirds of a quarter of GraphicMail as it closed October 20th. Revenue will be somewhat dampened for GraphicMail as its accrual accounting is adjusted to correspond with the rest of SMTP. We are estimating that to be $100,000 less than usual. Given that GraphicMail closed we are adding its operation to the forecast and are raising revenue estimate to $2.4 million, up 59% from last year. We are leaving EPS estimates alone after adjusting for taxes until we get a better idea of where expenses will fall after both acquisitions are included. We expect management to give some guidance when it reports Q4 next year. For Q4 we are now looking for $2.4 million in revenues versus $1.5 million last year, up 59% and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.06 versus $0.14 last year, down 55%. This should be the last quarter with one-time expenses, as any others for future actions should have been accrued for in Q4.2015In Q1 we will see the first normalized quarter for the combined companies. We expect margins to improve throughout the as SharpSpring ramps revenues and offices are combined. Additionally, GraphicMail customers will be migrated over to SMTP and expenses at GraphicMail will be reduced. As the sales force is trained and products integrated we should see economies of scale in sales and marketing. There are even plans to translate software to other languages to expand the market opportunity and give the company a competitive advantage in certain regions. Currently we are forecasting revenues of $13 million, up 85% and EPS returning to more historic levels. We are looking for operating margins of 22% and project a lower than historical tax rate of 32%. The share count should be 7.6 million shares versus 5.5 million in 2014, reflecting the shares issued in the acquisitions. This would result in non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, up 30% from the year before. Keep in mind if the company is able to get back to its historical operating margin in the low thirties, the EPS could be 50% higher.Recent AcquisitionsSharpSpring, a new start up, was purchased for $5 million in cash plus an earn-out of cash and stock. To qualify for its earn-out, SharpSpring must reach a $5 million run rate by the end of 2015, at which point it would receive an additional $10 million in cash and stock. The deal closed on August 15, 2014. It only launched its product this year, but as of August it was bringing in business at a $2 million annual run rate. SharpSpring's product is a marketing automation and call-tracking platform that is a direct challenger to Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) in the small and medium business market. Marketing automation helps marketers track the web traffic of potential customers visiting its site and tracks phone contacts with customers and prospects. It is an excellent add-on service offering for SMTP's current customer base, as SMTP's deliverability services will allow SharpSpring to upsell to larger customers. SharpSpring also offers a customer relationship management module or a customer can bring their own system.GraphicMail, is a ten-year-old integrated email solutions company based in Cape Town, South Africa, It operates in 25 countries and provides service in 13 languages. It employs about 50 people and has 9,000 direct customers who sell to 35,000 end users. It was purchased for $5.2 million in cash and stock with a possible $0.6 million earn out. It had $4 million in billings in 2013, and was profitable. SMTP believes it will be immediately accretive to earnings. GraphicMail has a robust front-end email platform that competes with products like MailChimp and Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT), but needs help scaling for larger customers. SMTP on the other hand was looking for a front end but had the back end scaling capabilities. Together, the two should create an impressive offering for customers as well as expand the sales force and market reach for SMTP and SharpSpring. The GraphicMail acquisition, which was more complex due to its international operations, closed on October 17, 2014.INDUSTRYUntil its recent acquisitions, SMTP competed only in the $800 million email delivery segment of the email marketing industry; this segment has an average compound growth rate of 9.9% according to Forrester Research as shown on the graph. With the acquisition of SharpSpring and GraphicMail, SMTP has increased its total addressable market (TAM) closer to the $2 billion opportunity for all aspects of email marketing spending.ConclusionSMTP can be valued against other public SaaS companies and found to be undervalued. Many of the highly valued SaaS companies are not yet profitable, so we are looking at valuation based on a multiple of sales. As shown on the chart below company valuations range from a low of 2.0 times enterprise value to forecasted 2014 revenues for the money-losing HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), to a high of 21 times for $16 billion Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which provides a SaaS platform for human resource information systems. The group yields an average of 6.8 times forecasted 2014 revenues and 7.5 times trailing twelve month. Using this metric, if we plug in SMTP's projected 2015 revenues, we can see the stock moving to $15.95 by next year if the revenue forecasts are reached. This does not even take into account the over 8% dividend yield on the stock that management plans to maintain. In addition, we are optimistic about the company's ability to cross-sell product among the three companies and believe there is upside to sales and margins next year.PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENTEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2991296,61421,2015-03-12T07:25:32-04:00,"Through acquisition, SMTP is emerging as a full service SaaS email marketing solutions provider.Originally a high-yield slow grower, its change in strategy has chased off some of its investor base.Its low valuation versus competitors and high growth should spark investor interest and stock appreciation as its story becomes more well known.","SMTP (SMTP) is a small growing SaaS provider of email delivery services that bought two other email services companies last year to add marketing automation and a front-end for email creation and tracking. These acquisitions should double revenues this year, while increasing the total addressable market for the company. The smaller one, SharpSpring, is proving to be a formidable competitor to MKTO and HUBS. With an enterprise value to sales of less than 1.5xs 2015 estimated revenues versus peers of 5.6xs, we rate the stock Outperform.Management Sets Goal on Revenue Growth, not Earnings…SMTP stock hit a new 52-week low yesterday, and its lowest price since 2012, after the company reported a loss for its fourth quarter, which disappointed investors. After years of profits and dividends, the company reported its first loss after suspending its dividend a few weeks ago. This loss was as a result of the strategic plan to seek accelerated growth rather than profits, combined with large one-time expenses generated by the acquisition of two companies. Revenue growth (which was pre-announced) was a bright spot, with the company reporting $2.9 million versus $1.5 million last year (up 91%) and $1.6 million in Q3 2014. This shows what is in store for the next three quarters for revenue growth. The market however was disappointed by the loss of $0.21 reported on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, removing amortization, one-time charges and stock-based compensation, the company lost $0.02 per share versus our estimate of non-GAAP earnings of $0.06 per share. So rather than earning $338,000, it lost $88,000 on a non-GAAP basis. Most of the difference was due to much higher sales and marketing than we had modeled. In accordance with its growth strategy, the company plans to continue to operate at or near adjusted EBITDA breakeven, pouring cash flow into increasing marketing and sales as it rolls out product internationally.After the two acquisitions, the new business model for the company is very different than last year and last quarter, back when it was a slow growth, high margin, and dividend paying entity. The company now must show its stripes as a SaaS marketing company and find investors who understand its value as such. This turnover in the investor base leaves an excellent opportunity for growth and GARP investors to take over from the yield investors. We continue to recommend the stock and believe that versus its comparables, the stock is worth over $12.65 per share.With only two and a half months of GraphicMail in the quarter, the company has yet to show a completely normalized income statement. Q1 will show higher revenues from the additional month negated somewhat by a seasonally weak quarter that shows less revenue from, for example, the newsletter customers. Q1 revenues are however expected to be higher than Q4. In Q4, gross margins came in at 76% versus 82% last year and in 79% in Q3 2014. The company expects gross margin to remain above 75% and increase, as high margin SharpSpring revenues become a larger portion of overall revenues.Two large non-cash expenses hit GAAP earnings this quarter due to the acquisitions. Amortization expense was $259,000 alone. Added to that, was the change in earn-out liability for the two acquisitions that totaled $682,000. This later expense arises as the two acquisitions reach their thresholds for the earn-out. SharpSpring is the major driver of this. In order to earn its earn-out, it needs to reach a $5 million run rate based on the month of December 2015. As it grows closer to that goal, the company has to adjust its reserve for paying out the amount. As a result the next three to four quarters are expected to have this expense line. The earn-out will be paid at the end of Q1 2016.On a dollar basis, expenses should increase from Q4 levels as a full quarter of GraphicMail is recognized. In Q4 sales and marketing expenses were 36% of revenues, high for SMTP, but not extremely high in an industry where its major competitors-- Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) and HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) spent 64% and 71% respectively on sales and marketing in their most recent quarters.On a non-GAAP basis, taking out all one-time expenses and stock-based compensation of $197,000, the company lost $88,000 or $0.02 per share. In Q1 there will be another one-time expense related to the adjustment to the earn-out liability. Should SharpSpring reach its earn-out threshold the company will owe its former shareholders another $2.3 million and some portion of that total will probably be recognized in each of the quarters this year. The exact amount is to be determined by how close SharpSpring is to its goal. For the 2015 quarters we are using $575,000 per quarter for this acquisition-related expense.Given what we know about expenses, we expect Q1 to show a non-GAAP loss of $0.01 per share. The GAAP number will contain both amortization charges as well as stock-based compensation and that number could be a loss of $0.22, similar to Q4. In 2015, the amortization charge is expected to jump to $375,000 per quarter from $259,000 while the change in earn-out liability will vary based on SharpSpring's sales. We are estimating a flat number of $575,000 per quarter versus $682,000 in Q4, but this number could be anything from zero to $2.3 million.The earnings reported overshadowed the success the company is having in new sales and the eager adoption of the SharpSpring product that is a direct competitor to Marketo and HubSpot. SharpSpring was founded to provide an easier alternative to Marketo, which shows in its product design, but can be as little as a third the price of Marketo. In fact, as partial proof of its success, the company actually raised prices in the US for the product and is pricing the product higher internationally in most regions. Not only did this not hurt sales, but they accelerated despite the increase. SharpSpring acquired 100 new customers, mostly marketing agencies, in Q4 to bring the total number of agencies over 250, and they started international direct sales and have already landed five customers.Given its current sales level we expect SharpSpring could contribute $2.3 million in revenues to the company in 2015 after only being launched mid-2014. We are currently conservatively modeling 10% growth for the SMTP and GraphicMail businesses and 60% growth for SharpSpring in 2016 but that could be easily surpassed given the large number of resources and resellers devoted to the product.2015For the full year 2015, we are expecting revenue of $14.1 million, up 89%, while earnings remain near or slightly above EBITDA breakeven as the company invests in growth where investors should get a better return, as sales multiples remain high for SaaS companies. We are estimating $0.07 non-GAAP EPS, a loss of $0.77 GAAP and an adjusted EBITDA of $325,000 for the year.2016In 2016, we expect the company to continue to grow 20%+ as the base business increases 10% and SharpSpring at least 60%. Coming off such a small base this rate could be easily exceeded and we believe this is where the big upside to revenues could be. However the newly invigorated product line could be a boon all around and given the market growth, the company's complete offering and the law of small numbers, this could be exceedingly conservative. For now we expect revenues of $17 million up 22%, GAAP breakeven EPS and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38.Recent AcquisitionsSharpSpring, a new start up, was purchased for $5 million in cash plus an earn-out of cash and stock. To qualify for its earn-out, SharpSpring must reach a $5 million run rate by the end of 2015, at which point it would receive an additional $10 million in cash and stock. The deal closed on August 15, 2014. It only launched its product this year, and exited 2014 at a $2 million + annual run rate.

Marketing automation helps marketers track the web traffic of potential customers visiting its site and tracks phone contacts with customers and prospects.

SharpSpring also offers a customer relationship management module or a customer can bring their own system. This past quarter the company added its first international direct sales operations in the UK and in South Africa where it has already made five sales.GraphicMail is a ten-year-old integrated email solutions company based in Cape Town, South Africa that was purchased on October 17, 2014. It operates in 14 countries and provides service in 13 languages. It was purchased for $5.1 million in cash and stock with a possible $0.8 million earn out. It had approximately $5 million in billings in 2013, and was profitable. In Q4, not a full quarter, it had $1.1 million in revenues. GraphicMail has a robust front-end email platform that competes with products like MailChimp and Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT).INVESTMENT THESISINDUSTRYUntil its recent acquisitions, SMTP competed only in the $800 million email delivery segment of the email marketing industry; this segment has an average compound growth rate of 9.9% according to Forrester Research as shown on the graph.With the acquisition of SharpSpring and GraphicMail, SMTP has increased its total addressable market (TAM) closer to the $2 billion opportunity for all aspects of email marketing spending.VALUATIONSMTP can be valued against other public SaaS companies. Many of the highly valued SaaS companies are not yet profitable, so we are looking at valuation based on a multiple of sales. As shown on the chart below company valuations range from a low of 1.4 times enterprise value to forecasted 2015 revenues for the money-losing Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE), to a high of 12.5 times for $14 billion Workday, which provides a SaaS platform for human resource information systems (HRIS). The group yields an average of 5.6 times forecasted 2015 revenues and 7.2 times trailing twelve month. The valuation of the group has moved down somewhat since we last ran the comparables. Using this current metric, if we plug in SMTP's estimated 2015 and trailing 12 month revenues, we can see the stock moving to $12.65 by next year if the revenue forecasts are reached.Although most of these companies are much larger than SMTP, they have the same business model and in the case of Marketo, very similar products. Since this is a fairly new industry, it is not unusual for companies as small as SMTP to even be public, so our public company comps are much bigger. SMTP was founded in 1998. We consider it valid to compare SMTP to these large companies because they are the ones available to compare with, and given the small size of SMTP it could be argued that it is more probable that it can grow faster than the larger ones and could even be valued more highly than them due to its potential.INCOME STATEMENTBALANCE SHEETEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2333615,68805,2014-07-23T11:28:56-04:00,"SMTP Inc. operates a highly profitable, scalable business in the largest and fastest growing segment of the $2B Email marketing field.The company has a substantial opportunity to gain share due to efficient operations, competitive pricing, and a new effort to materially expand their marketing efforts.SMTP raised money earlier this year which is earmarked for synergistic acquisitions that have the potential to meaningfully contribute to growth.SMTP is virtually unknown with no sell side analysts currently covering the firm.The company pays out their profits in the form of a 7.9% dividend so investors get paid to wait while management executes on plans for growth.","SMTP Inc. (SMTP) is making major changes and management is aligned with public shareholdersWhat the Acronym and the company name SMTP stands forSMTP is an email industry acronym that stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is the standard by which email is sent worldwide. The company does not own that protocol, however it has done a tremendous job over the past 10 years leveraging its brand to position itself to companies who search for SMTP-related services online. This has led to efficient and successful hits for online searches of its services with limited sales and marketing investments. However, the company is now taking a robust marketing approach to drive additional growth.What SMTP does for a livingSMTP is a provider of cloud-based email delivery services for companies in over 130 countries.While most people can easily send individual messages that flow freely through SPAM filters, the risks of non-delivery are much higher for high volume senders. To protect its users, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have been forced to tighten filters over time resulting in billions of legitimate emails never reaching their intended recipients. It is my view that ISPs will continue to tighten filters making SMTP services more valuable going forward.Source: SMTP Investor Presentation (May 2014)SMTP provides customers with the ability to increase the deliverability of email with less time, cost and complexity, which improves the effectiveness of their email marketing and drives revenue growth.SMTP operates using a subscription-based recurring revenue model. Customers pay a monthly fee for the delivery services that are provided, up to a set quota, and rely on SMTP for improved inbox delivery and for 24x7 customer support.Approximately 50% of SMTP's revenues are derived in the United States, with the balance split between Europe, Asia and the rest of the world.Brief HistorySMTP went public through a reverse merger in 2012. At that time, the company was being run by its Chairman, Semyon Dukach, who was and is the company's largest shareholder. Mr. Dukach is an active angel investor and was one of the founding members and team leaders of the MIT BlackJack Team, which was made famous from Ben Mezrich's book Bringing Down the House. SMTP is his largest holding.Mr. Dukach ran SMTP as an active Chairman without a dedicated CEO and only two sales professionals until August 2013. For almost a decade, SMTP leveraged its brand name and sales were largely driven by leads generated via the SMTP.com website. Over 370,000 unique visitors visited SMTP's website with minimal investments in sales and marketing. The company's name and web address has been a cornerstone of the company's historic profitable growth and drove 3 consecutive years of +50% growth.That annual growth tapered off to 25% in 2012 and ~8% in 2013. I attribute the drop off in growth to the size they had reached without a dedicated CEO or a robust marketing plan, as well as increased competition and a more competitive market environment. In addition, many potential customers also want email creation services for example along with sending. SMTP is presently scouring for small acquisitions to add complementary services. Adding services is critical to a re-acceleration of growth.The Business of EmailThe email market is highly fragmented, with numerous players providing a variety of different services and functions.SMTP is focused on the area of delivery, which is the largest and fastest growing segment of the $2B email marketing industry. The delivery portion of the email market is expected to grow 10% annually reaching $1B by 2016 according to Forrester Research.SMTP has a market share of approximately 1% of the email delivery market. Every 1% gain in share more than doubles current revenues.Why customers pay SMTP and other firms to send their emails for themIndustry data collected by Return Path, an email intelligence firm, indicates that ~22% of opt-in marketing emails never arrive at the intended recipient's inbox as spam and ISP filters often inadvertently block messages that are sent in high-volume because the sender does not have a track record or the know how to properly navigate the email ecosystem. SMTP assists its clients to improve their delivery rates through its robust technical infrastructure and extensive knowledge of international email rules and regulations.Source: SMTP Investor Presentation (May 2014)Email continues to be an important and growing marketing function for businesses globallyThe New York Times recently wrote on this topic. The article highlights how email marketing and more specifically email newsletters are not only still around, but an effective tool to drive sales.It is also worthwhile to point out that because of high volumes and high levels of automation; the email delivery business is highly scalable and highly profitable especially when the corporate culture, as driven from the top at SMTP, is to be highly effective at the lowest possible cost.SMTP's margins are significantly higher than other public companies that operate in this space and compare favorably to Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT) and others as a result of the large volumes of emails that SMTP sends on behalf of their clients against a lean but efficient and customer focused corporate structure. SMTP's net margins in Q1 2014 were 22% compared to Constant Contact's 3%. While Constant Contact has more functionality on its platform, it has smaller margins because it sends lower volume emails and has high customer acquisition cost.Source: SMTP Investor Presentation (May 2014)SMTP's offering provides a critical need to the market and because it drives revenues for its clients, it is a value added necessary service.Overall, the email market is a large market, which can be segmented in a variety of ways. While there is significant overlap in services, SMTP's competitors are typically focused in one of three areas: marketing email creation, marketing email delivery or transactional email delivery.Source: SMTP Investor Presentation (May 2014)Companies like Constant Contact and MailChimp are well-known brands best known for their tools for marketing email creation. They have a large following in the small business markets, where customers are focused on quickly and easily creating email campaigns, such as newsletters and promotions. The integrated services offered by these firms allow for campaign creation, management, analysis and delivery all in one platform. But typically, the companies spend heavily on sales and marketing to effectively reach large numbers of small business customers.SMTP does not currently offer customers additional services or any of the bells and whistles one might find with the brands mentioned above. SMTP's new CEO has indicated that there are accretive opportunities to expand its platform, increase its TAM and accelerate future growth through bolt on acquisitions. They now have an $11 mm war chest via their secondary priced 1/30/14. I would like to see them use the cash to accomplish this goal.New Management & StrategyIn August 2013, the company hired Jon Strimling, a CEO with a passion for email marketing and a track record of strong operational execution. He has 20 years of experience as an executive and entrepreneur. Most recently, Strimling was the CEO of WoodPellets.com, a private online retailer that used cloud based email services, to drive growth. In his 2 years as CEO of WoodPellets.com, Strimling achieved nearly 400% growth each year and positioned the company as one of the world's fastest-growing e-retailers.Since joining SMTP, Strimling has made a number of strategic hires and doubled the Sales & Marketing team. He has worked to create the necessary backend systems to more effectively manage customer acquisition efforts, monitor ROI and manage churn to maximize profitability.He is localizing SMTP's website to make it more conducive and welcome to potential international customers as they will be able to read about the company in their native tongue. I feel this simple step is likely to accelerate international growth. For a company that has 50% of its business overseas that relies on web traffic to its homepage it seems like this is an initiative that was probably long overdue.Jon has also outlined a strategy to rejuvenate growth and stated publicly that the company is looking to acquire accretive businesses that can bolt on to SMTP's existing platform. To take advantage of potential M&A opportunities, the company raised $11.5M in a secondary offering in February of this year and up-listed to the NASDAQ to provide capital and an effective stock currency for M&A.At a recent conference Jon Strimling stated: ""We believe acquisitions are a way to both broaden our product and service offering and gain access to new channels, new customers, and to bolt on earnings which are accretive to investors."" SMTP is actively looking to make acquisitions that are strategically, operationally and financially accretive.According to the company's most recent investor presentation, SMTP has identified over 100 companies in related markets, with nearly half of the companies falling in an appropriate scale range. They believe that many of these companies are orphaned and that there are few, if any, competitive bidders looking to buy them.M&A is a critical driver of value here for investorsI believe they can use their cash to buy complementary and synergistic companies at reasonable multiples. The chairman has a long track record of being frugal in all areas and the CEO while focused on growth, is aligned. Things can get very interesting for equity if they can add revenues in this manner as accretion can be significant. This is before any multiple expansion that I think the shares can enjoy given they trade at 3 x revenues without any attention on them at all!We get paid to wait hereSMTP has paid a quarterly cash dividend for the past eight consecutive quarters dating back to April 2012 with a current dividend yield of almost 8%. It has increased its dividend payments 4 times since it implemented its dividend policy and currently pays out $0.48 a share each year. The CEO has consistently stated his intention to continue paying a dividend because it differentiates the company as a profitable microcap stock. The last quarterly distribution of $0.12 per share was made on May 30, 2014 and I expect the company to announce its next quarterly distribution in the near future. SMTP is the chairman's largest personal holding and is incentivized to maximize value via dividend and capital appreciation as he does not draw salary.ValuationSMTP has an impressive business model and generates significant cash, which is currently paid out via the dividend. However, I do not feel this is a value stock. They have a long track record of growth. They have raised money to expand the platform and drive growth through expanded marketing and sales efforts and M&A. They currently hold less than 1% share of the fast growing email send segment. This is a growth stock.Also, while management has indicated they would like to continue paying the dividend, they will reduce or suspend it, if highest and best use for cash flow is reinvestment in the business for growth.I feel the market will use EV / Sales here. Since Responsys was taken out by Oracle for 8 x revenues at the end of last year, SMTP's only pure public comp is Constant Contact. CTCT trades for 3 x trailing, 2.75 x forward revenues. SMTP currently trades for 3.2 x ttm revenues and 2.6 x the $7.2 mm in revenues that I think they can do in 2015.The fact that SMTP has profitably grown sales by effectively doing nothing is significant for two reasons: (1) it means that there are significant levers it can pull to dramatically grow sales and (2) it's a testament to the quality of its product that it can grow the top line with minimal customer acquisition costs in a competitive environment.They are now poised to make accretive synergistic acquisitions to go along with a professional marketing approach to do a lot more business in the huge and fast growing email marketing segment. Oracle, Salesforce.com, Adobe, SAP and others have shown they care a lot about this area and I feel are likely to continue to make acquisitionsSMTP shares have carried 3 x revenues with no one hearing about them. Given the above thinking and their highly scalable and profitable business model, I believe the shares can trade at 3.5 to 4 x revenues. This gets us to a $8.25 to $9.25 stock price in a year. However, things get very interesting to me when I model in acquisitions. If they can buy small complementary businesses for reasonable multiples, then the shares can appreciate more rapidly and to a higher level. That could make for a very exciting stock.A note about liquidityThe shares currently trade very thin. It is a testament to the quality of the company that they issued stock in January and the shares did not go down despite a difficult period since for small cap.Management is committed to driving increased liquidity through stepped up investor relations efforts. SMTP hired KCSA in May of this year to lead a new strategic IR program. It is interesting to me that KCSA took on a company of this small a market cap. So far, the company has revamped its investor website, presented at its first institutional conference (Marcum Microcap in May), and indicated they will begin hosting quarterly earnings calls. Given how interesting I feel this story is, and the importance of the segment in which they operate, I feel it is reasonable to assume they will pick up sell side coverage. The company was also included in the latest June 2014 reconstitution of the Russell MicroCap index.In closingSMTP is a currently below the radar micro-cap with a track record of profitable growth that did a 1.84 mm share secondary in January of this year and up-listed to NASDAQ. The company was founded and is chaired by a brilliant entrepreneur and has a new dynamic CEO whose interests are clearly aligned with public shareholders. The new CEO has embarked on a clearly defined growth strategy that I believe is both logical and achievable. The business model is highly scalable and set to show wonderful leverage to increased revenues. Strict cost management is part of the company's DNA, which shows in their 22% net marginsDisclosure: The author is long SMTP.

Many of these companies have big promises and no profits in sight. In fact, SMTP is not only profitable, but it is a cash generating machine. EBITDA margins are over 35%, and with a SaaS business model that requires minimal capital expenditures, the company has lofty free cash flow - north of 25% of revenues. With minimal capital deployed, this company has been a fantastic business for much of the past decade, generating ROE and ROIC figures well above 50% in some years. Just think for a moment of how many micro-cap, internet SaaS companies you know that have these kind of metrics.Remarkably, management has been able to grow the business consistently without needing to plow millions into sales & marketing. As a result, much of that cash has been paid out in the form of dividends. In fact, the company has paid a generous dividend for the past 9 quarters, and the current yield is close to 8%. It should be noted of course that the company Chairman Seymon Dukach and CEO for much of the past decade (until he stepped down less than 2 years ago), is still the majority owner of the company and was obviously the biggest benefactor of this approach. I'll dive much more into the management strategy later.Going forward, I believe the company could be at an inflection point where revenues and valuation are set to increase again significantly. I will cover the following reasons in this article to be long the stock:1. Despite being small, the company has a long established profitable business with very low customer concentration2. Recent change in management strategy provides the company with lots of cash, and it has made no secret that it plans to make several acquisitions, which will bring the company more on the map with bigger investors3. Global Digital Marketing, Including Email Marketing Continues to Grow at Double Digit Rates4. The Company is Comparatively Very Cheap - Trading at only 3x Cash and a 3 EV/Revenue Multiple5. The company has a valuable Brand Name in ""SMTP""6. Improved Corporate Governance Should Attract more Investors#1: Long Established Profitable Business with Low Customer ConcentrationSMTP has been operating a profitable business for more than a decade. The company is in the business of email delivery services, which upon first glance may not seem that exciting. What the company does is that it offers services, which help to route mass email marketing campaigns to the correct recipients. A casual observer when seeing this may immediately think, ""Wait a minute, the emails I send are always received… so what is the value in this service?"" While this is true for individual emails being sent between friends (delivery success likely greater than 99%), when a company sends out mass emails to its opt-in subscribers the failure rate can be as high as 22%, as cited by SMTP sources:Now before you ask, it should be noted that technically these are not SPAM messages, because these are emails being sent by large commercial websites to their members who have signed up for accounts and have opted to receive future email newsletters (think of that check-box every time you sign-up on a new consumer website asking if you want to receive targeted updates or newsletters). These mass mailers typically contain discounts and other sales offers to try and get consumers to spend more. The success rates of these campaigns is actually quite high, and in many industries more than 3% of recipients will open the email and actually click on one of the links, as shown in statistics by one of SMTP's competitors MailChimp. Even if only a small fraction of these clicks turn into more sales, the ROI is still quite good, as sending out mass emails is very cheap compared to more traditional snail mail, print advertisements or TV commercials. For example a small company can send up to 10k emails every month with SMTP server for as little as $15/month. If this causes as few as 10 of these recipients to actually purchase something (0.1%), then it is well worth the money spent. In some cases, the websites using these campaigns don't even sell consumer products directly, but they are informational portals, which make money by selling targeted advertising spots. So just getting users to click on the mails and visit their website again will drive more traffic and make their portals more valuable (For example WebMD, which is a big customer of SMTP). Now the specific value of using SMTP instead of trying to send these mails directly, is that in recent years successful delivery has actually gotten more difficult, because ISPs and other big email providers have built sophisticated SPAM filters and blacklisting in order to try and stop the flood of unwanted emails. Most people can attest to this from personal experience, as spam filters have drastically improved in recent years. The consequence of this however is that commercial websites are losing potential revenue from their members who have actually agreed to receive targeted emails.Now turning to the business metrics, and we can see right away that SMTP has been wildly profitable. Return on Equity has been out of this world since the company went public, and is still above 30% despite recent slowdowns in growth.There are several reasons for high profitability. On the technology side, the company's primary software SMTP server is actually not that sophisticated, as they have built it largely on open source software and they have no formal intellectual property (no intangibles on the balance sheet). As the company does not need to spend millions in maintaining and ensuring superior complex technology, the company is able to get away with very low R&D expenditures (approx. 5% of revenues in 2013), and the SaaS model has gross margins near 80%. With larger scale, gross margins could potentially even improve, as some internet companies with similar service models have achieved >90% (e.g. Yelp (NYSE:YELP)). The second primary reason for high profitability has been extraordinarily low operating expenses, driven by virtually no sales & marketing expense. I'll cover this more in the next section.So turning to the value of the business, it is not in the technology itself, but more in the vast amount of white listed IP addresses (>12k), which the company believes is far more than other major competitors combined with strong customer relationships and support. The company works closely with major ISPs to ensure these IPs remain white-listed. Customers are paying in most cases month-to-month contracts, which can be cancelled at any time, however, over a decade the company has built up a customer base that numbers close to 10k, and no one customer is more than 3% of revenues. SMTP does not publish explicitly their retention rates, but there is for sure some level of stickiness in this business, as when a company decides to leave they will not be able to take their built up ""trusted sender"" reputation with them. This is based primarily on the IP addresses, and since SMTP owns the rights to these, a company could experience some setback in their delivery success rates if they switch to competitors.Additionally it should be noted that SMTP provides excellent 24x7 customer support with specific account managers for larger clients and those who are willing to pay for dedicated servers. When I spoke to a company representative, I got the sense that management feels their ability to provide high-touch support to the SMB market is a big reason why many small customers continue to stick with the company. There is therefore a lot of built up value in this business, and it is not immediately replaceable. It is a huge plus that a micro-cap company has a very diverse customer base, which provides a wider safety net than you usually find with such small companies, which more often than not owe their success to 1 or 2 big contract wins.#2: Change in Management Strategy - Lots of Cash and Pushing Marketing and AcquisitionsIn January 2014, SMTP raised close to $11m with a substantial equity offering.Although investors typically frown on equity dilution, I believe in this case it has presented a true inflection point. The cash will allow this company to begin growing again significantly, and it shows a key shift in policy that should help the company gain more investor following as it expands by acquisition. With zero debt and great operating metrics, this cash can truly be used for growth.To understand the reasons for this shift, it's useful to take a step back and get a sense of what has been happening with the management at the company. The current Chairman Semyon Dukach, purchased SMTP in 2002 and ran the company as CEO until June 2012. He is probably most well known for his prominent role on the MIT blackjack team in the 1990s. With degrees from Columbia and MIT, there is no shortage of brain power here, and Dukach has become a successful angel investor who is very active. He has invested in over 75 start-up companies. He became wealthy in 2000 when he sold his Fast Engines startup for $35m, which netted him millions just before the bubble burst. It was after this point that he purchased SMTP. Over the years, SMTP has grown steadily with a very lean business model maintaining a high level of profitability. The company literally has had less than 10 employees in the US, and has maintained a technical development and support team in Ukraine of about 30. The Ukrainian team are all contractors, seemingly for tax benefits as well as allowing SMTP to have maximum flexibility in its work force. Several members of this team are long standing employees, having been with Dukach since the beginning (for example the CTO joined SMTP in 2002). Dukach has used the company as his cash cow in order to fuel a variety of other investments. Clearly Dukach is a techy entrepreneur and investor at heart. As SMTP remained a small private company until 2011, Dukach maintained full ownership of the company and was both the CEO and CFO. The team had been highly focused on strong customer support, but with very little focus on sales & marketing. For years there was literally only 2 salesmen and nobody in a marketing role.In an usual move, the company decided to go public in 2011 without the help of any investment bank on the OTC market. The company raised just $100k by selling a private placement to 81 investors. As the company was already generating a lot of cash and high margins, it wasn't really necessary to raise lots of capital at the time.One look at the top line trends, and it becomes clear the company has been reaching the limits of its lean operating model in recent years. Revenue growth has stagnated as growth, which was in the high double digits a few years ago has slowed considerably, and is now under 10%:SMTP Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YChartsLikely recognizing what was happening, about 2 years ago Dukach stepped down as CEO. He was seemingly becoming more and more involved with his other investment pursuits and was ready to step away from the day to day management of SMTP, and at the same time the company needed to do something to take it to its next level. In August 2012, the company obtained the services of Bowen Advisors, an M&A firm to explore ""strategic alternatives."" It seemed at the time there was interest from Dukach to sell the company. At this same time the new CEO brought in only a few months prior resigned. What happened next however was interesting - the company went on for another year, perhaps unable to sell for a reasonable price (we can't be sure what really occurred), and in August 2013 a new CEO Jon Strimling was named and the agreement with Bowen was terminated.Now 1 year on with Strimling at the helm, I believe the company is ready to move full steam ahead. The management upheaval seems to have calmed down, and Strimling has done a number of initiatives, which signal a clear change in strategy. The company did a reverse stock-split last year to bring the share-price higher, and announced that they would be raising a substantial amount of capital in order to beef up sales & marketing and look to make a number of bolt on acquisitions. By doing this, Dukach now has dropped his ownership from near 90% to 53% of the company, and this means the stock has much higher liquidity and should be poised for much higher valuation multiples.Just consider, this company a few years ago literally had zero staff focused on marketing, and only 2 full-time salesmen. It is quite a feat that the company was able to grow from about $2.5m in sales to well over $5m with this kind of model. In my talks with a company representative, I get the sense that this was possible simply because the customers were coming to SMTP without any effort spent to acquire them. This was due to a few factors, including an early mover advantage and the fact that the company's name ""SMTP"" is very synonymous with email delivery for IT professionals, and many smaller customers simply found the company because they often appeared near the top of search results for email related queries. This model can only last so long however, so I believe the shift in strategy has come at the right time. The company has stated clearly that it has a list of ""100 or more"" potential acquisitions, and it is currently evaluating several of them. We can expect at least 1 M&A related announcement sometime in 2014, and although there is a risk of some margin compression as the company expands, I believe that at this stage simply growing the size of the company and its revenues will make it more visible in the small-cap world and lead to a higher valuation multiple. So I expect the refactoring on the valuation to really kick-in if the company makes a few acquisitions later in 2014.#3: Global Digital Marketing Continues to Grow at Double-Digit RatesInternet marketing and advertising continues to grow at steady rates. The overall digital marketing market is set to grow at more than 15% per annum in the coming 4 years. Despite being one of the ""oldest"" technologies of the internet age, email usage continues to grow significantly, especially as a means of replacing more traditional advertising methods. Internet penetration is still well under 40% in the world as a whole, and the email market, which was $1.5B in 2010, is projected to be over $6.5B by 2018.According to SMTP and citing Forrester Research, email delivery on its own is almost an $800m market and continues to grow rapidly:The market is very fragmented with many small private companies competing. There are some larger companies as well, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and SendGrid, but their primary focus is on transactional delivery and much bigger customers (think of those friendly emails from your favorite social network telling you someone has commented on your photo you just posted). SendGrid also advertises marketing email delivery solutions similar to SMTP, but even their smallest monthly plans are significantly more expensive (about $80 vs. $15 for 10k emails per month). There are also several larger companies that focus more specifically on the creative segment, providing a variety of fancy templates and tools to help customers design engaging emails. The best known company in this space is Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT), a $1B company.For sure the competition has increased in the past few years and this has likely been a cause of slowing growth. However as the market continues to expand at double digit rates, I believe that SMTP remains in a solid position, due primarily to its diverse customer base, excellent financial position, and valuable brand name.#4: The Company is Comparatively Very Cheap - Trading at only 3x Cash and a 3 EV/Revenue MultipleTurning to the valuation side, and SMTP remains very attractively priced considering its profitable business model. The company trades at about 9x EBITDA, which is cheap for a company with double digit ROE and FCF margins >25%, and despite a slowdown in growth revenue is still up nearly 9% in the past year. Even more exciting in my opinion is that the company has over $11m in cash and no debt, which is good for a price/cash of < 3. Many SaaS companies, which typically have high gross margins but low operating metrics, are frequently valued on an EV/Revenue basis. On this metric SMTP trades close to 3x, which is close to the same as Constant Contact. However considering that the company is head over heels more profitable and should accelerate revenue growth near term with a few acquisitions, I believe the company is significantly undervalued. This undervaluation is probably partially explained by the company's tiny size and lack of liquidity, which just doesn't make it possible for many larger investors to drive up the price.This however I expect to continue to steadily improve, as the company will likely make acquisitions with a mix of cash and stock and we can expect liquidity to continue to go up. Even taking a more conservative view and forgetting acquisitions for a moment, and I expect the company will grow modestly in 2014, in the 5-10% range, but with an increased focus on sales & marketing they should be able to accelerate this back to 15% in 2015. At a continued low EV/Revenue multiple the company should be worth about 30% higher than today's market price, and if the company can make a few accretive acquisitions, we could see much higher. Note that I expect profitability and EPS to dip a bit in the near term when compared to previous years, but this should be obvious with the increased sales and marketing expenses coupled with the higher share count since the January secondary offering.With my EPS projections over $0.20/share and FCF higher still (closer to $.30), I believe the shares are worth close to $6 on a cash flow basis alone taking conservative assumptions, and well over $8 when you factor in the cash and no debt. So upside can easily be more than 30% near term.It should also be noted of course that SMTP continues to pay a very high dividend, which is a nice cushion while you wait for growth to kick-in again. In my talks with the company I do expect them to keep the dividend, although clearly they were over-extending themselves with it recently as revenue growth slowed and operating expenses are starting to creep higher as more management has been brought in. This resulted in the company paying out more than it took in Q1 2014, and they will likely cut the dividend a bit if revenue doesn't accelerate quick enough. I do expect however they won't cut it too drastically, as the company is in strong financial shape and the impression I've gotten is that Dukach is likely using his steady stream of pay-outs to fuel his other angel investing initiatives. As he still maintains control with 53% ownership, I don't think he'll make any drastic shifts in dividend policy in the short term.#5: A Valuable Brand NameOne of the most valuable assets for SMTP is in fact its brand name and domain name - smtp.com. The acronym ""SMTP,"" standing for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is synonymous with email sending for IT professionals. The fact that the company owns the domain name gives it a huge advantage against some other competitors, as it is much more likely to appear near the top of search results. Some domain valuation tools even indicate the domain itself could be worth close to $400k. As mentioned previously, I had the sense from management that the company's name was one of the large reasons why they were able to grow so easily with minimal sales effort. Many of the other competitors also use SMTP in their name, but they are forced to settle for second best with names like: ""SMTP2Go"" or ""JangoSMTP."" Going forward and I expect that marketing efforts will leverage this advantage to get the word out even further, and I can see the company being bought by a bigger competitor just simply for the name (stranger things have happened!).#6: Improved Corporate GovernanceThere is no denying that corporate governance has improved greatly at SMTP, and this should be a plus for generating increased investor interest. Not long ago several other SA contributors commented on the poor governance, for example here, as you had a situation with Dukach who owned 90% of the company and was also the holder of all executive management positions (CEO, CFO, etc). Obviously this led to potential issues, but also because the company is so small it meant that the small amount of the stock that was floating on the market had extremely low liquidity. This however has drastically improved just in the past year or so, as Dukach now owns about half of the company and has stepped away from all executive management positions. He does retain his position as Chairman and does still own more than 50%, but I get the sense that he has taken a large step back. The CEO Strimling seems to have full reins to execute a new growth strategy. Strimling has hired a VP of Marketing, and is currently looking for another Sales Executive and a full-time CFO. I am told that once the new CFO is onboard, the company is likely to start doing quarterly conference calls. There was an announcement that they could already be starting to do it this quarter, but the sense I got was that they may now wait one more quarter until the new CFO is hired. All of this broadening of the management team though clearly shows that governance is much improved, which will be more attractive to investors.Investment RisksMost of the primary risks to this stock I've touched on already. For one the company relies heavily on a few key individuals. If Dukach or the CEO were to suddenly depart, it would be a big cause for concern. A company with under 50 employees is usually heavily influenced by its key leaders. In addition the company does not have any intellectual property, and their technology is not sophisticated. I could see that the biggest threat over time in this market is that the big players such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), or perhaps even SalesForce.com (NYSE:CRM) could decide to push more heavily into the email marketing space and build similar offerings as part of their larger product suites. As Google has done with other products, they could offer similar services for very low cost or even free to squeeze out a lot of the small companies and cause waves of consolidation. I think however there is inherent value built up in a vast area of customer relationships, and even if this type of moves were to happen I suspect SMTP would still be bought by a larger company for a premium.The other thing to be mindful of is more equity dilution and or a dividend cut, both of which are very possible as the company continues to shift its strategy. But again, I believe investors who look out a few years would be better served to see this as part of the flexibility that could be needed to ensure the company stays competitive and increases awareness, and I still expect the stock will generate plenty of alpha regardless.The Bottom LineSMTP is a very profitable and stable business that should see plenty of growth ahead of it. With a new management team on board pushing acquisitions and marketing, look for the company to accelerate in the coming year. A growing share count, larger revenues, and the fact that the company is now listed on the NASDAQ should help to improve liquidity further and bring higher valuation multiples. With some SaaS companies with comparable business models trading for sky high EV/Rev multiples of more than 15, there could be a lot of upside ahead. Strong profitability, a diverse customer base, no debt, and generous dividend give plenty of cushion on the downside as well, resulting in a very attractive risk/reward profile for this micro cap.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SMTP over the next 72 hours.

1618532,21604,2013-08-08T12:10:35-04:00,,"Most people have the pleasure of seeing spam e-mails outside of their inbox these days. E-mail providers like Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) Gmail or Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) Yahoo! Mail automatically scan incoming e-mails to classify them as legitimate or spam. While this is great for consumers, legitimate companies can have a hard time getting their e-mails read. These companies might be sending coupons to opt-in customers, but, since the e-mails contain spam-related keywords like ""free"" or ""deal,"" they may destine for the spam folder.SMTP Inc. (SMTP.OB) helps companies avoid this problem by letting them use its own servers to send the e-mails. Unlike normal e-mail servers, the company diligently works with Internet Service Providers (""ISPs"") and e-mail providers to ensure that all e-mails sent from them avoid the spam box as a ""trusted"" sender. The company also provides reputation management, compliance auditing, abuse processing, and issue resolution services designed to help its clients keep out of the spam box and realize a higher return on their e-mail marketing.Rapidly Growing IndustryE-mail marketing has been consistently ranked as one of the most effective forms of online marketing, despite the ongoing rise in spam e-mails and the rise of new technologies. According to a study by ExactTarget Inc. (NYSE: ET-OLD), some 77% of consumers prefer to receive permission-based marketing communications via e-mail compared to texts, social media, etc. And, a separate survey found that 56% of businesses would increase e-mail spending in 2013.Consider the following survey that compares many popular forms of online advertising:Figure 1 - E-Mail Marketing Survey (Source: Econsultancy)In total, the e-mail marketing industry is expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2010 to some $6.5 billion by 2018, according to Transparency Market Research. The growth is being driven by both the ongoing growth in e-mail marketing (due to its effectiveness) and the growth in Internet users in the U.S. and around the world. Mobile usage has also made checking e-mail far more common than it once was, contributing to the popularity of e-mail marketing.With this tremendous growth and the clamping down on spam, companies are increasingly looking for ways to increase their deliverability and avoid the spam box with their marketing messages. And, it's these trends that are creating a big opportunities for companies like SMTP, alongside e-mail marketing providers like Constant Contact Inc. (NASDAQ:CTCT) or Responsys Inc. (NASDAQ:MKTG) that provide similar, albeit broader, services.Strong Player in the MarketThe industry's strong growth has helped SMTP report strong top- and bottom-line results, while future growth prospects should help the performance continue ahead. The company generates its revenues by offering low-volume solutions (2,000 to 100,000 e-mails per month) at between $5 and $130 per month, and high-volume solutions involve anywhere from 100,000 to millions of e-mails per month, where it charges an average of $357 per month. These services are marketed through online advertising (80%) and marketing agreements (20%).Between FY2010 and FY2012, SMTP's top-line revenues grew from $2,735,752 to $5,353,550, representing a CAGR of about 40%. Bottom-line net income also grew from $394,901, or $0.03 per share, to $1,069,607, or $0.07 per share, representing a CAGR of about 65%. Meanwhile, trailing 12-month top- and bottom-line results suggest ongoing growth moving through FY2013, although at a slightly slower growth rate judging by the current numbers.Figure 2 - SMTP Inc. Revenues and Net Income (Source: SEC Filings)According to its most recent 10-Q filing, most of this growth is organic:Looking ahead, the company plans to grow its business primarily through acquisitions and expanded distribution channels, according to regulatory filings. While management has offered no public guidance, growth rates have been trending higher over the past few months.Significantly UndervaluedSMTP is unique among many micro-cap equities in that it offers a dividend yield of $0.02 per share, or 6% based on a $1.20 share price. On August 1, 2013, the company announced that it would increase this dividend to $0.023 per common share to shareholders of record at the close of the business day on August 20, 2013. The August 31, 2013, dividend represents a 27.8% increase over the prior quarter's $0.018 per share dividend rate.According to Chairman Semyon Dukach, ""The increase in our dividend rate, which is up 53.3% versus the same quarter in 2012, reflects the continued growth of our business and the strength of our balance sheet. While we continue to make the necessary investments in our business to produce stable growth and profitability, we are pleased to once again return cash to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend payment.""In addition to its rare dividend yield, the stock trades at a discount to its peers when it comes to price-earnings, price-sales, and price-cash ratios. Figure 3 below shows that these comparisons are sometimes half of the industry averages, suggesting that the stock price could double in order to reflect an appropriate peer valuation. For example, if SMTP were to have a 30x price-earnings multiple, the stock price would be closer to $2.10 per share versus $1.20 per share.Figure 3 - Valuation Comparison (Source: Morningstar)Finally, the company also appears undervalued given its growth rates. Assuming that a price-earnings to growth ratio of 1.0 is fairly valued, the company's current price suggests a long-term growth rate of just 16%, when its historical averages have been 40% on the top-line and 65% on the bottom-line. This strong historical growth rate and the favorable industry outlook suggest that the company could significantly outperform that modest 16% growth assumption. And, a rate closer to even 25% could mean a stock price of $1.75 versus $1.20 per share.Risks and ConclusionsThere are many sizable risks that investors should consider before committing capital, despite the company's favorable growth and valuation:Since these concerns are fairly serious in nature, investors in the company must accept that they are essentially leaving their capital in the hands of entrenched (but capable) management that has traditionally been keen on paying themselves via dividends as majority owners and has been very successful thus far in growing the business. And, based on this performance, the stock might be available at a bargain relative to its peers and growth rate.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Its core business focuses on providing cloud-based email delivery services for companies in over 130 countries with a recurring revenue subscription model. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of sales, and half of sales are outside the US. SMTP is an email industry acronym that stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol that is the standard for sending email. The company's main business is the improved deliverability of opt-in emails. When customers mail through SMTP servers, ISPs recognize the emails as from a reputable sender and being wanted material. Without a service like SMTP, a mailer typically gets only 78% of its emails delivered as many ISPs will flag large mailings as spam and not put them through to the addressee. Using SMTP's service, delivery can be in the high 90%. Higher delivery often gives marketers a measurable return on investment, making the service an easy sell to many. The company achieves higher delivery by building a reputable sending reputation on the sending server and by knowing the ISP filter rules, whether it is by the look of the email or the pattern of mailing. Prices for the service range from $15 per month for 10,000 emails per month to $10,000 per month for 100,000 emails per month.The company was founded in 1998, went public in 2011, and has been a steady consistent growth company showing high margins and high cash flow. It also pays an extremely high divided that is currently $0.48 per share (8.3% dividend yield) that it has no plans of reducing or eliminating in the near future. In the past five years, the company has achieved revenue CAGR of 48%.In the past year, the company outlined a strategy to aggressively rejuvenate growth through the acquisition of companies providing service offerings complementary to its existing business. In the email and sales automation market there are multiple companies that have shown significantly higher growth than SMTP, so the company decided to broaden its market scope and try to capture some of this business.After analyzing hundreds of companies across the globe it settled on two. These recently announced acquisitions are SharpSpring and GraphicMail. SharpSpring closed August 15, 2014, and GraphicMail is expected to close before year-end. These two companies will broaden the company's offerings, increase its total addressable market, increase its geographic reach, and make it more competitive against larger vendors. With these acquisitions, we expect the company's revenues to double next year.Recent AcquisitionsSharpSpring, a new start up, was purchased for $5 million in cash plus an earn out of cash and stock. To qualify for its earn-out, SharpSpring must reach a $5 million run rate by the end of 2015, at which point it would receive an additional $10 million in cash and stock. The deal closed on August 15, 2014. It only launched its product this year, but as of August, it was bringing in business at a $2 million annual run rate. SharpSpring's product is a marketing automation and call-tracking platform that is a direct challenger to Marketo in the small and medium business market. Marketing automation helps marketers track the web traffic of potential customers visiting its site and tracks phone contacts with customers and prospects. It is an excellent add-on service offering for SMTP's current customer base, as SMTP's deliverability services will allow SharpSpring to upsell to larger customers. SharpSpring also offers a customer relationship management module or a customer can bring their own system.GraphicMail, is a ten-year old integrated email solutions company based in Cape Town, South Africa, It operates in 25 countries and provides service in 13 languages. It employs about 50 people and has 9,000 direct customers who sell to 35,000 end users. It will be purchased for $5.2 million in cash and stock with a possible $0.6 million earn out. It had $4 million in billings in 2013, and was profitable. SMTP believes it will be immediately accretive to earnings. GraphicMail has a robust front-end email platform that competes with products like MailChimp and Constant Contact, but needs help scaling for larger customers. SMTP on the other hand was looking for a front end but had the back end scaling capabilities. Together, the two should create an impressive offering for customers as well as expand the sales force and market reach for SMTP and SharpSpring. The GraphicMail acquisition, which is more complex due to its international operations, is expected to close in Q4 2014.INDUSTRYUntil its recent acquisitions, SMTP competed only in the $800 million email delivery segment of the email marketing industry; this segment has an average compound growth rate of 9.9% according to Forrester Research as shown on the graph. These acquisitions allow SMTP to increase its total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) closer to the $2 billion opportunity for all aspects of email marketing spending.SMTPSMTP's typical customer is a large emailer with considerable in-house expertise that already has the capability and know-how to create email campaigns and only needs assistance with delivery due to the large volume of sent emails that could be construed as spam. As a result of this niche expertise, SMTP has been able to offer its service at very competitive prices. The company also competes by offering excellent service with staff on hand 24/7 to help customers.One current SMTP customer is Retirementjobs.com, a website for retired professionals seeking new jobs and volunteer opportunities. The company sends a handful of emails a month to its 1 million members, totaling 5 million emails per month. According to the CEO, once the company reached 800,000 members and two million emails a month, it decided that it should enlist some outside help on delivery. After evaluating a number of providers, it selected SMTP based on its competitive pricing as well as its professional service and support capabilities that were key differentiators. Retirementjobs.com is currently evaluating the products available from SharpSpring and GraphicMail and may use them in the future to obtain better information on its members as they move through the employment process. The company believes one of the most attractive features of SharpSpring's product is the ability to use a variety of customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) solutions. As a result the commitment is not as great as using other vendors that would require you to switch CRM systems.The company believes its competitors in the SMTP relay business are:SharpSpringSharpSpring is a small startup founded and located in Gainesville, FL with 25 employees. It created a new platform that was launched early 2014 and is rapidly generating revenues at a $2 million run rate. SharpSpring provides a software platform for marketing automation and call tracking. It is vendor independent and integrates with any Customer Relationship Management software, or a user can use the SharpSpring CRM. The company's end user customer is primarily small and medium businesses but it has been primarily sold wholesale to marketing and advertising agencies. The agency can either just resell the license or can sell a marketing service to the client using the SharpSpring software and create a new line of business at the company. By servicing only the ad agencies, rather than the end user, the price for support is significantly less for the company and it can be priced well below the competition. For $500 per month, an ad agency can buy a license that can be used for five clients which is a price far less than the end user price from Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) or HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS). They typically charge $2400 per year per end-user. So far, the company has over 200 resellers of its product of which 60-70 are outside the US.Marketing automation allows a company to track what a visitor does on its site, what pages he looks at and how long he stays. If the visitor registers, the company knows what he is interested in and can send relevant emails to encourage a transaction or start a conversation to engage the prospect. If there is no registration, SharpSpring can capture the IP address and do a reverse look up to see from what company the visitor may be. They can then search the integrated ZoomInfo database to see who at that company might be the best person to contact to make a sale.SharpSpring Demo Timeline ViewIn addition to web sites, SharpSpring has also added the ability to trace telephone inquiries and match them to specific ads, which is referred to as Call Tracking. Call Tracking enables users to better assess ROI for marketing campaigns and improve the ability to engage with prospects. For example, if your company places a Facebook ad, the ad can be assigned a specific telephone number that can be monitored to determine the success of that ad.By targeting primarily smaller businesses, SharpSpring's chief competition is HubSpot, Marketo, InfusionSoft and Act|On rather than companies like Elequa and Pardot who target very large enterprises and cost tens of thousands of dollars per month. In addition to its extremely low cost, SharpSpring's advantage is its ease of use and more modern look and feel which is a salient characteristic when selling to smaller businesses with less in house specialization and expertise. As a new kid on the block, SharpSpring needs greater visibility as a competitor and we believe the publicity from and stability of being owned by SMTP should boost its growth rate and prospects.SharpSpring CompetitionHubSpotHubSpot was founded in 2006 in MA, has had $100.5 million in venture capital funding to-date. The company claims over 11,500 customers in 70 countries and more than 2000 agency partners. In 2013, the company's revenues grew 50% to $77.6 million and lost $34.3 million according to its recently filed S-1. It has 700 employees. It recently went public and is now at a $900 million valuation, or 9 times its current run rate.MarketoMarketo was founded in 2007 in California and went public in April 2013. It is growing over 50% a year, has a $144 million revenue run rate, and just reached cash flow breakeven last quarter. It has over 3,400 customers and 600 employees. It is ranked second, just below Oracle in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for CRM Lead Management. It caters more to SMB than some of its larger competitors. Marketo's product was the inspiration for SharpSpring and its management set out to build a better product using Marketo as the product to beat.InfusionsoftInfusionsoft, based in Chandler, AZ was founded in 2001 and has had $73 million in venture funding to-date. It has over 580 employees and in 2013 it generated $56.8 million in sales, up from $39 million the year before.Act|OnAct|On Software was founded in 2008 in Beaverton, OR. In 2013, it reported $19.3 million in sales, double its 2012 revenues, and now has over 400 employees. It also has had $73 million in venture funding. Its $42 million April round was lead by TCV, and it is eyeing a 2015 IPO. It has over 2000 customers, and its average clients has 15 employees.GraphicMailGraphicMail provides a front end for customers to create, launch and track email, social media and text campaigns all from the same software. Its capabilities are similar to MailChimp and Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT) and its features are robust enough for the sophisticated user, but intuitive enough for a neophyte. Its major competitive advantages are: pricing that is lower and more flexible than its major competitors, and support that is accessible 24/7 to all users. The company uses two different types of pricing schemes, by volume per month for the occasional users, and by maximum contacts reached per month for the heavy user.CompetitorsConstant ContactConstant Contact is an $865 million public company that was founded in 1995 and is located in Waltham, MA. Last year, it did $285 million in revenues, and is expected to sell $330 million in services in 2014. It has over 1,100 employees. It sells a suite of online marketing tools to SMBs, the components of which are called: Email Marketing, EventSpot, Social Campaigns, SaveLocal, SinglePlatform, and Survey.MailChimpMailChimp is the name of the product created by the Rocket Science Group a company located in Atlanta, and was founded in 2001. It claims over 7 million users of its product. It has 90 employees, and reported that its customers sent 70 billion emails in 2013. It has taken no outside funding. It uses a freemium model, and does not charge for sending emails to less than 2000 contacts up to 12,000 emails per month.ExactTargetExactTarget was founded in 2000, went public in 2012 and was acquired by salesforce.com in 2013 for $2.5 billion. It also owns Pardot, a marketing automation company that competes with SharpSpring but is more appropriate for large enterprise customers. The last quarter it reported ending March 31, 2013, it generated $88 million in revenues and was still losing money. Thus it was purchased at 7 times is revenue run rate. It currently employees approximately 1,900 people worldwide.RISKSMANAGEMENTIn the past year, there has been almost an entire revamp of management as the decision was made to pursue growth by expanding product offerings and synergistic acquisitions. Executives were brought in from outside the company to add expertise and perspective. Jonathan Strimling was hired as CEO in 2013, and brings with him the views of an eCommerce email user. Ed Lawton, who was hired as CFO in 2014, added considerable expertise in M&A.Jonathan Strimling- CEOJonathan became CEO of SMTP in August of 2013. He has 20 years of experience as an executive and entrepreneur, largely focused on the commercialization of innovative products and services. From 2006 to 2011, Mr. Strimling served as the President and CEO of online retailer American Biomass Corp. Also, from 2012 to present, Mr. Strimling served as the President and CEO of US Dynamics, LLC, a consulting company, UltraCell Insulation, LLC, a manufacturing company, and Secure Neighborhoods, LLC, a security company, all of which are located in Manchester, NH. Also, Mr., Strimling was a governor's appointee to the Economic Strategy Commission for the state of New Hampshire. Mr. Strimling received his BS in Mechanical Engineering from Northeastern University in 1992 and an MS in Mechanical Engineering and in Management from MIT in 1996.Ed Lawton- CFOEd just joined SMTP in September 2014 from Bottomline Technologies where he worked for eight years and was Sr. Director of Finance. At Bottomline he was involved in 20 acquisitions. Before that he was a senior finance executive at Trico Marine Services. He is a CPA. He earned a BS in Accounting from Babson College in 1999.Yvonne Gaudette- VP of MarketingYvonne joined the firm in September of 2013 after being a marketing consultant and advisor for eight years at a variety of small companies. She earned a BS in Business Administration at Franklin Pierce College in 1995 and an MS in Administrative Studies in Innovation and Technology at Boston University.Rick Carlson- CEO/Founder of SharpSpringRick came to SMTP in August 2014 with the acquisition of his company, SharpSpring. Rick has 12 years of executive management experience in the technology sector, holding president, CEO, general manager, and board positions at several successful Internet security companies. He was the founder of CyberPatrol, and before that worked at Panda Security and AVG Technologies. Rick earned and MBA from the University of Florida in 2001.Travis Whitton- CTO of SharpSpringTravis joined SMTP with the acquisition of SharpSpring in August 2014. Before joining SharpSpring, Whitton was the primary data storage architect at Grooveshark.com where he implemented solutions for scaling the website to millions of visitors per day and also developed machine learning technologies used for intelligent radio, social feeds, and enriched user experiences. Prior to Grooveshark, Travis was the Chief Data Officer at PPB Environmental Labs. Travis has been a professional musician and member of the local music community for over fifteen years.Semyon Dukach- Chairman of the BoardSemyon is Chairman as well as the largest shareholder of SMTP with over 50% ownership (before the upcoming issuance of stock for the acquisitions.) He bought the company in 2002. He is a serial entrepreneur, inventor, philanthropist and angel investor. Since May 2014, he has been a managing director at TechStars. He co-founded Fast Engines, Vert, Global Cycle Solutions, PDFfiller, and East of Air, and has led SMTP since 2002. He received his BS in Computer Science from Columbia University in 1989 and his MS in Computer Science from MIT in 1992, where he was known in the early nineties for creating the SNPP Internet payment protocol, as well as for managing one of the notorious MIT Blackjack Teams.OWNERSHIPFINANCIAL FORECASTSQ3 2014This quarter there was a lot of action with the announced acquisitions of both SharpSpring and GraphicMail. SharpSpring closed August 15th and payment for it has reduced the cash balance by $5 million, leaving the company with $6.5 million. Twenty-five new people will join 35 SMTP resources and we expect the company to add $250,000 in revenue from half a quarter's addition. We expect this acquisition to be dilutive to earnings.We expect revenues to be $1.7 million up 14% over last year's $1.5 million, but expect earnings to decline to a non-GAAP $0.04 per share versus $0.17 per share in 2013. Share count should be up 61% from last year, due to the $11.5 million offering earlier in 2014.Q4 2014In the December quarter we expect the GraphicMail acquisition to close. This company sold $4 million in services last year, so we expect that it could add between $0 and $1.2 million in revenues depending on the date it closes. When the shares used for the acquisition of GraphicMail are added in, we expect shares outstanding to be 7.6 million up from 3.1 million in 2013, or 144%. With all the noise of the acquisition, we do not expect the acquisition to be immediately additive, but it should be so in 2015.2014For the year, we are expecting revenues of $6.5 million versus $5.7 million in 2013 up 13%. However, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be down to $0.22 versus $0.60 the year before as the new management and M&A expenses lower margins.2015All of 2015 should contain all the revenues and expenses of both SharpSpring and GraphicMail so we expect revenue comparisons to be huge through all four quarters. In 2015, we are looking for $13.0 million in revenues versus $6.5 million in 2014, up 100%. As SharpSpring grows and the company achieves some cross selling between the three businesses, we expect margins to increase throughout the year.We expect a big tax rate improvement as GraphicMail, the larger acquisition is headquartered in Switzerland. SMTP will receive over half its revenue from overseas. So far in 2014, the company has paid a 40% tax rate versus the 20% tax rate levied in Switzerland for GraphicMail. We are modeling the rate to go down to 32% but it could turn out even lower than that.The share count should be 7.6 million shares versus 5.5 million in 2014, reflecting the shares issued in the acquisitions. However, once the acquisitions are fully paid for, the company will have spent almost all its cash. As a result it may raise capital to continue to pursue more acquisitions. Also keep in mind if the earn outs are achieved on the acquisitions of SharpSpring and GraphicMail, another approximately 700,000 shares (or whatever equals $4.3 million then) will be added to the outstanding in 2016.VALUATIONSMTP can be valued against other public SaaS companies. Many of the highly valued SaaS companies are not yet profitable, so we are looking at valuation based on a multiple of sales. As shown on the chart below company valuations range from a low of 1.9 times enterprise value to forecasted 2014 revenues for the small struggling social business software platform vendor Jive Software, to a high of 18.3 times for $14 billion Workday, which provides a SaaS platform for human resource information systems (HRIS). The group yields an average of 6.8 times forecasted 2014 revenues and 7.7 times trailing twelve month.Using this metric, if we plug in SMTP's 2015 estimated revenues, we can see the stock moving to $16.38 by next year if the forecasts are reached. Of course this price does not even take into account the total return for investors if the additional 8% dividend is added included.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2429945,36281,2014-08-17T11:03:56-04:00,"On August 14th, SMTP simultaneously announced positive Q2 2014 results and 2 acquisitions which will have a big impact on the company in the coming year.I predicted in my recent in-depth article on the company that they would make some big acquisitions in 2014, and these add-ons will double revenues almost overnight.With an adjusted EV/Rev multiple now under 2.5x, SMTP is significantly undervalued and could easily double in the next 12 months.","At the end of last week, SMTP (SMTP) reported Q2 earnings ending June 30th, which came in at $0.03/share and revenues of $1.5m. Top line growth was 6% year over year, which is more or less inline with recent results. Bottom line earnings were significantly reduced from a year ago, but this was due mostly to heavy M&A activity in recent months. We can expect some of these costs to subside a bit in the near term after the company has announced two big acquisitions together with its quarterly report. For the second quarter in a row the company will pay out more cash in dividends than it has taken in from operations (annual yield is still 7.5% at current prices). Obviously, this isn't sustainable longer term, but it appears to be a positive sign that the company was very confident in the accretive power of its two pending acquisitions that it didn't see the need to cut the dividend.Since early 2013, the company has seen growth slowed to a single digit pace, and this quarter was keeping with those recent trends. A few weeks ago, I published an in-depth analysis on the company, which you can view here, where I covered the reasons for this. Although the email marketing and delivery industry continues to grow at double digit rates, SMTP has been in the process of shifting its business model to ramp up sales & marketing and better capture opportunities in the face of slowing growth. This journey to re-ignite growth has just taken one big step forward, as the company also announced last week that they are acquiring SharpSpring and GraphicMail. Interestingly, the market reaction to this was quite muted on Friday, as the stock was only up a few percentage points. However, I think the market is so far way underestimating the positive impact of this. Just consider:Overall, I'm really excited about these acquisitions and will be adding to my position at these levels before the market really begins to catch on.Disclosure: The author is long SMTP.

1026821,23552,2012-11-27T07:35:00-05:00,,"At Spruce Point Capital Management, we were recently screening for attractive microcaps with relatively low risk business models, experiencing above market growth, having solid, debt-free balance sheets offering downside protection, high insider ownership, and potential catalysts that could result in significant upside potential. The one company that fit our criteria perfectly is SMTP, Inc. We believe the investment opportunity offers an attractive risk/reward, and we recently became a shareholder.SMTP (SMTP.OB) is a provider of cloud-based services to facilitate email deliverability that includes bulk and transactional sending, reputation management, compliance auditing, abuse processing and issue resolution. The services provide customers with the ability to increase the deliverability of email with less time, cost and complexity than handling it themselves.Key Investment Highlights for Potential Investors to Consider are the Following:Large and Growing Market OpportunityAttractive Business and Financial ProfileShareholder Friendly Policies and Strong Insider OwnershipPotential Takeover Target Offering UpsideSMTP's Value Proposition and Differentiation PointsSMTP provides services to enable small, medium and large businesses to outsource the sending of outbound emails. Senders of email use their services to help maintain their online email reputation so that their email is not blocked and is delivered to the intended recipients. The services are differentiated by level of computer, software and customer support resources provided, which is largely based on the volume of emails sent by customers:SMTP's solution delivers both a technical and customer service aspect. From the technical side, emails outsourced to SMTP go through ""reputable"" IP addresses to ensure delivery to the inbox and monitor delivery issues. SMTP actively educates clients on how to maintain proper email lists and how to send emails, while working with ISPs and email providers to address resolutions to non-delivery issues.Competition is Intense but FragmentedSMTP faces competition from three principal categories 1) in-house, do-it-yourself operators, 2) integrated solutions from email marketing companies and, 3) direct competition from infrastructure providers. Integrated solutions companies range from companies like ConstantContact (NASDAQ:CTCT), ExactTarget (ET-OLD), MailChimp, and VerticalResponse. These are mostly one size fits all models, and have all customers on one IP address. For enterprise customers with large needs, even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has entered the market with their ""Simple Email Service"" which allows customers to leverage their infrastructure at low cost, but with limited service, support, or add-on features. SendGrid.com is another example of an infrastructure provider. Some of SMTP's closer competitors are AuthSmtp.com, SMTP2Go.com, TurboSMTP.com, SocketLabs.com, and iContact.com.SMTP is Focused on Low Risk, Profitable Growth, and Will Reward Patient ShareholdersWith an experienced management team and laser focus on growing the business, revenues have jumped from just $1.5 million in FY 2009 to $5.2 million as of LTM 9/30/12. All of the growth has been organic, and primarily from inbound lead generation. Given the company's simple, SaaS-like model, Gross and EBITDA margins are 77% and 35%, respectively as of LTM 9/30/12. The company's high EBITDA margins are a function of their extreme focus on cost discipline, while retaining a small entrepreneurial environment. SMTP has 25 - 35 contractors in the Ukraine that handle technical support, engineering, R&D, and other administrative functions. The core management team is based in Cambridge, MA.The company is extremely capital efficient and has generated $900,000 of net income on average equity of $850,000 in the last twelve months. This translates into a Return on Equity of 106%. Free cash flow per share has historically approximated earnings per share. The company is managed in a conservative manner, and the management has articulated that they will not pursue acquisitions or unprofitable growth opportunities. Instead, the company will return excess cash to shareholders through regular and special dividends. Shareholders are currently being rewarded with a 6.3% dividend yield, while the business continues to grow organically, and the strategic evaluation occurs.M&A Activity is Robust in the Marketing Services Space and Offers Upside PotentialIn October 2012, SMTP announced that it retained Bowen Advisors to help it evaluate strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value. We believe this is a strong signal from the management and its Board that they believe their share price to be undervalued. It is easy to understand why this would be the case with the torrid pace of M&A activity in their markets, and modest valuation they are currently receiving. In addition to the various direct and adjacent competitors we discussed earlier that would be interested in evaluating SMTP as a target, there are a variety of other companies that have been acquisitive in the email marketing space. In just the past few months, Twitter acquired RestEngine, Rackspace acquired Mailgun, and Vocus acquired iContact. We believe these deals underscore the priority that companies are placing in using email services to connect and engage with customers in an increasingly competitive and slowing growth business environment. The table below summarizes recent transactions in the email marketing software and services sector.Current Valuation Leaves Room for Appreciation Even Without a Strategic TransactionWhile there is no exact comparable company to SMTP, we have benchmarked their valuation against a broad range of marketing and digital software service companies such as Valueclick (VCLK) and Acxiom (NYSE:ACXM), although closer comparables are likely ExactTarget, J2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM), ConstantContact (CTCT), Responsys (NASDAQ:MKTG), ReachLocal (NASDAQ:RLOC), and Zix Corp (NASDAQ:ZIXI). In the table below, we have provided a full valuation comparison.The key financial metrics and valuation comparison are best illustrated in the charts below. As can be seen, SMTP has above average margins and growth, yet trades at a valuation discount to peers, primarily as a result of its microcap discount and limited awareness of its investment merits and opportunities.Key Risk Factors to ConsiderAs a small company and microcap, there are numerous risks that investors should consider when evaluating SMTP. We've listed a few possible concerns, but for a complete list, potential investors should read the company's Risk Factor section in SMTP's annual report.· Technology risk: As a technology company, the market for their services is competitive and rapidly changing, and has low barriers to entry. New technologies and new entrants to the market, could increase competition and harm their ability to increase sales, through lower customer additions, or lower product pricing.· Contract risk: Customer contracts are short-term in nature (1 month to 1 year). The company must continually renew existing customers, and attract new ones to continue its historical growth.· Search engine risk: SMTP relies heavily on search engines to attract customers, so changes in search algorithms and advertising prices could increase their costs and/or reduce their customer growth rate going forward.· Shareholder concentration and microcap illiquidity: A majority of SMTP's shares are held by its Board and management team. Potential investors must get comfortable owning the company through periods of reduced liquidity, and comfortable with the management team that exercises control over the company's strategy.SummaryFor investors that can get comfortable owning shares in a small technology company in a large and fragmented industry, we believe that SMTP represents an attractive/risk reward at the current share price. The company's email marketing and delivery solutions address a large and fundamentally growing need for organizations to effectively deliver their email needs, at a cost-effective price, with minimal bounce rates. SMTP's base of over 8,500 customers, extremely low cost structure, and debt-free balance sheet help to mitigate some business and financial risk. Furthermore, investors are currently being rewarded with an attractive 6.3% dividend yield. At the current share price, the company is valued modestly at just 2.5x, 12.8x, and 7.1x 2013E sales, EPS and EBITDA, respectively. Our research suggests that M&A activity is accelerating in the email marketing solutions sector, with a broad range of large and small companies scrambling to broaden their offerings to customers. As a result, we believe SMTP could be attractive to a number of acquirers, and that investors are currently receiving a free call option on a value-enhancing transaction.DisclaimerUse of the research produced by Spruce Point Capital Management, LLC is at your own risk.

1148381,42851,2013-01-31T16:43:18-05:00,,"SMTP Inc. (SMTP.OB) may not be a household name among individual investors, but its global e-mail marketing and delivery platform is well known among its 10,000 customers that include many Fortune 500 companies. The platform provides SMTP server relay services to send mail from web applications to recipients' inb-oxes with a focus on deliverability.Unlike many micro-cap stocks, the company has been consistently profitable and, even more surprisingly, offers a cash dividend yield that was recently hiked 20% to $0.072 per share. The newly increased fourth quarter dividend is payable November 30, 2012, to shareholders on record at the close of business on November 20, 2012.Consistently Growing And ProfitableSMTP is also unique among micro-cap stocks for its consistent growth, profitability and cash dividend to shareholders. Last quarter, the company reported revenues that jumped 35.1% to $1.35 million, gross profit that jumped 24.6% to $1 million and pre-tax net income that jumped from $384,000 to $424,000, or $0.02 per diluted share.""We continue to experience healthy growth of both top line revenues and net income,"" said Richard Harrison, CEO of SMTP Inc. in a recent press release. ""During the quarter, we added to our value proposition with new support programs that offer a higher level of personalized service and attention to our larger customer segment.""The company's business model involves charging companies between $2 and $450 per month to manage their e-mail marketing and deliverability. As of December 31, 2011, the firm had approximately 500 corporate customers paying $450 per month and many more small business owners paying $2 to $200 per month, generating a stable recurring revenue stream.Effective Product in a Growing MarketFounded 12 years ago, SMTP is an independent service provider focused exclusively on the execution of e-mail delivery for applications in marketing and the enterprise requiring bulk e-mail or high volume transactional delivery. For instance, retailers can use its solution to send coupons and other e-mails to shoppers while avoiding the ""spam"" folder.The proliferation of e-mail has led to the growth of spam, blacklisting, bounces, blocked IPs, firewalls and e-mail filtering. Even legitimate traffic can easily be flagged as ""spam,"" regardless of how well the sender adheres to the rules. The company's solutions address these concerns to provide higher-yielding levels of service to business users.The e-mail marketing industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% between 2011 and 2016, hitting $2.47 billion in size by 2016, according to US Interactive Marketing. E-mail deliverability is perhaps the greatest concern or this growing industry, which has resulted in strong demand for services to improve these metrics.Potential Investment OpportunityIncome investors looking for exposure to the micro-cap space may want to consider investing in SMTP, given the company's strong 7.2% dividend yield and predictable recurring revenue streams. Meanwhile, the growth potential of its software in a rapidly expanding industry provides a further catalyst, as the stock trades at P/E to growth ratio of well below 1.0.But before investing, investors should also remember that SMTP is a micro-cap stock that entails greater risk than larger companies. Some of these risks include reduced liquidity (making it difficult to enter or exit positions at attractive prices) and less access to the capital markets for the company itself (perhaps impairing its business plan's funding needs and making financings more expensive).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Investorials.com has a team of writers focused on the small-cap space.

4381090,102101,2020-10-23T15:44:50-04:00,Snap's impressive Q3'20 results highlight the growing success of its platform strategy.Snap's growth story is expected to continue to sustain the strong momentum heading into FY'21.Improved ad platform and investments in creative shows and content are playing into the desires of the company's target audience.I expect Snap to continue to outperform on sustained DAU and eCPM improvements.Now is the time to understand the big picture.,"Source: SnapchatSnap (NYSE:SNAP) reported a blowout quarter with revenue accelerating 52% y/y at $679m. This is way above the midpoint of analysts' average estimate of $550m. Adjusted EBITDA also improved to $56m (versus -$42m in the previous year), highlighting the significant margin expansion to be expected as its AR (augmented reality) platform bets begin to bear fruit. Going forward, I expect the holiday season to drive sustained momentum. Analysts were expecting revenue of $2.2b in FY'20. Given its strong outperformance YTD, I expect forecasts to be raised across the board. In addition to favorable macro tailwinds, Snap has created an attractive niche for itself via its AR engine, which will drive positive cash flows as we exit the current year.Before COVID, many investors abandoned ship due to DAU (daily active users) stagnancy and concerns about platform health and usability. Snap has since fixed most of these concerns. In addition to the revenue tailwind from the shelter-in-place trend, Snap recorded an 18% growth in daily active users (249m) according to its Q3'20 conference call. This growth was observed both on the iOS and Android platforms. Snap doesn't share DAU split across platforms. However, I believe the bulk of the growth is from Android users in the rest of the world geo-segment. The rest of the world segment recorded a DAU growth of 26m y/y. This growth validates the thesis that declining smartphone cost, cheaper access to fast internet, and the improved Android UI will continue to drive DAU and platform engagement in the foreseeable future. I believe India is a major contributor to this growth, given Snap's impressive investments in the country in recent quarters. EU's DAU grew by 7m (y/y) while North America added 6m (y/y). Q/q, overall DAU grew by 10m mostly from the Rest of World (RoW) segment. These numbers are impressive against a backdrop of growing competition for attention from Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), TikTok, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and Instagram. It is also possible that the uncertainties that loomed over TikTok and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in Q2/Q3 drove content creators to Snap. There is no doubting Snap's ability to retain these content creators as it can leverage its Creators Profile product to help with content curation and data analytics.Overall, I believe Snap's impressive growth story erases most of the doubts that detractors are harboring about its ability to add value to its target audience.Circling back to India, Snap observed a 50% growth in Indian Snapchatters watching Discover content. Snap has invested a lot in shows and content for Discover users over the years, and the recent results speak to the huge success of its investments. Recently, Snap has leveraged celebrities like Conor McGregor, Kevin Hart, and Jaden Smith to engage the Gen Z demographic. This point is important because Snap, like other social media platforms, has been leveraged by the Gen Z demographic to solve personal and social problems. Snap's ability to embed itself in the daily activities of Gen Z is only limited by its imagination. Beyond creating fun Lenses, Bitmojis, following their favorite celebrities, and sports shows, Snap is also helping in many unimaginable ways. Snap highlighted the ""Raise Your Voice"" lens, which was leveraged by Snapchatters in honor of important movements in US history. This is really important for investors to digest. By providing a platform for Gen Z to solve problems in intuitive and unimaginable ways, Snap is making itself a critical extension of the lives of people who fall within this age demographic. Anticipating these pains and solving them in creative ways is why the younger age demographic returns to social media platforms. This totally deviates from the pre-conceived notion that these social media platforms are just for sharing photos and laughing at cat emojis. Snap also highlighted the use of machine learning, indicating that some advanced number crunching is going on behind the scenes. It is important to note this point as we segue into the advertising section.Source: SnapIn my previous thesis, I pointed out the numerous way Snap is empowering users on its platform. Local lenses continue to foster collaboration amongst Snapchatters. This is good for local businesses trying to reach out to users in creative ways. Snap also highlighted its Meet The Snapchat Generation campaign. This campaign is important to help brands digest the shopping habits and brand engagement drivers of Snapchatters. Snap has already aggregated millions of millennials and Gen Zs. Over 80 million of Snap's users already engage with its augmented reality content. Augmented reality content and ads are unique, and they differ from traditional marketing creatives. This means Snap is winning a unique portion of the advertising budget from brands that leverage its platform. In the last quarter, Snap reported a 28% increase in its average revenue per user. This highlights Snap's growing ability to monetize its ad inventory. Readers will recall that Snap has invested a lot in its direct placement advertising platform. Therefore, the impressive results in recent quarters aren't far-fetched. As we advance, investors should anticipate how products like Headspace Mini, Sounds, Snap Games, and other AR content will be leveraged by a younger demographic of users.As expected, revenue outperformance will continue to drive gross margins. Gross margins improved to 58% (versus 51% in the previous year). The ease of ad placement and budget expansion on a direct placement platform means gross margins will continue to improve as long as advertisers meet their set campaign ROI. This trend will also flow to the operating margin line. Adjusted operating expenses percent of revenue declined to 50% versus 61% in the previous year. Operating margin improvement has also been assisted by reduced G&A expenses and improved stock compensation initiatives. In Q3'20, net loss margin improved to -29% of revenue versus -51% in the previous year. Operating cash flow improved by $21m while free cash flow improved by $15m. While Snap didn't provide a forward revenue or EBITDA margin guidance, I expect the strong DAU and inventory monetization trend to continue. In addition to its improved ad engine and unique AR creatives, new campaigns like Platform Burst give a peek into Snap's ad monetization strategy. Platform Burst is a campaign strategy that guarantees reach and frequency on ad campaigns. This is akin to takeover ads on TikTok and Masthead on YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Going forward, analysts are expecting a 28% growth in the current year and 38% growth next year. This isn't far-fetched in light of the multiple tailwinds benefiting digital ad platforms. The recent release of 5G-enabled iPhones further validates Snap's AR strategy. This will make it easy for media buyers to plan for more ad spend to be rotated to Snap as the quality of content and ads created for the platform is expected to improve. Readers will recall that Snap has already invested in a platform for developers to improve content creation. Therefore, I believe we are just scratching the surface of the immense value that Snap's AR platform can deliver to end-users and advertisers.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4380544,103480,2020-10-22T10:45:58-04:00,"Shares of Snap vaulted by nearly 30% after the company reported a blowout third quarter.DAUs came in substantially above expectations, highlighting that usage of Snap has continued to balloon amid the pandemic.ARPU growth was also a surprise in a continued challenging ad environment and helped Snap's profitability substantially.Looking longer term, however, Snap trades at astronomical valuations for a company that risks being a fad.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is enjoying one of its strongest periods of bullish sentiment, ever. The social media company just reported a blowout third quarter that featured far faster-than-expected user growth, intensified user engagement (driven by the pandemic), and a recovery in ARPU trends - all of which led to a surprising boost in profitability.Immediately after earnings, shares of Snap rallied ~30% (one of the stock's best one-day performances ever) and notched new all-time highs.Data by YChartsNow, investors are approaching Snap with a lot of puzzlement. Now, sitting at a ~$50 billion market cap, investors are wondering in which direction Snap will turn: will it become a mega-giant like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), or will it take more of the steady-niche path, like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)? Or will Snap just fade into obscurity like many other social media companies before it?There is no doubt that Snap has executed tremendously well amid the pandemic. Snap's robust growth in users as well as the sharp recovery in its advertising business and ARPU amid a very challenging pandemic environment is a testament to the relevance and popularity (at least for the moment) of its core product. I, however, remain bearish on Snap - and in particular, I think now that several risks have emerged that investors should be wary of:At present, however, investors are valuing Snap very richly despite its mountain of risks. At present share prices near $36, Snap trades at a $53.63 billion market cap. After we net off the $2.72 billion of cash and $1.65 billion of debt on Snap's most recent balance sheet, its enterprise value is $52.55 billion. Versus Wall Street's FY21 revenue estimate of $3.03 billion (+38% y/y; data from Yahoo Finance), Snap trades at a very rich 17.3x EV/FY21 revenue multiple - now, the most expensive social media stock in the market, trading even richer than Pinterest (PINS). To me, Snap's optimistic valuation doesn't bake in any of the risks the stock faces - particularly the fact that social media landscapes shift so rapidly, and the company's scale may be drastically different in a few years.In my view, investors should exercise extreme caution in Snap while it's trading at all-time highs.Let's now go through Snap's third-quarter results in greater detail. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Snap Q3 resultsSource: Snap Q3 earnings releaseThis was one of Snap's best quarters (from both a nominal and gap to expectations standpoint) in recent memory. The company's revenue soared 52% y/y to $678.7 million, crushing Wall Street's expectations of $551.5 million (+24% y/y) by a wide mile. This also represents a tremendous acceleration versus just 17% y/y revenue growth in Q2.Snap's top-line strength was driven by two factors: one, both in increase in the company's users, as well as a boost in both engagement and advertising macro trends that helped to boost per-user monetization.Let's start with the user piece first, which investors are most excited about. Snap saw its overall global DAUs grow 18% y/y to 249 million, adding 11 million net-new users in the quarter (far faster than net adds in the 7-9 million range in prior quarters). Wall Street, on the other hand, was more pessimistic about user trends. Likely baking in competitive impacts from the likes of TikTok into their expectations, analysts had a consensus of only 243.7 million DAUs in the quarter, or roughly 6.7 million net-new adds.Figure 2. Snap DAU trendsSource: Snap Q3 earnings deckBut it wasn't just the user surge that put Snap over the top. The average number of daily Snaps also grew 25% y/y, while new features like Shows saw a 50% y/y increase in engagement per user. At the same time, global advertising demand has rebounded from pandemic levels. All of these factors helped Snap's average revenue per user (ARPU) soar 28% y/y to $2.73. The bump was even more pronounced in Snap's most lucrative market, North America - which saw a 46% y/y bounce to $5.49 in ARPU, its highest-ever ARPU on record.Figure 3. Snap ARPU trendsSource: Snap Q3 earnings deckDerek Andersen, Snap's finance chief, commented on the Q3 earnings call that strong recovery dynamics in the advertising market helped Snap to turn in these fantastic numbers, but management isn't overly surprised by the quality of the results. Per his remarks on the call:At the same time, however, we do have to realize that Snap's results weren't perfect. In particular, DAU growth was incredibly uneven. Though the company added 11 million new DAUs in the quarter, North American DAUs were flat, with almost the entirety (10 out of 11 million) of the DAU adds in the ""rest of world"" segment (ex-North America and ex-Europe). The unfortunate reality is that, presently, these rest of world users are Snap's least lucrative - their $0.95 ARPU is less than a fifth of their U.S. counterparts, and even sunk -6% y/y.To me, this suggests that Snap's future revenue growth potential may be hampered, if its most monetizable user segment (the U.S.) is already at a saturation point.For the time being, Snap investors also cheered the company's profitability gains. Snap generated $56 million in positive adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, representing an 8% margin (17 points better than -9% in the year-ago quarter), and the first time Snap's EBITDA clocked in at positive outside of a Q4.Figure 4. Snap profitability trendsSource: Snap Q3 earnings deckHowever, given the uneven nature of Snap's user growth and the uncertain likelihood of a repeat performance, I'd be careful of assuming that Snap is now on a higher growth baseline.A ~30% rally in one day is enough to compensate Snap for its better-than-expected revenue and user growth in Q3 (especially because, as I mentioned, was lacking on the critical U.S. user growth front). It's hard to think that, with Snap trading at a heady ~17x forward revenue multiple, there is much upside left in this stock. Steer clear here."
4380176,69905,2020-10-21T05:09:10-04:00,"Snap impresses the Street with 52% y/y growth rates.Snap's daily user base is much bigger than Twitter's.Snap is likely to be undervalued, even after its stock jumps 23% after hours.","Snap (SNAP) delivers an impressive turnaround with its Q3 results. Even though the stock is up 23% after hours, I make the case that Snap is not fully priced yet.At approximately 13x its 2021 revenues, with by my own estimates at least 35% y/y revenue growth rates for the year ahead, the stock is still not fully priced and could be worthwhile considering.Source: author's calculationsI'll be the first to admit, that I've called Snap overvalued countless times, but the facts demonstrate I've been dramatically wrong.Not only was I expecting Snap to see Snap's growth rates in time return to 35% to 30% y/y, but I suspected it would take a while.Consequently, not only did Snap truly spring back to high growth astonishingly fast, but I do not believe that many would have braced themselves for plus 50% y/y growth rates -- quite a remarkable feat. Snap's DAUs were up 28% to 239 million -- this figure is likely to be more than 22% higher than Twitter's (TWTR) daily active users when Twitter announces its Q3 2020 results at the end of next week.Here's the ultimate reality, Snap has a very strong moat. It's not a wide moat, but a niche moat. I suspect that many older investors would positively shy away from this investment, as they would view Snap as a fad company. However, Snap's latest figures conclusively demonstrate that brand advertisers are positively allured to Snap's key user demographic.Snap points to its recently launched Platform Burst as a means of allowing advertisers to mount a successful marketing campaign in just a few days while allowing advertisers to reach a large and unique audience.Furthermore, Snap points to its determined efforts in improving augmented reality features as one of the reasons for its strong user growth during Q3 2020.Snap's CEO Evan Spiegel remarked that this quarter's performance wasn't down to a fluke, but backed by two years' effort to improve Snap's infrastructure and to grow its community -- with Snap reaching 75% of the Gen Z and millennial access many Western countries, including the US.Moving on, lower down the income statement there was plenty to be delighted with too, as Snap's adjusted EBITDA figure reached $56 million and in positive territory for the second time.Incidentally, it's worth mentioning that Snap is approximately 7% shorted. This implies that on the back of these results, there will many short sellers being squeezed out of their position. Moreover, given that the days to cover are close to 3, shareholders may wish to wait around for the dust to settle before considering cash in gains.Including the after-hours bump of 20% the stock is now priced at 20x its 2020 revenues.Having said that, this is less expensive than meets the eye. In fact, I suspect that Snap will continue to impress investors over the next couple of quarters.Source: SA Premium ToolsAs you can see above, analysts following the stock were largely expecting approximately 30% y/y growth rates for Snap, but given the underlying improvements Snap has recently made, I suspect analysts will be having to revise upwards their previous estimates.Accordingly, it's difficult to be sure of what Snap could be growing at in 2021, indeed, the company itself is not confident enough to put out its own guidance for the next 90 days. Although during the call Snap remarked that growth rates in Q4 could reach 47% to 50% y/y growth rates.On the other hand, a rational mind can most likely expect Snap to be growing at 35% or higher over the next year. If that were the case, investors could expect Snap's revenues in 2021 to reach $3.2 billion, which would put its stock trading for just 13x its 2021 revenue growth rates.Snap's turnaround is not being fully priced yet. If Snap can continue to grow at approximately 35% over the next twelve months, which is a steep deceleration from its Q3 2020 revenue growth, the stock could be valued for just 13x its 2021 sales.On balance, even though many investors (myself included) have troubles with Snap's lack of profitability, Snap is clearly showing with this set of results that with strong revenues, its bottom line EBITDA figures can dramatically improve."
4380787,105697,2020-10-22T19:02:42-04:00,Snap delivered Q3 results after market on Tuesday.Snap turned an adjusted operating profit for the first time in its history.I remain bullish on Snap over the long run and the Q3 update underpins my thesis that Snap is a long-term winner.,"Note: I have written about Snap previously, investors should see this as an update to my earlier article on the companyThe pandemic has changed the game for Snap's (SNAP) long-term viability and this was shown in Q3. Snap is still reaping the benefits of the greater traction it received at the start of the pandemic as the company turned a profit in Q3. I still favor Snap over the long run as highlighted in my previous article and believe that Snap will 'stick' with users as generations grow older. The results have surprised the market as they have shown that Snap can achieve profitability quicker than the market initially believes and that with a scale-up in revenues and a mix of organic and attained growth Snap can be a very profitable entity.Source: www.searchenginejournal.comRevenues surged to $679 million far exceeding consensus estimates of $547 million, allowing Snap to turn a slight adjusted profit over the quarter of $0.01 which surprised the market (beat by $0.06). However investors must look towards the DAU's for the true source of optimism.For some time bears have cited the fact that Snap isn't 'sticky' as a basis for their point of view but recent statistics are starting to disprove this. Don't get me wrong Snap still has a long way to go before showing its long-term viability but Q3 is showing some promising signs. DAU's continued to grow in Q3, standing at 249 million which was up 18% year over year and 4% on July. But what really matters about these active users is how much they are actually using the app. Whilst it is difficult to track this, we can get a feel for how long users are spending on Snap through the number of snaps created which was up 25% from the prior year. This shows strong engagement on the platform as the number of snaps created is growing at an even faster rate than the number of new active users. This is at least true for the messaging side of the app.As many Snap investors are aware one of the primary issues facing Snap is monetizing the users on the platform. Snap's Discover channel is a core focus for monetizing users as it can lead to far longer 'user times' when people actually go onto the app. In Q3 time spent watching discovery shows for snapchatter's continued to accelerate up 50% from the prior year. Snap's strategy of investing heavily into its Discovery platform is starting to bear fruit. I also want to note that Snap's discovery platform gives the app the chance to compete in a way with TikTok. Whilst Snap isn't on the level of Tiktok, Discovery does give Snap viability as a 'time filler', where people can watch discovery shows when they are bored. This is what has made Tiktok so successful with its well-targeted 'For You Page' where users get immediate content that's suitable to their entertainment demands. This is an area Snap need to spend a lot of time and resources on making sure content is suitable and targeted for each user, to maximize user time.Looking in more detail at the discovery engagement figures, sports discover content has seen real success over the last quarter, with ' Gen Z' engagement growing 40%. Sportscenter gives Snap a real competitive advantage as it allows users to view recent sports highlights in a quick and concise manner. Snap has incorporated this into their platform as well as accessing these highlights and other entertainment can be done with ease. Whilst Snap's compatible platform has drawbacks on monetization it has bonuses in terms of user navigation. Sportscenter viewership grew 80% in comparison to the prior year.I only see DAU's continuing on its current growth trend right now as Snap build their Discovery content offerings with the launch of 'Coach Kev' in the last quarter. Big-hitting celebrities such as Kevin Hart are only going to improve both user acquisition and retention over the coming months. 'VS the world' docuseries reached 14 million viewers alone and featured well-known UFC fighter Conor Mcgregor.Snap also provided more clarity on how they are building strong ad partnerships with brands such as Hoka One One owned by Deckers (DECK), Kohl's (KSS) and Levi's (LEVI) to launch VR 'try on' experiences. What is becoming more appealing is that Snap is increasing the number of revenue pipelines in order to maximize shareholder value. Data remains a key focus for Snap as they look to sell on user trends to partners and show brands what their users as consumers are looking for in certain brands. This was shown through snaps 'Meet the Snap generation' campaign launched recently.Things are now really starting to heat up for Snap as they diversify their in app offerings and continue to build content. DAU's are accelerating and this was to be expected as Snap build an app with a focus on improving user engagement and increase time spent on the app through increasing its discovery offerings. Investing in camera technology may seem small but is also helping Snap become the go-to camera app for those looking for certain filters or to engage with friends. Many go on Snap now to take pictures rather than using their camera roll due to the huge available options that Snap has.I maintain the bullish view and still see Snapchat as a long term winner, Q3 is only the start. Snapchat continues to build its array of content and is showing that at scale the app can be profitable. Right now investors' focus should however be on building user trends and showing strong user acquisition and retention which Snap has shown tremendous success with over the last few quarters.If you enjoyed this article, make sure to hit the ""Like"" button, and if you want to see more coverage from me, then click on the ""Follow"" button at the top of the screen."
4380300,102598,2020-10-21T12:28:51-04:00,I saw my old friend Jim Cramer posted about the big social media stocks last night.We actually caught almost the exact bottom on each of the four major social media stocks over the years.Our history with these four stocks again drives home the point about being patient with our entry points into individual stocks and using valuation metrics along with our Revolutionary Trends.,"What a quarterly earnings report from (SNAP). What a move in all the big social media stocks. Let's look at some of our long-term SNAP analysis here along with some of our other history with social media and other tech stocks that have been so wildly outperforming this year and get a sense of why I always pay so much attention to valuations.I saw my old friend Jim Cramer posted the following last night:And guess what I realized. Not only do we own all four of the major social network stocks:...we also actually caught almost the exact bottom on each of the four major social media stocks over the years:Looking at those charts and how we had the patience to wait for the valuations of each one of those stocks to get somewhere that made the risk/reward scenario too compelling to pass up.I want to drive a point home about what has been our approach to buying any/all of our stocks over the years actually: It's not just picking good stocks. It's paying attention to valuations of those stocks so that you pay a good price to set yourself up for gains over time.In that vein, it's instructive to look back at what I was writing about SNAP when we bought it at what I thought at the time -- and which turned out to be indeed be the case -- that SNAP's valuation was too good pass up at $6ish per share back in October 2018 in an article called ""Trade Alert: Snap? Yeah, Snap. Here’s the analysis and strategy"":Likewise, last week I heard on Bloomberg that the best performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 this year are:We had all four of them this year. didn't we? We bought (TSLA) at $50 last year, (ZM) at $110 in March this year, (NVDA) at $30 just four years ago, and we bought (JD) last year at $31.Our history with these four stocks again drives home the point about being patient with our entry points into individual stocks, and using valuation metrics along with our long-term Revolutionary Trends analysis to find winners at good prices. It's highly unlike that these eight names in this article will continue to outperform the markets so huge next year mainly because they are up so tremendously much this year and last year.Which would mean that if people who are today buying these stocks or aforementioned the social media stocks might underperform in coming years even.To be clear though, obviously I continue to own and mostly hold each of these names.So, no surprise here that I'm going to trim about some, maybe 1/5 or so of my SNAP in both the hedge fund and my personal account (as our playbook dictates) on this huge pop today coming on top of the huge gains we already have in the stock courtesy of having bought it when the valuation was cheap and the stock chart was horrible."
4380161,22148,2020-10-21T02:27:04-04:00,Snap surges 20% on a blowout revenue beat.The company saw tepid user engagement growth considering the positive environment.The stock now trades at 16x '21 revenue estimates hiked up to $3.5 billion.,"Before doing any research on the Q3 results of Snap (SNAP), an investor needs to absorb that the $34 stock (initial after-hours trading) has a market valuation of $55 billion based on 1,624 million shares outstanding. The company had a blowout revenue quarter as analysts failed to fully appreciate the rebound in ad demand as the economy improved during Q3. My investment thesis remains negative on the stock due to a scary valuation and engagement trailing that of competitors.Image Source: Snap website Despite an economic shutdown where users all around the world were forced to stay at home, Snap only generated 18% daily active users (DAUs) growth to 249 million. Snapchat is back to consistent growth, but the social site didn't see blowout engagement numbers, with Snaps created on a daily basis only up 25%.DAUs were up 11 million sequentially to 249 million. The amount just matches the sequential growth during Q1, when Snap saw DAUs grow from 218 million to 229 million. Even worse, all of the user growth was from the ROW, with quarterly sequential growth of 10 million to 87 million, up from 77 million DAUs in Q2.Source: Snap Q3'20 presentationThe stock is surging over 20% due to the massive revenue beat. The big revenue beat was due to Snap growing North America ARPU to $5.49 from $3.75 last Q3. The North America ARPU surged 46% in the quarter, leading to 52% revenue growth.Source: Snap Q3'20 presentationThe revenue growth has absolutely nothing to do with an expanded user base and everything to do with ARPU growth. The company got $1.74 per user in additional revenue over last Q3 and up an incredible $2.09 from the prior quarter. The 90 million North America DAUs contributed $157 million additional revenues this Q3, with additional ARPU growth in Europe contributing $27 million more revenue.The stock is definitely a story based on growing monetization, but these stocks ultimately grow based on engagement, and Snapchat didn't generate the engagement growth one would've thought during the best environment in the company's history. One can only think TikTok is taking time away from Snap.Regardless, the company generated an impressive Q3 revenue total of $679 million. The COVID-19 impact to Q2 revenues makes the quarterly results difficult to analyze. The revenue total is about $120 million higher than the previous Snap record of $561 million back in Q1. The company didn't provide Q4 guidance, leaving the market in the dark as to whether these numbers are repeatable going forward or whether some advertisers had catch-up ad spending during the quarter after a weak Q2.Despite these positive revenues, Snap still managed to burn free cash flow at a rate of $70 million in the quarter. The company even reported an insane GAAP loss of $200 million. A main issue remains stock-based compensation, which pushed the diluted share count up by 59 million shares over last year to 1,624 million shares now.A lot of stocks are difficult to value in this environment, with ad spending and engagement warped due to COVID-19 impacts. Snap now trades as if the engagement levels from Q2/Q3 will grow going forward, while the likely outcome is a period of tough comps in 2021. With a vaccine and better virus treatments, the global economy is unlikely to see a repeat of shelter-at-home requirements next year, thereby reducing engagement of most users.The stock is now priced for perfection based on engagement and sales growth next year matching this year. Snap trades an incredible valuation of 16.5x forward revenues. Even if 2021 revenue forecasts surge to $3.5 billion, up from $3.04 billion current estimates, the stock trades at 15.7x those boosted estimates.Snap has now disconnected with all of the other social media stocks. Pinterest (PINS) is the closest in valuation at 14.5x forward revenue estimates, while both Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) still trade below 10.0x estimates.Data by YChartsThe crazy part here is that Pinterest grew users by a far faster clip at 39% in Q2, with MAUs surging to 416 million. If anything, Pinterest has far higher upside potential with global ARPU at only $0.70, while Snap is up at $2.73 already.The key investor takeaway is Snap now has a scary valuation. The stock no longer has the best engagement in the sector, and revenues will eventually follow engagement with other sector players playing catch-up on the monetization side. Investors should use the after-hours surge to sell the stock."
4377136,104722,2020-10-01T06:44:56-04:00,"While I like Snap as a company, I feel the market is fully realizing the growth story here, making it difficult to recommend over some of its peers.Although the company boasts strong sales growth rates, its margins are subpar compared to similar peers, meaning it has a longer path-to-profit and thus should be somewhat discounted.I tend to agree with many of the points made by Michael Morris of Guggenheim who recently upgraded the stock to Neutral on a sector-wide multiple-expansion thesis.This is a good company to watch in the event of a significant pullback, and certainly not a short candidate or something I would personally exit if I were long.Downgrading to Neutral on a valuation basis for now.","Exhibit 1: Performance YTDYCharts2020 has been rather kind to Snap (SNAP) investors with share prices appreciating over 50% year to date. This is because the company has continued to prove itself as a viable player in the internet advertising industry, with a strong base of blue-chip clients that proved durable during the Covid-19 crisis. The company is making the correct decisions from a managerial standpoint and is likely to see a Non-GAAP net profit by the end of 2021; so I am not inclined to place any bets in adverse action into the year's end.I am concerned with the company's valuation, however, which appears to be rather stretched and the likelihood that investors could exhibit profit-taking leaves me a bit too uneasy. In my view, there are better sources of exposure to this fast-growing industry, such as Facebook (FB), which boasts better fundamentals at more attractive valuations. For these reasons, I am going Neutral on Snap, but will open a position given a sufficient pullback in levels of trading.Snap is an internet advertising platform that is a major innovator in VR & AR technologies. The company debuted on the NYSE in March of 2017 and, despite an initial troubled run, the company has since recovered to trading levels above its initial offering range. Snap is led by its CEO and Founder Evan Spiegel and is headquartered out of Santa Monica, California. Unlike its larger competitors such as Facebook and Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), Snap has limited exposure to SMB clientele, though also a much smaller market share of the ad industry. In many ways this makes the company a tad more risky, but leaves it ample runway for future expansion, with limited exposure to regulatory risk which tends to gravitate towards the largest players.SalesBeing an internet advertising platform, the company generates sales by delivering ad impressions to targeted users for a fee referred to as CPM. A clean way to simplify this dynamic is to view revenue as a function of average user levels and average revenue per user. For these reasons, I use estimates of changes in the company's disclosed average revenue per user, ""ARPU"", and daily active users, ""DAUs"", by geography to reach an aggregate level of sales. The visualizations below illustrate my revenue forecast by geography, as well as my supporting inputs.Exhibit 2: Quarterly Sales Through FY22Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelExhibit 3: DAUs Through FY22Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelExhibit 4: ARPU Through FY22Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelExpensesOne of the key reasons why I selected Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) as my top pick in the internet advertising sub-industry over Snap at the start of the year, was the company's cost profile. Although Snap posts strong revenue growth rates and has impressive technological advancements, the company has a significant trek ahead before profitability becomes a viable option. Specifically, gross margins are an area of present-day weakness. I see the company experiencing a period of margin expansion over the coming years, but I do not foresee consistent quarterly operating profitability until the year 2023.Exhibit 5: Profit Margins Through FY22Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelExhibit 6: Net Income Through FY22Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelExhibit 7: Resulting Cash & ST Investments Through FY22Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelStatementsExhibit 8: Income Statement Through FY23 Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelExhibit 9: Balance Sheet Through FY23 Source: Snap Investor Relations, Contributor ModelPolitical Scrutiny and Anti-Trust RegulationSnap is too small to find itself at the receiving end of political scrutiny the likes of which its competitors Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet are experiencing, making political or legislative risk relatively low. Additionally, I would not be surprised if the current negative sentiment on the Hill towards TikTok strengthens the company's competitive moat, with content creators increasing usage of other platforms, such as Instagram and Snap, to hedge the risk of an outright ban in the US.Economic UncertaintyThe greatest risk, in my view, is the sustainability of the macro-economic big-picture in the ever-fluid COVID-19 state of normalcy. Given the elevated levels of unemployment, discontinuation of the enhanced benefit package, and the potential for a large-scale stakeholder effect related to a surge in SMB bankruptcies, there is a risk we see market valuation re-rate to the downside.Additionally, the forthcoming mass displacement of airline workers and many restaurant workers as outdoor dining becomes impossible during the winter months will only serve to hasten this economic impact if not quickly mediated.Emergence Of A Viable COVID-19 Vaccination Or Effective TreatmentMy outsized FY21 estimates are contingent upon a reopening by the spring season, allowing a resumption of commerce in major urban centers, and curbing the lingering economic impacts of the current elevated levels of unemployment. Although there have been talks about vaccines that are widely available as early as the year's end, this seems like a stretch. My background is not in health or science, and therefore cannot provide any meaningful commentary on the progress towards the initiative to develop and deploy a vaccine from the major western drug manufacturers. In the event this does not occur by Spring FY21, my estimates may require a downward revision.The 2020 ElectionThe upcoming election cycle is likely to be a debacle and the polarizing fiscal policy stances of the mainstream candidates will likely drive significant volatility. Bloomberg published an article claiming that the overwhelming majority of mail-in-voters are in favor of Joe Biden, while only 11% of those polling in-person are not in favor of the incumbent, Donald Trump. Depending on which count is completing first, it will likely appear to be a one-sided landslide victory for the benefiting party, only to result in a drawn-out contest while votes are recounted. Given that Joe Biden plans to double the maximum long-term capital gains tax rate if elected, this could lead to significant profit-taking in high-performing names, such as Snap, from opportunistic investors looking to capitalize on their window to sell prior new legislation.My price objective is based on a target multiple of 19x trailing EV/Revs supported by my DCF models using a 3% terminal growth rate, and a 16x terminal EBITDA multiple. I feel this premium is justified by 1) my forward growth estimates in the upper-range of its peers 2) the company's potential for net profitability on the horizon 3) my conservative estimate on corporate tax rates reflecting the potential for a less lenient fiscal policy in the near future.The output of my sensitivity analysis associated with my terminal EBITDA multiple DCF model indicates a potential fair value range of $21.46-30.19, or an upside/downside range of -13.06% - 22.28%. This just isn't the most compelling risk/reward trade-off of the peer group, with my price objective of $26.00 suggesting level trading with ~5.00% with a 12-month time horizon. I continue to prefer Pinterest due to its superior margins and cheaper multiples, but Snap is worth considering in the event of a sufficient pullback.

We warned again in August 2018, Bursting SNAP’s (Micro) Bubble, before closing the position in February 2019 after the stock had fallen 65% from its IPO closing price while the S&P 500 had increased 14%.Now, with the stock trading ~155% above where we closed the position, the valuation implies nearly the entire global population will be Snapchat users. Fiduciaries should consider this stock extremely risky, especially in today’s market. Snap is this week’s Danger Zone pick.We think those with fiduciary responsibilities need to consider just how much risk they take by owning SNAP at current levels. This report shows investors of all types just how extreme the risk in SNAP is based on:Snap went public riding a wave of rapid revenue growth and the hype of being the next big social media platform. However, that wave crested in 2017 and grows weaker by the day. As the firm attempts to scale up, and more competition enters the market (in some cases directly copying Snap’s core product), it becomes harder to maintain its past growth rates. For example, revenue grew 104% YoY in 2017 and 45% YoY in 2019. Consensus estimates expect revenue will grow 27% YoY in 2020, and just 15% YoY by 2026, per Figure 1.Snap faces an increasingly uphill battle to grow revenue at high rates as the fight for ad dollars intensifies.Figure 1: Consensus Revenue Growth Estimates: 2017-2026As with most social media companies, the road to profitability, which is elusive for nearly all but Facebook (FB), begins with growing users.Unfortunately for Snap, and investors that care about profitability, the firm’s growth is coming from its least lucrative market: “Rest of World.” Snap’s Rest of World DAUs grew 38% YoY in 2Q20, compared to just 11% and 8% for Europe and North America. ARPU in North America is nearly four times as high as Rest of World and three times as high as Europe, per Figure 2.While the faster growth in the Rest of World segment is partly driven by starting from a smaller base (North America is still the largest segment by DAUs), the lower ARPU in that segment exacerbates the firm’s already negative profitability.Figure 2: DAUs Growth and ARPU by Geographic Region – 2Q20The rate at which Snap is improving its overall ARPU is slowing too, per Figure 3. ARPU in the Rest of World segment grew 231% YoY in 2Q18, 25% YoY in 2Q19, and fell 26% YoY in 2Q20. Europe ARPU grew 69% YoY in 2Q18, 44% YoY in 2Q29, and 16% YoY in 2Q20. North America tells a similar story, where ARPU grew 12% YoY in 2Q18, 42% in 2Q19, and 8% in 2Q20.Figure 3: YoY ARPU Growth Rates: 2Q18 through 2Q20With revenue and ARPU growth slowing, it appears Snap’s path to profitability requires a significant reduction in expenses. We don’t see significant cost reduction coming anytime soon because it signals that the company has given up trying to grow and achieve scale, and that signal would likely cause most investors to sell.Accordingly, Snap’s cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and research and development costs (“Total Costs and Expenses”) are an astonishing 156% of revenue over the TTM period, per Figure 4.To maintain competitiveness, attract new users, and develop new products to engage those users, Snap must continue this spending, which makes us question whether it can ever achieve profitability. The firm admits this strategy is bad for business in its 10-K: “We expect to increase marketing, sales, and other operating expenses to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive. Increases in costs without a corresponding increase in revenue would increase our losses and could seriously harm our business.”We think investors should sell the stock of any company that's unlikely to generate profits.Figure 4: Total Costs and Expenses as a Percent of Revenue: 2018 through TTMRegardless of user base and growth rates, Snap’s heavy reliance on advertising dollars (98% of revenue in 2019, down from 99% in 2018) means it competes with some of the largest, most successful and most profitable media/internet firms in the world. Specifically, Snap’s direct competitors include Facebook (FB) and Instagram, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR), Pinterest (PINS), ByteDance (owner of TikTok), and more.Snap bulls can’t point to its user base as a strength, as competitors have larger or faster-growing user bases. Snap’s DAUs reached 238 million in 2Q20, an increase of 17% YoY. For comparison, Facebook reported 1.79 billion DAUs in 2Q20 for an increase of 12% YoY. Instagram has over 500 million DAUs (Facebook doesn’t regularly report YoY growth in Instagram DAUs). Twitter (TWTR) reported 186 million DAUs in 2Q20 for an increase of 34% YoY. Pinterest (PINS) reported 416 monthly active users (MAU), for an increase of 39% YoY.More broadly, one might consider that Snap competes against all content available for consumption. Any minute spent viewing something else is time that Snap could be showing ads. With so much content in the world today (social media, streaming and live TV, video games/streaming), the competition for ad spending has never been tougher.Facing virtually unlimited competition for the attention of consumers makes turning a profit even more difficult for Snap. With a user base that is dwarfed by Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and even TikTok (which reportedly has 800 million DAUs), Snap relies on lower ad prices to attract advertisers. If Snap increases prices for ads, advertisers have plenty of other, larger platforms to spend ad budgets.Per Figure 5, Snap’s NOPAT margin, invested capital turns (a measure of balance sheet efficiency) and return on invested capital (ROIC) rank well below its competition. We included GoPro in Figure 5 as a comp for Snap’s continued insistence that they are “a camera company” despite nearly all revenue generated from ad sales.Figure 5: TTM NOPAT Margin, Invested Capital Turns, and ROIC vs. CompetitionSnap’s lack of profitability reflects the downside to a growth-at-all-costs mentality. Competing on price is a losing strategy for a smaller firm already lacking profitability, as larger competitors can easily match prices, or even undercut, to lure advertisers away.Given the competitive market and negative margins, it should come as no surprise that Snap’s losses are large. Per Figure 6, Snap has grown revenue by 133% compounded annually since 2015. Snap’s core earnings[1], which have never been positive, have fallen from -$357 million in 2015 to -$1.1 billion over the TTM.Figure 6: Revenue Vs. Core Earnings: 2015 through TTMFurthermore, Snap has a history of significant free cash flow (FCF) burn that is unlikely to change anytime soon. Over the past four years, the firm has burned a cumulative $8.7 billion (25% of market cap) in FCF. In 2019, FCF was -$1.9 billion compared to -$592 million in 2018. Over the TTM period, FCF is -$2.7 billion. At the end of 2Q20, Snap had $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. At its TTM FCF burn rate, the firm has enough cash to operate for just over 12 months before running out or needing additional capital infusion.As with most unprofitable firms, Snap would rather investors focus on flawed non-GAAP metrics such as adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net loss, which paints a rosier picture of the firm’s losses. Non-GAAP metrics allow management significant leeway in removing actual costs of the business to present a more optimistic view.Among the largest items Snap excludes when calculating its non-GAAP metrics are stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.Over the TTM, Snap removed $683 million (36% of revenue) in stock-based compensation and $29 million (2% of revenue) in amortization of intangibles when calculating non-GAAP net loss. Per Figure 7, Snap’s TTM non-GAAP net loss of -$250 million is well above core earnings of -$1.1 billion. Economic earnings, which remove unusual gains/losses and changes to the balance sheet, are even lower, at -$1.2 billion TTM.Figure 7: Non-GAAP Net Loss vs. Core and Economic Earnings: 2016 through TTMWith slowing ARPU growth, heavy competition, already negative profitability, and ad rates falling across the industry, SNAP already looks risky. Next, we provide more details on why this stock is too risky for fiduciaries.First, Snap’s current economic book value, or no growth value, is -$13/share. But, let’s see what the price looks like if we give the firm credit for being able to grow into a profitable enterprise.We’ll start with using our reverse discounted cash flow model to analyze the expectations implied by the current valuation.To justify its current price, Snap must immediately improve its NOPAT margin to 16% (compared to -53% TTM), which equals Twitter’s best-ever margin in 2018, and grow revenue by 30% compounded annually for the next eight years. See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario.In this scenario, Snap would generate nearly $14 billion in revenue eight years from now, compared to $1.7 billion in 2019. At its 2Q20 ARPU ($1.91), this scenario implies the firm would have more than 7.3 billion DAUs, which equals ~94% of the global population, and more than four times Facebook’s 2Q20 DAUs.For comparison, if we optimistically assume Snap can increase its ARPU to $7.05 (equal to Facebook in 2Q20), then Snap needs just under 2 billion DAUs to achieve the revenue implied by its stock price. In other words, even if Snap can achieve the same ARPU as Facebook, it must have 11% more DAUs (eight years from now) than Facebook in 2Q20 to justify its current stock price. Figure 8 illustrates these expectations.Figure 8: SNAP’s Valuation Implies Impossible Growth in DAUsFor comparison, we compare the DAUs implied by Snap’s stock price to some of its largest competitors, per Figure 9. At its current ARPU, Snap’s stock price implies it will have more DAUs than Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube combined (estimated ~3.4 billion, assuming no crossover between users).Figure 9: SNAP’s Valuation Implies DAUs Will Dwarf CompetitionFigure 10 compares the firm’s implied future NOPAT in this scenario to its historical NOPAT. In any scenario worse than this one, Snap holds significant downside risk, as we’ll show.Figure 10: Current Valuation Implies Snap Will Generate More NOPAT Than Intuit (INTU) or eBay (EBAY)Given the competitive issues discussed so far, we believe the future cash flow scenario above is highly unlikely if not impossible for Snap to achieve.If we assume Snap can achieve an 8% NOPAT margin (equal to Twitter’s margin over the past three years, and well above its current -53% margin) and grow revenue by 21% compounded annually (equal to longer-term consensus estimates through 2029) for the next decade, the stock is worth only $7/share today – a 70% downside to the current stock price. See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario.Figure 11 compares the firm’s implied future NOPAT in this scenario to its historical NOPAT.Figure 11: Snap Has Large Downside Risk: DCF Valuation ScenarioEach of the above scenarios also assumes Snap is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are. For reference, Snap’s invested capital has increased by an average of $643 million (37% of 2019 revenue) over the past four years.Often the largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk” which means an acquirer comes in and pays for Snap at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. The high-flying valuations of certain tech stocks can be their own worst enemy, as they make the cost of acquisition much higher and the option to build out a standalone platform more attractive to potential suitors.Nevertheless, it’s possible that a firm could decide to buy Snap to jump start its entry into the social media market.We think it would be unwise for a larger firm to acquire Snap anywhere close to its current valuation. Here’s the math behind our thinking.First, investors need to know that Snap has liabilities that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers would initially suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. For this analysis, we chose Microsoft (MSFT) as a potential acquirer of Snap given its recent interest in acquiring TikTok. While we chose Microsoft, analysts can use just about any company to do the same analysis. The key variables are the weighted average cost of capital and ROIC for assessing implied stock prices for a deal to create value for the acquirer.Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, Snap is worth less than its current share price.Figures 12 and 13 show what we think Microsoft should pay for Snap to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. There are limits on how much Microsoft should pay for Snap to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ""goal ROIC"" assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate is 27% in year one, 38% in year two, and 32% in year three, or equal to consensus. In scenario 1, we assume revenue grows 32% in years four and five, or a continuation of consensus estimates. In scenario 2, we assume 40% revenue growth in years for and five to illustrate a better-case scenario where we assume Snap could grow revenue even faster with the resources of Microsoft.We conservatively assume that Microsoft can grow Snap’s revenue and NOPAT without spending any working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume Snap achieves a 20% NOPAT margin, which is greater than Twitter ever achieved, but still below Facebook. For reference, Snap’s TTM NOPAT margin is -53%.Figure 12: Implied Acquisition Prices for Value-Neutral DealFigure 12 shows the implied values for SNAP assuming Microsoft wants to achieve an ROIC on the acquisition that equals its WACC of 6%. This scenario represents the minimum level of performance required not to destroy value. Even if Snap can grow revenue by 35% compounded annually for five years and achieve a 20% NOPAT margin, the firm is worth much less than $24/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 6% ROIC would not be accretive to shareholders, as the return on the deal would equal Microsoft’s WACC.Figure 13: Implied Acquisition Prices to Create ValueFigure 13 shows the implied values for Snap assuming Microsoft wants to achieve an ROIC on the acquisition that equals 39%, its current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be accretive to Microsoft’s shareholders. Even in this best-case growth scenario, the implied value is far below Snap’s current price. Without significant increases over the margins and/or revenue growth assumed in this scenario, an acquisition of Snap at its current price destroys significant shareholder valueAt the end of April, the consensus estimate for Snap’s 2020 earnings was just -$0.23/share. Jump forward to today, and the 2020 consensus estimate has improved to -$0.19/share, despite declining ad spending across the industry. Snap hasn’t missed earnings in any of the past 12 quarters, but with the global uncertainty, slowing ARPU, and stiff competition, continued beats could be much more difficult.Further, the COVID-19 driven increase in user growth, which Snap described as an increase in daily active users at the onset of widespread shelter-in-place orders, already is fading. In the 2Q20 conference call, management noted “this initial lift (in daily active users) dissipated faster than we anticipated as shelter in place conditions persisted.” Such a bump in user growth will not likely recur, which could pressure user growth rates moving forward.If user growth doesn’t meet expectations, disappointed investors might dump their shares in favor of ones with better risk/reward profiles.Or, investors, at any time, could tire of subsidizing the operations of a highly unprofitable business.These days, fewer investors pay attention to fundamentals and the red flags buried in financial filings. Instead, due to the proliferation of noise traders, the focus tends toward technical trading tends while high-quality fundamental research is overlooked. Here’s a quick summary for noise traders when analyzing Snap:As noted in our original report on Snap, the firm’s multiple classes of shares leave investors with no say on important matters and much less disclosure relating to corporate governance (not ever a good thing). Because the publicly-traded A shares have no voting rights, Snap is not required to file proxy statements which normally detail the compensation committee’s decision-making process for determining executive compensation.Instead, investors get a less detailed breakdown in Snap’s 10-K. In 2019, Snap executives were eligible for base salaries, equity based awards, and discretionary performance-based awards. Snap notes that the majority of executive compensation is in the form of equity-based awards, which vest over multiple years, and the value of which is tied to Snap’s stock price. Discretionary performance-based awards also can be approved based on individual performance, overall performance, and the recommendation of the CEO.We’ve highlighted the problems that can occur when compensation plans are tied directly to stock price, namely that executives are incentivized to drive the stock higher with no accountability to the real economics of the business or true shareholder value.Without significant changes to its executive compensation, Snap will continue to be incentivized to boost top-line growth numbers with no attention to prudent capital stewardship. We’d recommend the firm’s compensation committee tie pay to improving ROIC, which is directly correlated with creating shareholder value.Over the past 12 months, insiders have purchased 17 million shares and sold 40 million shares for a net effect of ~23 million shares sold. These sales represent nearly 2% of shares outstanding.There are currently 73 million shares sold short, which equates to 5% of shares outstanding and nearly three days to cover. The number of shares sold short has declined by 12% since last month, but it’s clear a portion of investors aren’t buying Snap’s story.As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings as shown in the Harvard Business School and MIT Sloan paper, “Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence.”Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Snap’s 10-Q and 10-K:Income Statement: We made $237 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $47 million in non-operating expenses (3% of revenue). You can see all the adjustments made to Snap’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $537 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $489 million. One of the most notable adjustments was $152 million for midyear acquisitions. This adjustment represented 4% of reported net assets. You can see all the adjustments made to Snap’s balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $2.1 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $2.1 billion. There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value. Apart from total debt, the most notable adjustment to shareholder value was $150 million in outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represents <1% of Snap’s market cap.

Meanwhile, Snap trades at a premium to its peers.Investors keen to participate here would do well to consider a lower entry point.Source: author's calculationsAs we can see above, Snap's growth rates for Q2 2020 reached 17%. Snap's quarter ended June was a period that saw a dramatic slowdown in ad spend, as well as ad rates falling.Although the company does not guide for what its growth rates could reach over its coming couple of quarters, Wall Street is largely expecting somewhere in the range of 22% to 27% revenue growth rates during Q3 and Q4.Source: SA Premium ToolsThe message here is clear: Snap's breakneck growth rates are no longer likely to return towards 40% y/y any time soon.Snap's bullish thesis lies in the social media platform being able to reach those hard to reach.Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationWhat's more, younger generations spend 29 minutes more on mobile content compared to TV. For advertisers looking to go where the customer is, Snap is a very attractive advertising platform.Advertisers have been keen to embrace Snap's self-serve model, with Snap helping advertisers to align their message with popular verticals like ""Sports"", ""Entertainment"" and ""News"".As younger audiences spend more time engaging and transacting online, Snap is looking to add value to performance-oriented apps and e-commerce advertisers attempting to reaching these audiences.Snap's backend optimization has helped the company land retailers such as Sephora (OTCPK:LVMHF) and Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) run e-commerce campaigns through direct messaging advertising.Source: author's calculations, Q2 2020 Press StatementAs we drill down on Snap's revenue stream, above we can observe that nearly 70% of Snap's revenues are derived from North America.In other words, not only does North America carry Snap's prospects, but one could even make the case that Europe and the Rest of World revenues are a distraction from Snap's near-term prospects.Accordingly, Snap's North America revenues were up 18% y/y, and unlike other social media platforms, such as Pinterest (PINS) and Twitter (TWTR), Snap doesn't appear to have greatly benefited from social distancing restrictions.Putting hard numbers to it, during Q2 2020, Snap's DAUs (Daily Active Users) were up 9% y/y. This figure pales in comparison with its peers:Accordingly, Snap is not gaining strong enough traction from the ""stay at home"" theme, yet it remains highly-priced on this expectation.If we take a step back, we can see that Snap has still been priced at slightly over 17x forward revenues.For their part, Twitter is priced for less than 11x forward sales, while Pinterest is priced at less than 17x.However, these multiples alone only paint one side of the narrative. Here's another side:Consequently, investors are presented with an interesting dichotomy. Not only does Snap carry the highest sales multiple amongst its peers, but it also is the least profitable of these comparable social media platforms.As we compare and contrast Snap with its peers, it becomes incredibly challenging to build a compelling investment thesis for why Snap affords investors a positive risk-reward profile.Not only does Snap trade at 17x forward sales, which is a premium to its peers, but it also is the least profitable in the cohort.In sum, Snap's moat is already more than priced in."

While the company has experienced an increase in revenues in the second quarter of the year, its net loss for the period widened and the overall expenses increased. The reality is that Snap doesn’t have any major competitive advantages in comparison to others. By trading at an EV/Revenue of 16x, Snap is overvalued to its peers and for that reason, we continue to hold a short position in the company.Snap is up more than 10% since we published our bearish article on the company back in June. However, its share price started to slowly depreciate after the company reported mixed Q2 results in late July. From April to June, Snap managed to improve its Discovery feed by signing partnership deals with Disney, ESPN, BuzzFeed, and others. At the same time, it has experienced the increase of the average number of shows watched on the feed by 45% Y/Y, which helped Snap to increase its revenues by 17% Y/Y to $454 million. The problem is that sequentially, Snap’s revenues have been declining for the second quarter straight, even though the vast amount of people spent their time online during the period due to the implementation of nationwide lockdowns around the globe.Snap Revenues. Source: SnapIn addition, Snap’s average revenue per user of $1.91 was flat Y/Y and down Q/Q.Snap’s ARPU. Source: SnapAt the same time, Snap’s net loss widened during the period to $326 million from a net loss of $255 million a year ago, and its business generated a negative operating cash flow of -$67 million and a negative FCF of -$82 million. Its DAU of 238 million, was below the street consensus by 0.5 million.The problem of Snap is that the company doesn’t have any major competitive advantages. Its major demographic group consists of teens, who don’t have a lot of purchasing power and for that reason, it will be hard for Snap to improve its ARPU in the near-term. In addition, most of the new users come from outside the United States, where monetization opportunities are lower in comparison to the North American market. With a mediocre user growth and low ARPUs, it’s unlikely that Snap will be able to improve its performance in the long-term. For Q3, Snap expects to increase its DAU by 4 to 6 million to 242 million – 244 million and thinks that there might be a weak advertising demand in the following months.Since Snap wasn’t able to improve its bottom line and meet its DAU guidance in Q2, when everyone was at home, it’s unlikely that it will be able to improve its performance when all the restrictions around the globe are loosened. Considering that in Q2 insiders were dumping Snap’s shares at a record pace, there’s a possibility that the company will not be able to substantially improve its performance in the following months and its stock might tumble.The good news is that Snap has enough money, for now, to burn cash and not worry about the liquidity crunch. However, there’s not even an indication that Snap will become profitable at all in the next couple of years. The company constantly loses money and generates negative FCF every single quarter and this should be viewed as a red flag for value investors.Source: gurufocusWhat’s also interesting is that while the company’s revenues increased by 17% Y/Y in Q2, its operating expenses increased even more and were up 19% Y/Y during the period. Out of $307 million in expenses in Q2, only $120 million went for R&D, while the rest $187 million went to sales and general expenses. It’s safe to say that Snap is an inefficient enterprise and the only reason that it’s still alive is that there’s a group of people on the market, who believe that eventually, Snap will reach the breakeven point. By having negative margins and trading at an EV/Revenue of 16x, Snap is overvalued in comparison to its peers, as the industry’s median EV/Revenue ratio is 9x.Source: Capital IQConsidering all of this, it’s safe to say that Snap has very little value and no growth prospects in the long run. For that reason, we continue to hold a short position in the company, while at the same time we’re long Pinterest, which has more chances to create shareholder value in the long-term.On September 11, Bears of Wall Street will launch a new Marketplace service: Best Short Ideas.The goal of the service is to provide you with actionable short ideas from which you can profit by betting against the companies that trade at irrational exuberance levels and have limited upside.

4361143,104722,2020-07-27T16:56:55-04:00,"I have been wrong on Snap in the past, and today, I am more bullish.The recent rally is a bit concerning as it appears to have been driven in-part by intense retail trading.There appears to be an opportunity in the divergence in prices from sell-side consensus.Given I am bullish on the prospects of the growth trade, I think Snap is likely to outperform over the long term.","I have missed the mark on Snap (SNAP) in recent months, and it is time for me to admit that. On a macro level, central bank intervention and a risk-on rebalancing trade led to a significantly stronger base of support in equity markets and earnings estimates proved to be overly pessimistic. Specific to Snap and social media as a whole, investors cared much more about the extent of the pull-forward in user activities, even if monetization is not yet fully realized. Traditionally, ARPU and sales growth are top of mind (given that many of these firms do not post GAAP profits), but it would seem the focus has shifted to future monetization opportunities given the abnormality in present-day economic activity. That being said, this is not a thesis that I find comforting over the long term.Snap now faces the task of ensuring these new-user adds prove sticky during the reopening, and these users are able to be adequately monetized. A major risk factor to consider is the long-term economic fallout of COVID-19 on SMBs because, although only representing a small number of the company's current partnerships, these firms represent a portion of the long-term growth prospects. Additionally, at 14.4x forward EV/REV, it seems that the market is pricing SNAP's performance to perfection, leaving little room for the sell-side estimates of improving profitability to waiver despite an uncertain time-horizon for the crisis and margins that are lagging peers. Investing in Snap at this point is a bet on the firm continuing price momentum, and, given the fickle nature of demand-priced markets, this is a narrative that leaves me uneasy.Data by YChartsWhen it comes to monitoring Snap's valuation, I tend to rely on the enterprise value-to-revenue multiple. I do this because I prefer enterprise value multiples over price-based ratios given that I feel they better encompass the principal component of a company's debt, and because Snap is an unprofitable entity that trades on prospects of future top-line growth. Given that the company has traditionally posted premium growth rates relative to the peer group, it is awarded with a premium valuation on a forward basis. What concerns me is not the fact that it trades above the mean, but the degree to which it trades at premium levels, especially compared to its nearest comparable Pinterest (PINS).I have spoken about the comparison between Snap and Pinterest from an operating standpoint at great lengths in the past and I stand by this comparison. Both companies (previously) trade(d) at similar valuations, posted similar rates of trailing & forward sales growth, and have fought for the coveted rank of 3rd largest domestic social media platform over the past trailing twelve months. The greatest divergence comes in the form of the past Non-GAAP profits that Pinterest has posted, as well as the firm's significantly higher gross and operating margins. Despite these similarities, Snap shares have recently achieved an ultra-premium valuation relative to shares of Pinterest and I think it's, at least partially a reflection of the company's investor base.Source: RobintrackThe graphic above was taken from Robintrack, the platform that tracks Robinhood investor activity, and it seems to tell a story of a paradigm shift in the company's investor base. If you look to the March sell-off, you will see that the precipitous recovery was led by a spike in user purchasing, which today puts the stock at the rank of #15 most held in client accounts. I am fully aware that Robinhood does not have sufficient AUM to move markets alone; however, I do feel that user-activity is a strong proxy for retail trading across self-direct brokerage accounts, and that dollar amount is a different story altogether. Furthermore, the company's relatively high short-float ratio opens the opportunity for small trades to have a significant response in pricing (see below).Data by YChartsThe significance of a surge in retail trading is an infusion of investment from individuals lacking formal financial education or investment experience that may not be evaluating the company using the correct methodology, and thus displacing the valuation and disrupting price-efficiency. For those of you who are not familiar, price-efficiency refers to the a concept in a theory by Burton Malkiel which states that asset prices, given the presence of enough sophisticated participants, will accurately reflect all known information regarding the investment opportunity - with the key being ""sophisticated participants"".A good example of a market that has lost price efficiency as a result of a limited number of sophisticated participants can be found in Silicon Valley Venture Capital. Although these VCs employ some of the highest caliber financial professionals, the limited number of participants and opaque reporting requirements has led to a number of valuation debacles, such as the WeWork (WE) disaster this past Fall.I am concerned that many equities are seeing a problematic surge in retail interest that is displacing their valuations to the upside. Many of these investors are trading on technical analysis, qualitative attributes (i.e.. ""All of the kids use it"" or ""No one will go the grocery store"" in the case of Blue Apron (APRN)), and are emboldened by a sensation of false-confidence as a result of the recent meteoric recovery in the Nasdaq. Valuation and stock picking is not an exact science, every analyst who put low price targets on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) can attest to that, but this is largely the result of correct methodologies being employed with incorrect assumptions driving the inputs. In this case, there is at least some method to the madness, but in the case of price-momentum trading, you are only betting on the existence of a greater fool.Data by YChartsThe chart above illustrates the sell-side (Wall Street) analyst consensus and range on Snap's price objective. Looking to the average read, it appears that a buying opportunity has emerged as a result of the recent sell-off in technology as well as the recent earnings disappointment. This opportunity appears to be to the tune of ~20% with the upside and downside scenarios being +/-45%, respectively. It's worth noting that this is the first time we have seen a significant apparent discount in share prices relative to Street estimates in months, and this could be part of why we saw the second spike in purchases on Robinhood following the firm's earnings results.My opinion is that the company will likely perform closer to the upside scenario. As much as I think Snap is trading too richly, I would not bet against the growth trade in a period when financing rates are at near record lows. Firms now have a very good reason to lever the balance sheet and pump the gas on growth while locking in interest rate debt financing. Additionally, central bank intervention in corporate credit markets creates a safety net for healthy businesses by reducing the risk of a failed offering, meaning a longer than previously understood liquidity runway.The biggest risk to this trade is that the integrity of the momentum-driven valuation is dependent on flawless execution as evident by the recent sell-off despite a robust top-line beat on sales and a match on net income. If investors begin to see weakness in the company's prospects, then a downward correction is likely.I am cautiously bullish on Snap over the next 12-24 months, but I fully expect volatility in the near-term as there are just too many uncertainties on a macro level. That being said, I still do not like this name as much as Pinterest simply on a valuation basis. I feel that Pinterest offers better fundamentals at a more attractive value, creating a margin of safety in this growth trade which I will always prefer to a current premium. That being said, although I initially considered going Neutral, I am Bullish on the long-term prospects for Snap. Investors need to be weary of the intense retail positioning in the name, and all that comes with it, but I feel that institutions are still keeping some degree of sanity for the time being."
4362233,105304,2020-07-30T09:21:07-04:00,"Snap delivered a Q2 beat, but saw a substantial decline in growth rates.Snap is priced near a 2-year high EV/Sales multiple.The company is struggling to generate free cash flow in a tough advertising environment.Snap's user growth remains steady.I'd rather own other digital advertising companies like Pinterest right now.","Snap Inc. (SNAP) is priced substantially higher than any of its peers and is possibly due for further multiple contraction, given what is likely a tougher advertising environment for another quarter or two. User growth appears to be staying steady in all regions, but ARPU in Q2 remained the same as last year. The company still has a solid balance sheet to weather further storms, which has perhaps given investors confidence to bid shares up to a 2-year high sales multiple. Investors should proceed with caution and only consider adding or initiating a position on dips from here, in my opinion.Going forward, Snap, eventually, will have to get to positive free cash flow to maintain a sustainable business model. While I think they'll get there, it could take a few years yet. Disruptions like COVID-19 can clearly have a negative effect on the company's ability to generate free cash flow, as one will see in the Q2 earnings recap below. I find this concerning, and I'm surprised the stock hasn't declined more after the earnings report (year to date, the stock is still up 40%, yet short-term expectations have almost certainly declined from the beginning of the year).Growth could pick back up in the back half of the year as businesses re-open and more business is conducted online. This could be good for digital advertising companies like Snap and, along with user growth, is probably why the stock has soared along with other technology and internet companies. The fundamentals, however, don't yet support the 40% year-to-date performance, in my opinion.Snap reported GAAP EPS of -$0.23 in Q2 2020 earnings, in line with analyst estimates. Revenue came in with a surprisingly robust number of $454M, beating estimates by almost $10M in a challenging advertising environment. This was good for a revenue growth rate of 17% overall. Readers should note that this is down from the 40%+ revenue growth rate numbers the company had been putting up over the previous four quarters. Global Daily Active Users grew 17% year over year, the same rate as revenue. This meant ARPU came in flat globally.Breaking these numbers down by region tells an interesting story. Globally, DAUs grew 17%, with huge growth in rest of world of 37% (India itself grew DAUs by 100% YoY as mentioned on the conference call), while North America and Europe grew a much more modest 9% and 12%, respectively.Source: Snap Q2 2020 Investor PresentationARPU for rest of world declined substantially. North America and Europe still grew ARPU, but these gains were entirely offset by rest of world's decline, as global ARPU remained flat.Source: Snap Q2 2020 Investor PresentationThe company burned through $82 million in free cash flow in Q2, a stark change from what looked quite positive in Q1 when the company actually managed to post positive operating cash flow and negative free cash flow of just $5 million. Getting to free cash flow positive is, in my opinion, a key step for Snap going forward over the next year or two.Source: Snap Q2 2020 Investor PresentationSnap's balance sheet has cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of over $2.8 billion, with debt in the form of convertible notes of $1.6 billion. Thus, the company should be able to sustain losses like this for quite some time (over 2 years).Comparing Snap to other social media/digital advertising companies illustrates the market is pricing in a premium for Snap. Snap is growing the fastest, although I think Pinterest (PINS) could put up similar growth rates. Q2 earnings resulted in a repricing for Snap from an enterprise value of around 20 times revenue down to around 17, but given the significant free cash flow issues and a 2-year high EV/S multiple, I could see the valuation falling further and the gap between Snap and its peers closing somewhat. Personally, I'd rather own Pinterest right now. I'm neutral on Snap until they can show improvement in free cash flow and a more modest EV/sales multiple.Data by YChartsI'll be writing more articles on great (or sometimes not so great) stocks.

4359912,104703,2020-07-22T12:45:31-04:00,"SNAP shares are down ~6% in after-hours trading after releasing their Q2 earnings numbers.Overall, the numbers were very solid, at least in my view. ARPU and revenue beat, while margins were strong, and EPS and DAUs came in line.From the beginning of Q3 to July 19th, SNAP reported that revenue was up 32% Y/Y, though they expect moderation in this growth as the quarter progresses.Margins, cash bleed, user growth, and ARPU were all strong points for the quarter. SNAP's progress thus far in Q3 was also a point-of-interest for me, I didn't expect a turnaround in the financials that fast.Rating reiterated at SELL. PT raised from $15 to $17.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) reported Q2 numbers today, delivering some very strong numbers on virtually all fronts.With these numbers, I am a little surprised that the stock is down ~6% in the after-hours session, and anticipate a recovery in the share price as Wall Street and the sell-side digest the results.There was a lot to like about Snap's Q2 report. Here are a few things I liked:As you can see, while Snap saw strong sequential user growth, this was expected. Snap didn't disappoint on the user growth side, but they did surpass expectations in terms of ARPU. What was so shocking to me was that in a global pandemic that shutdown the vast majority of the world economy, Snap's global ARPU declined sequentially by only ~5%, while ARPU was flat Y/Y. A 5% decline while the rest of the economy was getting shelled is impressive. The fact that Snap was able to keep a relatively strong group of advertisers purchasing ad inventory on the platform was surprising. And clearly, this surprised the Street too, with Snap beating expectations on the monetization front by ~5.5%. Essentially, Snap's strength in keeping advertisers locked into the ecosystem despite coronavirus related spending headwinds is commendable.Second of all, Snap was able to keep their cost structure relatively grounded. They grew operating expenses $9 million sequentially, and yet, they didn't see too much damage to their overall EBITDA margin. I would have expected a nine-figure cash burn number this quarter, but because of management's fiscal discipline, cash-bleed was relatively low, especially in this economy. Keep in mind, that even with this cash burn, Snap has a total cash reserve of $2.8 billion. Worries about the company's ability to stay afloat without a capital raise are now unfounded.(source)And finally, even though ad pricing across the internet advertising industry was being shelled, Snap's gross margins remained flat sequentially. As ARPU and ad pricing fell, Snap was able to lower internal costs, particularly infrastructure costs to the point where they wouldn't lose any margin. This was very surprising to me, as I anticipated that Snap didn't have much leverage in terms of reducing COGS (cost-of-goods-sold) in an environment where ARPU and ad pricing were in decline. When Snap's revenue growth returns (fueled mostly by ARPU growth), gross margins will begin to expand at a much greater rate. The company's strength in terms of delivering consistent gross margins during this pandemic is, again, commendable.Snap gave us a little bit of commentary, but did not gives us a formal guide for Q3 or for the fiscal year as a whole.From the beginning of the quarter to July 19th, revenue was tracking up 32% Y/Y, a stark re-acceleration in growth. That being said, because of the disruption in normal activities that occur during this time, activities that drive revenue growth (like sports, back-to-school, and film releases), they anticipate a moderation in this growth rate. Revenue growth is still expected to accelerate sequentially, with the company planning their investments around 20% Y/Y revenue growth in the quarter.They also expect somewhere around 242-244 million users, and 20% growth in COGS/OpEx combined. Plugging these new assumptions into my valuation model yields a higher price target on the stock.While I concede that Snap's quarter and even a bit of their forward-looking commentary was positive, I remain generally bearish. In my view, post coronavirus usage of Snapchat could underwhelm, as general life returns to normalcy and time that used to be spent on-app moves to real world activities. My DCF (discounted cash flow) model implies a valuation of $17/share, a stark downside from these prices. And yet, this $17/share valuation (~$25 billion market cap) implies a little over an 8X 2021 P/S (price/sales) ratio. It uses an 11% discount rate and a 3% terminal growth rate. The valuation model goes out to FY2029, estimating just under $9 billion in revenue and ~67% gross margins by then. Even at $17/share, one could argue my valuation is too rich. With the stock at >11X sales, even for all the growth potential the company has, there is always a price for everything. Relative to other names, 11X is definitely a premium.Data by YChartsAnd right now, the risk/reward is heavily skewed in the bearish direction. For that reason, I remain a bear on the stock."

Regardless, its augmented reality strategy remains compelling.Its improving ad engine capabilities will drive more revenue growth and cash flow. With more goal-based bidding options, advertisers will rotate more ad spend to Snap.As long as DAU and platform engagement metrics continue to grow, betting against Snap due to potential earnings weakness remains a gamble at best.","Source: The WrapBears continue to misinterpret Snap's (SNAP) growth story. The fundamental premise of most bearish prints is centered around Snap's cash burn and waning competitive prowess. Yet, it is abundantly clear that Snap is successfully executing its short and long-term goals. Bears make the common mistake of valuing Snap like a social media company or an advertising company. The first sentence in the business section of its IPO prospectus, which has been left unchanged in its yearly Form 10-K, states that "" Snap Inc. is a camera company."" Believing that Snap is something else will prevent investors from enjoying the game of investing in Snap. Calling itself a camera company is highly strategic as its brand positioning dictates its long and short-term goals. It also dictates its capital allocation strategy and competitive positioning.That's why the first sentence made by its CFO during the last earnings call was centered around Snap's focus on strategic investments for the future. This explains the recent debt issuance and emphasis on its cash trove (plus untapped credit facility), which put its overall capital position at $4B. This update is more than sufficient to confirm that Snap has the working capital to keep executing in the short term. As Snap deploys its cash trove to drive innovation, it won't be focused on fighting for market share with Instagram or TikTok. It will be focused on expanding the market gap that is best filled using its augmented reality (AR) technology and premium video content. This market positioning is unique because the inaccessibility of non-digital attributes has hindered the online success of most digital products. This explains why Snap highlights Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) during its quarterly conference calls. For example, apparel fit is a non-digital attribute. Direct to consumer apparel sales is best achieved via technologies like AR. Investors following the news will realize that Nike's (NKE) future strategy aligns with driving direct to consumer sales. This growing trend will boost demand for Snap's ad inventory as more brands rely on digital marketing channels to sell non-digital products.If Snap is going to be outpunched by Instagram in its effort to target Gen X and Baby Boomers in delivering digital marketing solutions, its present and future potential with Millennials and Gen Z shouldn't be discounted. Last earnings, Snap highlighted a 40% increase in engagement with Discover content among Snapchatters over the age of 35. This highlights its growing potential to capture the Gen X market. This trend is important because Snap hasn't been appreciated for its capabilities beyond the younger age demographics.Investing in Snap on the premise that it is a social media company that is burning cash with fewer users compared to Instagram or Twitter (TWTR) will guarantee that investors miss the evolution of its camera platform, which leverages its innovation in AR to differentiate it from competitors. Snap only competes with other media platforms for attention and talents. That is why it reports DAU, and it also explains the huge stock-based compensation expense on its income statement. In terms of ad inventory type, Snap is mostly unique (Lenses, Filters, Story Ads, and Commercials). Given that augmented reality is a nascent technology, it's easy to understand why many continue to miss the true story. Most investors will only use ARPU and DAU growth to drive their short-term thesis. Interestingly, DAU (+17% y/y) and ARPU (flat y/y) have been above expectations in recent quarters if we back out the impact of COVID-19.Going forward, Snap has made a lot of product updates that are beginning to yield positive returns. These updates will sustain the DAU and ARPU growth trends.Source: SnapSnap's focus on content localization is driving DAU growth in its ex-North America markets. This will weaken the thesis that Snap has no strength outside North America. Throw in the upcoming rollout of 5G networks, and the declining cost of smartphones and the bearish rest of world thesis is effectively neutralized. I expect international programming expansion in Europe and the Middle East to continue to impact margins. This will be temporary in addition to the supply chain and cash transaction limitations observed in the rest of the world. That is why it is important to pay attention to content engagement rate in Europe and the rest of world segment. ARPU outside North America isn't a metric to be fixated on as it is obvious it will be weak due to the impact of COVID-19.Since COVID-19 leads to fewer companies participating in ad auctions, CPM rates will continue to fluctuate. This will impact monetization and ARPU. This is positive for Snap because the attractive CPM rates will give brands in digital economies more confidence to rotate more budget to experiential ad platforms (digital) like Snap. Snap's pace of innovation will also assist its growth factor as direct response advertisers continue to demand more goal-based inventories. The availability of measurable goals (pixel-based) like app installs and website conversions will make Snap attractive to advertisers of all kinds. The recent release of dynamic ads will also increase the reach of its ad platform. It is interesting to know that ROAS based bidding has been launched. This will help advertisers maximize their return on ad spend. ROAS is one of the most sought after advertising objectives.As bears continue to fixate on cash burn, they will miss the huge pace of innovation in content creation and ad engine optimization to empower users and advertisers. The strong user retention and platform engagement rate underline the effectiveness of Snap's recent initiatives. Via Snap Games (includes over 100 million Snapchatters), retention, and engagement rates will grow as friends collaborate to participate in fun games without the need to install new apps. Gamers should check out Bitmoji for Games and Bitmoji Paint. These updates make it easy for gamers to collaborate on Snap. Snap is working with studios like Zynga (ZNGA), Game Closure, and more to release more games. These partnerships will make it easy for gamers in top metaverses to discover Snap. This will further drive DAU and platform engagement.Snap is also working with content creators to make more premium video content (Snap Originals has reached more than half of the US Gen Z population). Snap Originals is available to users who depend on their mobile phones for quick delivery of entertainment. Innovation like motion tracking lenses will make it easy for users to be a part of some of the shows they consume. This means Snap will continue to make a compelling case to advertisers to rotate more TV ad budget to its video content. To further drive user engagement, Snap is partnering with news organizations to deliver breaking news to its users. This is dubbed Happening Now. Happening Now will reach over 125 million users (mostly Gen Z) who have watched Snapchat stories this year. These updates will take market share from traditional TV platforms. If Baby Boomers and Gen X continue to leverage traditional media platforms to consume information, there is no doubt Gen Z and Millennials will use their smartphones to fulfill the same purpose.New updates to Lens studio include the possibility for developers to include their machine learning models via SnapML. This creates endless opportunities in areas like Local lenses. Via Scans, users not only recognize dogs, brands, and plants, but they will also start identifying local businesses. This capability will be a solid fit for Places. As users share more local content, they will also discover more local businesses. Using Snap Map, users will get directions, call businesses, and take deliveries. These capabilities will complement Snap's ad business. It will also empower small businesses.Source: SnapSnap Kit now offers a lot of ways for users and developers to integrate Snap with other web apps. As more developers try out its offerings, Snap has the potential to enjoy ""Network Effects 2.0."" Snap Kit includes Camera Kit to help developers and brands add AR features to their apps. The announcement at its last partner summit features over 800 integrations to its platform. Login Kit enables users to sign up and log in to web apps using Snap. Ad Kit helps app creators to monetize their apps by featuring Snap ad inventories in their apps. Developers and users can also find creative ways to express themselves using Snap Minis, Dynamic Lenses (Creative Kit), Bitmoji Kit, and Story Kit. Via Snap Minis, Snap was able to collaborate with Headspace to offer tools to help users check in on their friends as COVID-19 shut down economies. As developers and content creators embed these kits on their platforms, more users will naturally interact with Snap's creative content.Given that Snap is still in the growth phase of its business lifecycle, the focus should be on its pace of innovation compared to potential AR rivals. Therefore, short-term margins fluctuation will be of little concern. Macro uncertainty (induced by COVID-19) will only have a temporary impact on revenue and user growth. Despite the investments in content, gross margin (non-GAAP) improved to 47% (vs. 46% in 2019). Snap is focused on driving operating efficiency and positive free cash flow. The improvements to its direct advertising platform mean brands now have more confidence in making upfront cash commitments. This is the period bulls have been waiting for. As Snap improves its measurement technology, CMOs (Chief Marketing Officers) will have no problem justifying the return on ad spend of their Snap campaigns. This will drive competition for premium ad slots from products that rely on augmented reality to sell their non-digital attributes. This untapped market will be effectively unlocked if the shelter in place measures remain as customers can't rely on offline stores (webrooming) to verify the fit of the items in their online shopping carts.Snap isn't buying back shares. Snap is investing in deepening the capabilities of its platform to add more value to users and advertisers. Exit strategies should put this in context.Snap only competes with social media platforms for ad budgets. In terms of its innovation strategy, Snap is a lone wolf executing to build a unique platform that has never been imagined before.

4360579,103480,2020-07-24T09:09:33-04:00,"Shares of Snap have fallen back nearly 15% after releasing disappointing second-quarter results.
        Despite a beat to the headline revenue and bottom-line estimates, Snap also reported a disappointing deceleration in user growth.
        The fact remains that while our online engagement is way up, there are a lot of competing distractions for our time.
        Management noted that the initial coronavirus-driven bump in user growth has cooled off.","A little air is starting to come out of the Snap (SNAP) bubble. Buoyed this year by the expectations of strong user engagement amid the coronavirus, Snap had enjoyed one of the biggest winning streaks in its short life as a public company this year, as shares nearly tripled from their nadir below $10 in March. Investors' enthusiasm for tech stocks - particularly Internet names that benefit from users being marooned at home and having little to do aside from work remotely and check social media - have sent shares of Snap up ~30% year-to-date.Yet it's clear that cracks are beginning to show in Snap's bull run, with shares off more than 10% after the company reported disappointing Q2 results. Expectations were very high for Snap - most of Wall Street had expected the company to continue riding the coronavirus high for multiple quarters. In my prior article on Snap, I raised three concerns with the company:Snap's latest results show that, even as lockdowns persist for longer than expected in the U.S., its primary kick of DAU growth in Q1 has cooled off somewhat - and neither has profitability made any meaningful progress. In my view, Snap still remains a stock to avoid.Daily active users, or DAUs, are Snap's most keenly-watched metric; not just this year but since the company went public. Snap's revenue growth - and ultimately, its path to profitability - relies on the company expanding its user base so it can continue to deliver a growing number of ad impressions. Especially in a year like this year, when marketers have pulled back from online advertising (Snap so far has said it is uncertain of the impact of the Facebook/Twitter ad boycott on Snap's business) and average cost of internet ads has gone down, user growth is Snap's only lever for revenue growth.And unfortunately here, Snap has disappointed us and the Street. Quarterly DAUs still grew at 17% y/y to 238.0 million this quarter, missing Wall Street's mark of 238.5 million. Figure 1. Snap DAU trendsSource: Snap 2Q20 earnings releaseNote two things here: one, Snap's year-over-year DAU growth decelerated four points from 21% y/y this quarter, and actually reverted back to the 17% y/y growth rate that Snap saw in Q4. Second, Snap added only 9 million net-new DAUs in Q2 - again, the same approximate run-rate as a normal quarter last year, and below the 11 million net-new adds in Q1. This suggests that the coronavirus bump may be short-lived.Even worse is the fact that two-thirds of Snap's net-new DAU adds were in the Rest of World segment. This user segment is far less lucrative than their North American. counterparts (each ROW user averages $0.89 in annual revenue, about 4x less than a North American user at $3.40 each), and ARPU (average revenue per user) in Q2 for Rest of World users was actually down -25% y/y:Figure 2. Snap ARPU trendsSource: Snap 2Q20 earnings releaseCommentary from Snap's CEO Derek Andersen on the Q2 earnings call also offers some helpful context on these user trends and how the response has evolved throughout the coronavirus (key points highlighted):We note as well that Snap saw severe revenue deceleration in Q2 - with growth slowing to just 17% y/y, down twenty-seven points from 44% y/y growth in Q1. Amid this, however, there is one notable glimmer of hope for Snap: a lot of conversation has built up over the past few weeks on the possibility of banning TikTok in the U.S. While an outright ban may not actually happen, the widespread rumors of security risks may slow the growth of TikTok's competing platform and bring more users back to Snap. The other point that needs to be made that, especially with ad pricing weighing on Snap's current-quarter revenues, the company has made little to no progress on its path to profitability. This positions Snap pretty poorly against other smaller (e.g., non-Facebook) social media companies like Twitter (TWTR) that have begun to show positive, if relatively small, profits.This quarter, Snap's operating expenses rose 19% y/y while revenues grew just 17% y/y. Unlike many other smaller companies, Snap has not made any meaningful reductions in its work force and has continued investing into the business (though this isn't to say Snap has never done this in the past - the company laid off >100 engineers back when it was struggling in 2018). Despite flat sales and marketing costs as expected, Snap's largest expense category - research and development - soared 31% y/y as the company continued to build out key features like Discover. Though we don't necessarily think it's a bad idea to keep Snap's platform fresh to compete with other social media companies, this has an impact on near-term profitability. Snap's adjusted EBITDA margins sank one point to -21%, as shown in the chart below. The fact that Snap relies heavily on stock-based comp (not unlike other high-growth tech companies), however, somewhat helps to mask the fact that actual GAAP net losses are swelling substantially. Snap's Q2 net losses grew 28% y/y to -$326 million - representing a -68% net margin. Figure 3. Snap lossesSource: Snap 2Q20 earnings releaseIn my view, for Snap stock to see material further upside from current levels, there needs to be a significant bullish catalyst in either 1) accelerating user growth or 2) a clear path to profitability. Snap's second-quarter results, plus the surprising revelation that the user engagement lift from the coronavirus barely lasted one quarter, makes a further rally even more unlikely for Snap.In the meantime, based on current share prices near ~$22, Snap is trading at a gargantuan $31.7 billion market cap, $30.6 billion enterprise value, and at 10.5x EV/FY21 revenues based on Wall Street's consensus FY21 revenue of $2.92 billion. That's too rich for a company that has seen revenue growth slow below 20% and is also seeing such deep red ink (on a GAAP basis, losing $0.68 on every dollar it's making).Resist the temptation to catch a falling knife here and steer clear."
4357133,105697,2020-07-06T12:41:01-04:00,"Snap has seen a large run up amid improving user trends.Snap continues to innovate and develop their moat.The company has a pricey valuation; however, I believe this is justified considering the great deal of opportunity for Snap going forward.Snapchat continues to develop and innovate their simple, convenient platform to attract new users and 'stick' to current users over the long term.","Snap (SNAP) has made significant headway in developing its MOAT and gaining large competitive advantages over its peers. Although there is still a large amount of competition in Snap's space, the company continues to bring in new and innovative features to engage with users. Back in 2018, Snap dropped to all-time lows as market fears grew that it was losing market share to Instagram (owned by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)). This was after Snap announced that average active users fell by a dramatic 3 million in Q2 2019 which further fuelled the share price fall. Although Instagram started to offer similar features to Snap as they improved their messaging service and started to offer stories, they never truly stole users off Snap and many teens (like myself) still opted to use both platforms but for different reasons. Throughout, Snap has remained users' predominant messaging app.Snap has continued to build both user base and revenues since 2018 showing a swift recovery in the number of active users and beating the expectations of numerous bears. I do not see that stopping going forward as I believe that Snap's stickiness as a platform is actually strong over the short term (post lockdown) but also over the longer term where I believe the app will stick with certain demographics as they grow older.Source: searchenginejournal.comThe social media space is very competitive, so gaining a moat can be difficult. Snap has done well to create its own competitive advantages in order to retain and gain new users.The sheer mass of users that Snap has now obtained on its own puts Snap in good stead. Through this, Snap has gained a strong networking advantage through word of mouth where it has become the go-to app for young users leaving the likes of Kik Messenger in the dust. Snap's primary demographic (12-24-year olds) is a hard to reach demographic. And by Snap's continued and improving strength in this market, they push off other competitors simply due to greater establishment and the network effect of this. This is very lucrative when considering attracting partners and advertisers going forward, if retailers want to access this demographic, Snap is the go-to app to do so.Snap has also shown its strength in innovation in order to maintain this advantage. It is constantly adding new features such as bitmojis and public stories while constantly updating the overall platform interface to keep the platform look fresh and appealing. A more recent feature was the launch of App stories bringing greater third-party involvement to Snap whilst giving these developers a platform. This was broadened with the introduction of Mini apps early last month.Although social media is a space where a large amount of 'copying' goes on where platforms steal others ideas, Snap has been at the forefront of innovation with a large amount of their original features being the ones copied. Although this doesn't mean too much over the long run as these ideas can't be patented, being the first in the market does provide a big advantage in gaining both initial traction and strong integration into its platform.Snap continues to be a host for more private conversations with options such as private stories and gives greater variability to what you can do with these stories (through added features). Although Instagram largely copied Snap's stories, they didn't mimic all of its features to make it as effective as Snap.First quarter 2020 results displayed exponential growth across the board for Snap in all demographics and geographies across the globe. In India alone, Snap saw 120% growth in active users as more and more people learned about the viability of Snap in connecting people. Although this exponential growth won't remain constant going forward, this will directly support Snap's business continuing to grow going forward as awareness of the app increases and word of mouth and the network effect continue to drive growth.Overall, Snap saw 229 million daily active users in the first quarter which was up 20% year on year. The key part of this growth for me was the broad diversified geographic growth that was seen with Daily Average Users (DAUs) increasing sequentially in North America, Europe, and the Rest of World. Overseas markets contributed 62% of Snap's DAUs, showing Snap's truly international position.Another pleasing result was the growth seen in Snap's Discover platform, a platform that has a dominant placement on the app. I was previously wary about how much engagement this feature would actually get. The growth in Discover viewership doesn't look set to slow down going forward as new Snap original 'Nikita Unfiltered' has received 20 million new viewers since its launch in March (to Q1 results in April) compared to a monthly audience of 10 million for other shows. The company's Discover platform adds to the entertainment factor of Snap's platform and helps to separate it from other messaging platforms. While Snapchat won't receive anything material from this feature over the short term as they continue to reinvest into improving content, they will bear the fruits of it over the long term.Much of the growth drive in the discovery platform is not simply COVID-19 fuelled but actually action that Snap has specifically taken to broaden the Discover offering for a variety of demographics. CEO Evan Spiegel highlighted this in the Q1 call:Another relatively new but more 'back seat' feature that also saw huge growth over the quarter is Snap Kit. Snap Kit saw 75% growth in the first quarter in comparison to Q4 2020. Snap Kit allows greater third-party integration into the Snap app through the 'creative kit'. Snap has started to further integrate their app and users' Snap profiles through the 'login kit' - allowing users to log into other platforms using a Snap account. These kits have allowed Snap to connect to the broader community, and continued growth in these kits will create greater Snap user engagement going forward.Snap has not simply just seen growth in revenues and active users but a huge amount of growth across the board in all of their offerings. This is a credit to the improvement and development of Snap's technologies and offerings over time. Management is focused on heightening overall user engagement and this provides greater monetisation opportunities going forward.Much of the 'bear thesis' surrounding Snap is that it won't' be 'sticky' going forward, but, on this, I disagree. I actually believe that Snap 'COVID-19 boom' will bring material positive effects for the company post lockdown. Users have increased their reliance on Snap throughout the period in order to connect with friends and this will lead to greater resonance between users and the platform going forward. Also, the new influx of users during 2020 will 'stick' to the platform going forward adding to the volume of DAUs. The truth is that although post lockdown people will be able to network in person, this will not stop the viability of Snapchat at other times with people using the app as a means of communication while on the move and when apart. As a Snap user myself, I can attest that Snap has been particularly useful during these uncertain times where staying connected with close ones has been so important.Much data has come out over the last few years which has shown greater penetration of Snap among older age groups, this offers Snap even greater opportunities going forward. In 2019, over 50% of Snap's new users were over 25 years old. This penetration into an older age group confirms Snapchat's viability to older groups as well. As Snap moves forward the existing penetration of the younger demographic and networking that has already been achieved in that group will deliver a broader demographic of people using Snap as there is a continual influx of new younger users.Snap also does very well to adapt to changing consumer trends, developing and offering users services and products that suit the trends and deliver more prolonged engagement. The company proved this during the crisis, as highlighted by Chief Business Officer Jeremy Gordon:The truth is studying Snap currently on fundamentals and its valuation, makes it seem like a sell. With much future growth already priced into the Company's market cap, this has also attracted a large amount of bearish coverage. However, going forward, I believe that Snap can fulfil and succeed in justifying this valuation. Snap, currently, trades at 16x this year's sales. This sure is pricey particularly when considering that Snap is still bleeding cash and loss making. However, I believe that Snap is making headway to become a profitable entity through a continued drive in user growth and user engagement. Snap continues to reinvest heavily into creating a far better and more engaged user experience that will give greater monetisation opportunities going forward providing ample upside opportunity for the business and shareholders.Snap was so well positioned for the crisis, offering advertising opportunities to companies with the greatest exposure to the younger demographic. As people came together to connect during the pandemic, Snap was well positioned to host that connection. This increase in traffic offered a significant opportunity to monetise its platform and generate strong sales. Snap still has a lot of work to do in improving its advertising products, but the company's innovation and versatility have shown they're on the path to better optimise their platform. Snap's near-term focus is on generating greater user engagement and gaining more active users, which as this quarter has shown, they have been successful in doing so so far and I expect this to continue.I believe the combination of continued growth in users combined with innovative product development means that Snap is set to be one of the big winners in social media going forward.If you enjoyed this article, make sure to hit the ""Like"" button, and if you want to see more coverage from me, then click on the ""Follow"" button at the top of the screen."

Even though its Daily Active User ('DAUs') numbers were not as strong as expected, its underlying operations are moving in the correct direction, with improvements to its operating cash flow and gross margin profile.Nevertheless, I remain unsure whether investors are getting a bargain opportunity as they are asked to pay close to 16x trailing sales for a company that struggles to find a path to profits.Source: Author's calculationsSnap delivered better top line revenue than I had expected. This was supposed to be the brutal quarter for the ad industry, and if its peers performed similar to how Snap performed in terms of ad pricing, it would appear that investors overreacted during the March-April sell-off.To illustrate we can see how Snap's more mature North America market performed in terms of pricing:Source: Snap ARPU, Q2 2020One could argue that the Rest of World for Snap was down 26%, but investors would most likely pay less attention to that market.What matters for Snap is mostly driven by its mature North America market, and here despite all the concerns from investors, Snap's ARPU was up 8%, which is impressive.Investors were hoping that during the lockdown, Snap would see its total number of Daily Active Users ('DAUs') soar:But as you can see from the red box, its North America DAUs were only up 9% year-over-year, which is less than the 10% increase in DAUs set in Q1 2020 (green box).Snap addressed this during its Q2 2020 earnings call:Put another way, for Snap, the lockdown did not translate into a very high increase in users. But it's not all bad.Snap's operating performance improved where it matters most, its operating cash flow and gross margins.Firstly, its operating cash flow came in at negative $67 million compared with $98 million in the same period a year ago, a $29 million improvement despite the challenging period for Snap.Secondly, its non-GAAP gross margin was 100 basis points higher to 47% compared with Q2 2019.Put another way, despite having to navigate unprecedented and unexpected conditions, Snap's operating results actually improved.However, when I think of Snap I fail to see a high-quality stock. Snap's top line is expected to bounce back and return to strong growth, but with so many higher-quality businesses trading for ever so slightly higher valuations, I'm struggling to see the appeal of getting invested in this stock.On the one hand, as you may note from the tone of this article that I'm less bearish Snap than I've been for a considerable amount of time.On the other hand, I'm still a cautious investor and prefer to miss out on an opportunity where I don't feel confident rather than chasing a stock where I fail to see an adequate margin of safety.Source: Author's calculationsRight now, Snap is being priced at very approximately 16x trailing sales. This is a marked increase from the period back in 2018.In essence, investors are willing to pay more than twice the multiple compared with what investors were willing to pay for Snap during 2018 - if that doesn't note the high level of investors' expectation, little else will.Source: SA Premium ToolsWhat's more, according to the earnings call, Q3 is on target for 32% revenue growth through July. Thus, as we look ahead to year-end, it now appears highly possible that Snap could reach or even slightly beat that year-end target of $2.2 billion in revenues. Yet, this unprofitable company remains priced at approximately 17x sales.In earnest, I've been calling Snap wrong for a prolonged period of time. And if I were a Snap shareholder, this set of results would not be what would cause me to sell out of Snap.Even though the results were not so strong, in my opinion, the results were positively better than I had expected.You may declare that I'm too cautious, and my personal requirement to avoid a loss of capital is now transforming itself into a bigger cost by omission.But I prefer it that way because when I invest, I want to be positively confident that the opportunity is tilted in my favor. Right now, with Snap, there's just too high expectations and too little doubt by investors that are getting reflected in its insufficient margin of safety."
4355675,103480,2020-06-25T14:00:02-04:00,"Shares of Snap have hit all-time highs in the wake of strong user trends.
        Despite the global decline in advertising rates, Snap has made up for it with a raft of new users and heavily increased engagement.
        However, I fear Snap's usage will begin to fade again once lockdowns ease.
        Competing platforms make it difficult for Snap to be truly sticky.","Snap (SNAP), the disappearing-messages social media company, has been one of the biggest winners of the year. After being mostly left for dead by investors for losing too much money and for potentially being a fad, shares of Snap roared back with a vengeance this year as the coronavirus made house-bound teenagers and millennials flock to the app in droves. Even as advertisers ratcheted back their marketing spend and caused a reduction in advertising prices throughout the globe, Snap was able to make up for these declines with the massive surge in its user base.Now up more than 40% in the year to date, shares of Snap are at new 52-week highs not seen since immediately after its IPO:Undoubtedly Snap is at a turning point. But investors shouldn't mistake this unusual time's strong results with Snap's true capacity to sustain that performance. What happens when we go back to work and school? Will we still use Snap as much? With its current ~$34 billion market cap, Snap is now the second-largest publicly traded social media company. It's worth about the same as Twitter (TWTR) and Pinterest (PINS) put together. Investors are betting big on this company's sustainability, and banking on the hope that it can become a multi-product platform like Facebook. While I acknowledge Snap's current user strength, I'm very wary of Snap's current valuation at ~16x forward revenues and am also unsure of Snap's capacity to be a truly sticky platform that lasts beyond the current generation. I remain bearish on this name.Let's start with the positive news first. Snap has succeeded in becoming a go-to-platform for people to spend their digital time in the midst of the coronavirus. Figure 1. Snap DAU trendsSource: Snap 1Q20 investor presentationAs seen in the chart above, Snap's DAUs rose to an all-time high of 229 million in the first quarter of 2020 (covering through the end of March), up 21% y/y and accelerating over Q4's 17% y/y growth rate. We note that April and May, which are more lockdown-impacted, are likely to be even stronger than Q1, so Snap likely has a very strong Q2 ahead of it. And despite the declines in ad pricing (which industry observers generally say is down 15 to 20%), Snap actually managed to grow its average revenue per user on a year-over-year basis, thanks to heightened engagement and time spent on Snap.Figure 2. Snap ARPU trendsSource: Snap 1Q20 investor presentationOverall, Snap was able to grow revenue at a 44% y/y clip in Q1, beating Wall Street's expectations by more than a ten-point margin. Let's now put Snap's outperformance into context. Yes, Snap's 21% y/y increase in DAUs is impressive. But when we recognize that Twitter produced 24% y/y growth in DAUs over the same time period (which accelerated from 21% y/y growth in Q4), we get the sense that Snap's outperformance isn't isolated to its platform alone.Figure 3. Twitter DAU growthSource: Twitter 1Q20 shareholder letterHere's the point that investors should be aware of: users now have a plethora of social media options, and I'm just not sure that Snap's is unique enough. Though Snap was the first-mover in the concept of short-form video and disappearing messages, Twitter has recently introduced a concept called ""Fleets"" that allows users to post disappearing 140-character messages that also can't be retweeted, almost mirroring Snap's format. Facebook's (FB) Instagram also allows for disappearing messages.Then there's TikTok. TikTok rose in popularity in the U.S. only this year, and surged in particular as the coronavirus left homebound teens with nothing to do but to post wacky dancing videos. As a private company, we don't have exact data on how popular TikTok has become, but certain third-party estimates peg TikTok's global MAUs at ~500 million. Of course, MAUs and DAUs are not directly comparable, but this data is enough to say that TikTok is a formidable contender to Snapchat for users' time.The relatively overnight surge in TikTok's popularity only serves to highlight how fickle and fad-oriented users are. New sensations appear on the stage all the time, and in my view, Snapchat isn't unique enough to handle that competition. The reason why Facebook has become so resilient is that, even in the wake of widespread controversy (last year, over privacy concerns, and this year over Mark Zuckerberg's laissez-faire stance to President Trump's posts), Facebook has a huge platform of products that extends beyond its core social media offerings. Facebook is also Facebook Messenger, Facebook@Work, Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Video, and a host of other products.So far, Snap has not deviated beyond its core disappearing-messages product, which is a feature that has been copied in bits and pieces by companies like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. I find it difficult to believe that Snap will be as prominent in five years as it is today. Yet Snap's valuation betrays very high investor confidence in its future. At current share prices near $24, Snap has a market cap of $34.1 billion. After we net off the $2.08 billion of cash and $0.90 billion of debt on Snap's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $32.98 billion. Versus Wall Street's consensus expectations of $2.10 billion in revenue this year (per Yahoo Finance, and representing ~23% y/y growth), this indicates that Snap is trading at a valuation multiple of 15.7x EV/FY20 revenues.This instantly puts Snap at a much higher valuation multiple than other publicly traded social media companies; this high-teens forward revenue multiple is also a stretch compared to the low teens/high single digit multiples at which Snap has traded in the past:Of course, Snap's higher revenue growth rates than peer social media companies may justify some of the disparity in valuation between its direct social media comps. But we note that companies in the software sector that have similar gross margins to Snap and a similar ~25-30% y/y growth rate expectation for the year also trade either in the high single digits or low teens. Snap's ~16x forward revenue multiple is likely the upper bound for where the stock can go - especially as this is a company that is still producing heavy GAAP losses in a market environment that favors stability and profitability over growth.There's no doubt that Snap has done well in adding to its user base amid the coronavirus, and higher engagement has helped to blunt some of the losses from lower ad pricing. However, we note that Twitter has seen similar user growth numbers. In addition, the broad competition from other social media companies makes me hesitant to believe that Snap can truly sustain its popularity five years into the future. The stock's ~16x forward revenue multiple, meanwhile, essentially prices the company for perfection. Stay on the sidelines here."
4353964,104703,2020-06-16T09:00:00-04:00,"SNAP shares are up ~167% off their lows as of writing. While bears have been consistently wrong on this story for a while now, I can no longer recommend this name.The stock has reached a valuation of $30 billion. While I have long believed that SNAP has been a good company deserving a higher valuation, I simply see no real upside.SNAP saw a drastic deceleration in top-line growth in the first few weeks of Q2. Coronavirus has clearly affected the overall demand for advertising. More weakness to come.The recent run to 52 week highs seems to ignore immediate short-term risks that I simply can't get around. Longer-term, internet advertising is a decelerating market that Snap may have problems gaining share in.Downgrading SNAP two notches from BUY to SELL. PT lowered from $18 to $15.","My first SA report, nearly two years ago at this point, was on Snap (NYSE:SNAP). At the time, Snap shares were trading around $12.50/share. The story was this: shrinking user base, poor share structure, hard to monetize attention, executive churn, Instagram competition, and a valuation that didn't price any of this in. At the time, I was short Snap (via puts), and had a $8 price target on the name. Sure enough, the short was very profitable as the market began pricing in these problems. The stock fell to $8, and well below. Eventually, I sold my puts for good money and ended up moving to a more positive stance on the company. Fast forward to now, June of 2020, nearly two years later. The stock has rallied >300% since hitting it's all-time low. Why is this? These risks, were one-by-one debunked as time went by. The user base that continued to shrink on a sequential basis eventually turned around. After the Android update, Snapchat saw a resurgence in usage that propelled DAU trends in the right direction. ARPU growth began to reaccelerate as Snap began expanding monetization opportunities on the platform. The usage and monetization progress showed that clearly, despite the looming threat of Instagram, Instagram is no longer affecting Snap's expansion. In addition, the C-Suite saw increasing stability, with churn decreasing greatly. All of this increased investor confidence in management, meaning that executive control of the voting stock was more tolerable. In addition, Snap's P/S multiple bottomed at around 3X revenue, meaning the valuation was no longer ludicrously expensive. So, it was a drastic fundamental turnaround. And while others on Seeking Alpha have been pounding the table on their pessimism on Snap, the company has continuously proved the doubters wrong.So, I have been on both sides of the trade, and made good returns both ways. And recently, Snap has consistently found a way to prove the bears wrong. That being said, I sold my long position in the stock, and am now a bear on the stock.Now that the old bear case is almost entirely down the drain, what does the new bear case on Snap look like? Here are the four main tenets:The first part of the new bear case on Snap is temporary pressure the company will face on the gross margin side. To understand the pressure Snap's margins will face in Q2, and potentially Q3, we have to understand how Snap makes money. They sell ad inventory on their platform. So, as advertisers stop buying ad inventory (the advertising market has been drastically hurt), Snap's ARPU (average revenue per user) will decline. At this point, it is basically a given that Snap's ARPU will decline. Even though Snap has tailwinds like programmatic and auction based advertising trends going for it, those tailwinds are likely not enough to offset a decline in ad budgets. But revenue is only one part of gross margins. The other part is COGS (cost of goods sold). Snap conveniently breaks down the three categories of COGS in their business: Infrastructure, Revenue Share, and Other. Infrastructure costs are the largest, making up ~66% of total COGS in the most recent quarter. Infrastructure costs do not directly correlate to ad inventory, infrastructure costs correlate with usage. So, as people use Snapchat more often, infrastructure costs rise. Just because there is more usage doesn't mean that more revenue will be generated. Especially considering the fact that advertisers in many segments have pulled back spending.So, as ARPU (revenue) contracts, and usage-based costs like infrastructure (gross costs) increase, margins will likely contract. Snap's infrastructure cost per/DAU was ~$0.71 as of last quarter. Revenue share was ~$0.22 as of last quarter. Other was ~$0.14 last quarter. This means Snap's CoRPU (cost of revenue per user) was $1.07. Assume this stays flat next quarter, and that DAUs grow 10 million sequentially to 239 million users. If ARPU drops 14% sequentially (a reasonable estimate in my view) from $2.02/DAU to $1.73/DAU, then gross margins are just 38.7%. Gross margins in Q1 were 47%. So this is a stark drop-off, and worrisome if ad budgets don't recover by Q3 (though I believe they likely will).Another interesting dilemma with Snap is this: right now, usage is up big, but ARPU is down big. As lockdowns ease and advertisers begin to spend again, usage will likely taper off too. Snap is one of many tech companies, that in my opinion, have seen a pull forward of organic demand growth for their products. What does that mean? Take Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) for instance. If COVID-19 never happened, the company would've likely continued to grow usage at a solid pace for years to come. But COVID-19 increased usage seemingly out of nowhere. While I believe the ramifications for usage of Zoom are much harsher than for Snap, I believe Snap could face something similar.Think about it. Why was user growth surging?(source: Snap IR)Well, before COVID-19, user growth was robust. This growth was driven by two main factors: (a.) Snap regaining cultural zeitgeist and (b.) Android update. If you remember, Snap said that they were seeing strong growth on both iOS and Android operating systems heading into the lockdowns. But the key driver was likely Snap's updated Android app. This brought in a flood of new users, and reignited Snap's cultural relevance. All the sudden, with this influx of new users (primarily from the Android ecosystem), other people that had virtually abandoned Snapchat for Instagram began returning to the platform.Now consider Snap's audience. Mostly teenagers (Generation Z), and some millennials as well. When school/work returns to normal, usage will likely dip. So while easing lockdowns will improve advertiser trends and ARPU, usage, or at least DAU growth, will likely decrease quite a bit.Another problem that is not temporary, and is on the horizon over the next few years is the general expected deceleration of growth in social media ad spending. We'll focus on mobile, because Snap doesn't have a desktop application.(source: Statista)Keep in mind, these are just estimates for the overall market. Nothing is set in stone. These numbers are adjusted for COVID-19, and initially, these growth trends look pretty solid. 16.6% growth in 2020, followed up by 11.5% growth in 2021 is undoubtedly strong growth. But from there, growth rates estimates are for deceleration into the single-digits. When the market begins growing in the single digits, Snap's ability to grow revenue will be based on their ability to gain market-share from their competitors in the space. That is where the problem arises. Can Snap legitimately compete with large well-capitalized corporations with much greater scale and better targeting? Don't get me wrong, I do believe Snap can carve out a niche, particularly around its target demographics. The only problem is, how much of the pie can Snap take from the competition? Eventually, the organic growth of the market will fade, and revenue growth will be zero-sum, meaning Snap grows at the expense of competitors or vice-versa. That being said, this is a huge market, the sheer size of which will enable growth at Snap for at least a few more years.Two very important factors (there are more than just these two) when it comes to choosing the best platform for advertisers are targeting and scale. Snap, while it has scale, doesn't have as much as the elephant in the room, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Let's say for a second that Facebook's massive third-party data collection practices that enable its uncanny targeting were banned. Even then, Facebook owns three platforms with 1 billion+ users: WhatsApp, Instagram, and the core Facebook platform. The cross-pollination of user data across these three platform is far more than the first-party data a platform like a Snapchat has. Simply put, Snap cannot, and never will be able to compete with Facebook's sheer scale.The other factor is targeting. Having a large amount of first-party (in-app) data is very beneficial, but Facebook's access to third-party data is again unmatched. While mobile operating systems are beginning to limit or outright ban third-party tracking, Facebook still has large amounts of access to third-party data that Snap again can't compete with. The combination of these factors means that in the mobile social media space, Facebook will be the dominant player regardless of Snap's enhancements. What does this mean? Snap should stick to its niche: Gen-Z and some millennials. This could play well with advertisers trying to grab the attention of younger consumers with growing purchasing power. But Snap will not be able to take on the big enchilada of social media advertising because of Facebook. Another way that Snap could stand to benefit is augmented reality. An augmented reality centric strategy could differentiate their product enough from Facebook that budgets could shift over to Snap.Again, at ~$20 Snap's valuation is not the most extreme it has ever been. That being said, it is quite rich considering the headwinds this company is facing. If we look past 2020, and look at to 2021, the valuation doesn't get much more compelling. The stock trades at just over 10X consensus 2021 sales estimates that I think are a little aggressive. I do not believe the market should be paying that kind of a multiple for Snap in its current state. Right now, my discounted cash flow valuation gets me to $15/share. On my FY'21 revenue estimates, my target is ~8X revenue. This valuation still reflects the long-term positive dynamics going on at the company.I have a history covering Snap. I have seen the company and understood it for a while. I have been on both sides of the trade. While I was primarily short in the past, when I saw the company's fundamental turnaround I took my profits and went long. Now, I have cashed in my long positions and am looking to take up a short (likely via put options). Until the valuation reflects the headwinds at Snap, I am going to remain bearish on the name.TIPRANKS: SELL"
4359760,22148,2020-07-21T19:38:57-04:00,Snap reported mixed Q2 results.The company guided towards highly disappointing Q3 DAUs at only 243 million.The stock is the most expensive in the social media sector and should be avoided without leading financial results.,"Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is amongst the cohort of technology stocks priced for perfection when the company is imperfect. While plenty of stocks trade as if the economy doesn't recover to previous levels, Snap trades at levels suggesting a return to strong growth in 2021, despite the company still forecasting a tough ad market in Q3. With the company still losing substantial amounts on a quarterly basis, my investment thesis remains negative on the stock up in the $20s with a market cap topping $40 billion prior to the earnings report.Image Source: Snap websiteTo be fair, Snap reported decent numbers considering the COVID-19 disruption of the U.S. economy. The company reported 17% revenue growth and 17% daily active user (DAU) growth during Q2.While the revenue growth has returned to a 30%+ clip in early July, the user growth hasn't hit the phenomenal levels of even Twitter (TWTR) that reached 24% in the last quarter. While 17% growth in users is solid, the stock is priced for far higher DAU growth.Per CFO Derek Andersen in the prepared remarks, Snap is on the path to a revenue recovery, but the company doesn't expect to maintain these growth rates:The user numbers were even slightly below analysts' predictions conceding the company had forecasted users at 239 million and only reach 238 million. The CFO remarks on Q3 users is a huge disappointment with a target of only 5 million sequential DAU growth:Why this matters even more is the company still reports substantial EBITDA losses. For Q2, the EBITDA loss again dipped from last year to $96 million from a $79 million loss last Q2.Source: Snap Q2'20 presentationEven the quarterly net loss plunged to $326 million. The biggest risk with Snap remains the very problem with the COVID-19 shutdown where an economic hit is more impactful to a company reporting a history of loses. Such companies tend to struggle with ever reaching breakeven and cash flow positive levels.Prior to Q2 earnings, Snap had rallied all the way back to $25. With 1.6 billion shares outstanding, the stock had an incredible market valuation of $40 billion.As mentioned above, Snapchat doesn't have faster user growth than Twitter, and the vast majority of the excessive revenue growth is just from some catchup in ARPU along with the user growth. The Q2 ARPU was flat at $1.91 from last year, but the return to 30% revenue growth must include a solid boost in ARPU that is currently far lower than peers.Compared to other social media stocks of Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS) and Twitter, Snap has the highest forward P/S multiple of the group. The stock traded at over 11x forward sales while Twitter and Pinterest barely top 7x forward sales.Data by YChartsAnalysts generally expect Snap to return to roughly 30% normalized revenue growth with a goal of 2021 revenues reaching $3 billion. Twitter is expected to reach 22% revenue growth next year with revenues topping $4 billion, while the stock is only worth $29 billion.The justification for Snap trading at a higher valuation than Twitter with lower user growth just doesn't add up here. Investors need to understand that Snap will eventually see revenue growth in line with these peer stocks as ARPU catches up to the sector. The company has no reason to generate outsized growth other than relatively low per user revenues.The key investor takeaway is that Snap is far too expensive for the actual performance of the company. The company doesn't generate outsized user growth as suggestive of the stock valuation, and Snap is still a money loser, while peers generate substantial positive cash flows. Investors should avoid Snap at these levels."
4352132,69905,2020-06-05T03:49:35-04:00,"Snap's auditors put out critical comments on Snap's financials.I question whether Snap's growth in users will be strong enough to offset its decline in pricing.Exuberant valuation with no upside left, asides from speculative.","Snap (SNAP) remains shockingly valued. The company continues to trade at approximately 14 times sales, even though its revenues are set to decelerate meaningfully for the remainder of 2020. Given that Snap's auditors put out a critical matter over Snap's revenue recognition, I am further troubled by its excessive valuation. To argue that the market appears to be losing its mind is to sound like sour grapes.Particularly, when you are aiming these comments at a cult stock, which continues to be priced at exuberant valuations and shows no sign of slowing down -- so I'm flummoxed.Of course, shareholders would declare that my style of investing, which puts prudence above gains is outdated. So what's actually happening with Snap? Investors clearly have come to terms, by now, that Q2 2020 will be carnage. But at the same time, investors appear to be more than satisfied to look past this. Thus, the question that matters here is how far past Q2 are investors willing to look? Are investors expecting that by Q3 2020, Snap will be back to normal, with a nothing-to-see attitude? Or are investors cognizant that 2020 will be unimpressive, but that 2021 comparisons will be so strong, thereby ultimately justifying paying this high valuation today?The graph below reminds us that nearly 70% of Snap's revenues are derived from North America.Source: author's calculations, Q2 2020 10-QConsequently, whatever dynamics take place in advertising in North America has an overarching impact on Snap's performance.Why is this important? Because know from numerous companies, including Alphabet (GOOGL)(GOOG), Facebook (FB), and Twitter (TWTR), that have exposure to largely similar advertising dynamics that the market weakened in earnest starting the second half of March.Further, although the advertising sector stabilized into April, that simply means it stopped weakening. It does not mean that as we enter the final month of Q2 2020, the advertising sector has bounced back to where it was at the start of 2020.For Q2 2019, Snap's North America ARPU was $3.14. This figure is going to come out lower in Q2 2020. Hence, important questions which are truly critical here are:1) How much lower will North America's ARPU come in Q2 2020?2) Will Snap's North America ARPU bounce back quickly over the remainder of 2020?3) Will the increase in DAUs be strong enough to offset the decrease in ARPU for the remainder of 2020?Realistically, I don't know the answers to the questions. What I do know, is that 2019 and into early 2020, the advertising sector was operating at its peak strength.Consequently, common sense implies that ARPUs will be lower for the remainder of 2020, with the last three quarters of 2020 faring weakly when compared with the same period a year ago.Management knows this too, hence why guidance was pulled, not to spook investors. Thus, even if DAUs continue to increase, particularly given that during the lockdown, there's likely to be an uptake of social media platforms, I am unsure whether DAUs increasing is going to be strong enough to offset my expected drop in APRUs.Source: author's calculations, Press StatementIndeed, during the earnings call, Snap's Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman noted that during the latter parts of March DAUs were higher. The question is just how much higher? And whether those newly found users will stay on the platform past lockdown?Note, I've focused my analysis on North America, as this is where Snap derives close to 70% of its revenue from. I'll attempt to make a brave assumption that in the best-case scenario, Q2 2020 saw North America's DAU increase by 20% year-over-year, thereby jumping 1,000 basis points sequentially. Even if that was the case, I can't see how it would be high enough to mitigate my expected drop in ARPUs in Q2 2020. As you see below, analysts are still expected that 2020 comes out at close to 22% growth year-over-year.Source: SA premium toolsGiven that Q1 2020 was up 44%, this would require as very strong performance for the rest of 2020. And I can't see how Snap can indeed reach these figures.Further compounding issues, for now, Snap is still being priced at close to 15 times trailing sales. Stocks that get priced at north of 10 times sales are stocks where their business model locks in customers into multi-year contracts.Moreover, as Snap's auditors noted, there are question marks over how Snap recognizes its revenues. Ernst & Young LLP stated, among other issues with Snap's accounting, that the way Snap recognizes the timing of its revenue recognition, is 'complex'. Snap is simply too expensive at approximately 15 times revenues, when we know that its revenue is going to decelerate over Q2 2020 and Q3 2020, if not for the whole of 2020. For Snap's valuation to be justified, it assumes that by 2021, the advertising sector is back to full strength, as if nothing happened during 2020.On balance, I believe that there are substantially safer investment opportunities elsewhere."

        The company raised $850 million via a convertible debt while other social media players are repurchasing stock.
        The stock trades at an extreme 10x '21 sales estimates.","The market reacted favorably to the Q1 results from Snap (SNAP), but the reasons for avoiding the stock were brought to the forefront as the social media company started highlighting weak Q2 metrics compounded by the expense growth. My investment thesis still sees Snap as the riskiest social media sector stock in any prolonged economic downturn, but the dire outcome appears unlikely at this point. Regardless, the stock isn't a buy up here at $17. Snap reported Q1 results initially considered as strong by the market. The company generated surprisingly strong revenue growth of 44% in the quarter, but the January/February growth of 58% quickly dipped to only 11% in the last week. At the same time, Snap grew operating expenses by over 20% in the last quarter. The amount made sense with the company crushing revenue growth of over 50%, but the question is whether Snap is able to keep the leverage going when revenues suddenly collapsed. As the market looks at their operating performance and low ARPU levels are where the story of investing in this stock over other social media stocks has additional risk. The initial story made the market quickly buy the stock with Snap soaring 37% to over $17. The details suggest Snap still holds the most risk while users and engagement aren't growing as fast as Twitter (TWTR) and Pinterest (PINS). While some of the cash flow numbers also appeared initially positive, Snap got some Q4 ad revenues paid early this year pushing a rosier cash flow position. The key EBITDA number was still a large loss at $81 million. The company saw a big improvement from last Q1, but these numbers were before the economy was shutdown. Source: Snap Q1'20 presentationThe problem here is the ARPU story. Snap only generates $2.02 per user, up 20% YoY. The numbers were mostly boosted by a 27% jump in North America. The problem here is that the ROW only grew 3% YoY while this area accounts for the majority of DAU growth at 45% in Q1 and equivalent to over 50% of global user growth.The relatively small ARPU is contributing greatly to revenue growth. Twitter has already reported Q1 user growth in the 23% range. Snap is only leading in revenue growth due to an attempt to normalize average user revenues in an actual sign of the difficulties the company has in monetizing a young user base. Since the quarterly report, Snap added an upsized $850 million private placement of convertible notes. The company had a cash balance of $2.1 billion questioning why the company needs such proceeds. CEO Evan Spiegel appears to know the same risks as presented in my previous article, otherwise the social media company wouldn't need any cash for operations even under a challenging condition. My hopes are that both Facebook (FB) and Twitter are using excess cash balances to repurchase shares during this stock market crash. With a fully diluted market cap of $27.0 billion ($17 x 1.599 billion shares outstanding), Snap has a far larger market cap than Twitter and Pinterest. Both the later combined are only worth $35.5 billion while Twitter has a far larger revenue base. Analysts have now cut 2020 revenue estimates for Snap to only $2.1 billion for 22% growth. The quarterly numbers trough at ~11% growth in Q2.The company doesn't cross $3 billion in annual revenues until 2022 while the stock is already worth $27 billion. Snap trades at ~10x 2021 sales while Twitter only trades at half the multiple. The more interesting part of the story is that the lagging social media stocks are actually generating similar, if not better, user growth. Snap is still getting more juice out a user base only monetized at $2 per quarter, but the company no longer has any benefit of faster user growth. The key investor takeaway is that the social media stocks have rebounded along with the market bounce. Snap has rallied far too much on results that were initially stronger than expected. The company has already raised cash in a sign of how a weak economy will lead to large losses and tons of cash burn. The investment opinion remains intact that other social media stocks offer better values and Snap is the largest risk in the sector on economic weakness."
4351536,102875,2020-06-02T13:35:32-04:00,"Despite beating its Q1 forecast and making $462.5 million in revenue for the first three months of FY20, Snap is overvalued at the current price.In the last eight years, as the market was booming, Snap was unable to find a profitable business model, as it was constantly redefining itself.Our analysis shows that Snap is overvalued by more than 16% and we decided to open a short position in it.","Despite beating its Q1 forecast and making $462.5 million in revenue for the first three months of FY20, Snap (SNAP) is overvalued at the current price. Once the lockdown ends, we’ll probably see a quarter-to-quarter decline of the overall users. Besides, as advertisers start to cut down their ad budgets to weather the current storm, it will be hard for Snap to make a substantial amount of money this year. We believe that the increased competition and the weak advertising market will make it harder for Snap to turn to profitability sometime soon. Our analysis shows that Snap stock is overvalued by around 40% and we decided to open a short position in it.We have been bearish on Snap in 2017 when the company was facing increased competition from Instagram and it was unable to offer any meaningful value for users to encourage them to stick with its platform. Nevertheless, over time the company proved us wrong, as the service picked up steam and the company managed to reinvent itself, and advertisers started to place their ads on the company’s platform. The introduction of Discover feed acted as a major catalyst for growth in recent years and now more and more users tend to stick with the feed for longer times than before. Recently, the total daily time spent on Discovery increased by 35% Y/Y, and currently, it is one of the major monetization mediums inside Snap’s platform. The continuous addition of new content will help Snap to keep its users engaged with the app. Also, the company’s AR efforts so far have been successful, as the engagement rate continues to be high. However, it’s too soon to tell how the use of AR technology will impact the company’s financial performance in the foreseeable future.Despite all of this, we believe that Snap is not a solid long-term investment for tech investors. While the company managed to add 11 million daily users to its service in Q1, the major growth came outside of North America. The rest of the world segment added 7 million users. Unlike the North American segment, it’s harder to monetize users outside of the United States, since they have less purchasing power and the CPM is considerably lower for them. It’s good that Snap is not stagnating. However, investors should not be excessively optimistic about the recent spike in DAU’s, considering that there are companies like Pinterest (PINS) and TikTok that recently experienced a greater user base growth. In comparison to its peers, Snap is not growing as fast as other apps and as a result, it will take longer for it to become profitable.In addition, despite increasing its revenue in Q1 by 44% Y/Y to $462.5 million, the net loss for the quarter was $306 million. For comparison, a year ago when the revenue for the same period was $320 million, the company’s net loss was $310 million. Therefore, despite dramatically increasing its revenues this year, Snap continues to lose a substantial amount of money.Considering this, we believe that the company will continue to be unprofitable at least in the next two years. Our DCF model below clearly shows that revenues will continue to grow at impressive rates, but the overall business will lose money for some time.Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesIn our model, we used a WACC rate of 9% due to the instability of financial markets, which is caused by COVID-19. The tax rate will stay at 0% for a while thanks to its deferred liabilities.Our DCF model shows that Snap is trading at a premium of more than 17% to its fair value, thereby making its stock overvalued.Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesIn our comparative analysis, we compared Snap to its major peers from the digital space on several major operating metrics. The peer list was taken from Goldman Sachs’s research report on Snap.Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesOur comparable analysis showed that Snap also trades at a premium to its fair value of around 12.8%. By consolidating our DCF and peer analysis, we concluded that Snap’s intrinsic value is $14.62 per share, below its current market price of more than $17 per share.Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesIn the not so distant future, Snap will face many challenges that cannot justify purchasing its stock at the current market price. Unfortunately, Snap has no real competitive advantages and no real edge inside the social media industry. Its demographic consists mostly of teens, who do not have a lot of purchasing power, are unpredictable and too volatile. They constantly jump from one app to another and stick with the one that is the most popular at a time. As advertisers cut down their budgets and optimize their ad spent, Snap will surely suffer. While its AR capabilities are ahead of everyone else, AR will not contribute a lot to the overall revenues for quite a while. This leaves Snap in a dire position.In the last eight years, as the market was booming, Snap was unable to find a profitable business model. While Facebook (FB) managed to make Instagram a $20 billion business during that time, Snap continued to constantly redefine itself. As cash continues to burn, it will be even harder for Snap to find how to generate profits in the current environment.As the company is trading close to 10x of its projected FY20 revenue, its stock has a real chance to depreciate in the foreseeable future. Since the company didn’t issue any guidance and will continue to struggle to break even, we decided to open a short position in it. Our analysis clearly shows that the stock is overvalued and there are no real catalysts for growth, at least for now."
4338292,104722,2020-04-17T17:59:52-04:00,"Snap is one of the worst positioned stocks in media.The company's rich valuation and poor margins are not attractive in this crisis.These current headwinds could turn into a lingering drag, given the company's weak market share and the cost of regaining lost business.","Snap, Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is one of the worst positioned stocks heading into a pullback in corporate ad spending across the board. Increased user engagement is being reported at competing firms, but despite these massive spikes, these companies are guiding down expectations on revenues in the same breath, meaning Snap is not likely to benefit from spiking user engagement. Given its rich valuation and dependence on ARPU expansion in its sales growth strategy, investors in this firm are exposed to the greatest degree of downside risk. In my view, these drags on sales growth will prove to be lingering headwinds as the company is forced to increase opex to regain trial budgets, which should have been low-cost renewals, during the subsequent period of recovery.The New York Times ran a piece stating that the ad industry was in trouble, and that of the group, only Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were somewhat safe. This, of course, was not news to my followers as I wrote about this exact dynamic with the same conclusions over a week ago. I encourage you to read this article for a more detailed view of my thoughts, but I will briefly summarize my thoughts on the industry.Periods of reduced business are not the times companies expand their marketing efforts. Businesses today are operating with an objective of business continuity, and it is fear for survival that has led half a trillion dollars' worth of SBA funding to be depleted since this crisis began. It is this sense of crisis that has led an over 22 million new unemployment claims with the latest round extending to white-collar jobs.In these times, their objective is meet fixed costs while breaking as few eggs as possible, and when the strain has escalated to the point of necessitating layoffs, then advertising is often out of the question. Additionally, with sporting events like March Madness (and all spring college athletics) canceled, new leagues like the XFL dead-on-arrival, and major events such as the Stanley Cup, the beginning of the MLB season, potentially, the NBA play-offs, and The Olympics being delayed, businesses are losing additional anticipated event-specific sales. If you are still skeptical of my take, take a look at what Barry Diller of IAC had to say when he markets with his warnings this morning on CNBC.The key takeaway is that now is the time to invest in strength, not speculation. Given that Snap is not an established advertising platform, it is not likely to fare well in the extended advertising drought we are seeing unfold.Sales are critical for a company like SNAP and, as we've seen with events such as Facebook's 2Q18 miss in revenue and guidance, stocks with lofty sales expectations that fall short and guide that they will continue to are met with a harsh response. Snap is a company that posts approximately 50% y/y sales growth and dismal margins at every level. Needless to say, the expectations for the stock to perform are high. However, the way the company has historically met these levels of growth may not be feasible in this time of crisis.The revenues reported by Snap are the product of daily active users ""DAUs"" and average revenue per user ""ARPU"". These sales are paid out by companies running advertisements on Snap's platform, who are paying the company for each click or ""impression"" delivered. One way to scale rapid growth is through price expansion in which the company increases the cost-per-click of their advertisements. Given the trends seen in the ARPU chart, seen above, and the DAUs chart, seen below, it appears this would be a critical component of how Snap has been achieving such lofty growth.The macroeconomic environment in which we find ourselves today is not ideal for premium valuations or customers accepting a surcharge. Given that Snap often exists within trial ad allocations, or ""test run"" ad campaigns, it is not likely that this pricing power will remain, and the results for revenue could be disastrous - perhaps not in Q1, but, as previously stated, guidance is critical, especially given the valuations at which shares are trading today.Super-Premium Valuation Hinges on Growth and Margin ExpansionData by YChartsThe biggest issue with Snap since its IPO has been its premium valuation when compared to its fellow cohort members. Snap does not turn a positive net income or EBITDA, which isn't a huge issue. Several of these companies do not, but it means that the valuation hinges on revenue growth. From this perspective, the company is grossly overvalued at 10.53x EV/REV vs the peer group, which is trading at an average of 6.7x. In general, I am in favor of companies with higher growth rates at a lower rung of the curve being rewarded with a premium multiple, but Snap's position is not unique, nor is even top of the peer group.Data by YChartsThe graphic above illustrates how Snap's operational performance stands against that of its closest comparable company, Pinterest (PINS). Both entities are growing sales a similar rate y/y with Snap only coming in 3% short, but what is really staggering is the fact that Pinterest has been able to achieve these results while capturing greater margins. Pinterest posts an impressive 75.93% gross margin, while Snap is only retaining about $0.55 on every dollar it earns before operating costs are considered. On an EBITDA basis, neither firm is posting a positive result. However, Pinterest is only 6.69% shy of the black, while Snap is nearly 37% in red with little sign of positive progression. This backdrop shades the inequity in premium allowance between the two entities in skepticism. It could be that Pinterest is simply being given too low a premium at 7.1x sales, but I imagine the truth is both firms' valuation should converge somewhere closer to the center.Snap is just too poorly positioned for this type of a crisis for me to consider investible. The company could experience lingering damage to their operating results, and regression in what little margin expansion they'd achieved in the aftermath of this crisis, and even after the drop from recent highs, it just is not safe to buy. Although it is not at risk of bankruptcy, when combined with a balance sheet that posts over $1 billion in convertible debt, the stock is even less attractive. In my view, Pinterest is a much better alternative investment that offers a similar growth profile with a better balance sheet, better margins, and similar operating growth (though I also don't think it is wise to long that company either prior to earnings and guidance). Depending on what happens to share prices after the report, it might be worth considering a long position (I will be watching under $10), but right now, it just isn't the right time."
4339109,69905,2020-04-22T11:31:41-04:00,"MAUs continue to rapidly grow, reaching 229 million in Q1 2020.Q2 2020 is likely to grow its revenues at less than 15% year over year.This red hot stock leaves investors with no further upside potential.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) pulled its guidance amidst business uncertainty. On the one hand, its user numbers are growing at a rapid clip by 20% year over year to 229 million. Indeed, Snap notes that its users were growing rapidly even before the lockdown, through January and February.On the other hand, the advertising sector has taken a dramatic hit starting in March, and it has continued into April. Meanwhile, its shares continue to soar higher, as investors hang onto the idea that Snap's revenue growth rates are only temporarily slowing down.Nevertheless, this unprofitable company remains substantially overvalued at more than 10 times trailing revenues and is best avoided until cheaper prices prevail. Here's why:Snap is highly seasonal, with Q4 being strong in North America as well as globally. Consequentially, comparing sequential performance year over year is crucial.Source: Q1 2020 investors' presentationHowever, as readers should beware that the average user in North America is worth more than three times than either in Europe or the Rest of the World. Put another way, how Snap performs in North America mostly dictates Snap's total performance.Thus, these details matter:Above, we can see that from Q4 2018 sequentially to Q1 2019 Snap's ARPU dropped 16.9%. Whereas sequentially from Q4 2019 into Q1 2020 ARPUs in North America dropped 19.2% this time around - 230 basis points worse in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.Globally, Snap's ARPU fell 21.7% sequentially from Q4 2020, compared with 19.6% in Q1 2019 - a 210 basis point decline in 2020.Put another way, advertising dropped more in Q1 2020 than in the previous year, both in North America as well as globally. Moreover, without any Q2 2020 guidance from Snap, we can see that the advertising space went cold rather rapidly in March.Specifically, Snap notes that, in January and February, its advertising was growing at approximately 58%, before declining to approximately 25% in March. Note, this is not the same as ARPU, but its direction would be similar.Furthermore, Snap notes that,So, there's a huge decline expected from Snap's Q1 2020 revenue growth rate of 44% to Q2 2020 less than 15% and possibly approximating just 10% year over year growth rates for Q2 2020.Snap's Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman noted the strong user growth and points out that the growth witnessed in Snap's MAUs increased further towards the back end of March.However, Gorman states that Snap was already well on the path towards strong growth for the quarter, irrespective of the lockdown.Furthermore, Snap's management notes that this growth in its user base has continued to increase and that the average engagement went up 20% in the latter weeks of March compared with the last week of January.Indeed, Snap has been working hard to keep user retention high through strong and rewarding experiences on its platform.Separately, Snap noted its ability to reach the hard to reach audience of 13-year-olds to 18-year-olds and how advertisers have been keen to collaborate with Snap's main demographic, pointing out that adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) successfully launched a campaign to encourage Snapchatters to stay home and to offer them creative, fit, and fun ways to stay active during the lockdown.Snap's balance sheet remains rock-solid, with cash and equivalents above $2.1 billion. Snap holds 2026 convertible notes on its balance sheet of approximately $900 million. Consequently, it has a net cash position of slightly more than $1.1 billion.For 2020, we know that Snap's growth rates will be dramatically impaired because, although its user base is rapidly increasing, the advertising market is offsetting that growth at a rapid clip.On balance, Snap is likely to grow at less 25% revenue growth rates in 2020, and question marks abound about Snap's ability to resume mid-40% revenue growth rates in 2020.However, even if Snap was able to reach $2.9 billion in revenue by the end of 2021, investors are still paying approximately 6.8 times its revenues nearly two years out.And given that Snap has not succeeded in showing a clean and sustainable path towards GAAP profitability, investors are left to make assumptions as to what its future profit margin profile could shape up to be.Will Snap be profitable in 2021, while still aggressively growing faster than the more mature Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)? Indeed, will Snap be able to command 10% operating margins at some point in the future?If that was the case, Snap would be already priced at north of 60 operating income before taxes, presuming future best-case operating margins.In summary, despite a large number of bullish assumptions and mathematical acrobatics, it is still too difficult to justify paying more than $20 billion for Snap's market cap.Snap's Q1 2020 was a tale of two stories, with plenty of evidence for both bulls and bears.Although Snap's MAU continues to increase at a rapid pace, this is being painfully offset by the weak advertising sector, which is culminating together, and Snap's revenue growth rates are now pointing to grow Q2 2020 at less 15% compared with 44% seen in Q1 2020.Ultimately, given Snap's lack of visibility, together with its red-hot stock, leaves new shareholders with no margin of safety and primed for disappointment."

        The company offers little in reward and exposes investors to many risks, when compared to a competitor, such as Instagram.
        I give my general thoughts on the company, as well as an option strategy to play the short-term pullback to $16.","I was recently asked about Snap (SNAP). Having no articles on the subject, I figured I’d make my thoughts public now. Let’s get into the business itself, discussing a potential trading plan afterward.Let’s start with one recent other aspect of Snap that has been of interest to me due to the news coming out of France (link in the next paragraph): its use in independent businesses. Illicit business, such as those selling counterfeit goods or illegal drugs, have found success in advertising their products via Snapchat. Unlike text-based social media apps, Snapchat is image-focused, and thus screening via something like a text filter is impossible, and machine-learning algorithms are yet unsuccessful in adequate image screening.(Source: Pranay Pathole, Twitter)With social media companies becoming increasingly regulated, the difficulty in scanning for these illicit sales (or hate speech in France) becomes a costly problem, as compared to a company such as Facebook (FB) that could simply run a text algorithm. In addition, while Snap says it does not retain all user data or stories, governments might be walking the path of forcing Snap into the expensive task of data retention and organization. It only takes one Snap-centered scandal to cause law enforcement to take an interest in Snap’s data management, and that’s a strong potential headwind for the company. I’ll skip a similar discussion on the potential risks related to the company appearing to embrace deepfakes and the company’s reliance on augmented reality as its unique selling proposition.Elon Musk joined our Zoom call | Avatarify(Deepfake circa 2020; keep Moore’s law in mind)Stepping back for a minute to look at Snap on a longer timeframe, the company is often seen as a more modern version of something like Twitter (TWTR), with an emphasis on images instead of text. Naturally, this makes the company feel more youthful, appealing to a younger generation of social media users. TikTok is close to the Chinese equivalent of Snapchat, and it too focuses on appealing to the younger generation.Like TikTok, Snap is not yet profitable. The young demographics and the lack of profitability are positively correlated, just as youth and liquid net worth are correlated. Younger demographics bring in fewer and poorer advertisers.When Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, stated that the app is only for rich people, he was reflecting Snap’s reliance on its younger demographics. He was against expanding to “India and Spain” because these are not rich countries – but more importantly, the youth in these countries have comparatively little expendable cash. Snap’s reliance on the younger generations makes profitability a more difficult goal than it does for, say, Instagram, who has an older (and thus richer) demographic base.Snapchat’s usage rate, by age categories:(Source: SproutSocial)Instragram’s demographics, for comparison.(Source: SproutSocial)Snap does not win in any category and loses the biggest in the categories with the biggest spending power. The plurality of Snapchat users have an income of under $30k per year; the plurality of Instagram users have an income of over $75k per year. This shows the power of marketing to boomers, not zoomers.In light of the “only for rich people comment,” these numbers look funny. Clearly, Instagram is the image-focused social media app for rich people here; Snapchat looks to be more for poor people. Snapchat was successful in attracting its userbase despite the strong competition, but that demographic has yet to give way to success in the company’s path to profitability.What’s the meaning of being a social media staple if you cannot turn a profit? This is question all SNAP investors should be asking themselves, especially during coronatimes (I coined this phrase). With SARS-CoV-2 stressing the economy, how can anyone feel content in bidding up this unprofitable alternative to FB (the owner of Instragram)?I’d love to hear a good short/medium-term bullish thesis, as I’ve yet to read one that seems rational. If you have one, leave it in the comments section below.For now, I’m going to recommend shorting SNAP. With the economy in the dumps and without changes in its profit-seeking ventures, this company is headed downward. For investors, I’d say avoid this stock until 2022, and only then pick it up – and only if at near-low prices.Here’s the short-term short play:This is a limited risk/reward strategy – your downside reward is limited, as is your upside risk. Your max profit is reached once SNAP falls to $16. If SNAP falls below $16, you will see no extra profits and should thus buy back the short put if you expect SNAP to fall more than 6% before Jun 19.Happy trading!"
4337750,69905,2020-04-16T07:00:00-04:00,"As the advertising market weakness, I contend that Snap will be impacted more than investors believe.I dissect Snap's revenue stream and show that its main revenue source, North America, will be significantly impacted.Given Snap's lack of profitability, as well as its likely declining growth rate, this implies that this stock is overvalued and risky.","Snap (SNAP) has been overvalued for some time. But right now, its operations are going to take a turn for the worse as the advertising market weakens.Several of Snap's peers' valuations have come down substantially these past two months, as Snap's peers have offered business updates related to the weakness in the advertising market. Meanwhile, Snap has chosen not to update the market. I believe Snap's dynamics are likely to be similar to those of its peers and its revenues will meaningfully decelerate over the coming two quarters. Avoid this stock, here's why:Snap's business model is advertising driven, with 98% of its revenue coming from advertising.Further, Snap's customers do not have long-term advertising commitments with Snap (page 11). Consequentially, during a global recession, Snap's business model will be significantly affected.In Snap's Q4 2019 press statement it shows:We can see that a large portion of Snap's revenue growth rate is being driven by an increase in ARPUs. Specifically, we can see that up until Q4 2019, ARPUs are more than half of Snap's 44% revenue growth rate.Now, we have seen from numerous other advertising platforms that the advertising market is not faring particularly well amidst all the business uncertainty. Indeed, I argue that there appears to be a certain amount of denial in Snap's shareholders to what the likely impact a pullback in advertising spend will have in 2020.Consider this, we have seen from small peers such as Pinterest (PINS) and Twitter (TWTR) to larger advertising companies such as Facebook (FB) that advertising spend is not as strong as it was up until 2019 and early 2020.I mention these three companies because these businesses have all offered preliminary business updates reporting weakness in the advertising market and I have covered them all on SA.Furthermore, we can see that's Snap's ARPU in North America reached $4.42 in Q4, making each North American user worth 3.2 times more than a European and approximately the same for the Rest of World. Put another way, what happens in North America's advertising market has a significantly larger impact on Snap's revenue growth rate compared with what happens elsewhere. As discussed above, this social media platform has poor visibility, as it does not have long-term contracts with its customers.Accordingly, Snap is only able to provide guidance over the next 90-day period. When Snap announces its Q2 2020 guidance within a week's time, I believe that investors are likely to be negatively surprised, because investors have been accustomed to Snap's growth rates steadily growing at mid-to-high 40% growth rates.Indeed looking at its trailing seven quarters plus Q1 2019 to be announced next week, making a total of eight quarters, Snap has averaged to grow its revenues rates in the mid 40% range. The only exceptions were Q4 2018 and Q1 2019 where Snap reported slightly below this range. Snap derives 68% of its total revenues from North America, so weakness here has an overreaching impact on its total revenue.Snap is substantially unprofitable, in fact, for every $1 of revenue it records 59 cents in losses. Consequently, investors are pricing Snap on the expectation that it can continue to rapidly grow and positively surprise them with strong revenue growth rates.Indeed, for this hugely unprofitable enterprise, investors are willing to pay 11 times trailing sales, leaving new investors with no further upside potential from multiple expansion.Even if Snap is significantly unprofitable, its balance sheet carries close to $2 billion of cash and equivalents. This provides the company with plenty of maneuverability to withstand this global recession. Having said that, given that its market cap is close to $2 billion, it demonstrates that investors are not pricing Snap anywhere near liquidation. So that cash is only as valuable as management's ability to invest it profitability.Snap's guidance for Q2 2020 next week is likely to negatively surprise investors. Investors are still pricing in way too much optimism into Snap's valuation, at more than 11 times trailing revenues for this unprofitable company. This valuation is particularly shocking given that we know from Snap's close peers that the advertising market is not as strong as it has been up until a few months back and that Snap's revenue growth rates are going to slow down more than investors expect it. Avoid this stock for now."
4339207,104703,2020-04-22T15:58:15-04:00,"SNAP delivers a huge Q1 beat. We already knew that usage on the platform was way up. Now, we see that this has translated over to the financial numbers.Headwinds likely to impact to a greater extent in Q2, so be cautious. Long term, SNAP has access to a niche user demographic and is unlikely to be impacted by competition.Opening up the advertising to self-serve and innovating on the Snap Ads platform will improve ARPU growth going forward, driving strong top-line growth.Here is the legitimate bear case: struggling to monetize outside Discover, valuation, lower ROI compared to Facebook and Google, more susceptible to a recession.Rating reiterated at BUY, PT lowered from $22 to $18 after updating valuation to reflect risk profile.","Wow. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) just delivered an absolute blowout quarter. Let's briefly break down the results:Snap added a staggering 11 million users in the quarter. They saw strong growth it seems across all geographies in the face of the global lockdown. They added two million new DAUs in North America, their best-monetized geography. They also added 3 million in Europe and 7 million in their ROW segment. The valuable thing here is, these are new users who are likely to stay in the ecosystem even after this coronavirus storm ends. So, this isn't just a brief spurt of growth to be followed by a declining user base. These users will likely be locked in over the coming months. And as Snap finds better ways to monetize their platform, the overall revenue growth will only improve.That being said, the least surprising part of what happened this quarter was the usage trends. The most surprising factor in the Q1 report was how well Snap monetized their user base. Keep in mind, Snap delivered 23% Y/Y ARPU growth in Q4'19. In the first quarter, Snap saw 20% Y/Y ARPU growth. While this is a deceleration on a sequential basis, it is much better to be growing at 20% Y/Y than to be in decline. That being said, I would anticipate much greater weakness in Q2 than the deceleration we got in Q1. Overall, Snap continues to see strong monetization.Another interesting thing to point out here is Snap has drastically improved in terms of cash flow without seeing an impact on its growth. The company was actually operating cash flow positive in Q1.(Source: Snap IR)The company continues to grow its operations with minimal cash burn.Turning to what Snap has seen strategically.The Discover platform is the primary method of advertising for enterprises interested in utilizing Snapchat to deliver ads. Total daily time spent on Snapchat's Discover section has increased 35% Y/Y. Increased usage of Snapchat's Discover is good, as Discover appears to be the primary way usage is monetized on Snap.Snap has also improved the platform for advertisers. They launched ROAS bidding, so that advertisers can pick ad placement specifically based on what their ideal ROI is. They launched Lens Web Builder, which, in my opinion, is the first real proof of Snap monetizing their augmented reality side of the platform. They also doubled the number of upfront dollars from advertisers Y/Y. Overall, this paints a bright long-term picture for Snap's relationship with advertisers and their ability to monetize the platform over the long haul.While I am a long-term believer in the story on Snap, I acknowledge that Snap will likely follow the rest of the advertising sector and report a weak Q2. Unfortunately, the brunt of the lockdowns will be felt in Q2. Q1 was not as weak because the US felt the brunt of the lockdown's effect in March, while the first two months of the quarter were mostly unaffected. Q2 will likely be a quarter where Snap is fully affected by the lockdowns in all three months of the quarter. So, there is a good chance that because Snap did not give a Q2 guide, there will be some volatility relative to current expectations. So, I can definitely see some meaningful downside in the stock and in the fundamentals heading into the next quarter.After Q2, as lockdowns begin to (likely) ease, Snap will see a re-acceleration in ARPU growth on a much larger user base. I continue to believe Snap is well positioned to succeed in a massive and quickly growing internet advertising market. They seem to have finally differentiated themselves from other platforms, as is evident in their user growth trends. While competition remains somewhat a threat, that isn't the real bear case on the stock.Here are the four real tenets of the Snap bear case:The first tenet is Snap is more prone to a recession than competing firms. Snap is more exposed to a recession than larger competing advertising platforms. Why? Even as Snap continues to innovate and build out its advertising platform, it is still seen as a much more experimental platform as ROI hasn't been fully developed yet. So, in a recession, where marketing is one of the first expenses for businesses to cut, the rare businesses that continue to market are going to stick with safer and higher ROI platforms. So, in a recession, Snap is likely to be hit hard, very hard, as they are more exposed in a recession.The next problem that I can see with Snap is trying to monetize the platform outside of Discover. It appears that the majority of usage on the Snapchat platform is chat-based which has been a difficult area for Snap to monetize. The real monetization challenge Snap will have is expanding monetization of the platform outside of Discover. They have been experimenting with AR ads and have been integrating Stories ads into the platform. Whether these offerings gain any material traction or not will be the question.The third risk is proving to advertisers (small and medium-sized businesses in particular) why Snap is a more compelling offering in comparison to larger, arguably higher ROI alternatives. If Snap can do that and get a more meaningful piece of the internet advertising pie, then the company will likely maintain the solid growth trajectory it is on right now. The most important transition Snap has made is to an auction-based self-serve advertising platform, as this opens the door to lower budget advertisers. As more tools are added to this platform, the monetization door will continue to open up for Snap. Small and medium-sized advertisers are the key to Snap's success going forward.The final real tenet of the bear thesis is Snap's valuation. This is something I have been stuck with rationalizing for a while now. As a matter of fact, my first SA report was a bear case on Snap. A central part of why I was bearish was the company's valuation. Looking forward on a sales basis, the stock definitely looks expensive. Personally, I use a DCF model for my price target. On a P/S basis, I completely understand the bear case on Snap's valuation. My DCF points to upside, assuming some slightly above consensus expectations.My DCF-based price target is $18, lowered from $22 to reflect the recent coronavirus-related downside. Snap knocked it out of the park this quarter, and while there could be some coronavirus-related downside, I still like the stock here long term, and I still have a buy rating on it.TipRanks: BUY"

Good news for shareholders and SNAP peers?We dissect what happened and what might make SNAP stand out, both for good and for ill.","Editors' Note: This is the transcript of the podcast we posted last Wednesday. Please note that due to time and audio constraints, transcription may not be perfect. We encourage you to listen to the podcast, embedded below, if you need any clarification. We hope you enjoy.Daniel Shvartsman: Welcome to The Razor's Edge. Daniel Shvartsman, I’m joined by Seeking Alpha author Akram's Razor as always. The Razor's Edge features ideas that Akram has been following for his investing, for his Seeking Alpha Marketplace service also called The Razor's Edge. I bring my perspective as more of a generalist investors and we get into sectors.We get into a lot of tech names, not always tech names and we look at how they may play out. We look at any research that goes into the thesis. If you’re interested in more of these ideas, I encourage you to check out The Razor's Edge on the Seeking Alpha Marketplace. You can do that by typing in Razor's anywhere on Seeking Alpha search bars, it will pop up or Akram is a good service for just ongoing flow and ideas.This week we’re talking about Snap. The social media messaging company reported earnings this week and the stock popped, no crackle involved here I think. But the company posted pretty solid growth for Q1 and additionally said that they've been growing year-over-year so far in Q2. We’ve got a constellation of reports or news bits coming out of the Internet advertising space.Pinterest pre-reported a decent Q1, but also pulled their guidance for the rest of the year. Facebook and Twitter both made some noise in March about how they’re getting into lot more usage, but that they expect to affect their sales growth, the coronavirus surge of interest, but also the hits to the advertising economy. And so, we’ve got an interesting set of dots on the sector. The question is how do they all connect.We’ll get into that, but before we begin, our usual disclaimer and disclosure.

The views discussed belong to either Akram or me respectively. Nothing on this podcast should be taken as investment advice for any stock.

Akram is long Facebook.Listen to or subscribe to The Investing Edge on these podcast platforms:So, Akram, good morning.Akram's Razor: Good morning.DS: So Snap, it seems like a pretty good report. I mean the market pops, but you have to give the context that they still lose a lot of money. They still have high share-based compensation. They also don't know how much money they’re going to make. But it seems like a pretty good report as a starting point.AR: It was their first, I think, cash flow positive quarter ever, right?DS: Okay, okay. So they – yes, so that’s in the context…AR: You got that going for them.DS: Which is nice.AR: Which is nice, but, yes, I mean that was obviously a knock before. Structurally costs are improving. Those are getting around that. It’s 70 and 100 basis points and they talked about that on the call, focused on I think [700 to 800] total driving cost down $0.70 or so I think. So that's notable, but, yes – no I mean on the surface, you don’t like to say that a stock goes up 36% in a day and you’re like okay, it's great, but – this is obviously a confusing one. Let’s just be honest, those – I've been on the bears camp on it. You got to stay open-minded, and it's hard to look at it the way it traded and not be like well, I mean what is part of the just craziness that is in these markets lately. You know it’s just liquidity. They’re just – it is driving so many things.People don't think much about really – I mean if you – I mean, we don’t really need to get into it, but I mean the Federal balance sheet has gone from $3.7 trillion to $6.5 trillion, and since September 1 and like 80% of that is in the last four weeks. I mean put perspective it's – the balance sheet has grown more in the last four or five weeks than it did from when it first started moving after – during the financial crisis through the time up till now. I mean forget the fact that –it's the same amount as the last 50 years, but generally speaking, [indiscernible] the financial crisis all the way through the recession in Europe, the panic there and everything you were thinking about in 2008 to 2015 [indiscernible] taper tantrum, everything that went between just smudged that into four weeks. That's what’s the Fed’s done.So, it's obviously been a big driver and stocks just stop liquidation, and when you have good news or bad news, it seems like particularly lately on good news more extreme price action in tech, this is just insane, but, yes, I mean let’s look at the cadence and went through this already. You had – the first person to drop it and use in the Internet advertising universe was Twitter and then Pinterest and then we got some news out of Facebook. Google hasn’t said anything about their business. Then you officially got Snapchat reporting. So, we’ve had data points from everybody and I mean obviously this space is interesting because engagement is so high, everyone’s at home; they’re online. I mean I’m amazed at how much time I spend on Twitter right now. I feel like someone with an addiction problem.DS: Well, and that’s the – we talked about this within the context of, for example, Zoom last time, but it's more…AR: Another 50%. I wrote something up on Zoom for the subscribers over the weekend. Look, I mean I went through the exercise of actually trying to freaking model this thing. Where do I see revenue coming out of that, what's paid, what's not paid, how much is – it's actually a fun game to play because you can look at Zoom and be like what will Zoom be in two years? What does it have to be revenue wise for me to say buy? And I was just of the view I was actually having this show with my little brother who’s like everyone else in America trading expert all of a sudden and he’s just like, bro, Zoom is going to give an update. That update is going to be crazy. It's going to be huge and when it does it will pop, and [indiscernible] happen yesterday, and he’s like told you.DS: He should launch his own service.AR: He should launch his own service. He’s too busy doing influencer marketing, building out sales teams, but his – I mean, if you saw his returns since like the beginning of February, you’ll just be like what the hell? How is this possible?DS: But – so if we go back to the Internet advertising, the point is that they’re seeing a lot. I assume their cost structure is probably less per – I would imagine Zoom server cost or whatever else, a little bit more intensive than…AR: Yes, let’s just start – we could do a – if we want to do Zoom [indiscernible] maybe we’ll do that later, let’s just say we have…DS: No, what I’m saying is I'm saying is that with the Internet advertising, there is some of that increased utilization without actually – it's not monetizable because I – somebody made this point on Twitter, I can't remember who to credit them, but the hard spot is you have, for example, travel companies who are huge advertisers, but there’s no demand for them, so why would they bother advertise?AR: Travel, auto, hotels, [oh, that’s travel].DS: Or you have consumer goods or something where you don't need to advertise because everybody wants you, so it’s either there's so much demand that you don't need to advertise or there's not enough demand for advertising to make sense. And so, that would in theory seem to squeeze and to advertise. I’m hesitating because I know I saw in a report that there was a ton of interest in advertising for the Draft last night, the NFL draft, so there's some huger to advertise, but I guess what I’m say is that until the Snap report everything what we were seeing was a lot of usage, the revenue didn’t [indiscernible] good. So does that – does this change your mind about the sector at all or do you think? Do you still more chalk it up to just the weirdness going out in the markets the fact that Snap had that pop?AR: Well, I mean Snapchat – there's a very good case to be made that Snapchat without a doubt of all of them kind of sits in that spot where video gaming, media in a demographic targeted that right now is set up nicely for them. They made a case on the call, which I did find interesting because I’ve been following this space a lot and just movies moving around in the windows to digital – all digital release windows and their ability to provide an ad product for studios is more targeted. I know some people in this video space pretty well on the marketing side and I’ll occasionally have chats with them on spend and what's going on in the industry, and right now, there’s no industry that’s more shaken up by what's happened than Hollywood, particularly budget wise and marketing spent.So, I mean if you just were to think about different studios there was actually the news out yesterday on – I mean, we love talking Disney and the whole Marvel complex. I was talking to a friend of mine and he was explaining that nobody in the industry right now wants to be first to release a tentpole and I mean if you’ve seen, for example, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, it was supposed to be released in June, that's been pushed to March 2021. The first real major tentpole was going to be Venom, Sony and that was slated for end of October. I think they’d pushed it, they made an announcement pushing it to November. Now, they came out like two days ago and said Venom is going to June of 2021 and now what else does Sony have coming up, Spidey? So, you just have…DS: [Indiscernible] which is…AR: …which is their – I mean Venom and Spidey is the whole game for them, that's the viability of the Sony Studio. Otherwise, the business model hasn’t completely changed. And Spidey hasn’t even, I don’t think have started production yet, and they’ve got Tom Holland under contract for this other that – what’s that videogame series Uncharted. It was Nathan Drake. Production on that is also tied to finishing Spiderman. So – and Spiderman is slated for – it’s a summer blockbuster for next summer. So, they haven’t said anything yet on Spidey, but if they’re moving venom to late June, Spidey is supposed to be a of July 4 or on release as Spidey is in MCU and Disney has said that the whole MCU slated is shifting [indiscernible].So, if you think about that, for example, you had marketing spend for Ghostbusters tied to the NBA playoffs, that's out of the door and you got to look at like a lot of this advertising and the production around Hollywood is so meticulously planned in advance that this essentially losing a year has disrupted it massively. So – I mean, I know one studio is spending around $500 million a year and that’s essentially been cut in half. So, when you look at that and you think about it and you look at a Snapchat making the case that their making, it's an understandable case because they’re saying, we’re –we’re over 50% direct response to advertising and if you’re one of these studios who had been buying billboards and buses and the up-fronts and stuff tied to sports, and you're now releasing things digitally, well, what's the most valuable place to shift whatever marketing spend dollars you’re going to leave allocating around is something like a Snapchat. Where do you reach that audience? They’re not on Twitter. I mean they maybe on and Instagram to a degree, but it’s definitely a good place.DS: [Multiple speakers]AR: Yes, if you’re these and video gaming without question as well and they reported data regarding how up gaming is. So, you do look at it and you’re like yes, maybe, maybe it’s good. And what’s really surprising is the usage data for international because I kind of look at – I mean, look I’m someone who’s lived outside the United States for over a decade up until being back here recently and I look at data and I’m like is [indiscernible] one of these where the international success just so big and you’re kind of ignoring that when you're back in the US. You’re kind of downplaying it because they’re growing so quickly outside the United States still, and that's actually a much more viable peace to them.I mean the last time I went through something like was research in motion, literally 2009 where Apple was growing like crazy in the U.S., but BlackBerry was crushing it in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the stock was super cheap as the market had rebounded and I’d had some Apple, but living abroad at the time, particularly you see people using their BlackBerry’s crazy still before the Apple wave had really hit and you’re like yes, this is Apple thing. It's not – they’re not – it’s not going anywhere. They’re not going to kill BlackBerry and Nokia at the same time and that's kind of like a prospectively you’re just like, I mean how many people are there in America, 300 million, but it’s a different ballgame when you’re looking at it from a perspective of social because well, I mean it's where the bodies are and for some reason with a Snapchat it's continued to do extremely well outside the United States.I mean it’s doing well in the U.S., but extremely well outside the United States where I look at those numbers, I’m just like [indiscernible] 45% use of growth year-over-year how is – how are you doing that versus 9%, 10% was it in the U.S. on the DAUs.DS: Overall, DAUs were up 20% and rest of world was – yes, North America 10%, rest of world 45%, Europe 14%.AR: There you go.DS: So, yes, and that's – rest of world has caught up to – and it's – in Pinterest's case, for example, that growth rate is a big split, but it's still – I mean I guess the – there its more that their ARPU is really low or whatever their term is [multiple speakers].AR: Yes, look, same problem everybody has in advertising outside of the developed world without question, but in Snapchat's case, it's more BDS, so they’re on a hot – they’re definitely higher than something like Pinterest or Twitter would see in those markets because you've got a very engaged user.DS: Yes. I mean and that's when you're –and in their script, they talked about the importance of connecting with your friends and you can see – I mean you can sort of talk yourself into those effects to the fact that is – even as a counter to video conferencing fatigue or whatever else just the ability to send messages quick, quick hits and just be in touch with people. I mean I think that's probably what’s [multiple speakers].AR: Look, that’s the value prop, they’ve always had that.DS: Yes, but it's comes into focus when you're not –you think of teenagers who are not in school and not even allowed to leave the house in a lot of place, and all of a sudden that is just the only way to be in touch or that sort of thing, so that's where it becomes – you can tag yourself into that being part of where Snapchat also gets that boost and that if there's still enough reason to advertise, as you’re saying in the Hollywood case, than that kind of keeps them – keeps their growth rates afloat to a certain degree.AR: Without question, but it's – look there’s a – I mean going back to the growth rates actually, I mean that's part of the debate here on Snapchat. There's no denying that it’s been growing faster. There are two things to consider here, Snap is still in this 12-month window where they re-boosted user growth. That started when they kicked in these new lens filters on the camera in Q1 literally of last year. That's what flipped this around for them. I think it was late February of last year when they launched this and when they really started seeing the effect of this, it was Q2 last year.So they actually did mention that too as well which is a reminder because when I was short Snap, we would have this conversation, I've discussed this with a couple of other short seller buddies in terms of the idea of whether it's worth picking on them in more detail and focusing on it and making it a more focused short versus a hedge against Pinterest as it was and it was like look, is it really that easy? They released these filters. They got a huge engagement boost and by Q2, those numbers slowed down and you just want to be essentially sorted into that. At the time when the stock was 17, you want to be short ahead of that before all this madness happened and when it fell down to the single digits and then back to 17, which has been happening with a ton of stocks in tech, but they did talk about their cadence on the call, and they went through the same thing as everybody who's been talking in the sense where January, February were great, best performance ever, amazing numbers then the invisible enemy came, but it’s – their cadence on that was January, February like 53% and then March drops to 25%, April so far 14% and the week into this earnings, 11%. I mean that's a huge, going from 55% to 11% in three months tells you what you're dealing with and you got a lot of these guys who are reporting who will be like this is how we did in Q1 and we’re pulling guidance and not like that –Pinterest gave you advertising. It was impacted end of March. They didn't say anything when they gave that update, but I'm sure we'll hear more, but there’s a universal consensus that Q2 is going to be really bad.The brunt of the pain is April and then is a question of where do you go from there. So, when you look at it, it's – there's two parts I think with this one, which – because I was to – the call was a very – it's a very good conference call. I think they did a good job and its one of those conference calls where they could convince you almost that there’s a case here that Snap was in a one-trick pony on the filters driving people back into Snapchat on a temporary basis. That’s essentially an argument; that's I think they’re making some progress on shooting down, but when you consider the fact that they have that tough comp in Q2 and the first underperforming lappage quarter wise would have been Q2, you kind of now have this coronavirus thing that gets in the way of how much of this drastic slowdown can be blamed coronavirus and how much of it is also part of your business in terms of – because March, January and February should have been huge positive compares for them year-over-year without anything going on.That’s not exactly super shocking. March should have been when they slowed down because those filters did come out and had that huge boost in March of last year. It started at the end of February and that’s when you were able start to see a measurement was March and into April, May, June, etcetera. So, they are lapping that and that's one way you look at it and one more quarter to kind of see although what they gave you engagement wise is still pretty positive year-over-year, but you definitely have a headwind to go with the overall advertising environment.DS: But does that – is that something where on the – you could see it both ways, you could see it two negative sort of makeup not a positive but it wipes out the scrutiny literally because everybody is so quick and you’ve talked before in different –you’ve talked in the context of longs you have and context of shorts you have that even a sell-side doesn't always pay attention to these sort of overlapping things. They kind of – it just goes into the background of the narrative without paying attention to that that the comp is going to be tougher. So, now they get a – get out of jail free to some degree because Q2 is just going to be a wasteland anyway and then they come out of it clean.AR: Right.DS: So is that – that almost sets them up nicely you can argue.AR: Look, part of problem with Snapchat is they’re in this kind of no man's land as far as a stock investment because they're so expensive compared to everybody else in that space, I mean in online advertising. Where are they now? I mean they got up to 17 again, when you think about that that's – what is that $22 billion or what's the math EV to sales? Almost…DS: We have them at 10, 11…AR: …toward 13, 13.5x trailing?DS: We have them at 12, but I'm not sure if that's the updated.AR: It’s $22 billion enterprise value.DS: Yes.AR: At $17.00 basically and they did what, 1.6 in revenue the previous year? Yes, it’s over 13. Put it this way, what’s Twitter? Twitter right now is just a hair under five. I mean I had some people already asking me again, what have you [indiscernible] I’m not going to lie again, I was thinking about it again because when we did that Twitter podcast, it went through this element of the fact that Twitter was at a premium then. Twitter was, what $33, $34 and I actually shorted Twitter for the first time and I actually made some money on it and it's today the cheapest name in this space again by far. 4.9 times, okay. So, that’s the Twitter, 4.90 EV to sales, Snap 13.4, Facebook 6.6, Pinterest is what, nine?DS: Yes, I was going to say it’s still high single, I think.AR: Okay, so there you go. I mean Twitter is now, they’ve gone to a point where Facebook was cheaper than Twitter. We had that period it seems like a millennium ago, but it was three weeks ago, four weeks ago because Twitter came out with the Elliott update and then rallied in the face of [indiscernible] which actually set that up where I was like how is this happening? And then it went as low as 21, 22. I mean, I think covered at 24, but it was a crazy swing in a couple days. Pinterest came down to what 9, 10, almost to 20. Pinterest and Snapchat have done basically the same thing.They both dropped significantly to real extreme points and then have had like almost say equivalent of short covering rebounds that you would typically attribute to short, but it's more this liquidity dynamic in this market, but, yes, I mean it's hard to not – to look at Snapchat and be like well, what’s priced into it? It's double essentially the next closest name on EV to sales. So, I'm going to go valuation kind of trumps everything else here, and so makes its uninvestable. I don’t know, I mean what's your take?DS: I mean I think, yes, that's always –– I struggle to get too far [on a limb] valuation wise. I guess what I'm trying to ascertain are these – you made the point Snap is more media, for example, as compared to Pinterest and I think that's what’s going to be interested see is how does the actual – who actually benefits from – does this actually mean the same thing for all of these other companies or is the story different? Is it – you could – this is not a name we’ve mentioned yet, but Amazon also has quite a bit of an advertising business now. Do they have – because Amazon’s getting so much of traffic for everything else, dose their advertising get more important because you still have to buy stuff and that makes it – you want a game that more. And so, I guess that's question.AR: It’s obviously from that standpoint, Amazon is valuable real estate. I got into this to someone online where they were trying to make the case that Amazon’s advertising business is going to get hit in this environment and I was just like well, wouldn’t that be the one ad business that's hit the least. So, what are you doing? Why making that argument?DS: Right. I mean it’s just – it really…AR: I don’t want to talk about that stock, I think you would have sold it and it’s ridiculous.DS: Okay, nice [indiscernible] but it really is a perfect storm. It just…AR: It tortured me. Last year, I couldn’t make money long Amazon. For two months Apple, Microsoft went up every day and Amazon did nothing and all I owned was Amazon calls crazy aggressively and I would just be like why is nobody buying this thing. Everything is going up, literally everything and this stock doesn't move and what is it, the entire economy [tipped] these days to people.DS: It’s the [indiscernible].AR: And it was literally up. I looked at it at one point last week, it was up 20% on the week. Amazon added half of Facebook in three days.DS: It’s up almost – it's up about 25% to 33% this year. Pretty close to 33%.AR: Why wouldn’t it be. Twitch is crushing it. Everybody has to scale up that on computer has some – spend more on AWS. It's pretty much all the shopping that anyone is doing. You’re sitting at home and buying stuff that in many cases you don't necessarily even need, just tuff on top of the essential business, and I mean it’s got –its video and core businesses –every single one of their businesses is well positioned right now.DS: I mean, it really does feel like a perfect storm. I mean, obviously lots of political, economic concerns around them, but it just seems like – and if you want you can throw it in. By the way, Washington Post is getting tons of attention in traffic too.AR: Well, I mean that’s personal, but yes, correct.DS: Right, right. I know it's not part of the business, but it’s just different thinking [indiscernible].AR: Yes, and he’s supposedly back involved in day-to-day.DS: That’s not bad [indiscernible].AR: He’s not on his yard and his house – a $160 million houses or whatever. It's kind of – you know it’s flipped. It’s like Amazon back in its prime so to speak.DS: I mean yes. It’s – there's probably a blue origin joke in here somewhere, but maybe we can skip that, but I guess so do you think – what are you expecting from the other advertisers I guess? As we – what do you – do you think…AR: Well, I mean you would think that Google is going to see some – based on travel, a lot of – I mean let's go back, Pinterest was like hey, we don’t have much exposure to small restaurants and travel. I would imagine Yelp is the worst case scenario or just what the fuck is going on there and that's got to be Armageddon, as far as advertising for them because that's actually drawn to around, hotels and restaurants, but Facebook is a lot of SMB. They should definitely see a hit as well. I mean, and it's such a huge business. This goes back to the fact that if you’re going to from spending $500 million to $250 million in terms of let’s say a major studio marketing budget for the year, that’s – could impact so much.I mean this was my rational behind shorting some trade desk and three days later, it’s up 25%. I’m closing the position. It’s that we can get into the market element yet, but I’m just like alright, I mean I can't short Omnicom and Publicis, these things have been absolutely hammered there and rebounded, but Trade Desk from 142 to 210, I’ll shorts some Trade Desk, I mean before you know it is 260. But Trade Desk is a business where you can make a case that they’re benefiting because spend comes out of a certain place, it’s still got to go into an area; you’re repurposing the way money is being spent. Roku is another one we haven’t even discussed.I mean that thing got done to the 50s and I’m – I don't like my Roku at all as a stock. It's doubled in the last three weeks and that's one where, again, streaming hours is up huge, but the advertising spend, I know from some checks, not nearly as good, but they didn't give any guidance on the next quarter, so they just kind of came in and okay, this is where we came in at the end of the year and for the January, February, March, March did see some slowing, but not going to get too much of the detail and the stock has brought back to life. I do think you kind of have to, when you look at these, break it down into who is kind of unique?I do think Snap does still make a case like they were making as – regarding video gaming and TV, film, etcetera, being a target audience right now that has an advantage over others, but I mean if you look at – there was some sell-side dispute over – this is a – the younger demographic is going to be hit hard by the recession, where are you on that? Basically these guys – if I’m an advertiser, I mean why would are we spending money here going forward because their disposable income is going down.DS: Yes, that's – because that’s also so –again not to…AR: The internships are being canceled. People are coming out of school or whether they’re going to get jobs, what’s the dynamic? Young guys not exactly as confident as before about their prospects and that means that they have less money to spend and you're better off spending on the seasoned – the Twitter demographic for example.DS: Yes, I guess to me it seems more not to go into economic theory, but it seems more of a class thing in the sense of the – it does feel the same way that the largest companies feels like they're the most well set up to survive something like this. It feels like if you're somebody who is in an upper-middle-class situation and you can work from home and you're not – your income hasn't really changed, you've got a lot of extra money on your hands as compared to normal. We – I don't know that we can point to numbers, but Seeking Alpha’s audiences out but also you can sort of – you get the perception that you brought up your brother, for example, you get the result from the people with some time on their hands. Some of them are dipping into the market, for example, just because that's where the action is.AR: Some? Everybody.DS: Yes. So that’s that is the entertainment that [multiple speakers].AR: People who have never traded and forget my – there's at least half a dozen. I get people like yo, bro. I’m doing this with the Snapchat, Zoom. What’s your take on the Slack and [indiscernible]. Bought some Tesla last week, I’m up 40%. Everyone is a trader.DS: And so, if your take is that there is enough people in Snap who are either kids from families where they have…AR: It will be nice to see what percentage of Snapchat users have Robin Hood accounts, but, yes, continue.DS: Yes. So – but you have the spending money to do this to – for example the stimulus checks are not being used to just cover rent or whatever, but are being used while we can’t go to the restaurants?AR: Rents? Who pays rents anymore?DS: Some. I guess I still pay mortgage, mortgage payments, but yes.AR: Sucker, seriously.DS: Well, I think that's to me – you can see the case young people are relatively resilient emotionally and relatively sort of a second or third level effects. I mean, I remember being 23 when the – in 2008 and I was just – and I was working not a very – I was working at the school, I was making – I think I got housing and maybe $1,000 bucks a month, so it wasn’t like I was making a lot of money or whatever it was. It was enough to get buy, but I was totally just out to lunch about the crisis that was happening around me. And so, you could make the case that if you have enough kids who are coming from middle-class, upper-middle-class wealthy families on Snapchat who just aren't thinking about it, they’re still looking for stuff to buy and they still are able to do it.So, I can see it. I guess it to me that's what it boils down to more. I would assume that, yes, and so, then your argument is if you – that’s your population [indiscernible] that people who are super plugs into the apps are slightly –there's correlation between people who are tech savvy and people who are well off to some degree, and so, you start to work that out. I guess you could get there. I wouldn’t say, I'm skeptical of the argument you started with from whoever made it that kids are worse off. I just – I think that's…AR: Will be worse off. Remember there’s two phases to this thing. At the end of the day, what's going on right now is almost farcical in the sense of its connection to the reality. I mean, there's a lot of these articles for example, the last couple days about unemployment insurance and the fact that for some people it makes more sense to stay home and not work. A restaurant, for example, in Oregon, there was an article on CNBC that should we start. She wanted to reopen because deliveries kind of been a little bit stronger than she expected and she laid up people at the beginning. The employees were like, no. Now, I’m good. I’m getting $600 extra a week. I don't want to come back to work right now type of thing. And that's an element because look, unemployment insurance is designed to cover in the U.S., the replacement rate average nationally is somewhere between 25 and 50, the lowest states like Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, you end up replacing about somewhere between 25% and 30% of the wage for whether it's 13 or 26 weeks [varies]. But nobody goes over 50 and when you – when the $600 that they’ve added for four months through August 1, is targeted to bring the national average up to 100%.So, the national average gets to 100% and the argument had been that there's going to be some people – they try – I don’t remember if you remember this, but McConnell and Graham raised some issues and tried to block it initially when they were passing CARES being like oh! We can’t have people making more than 100% of their previous salary because you have many – if you do the math, $600 a week on a 40-hour work week is $15 an hour. So, everybody's getting $15 an hour at least and then the minimums in the states vary, but if you do a base on the maximums, you're really talking $20 an hour is kind of what anyone who’s getting the combination of the CARES boost and the typical unemployment is going to be getting for at least through August 1.So, there’s tons of workers today, grocery stores, big box, the essential workers, making far less than that and the focus has been hey! Well – you’ve got some people – and states with really high replacement rates like Oregon and Washington, for example, Arizona that added $600, so there is people in those states who literally are making significantly more money to not work. It had been laid off for those four months. If you really believe that this one of these dynamics because this isn’t like you're talking about financial crisis earlier, and kind of being out to lunch on it. The financial crisis was my joint. That was to me – I was this bear. What's going on here, but – the world is going to end and I've been saying it since 2007 and short countrywide, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and all this [indiscernible].The bottom line on financial crisis was everyone in America for that matter worldwide could – one thing is unraveled and unraveled over almost three years really looking the mirror and be like, I – it was my fault as well. I bought too many houses. I got too overleveraged. It wasn't something you – Wall Street was doing what they were doing with derivatives and the housing market and the financialization and CDOs and CDO squared and the overall aggressive nature of things and NINJA loans and all that crap and in terms of the sub-prime lending, but everyone was out of control with housing. I mean whether you’re talking about Spain or Ireland or London or America or Dubai, I mean you had housing mania all over the planet and it was a crazy real estate market and everybody thought that their first, second and third property, they were getting rich and they were all kind of levers around it. So, when it crashed, you couldn't just point the finger. You couldn’t say hey, someone else’s fault.DS: Well, I…AR: What’s complicated about this is everyone feels blameless even though that's not true, but you have this kind of dynamic here where when you get into the situation with the worker and he’s sitting at home [quoting] unemployment, if you offer him to come back to work, well, I mean he's not eligible for unemployment. By the letter of the law, that's the whole purpose of unemployment insurance, but you’re going to get this debate here whereas hey, that person is making 120% or 150% of what they were making beforehand. So, what are we dealing here with socialism, incentivizing people sit on their ass, but where I take issue with that is that if I'm making 80%, okay, of my previous working salary, I'm still incentivized to stay home. Forget 110% or 112%, I don’t care. My free time is not free. I mean it's worth money.So, if you’re going to tell me I’m going to get 80% of my salary for four months, I think there's a lot of workers out there who are like that's good enough for me as wel. Once you cross 50%, it’s no longer insurance. It starts functioning more like stimulus and that or to an essence even like a level of basic income temporarily. So, when you think of it that way, the fact that the replacement rates with this extra $600 are between 90% and 120% or so 130% for all 50 states, everybody essentially who's been laid off and is eligible for unemployment that would have been making less than, let's call it, $40,000 a year is incentivized not to work.DS: Well, but that’s…AR: That’s part of the dynamic here. So, when people are talking about opening up the economy again, I mean you cut in them the checks right now. When you open it and back up, for some people that's when the dynamic really changes.DS: Well, yes, I mean, and that’s part of your public health play to make it so to reduce the pressure on opening preemptively and all that's –we can get into the debate around that, but that…AR: But it's not like when I was laid off or something in 2008, if I’m in that category and I lost my job because housing crashed and there was a lot of layoffs and general less spending in the economy and I'm on employment for 13 to 26 week –this is a different dynamic. You’re getting paid 100% or 90%, that is – I’m covering your salary.DS: Right, but…AR: You haven’t lost a job effectively yet. You’ve got four months where you really haven’t a lost a job at all.DS: Right, but that's because the government essentially said you – this job can't exist for an indefinite period of time while we figure out the hell is going on. So…AR: Okay. But what about if you work at Kroger or Walmart and you’re make $11 an hour, shouldn’t you be getting the equipment of hazard pay here?DS: Yes, absolutely, yes.AR: You should be getting – [indiscernible] you be getting to work, 150%, 160%?DS: I mean no…AR: Because you’re staying in your job and…DS: You are risking your health.AR: …everybody who's been laid off from a restaurant or hotel or whatever is making at least $20 an hour. You put a floor on the minimum wage essentially speaking.DS: [Indiscernible].AR: That’s what’s going to till August 1. I mean all 50 states – if you take the minimum and you add the $600 you’re looking at nobody should be making less than $17.50, $18 an hour.DS: It’s – maybe it's one way to –minimum wage, national minimum wage at 15 was, I think, the campaign platform.AR: Okay. But I’m saying if you’re an Amazon employee, if you’re a Walmart employee, and these are private employers that – again, you have to be laid off to be eligible for employment, okay. And the point here is you’ve been laid off and now your employer is back at – I mean, maybe a way to resolve this is to grant bonuses for these essential workers classify what is essential and say that, after August 1, we’ll cut them a check that makes sure they get equal to the national – or for the state, you know, the minimum that the – they would have got under being unemployed. So, the $600 plus the unemployment insurance – you did not make less by continuing to work, but like I said is that even enough? You should be getting a premium.DS: Well, but – so setting aside the economic issues for the advertisers, what you're describing is extraordinarily bullish actually when you think about it because what you're describing is…AR: It’s inflationary. I don’t necessarily know if it’s bullish because that’s my point.DS: Fine, it’s inflationary.AR: You’ve got a segment of people that are sitting at home and have – not only do they have money in their pocket they’re spending less, they are not driving to work, okay. So, the gas tank money has come out, okay. I'm not traveling at all compared to what I used to. I'm not going the restaurants compared to…DS: You don’t eat out as much.AR: So, I've taken a bucket of consumption, cut it to zero and put it – kept it in your pocket and you’re sitting at home and you now have more discretionary income for a certain subset of places spent.DS: Right, which is where – I mean if you have enough people who have goods to sell I mean, I posed that quandary earlier where if I already have enough demand, I don't need to advertise further, but if you have something – if you have a reason to advertise to get out – get the word out for a movie, for example, if you were to try to do some direct consumer release whatever like there are…AR: I mean like…DS: …times they are straight.AR: Without question. So, there’s that argument clearly in terms of if you're in the gaming demo or if you're in the streaming media demo this is a place where you can take advantage because they do have money to spend and you can take advantage of it. I mean I just think about – that's when you look at Walmart and Costco and Amazon stock, I mean, I bought a tripod for videotaping cooking, right. I mean talk about a random purchase. Sitting around the internet…DS: To film yourself cooking. Like to…AR: To be able to film – yes, to get a perfect overhead angle on my food.DS: This is production on Zoom or production for Instagram?AR: I’m doing – I use InShot…DS: Okay.AR: …which is an app that lets you do editing on the fly I’m getting – look, I’m just setting up for the inevitable pivot dude. So…DS: I can see.AR: Everybody right now is a stock analyst. So my skillset is essentially useless. Video editing though that's the future.DS: Well, it’s funny not be too on the nose, but I was in a meeting yesterday where it was with provider to us of a service, not at Seeking Alpha, and they – we were joking about the virtual backgrounds where we used GyPSy for our call rather than Zoom, and so, we were talking about that and the security and then the lack of virtual backgrounds and the guy said, yes, but do you know, Snaps’ camera can give you a lot of VR stuff and a lot of…AR: [Indiscernible] they were talking about that on the call they’re actually downloading the camera as equipment is very popular.DS: So, there you go. So, maybe Snap is secretly the videoconferencing play as well.AR: I mean, everybody is on it – videoconferencing is so hot right now.DS: So hot.AR: Talk about technological breakthroughs? You can video over the Internet, wow!DS: I mean it’s really like, the David Foster Wallace – infinite jest from the 90s, where all of a sudden where just plugging right in and talking to each other and meanwhile the world is fracturing.AR: So that’s the point. That’s where you’re having an issue here, because once this stimulus goes away you’re going to have these distortions correcting themselves. You’re going to actually – this what happens when you mess with something like the economy like this on this level whether it's the Fed as – you essentially have prevented liquidation.Everybody's kind of just got money – it’s like – it's a summer camp for a lot of people. I mean, if you didn't get sick and you don’t have someone close to you yet who’s sick and you’re social distancing, that's what it is and there's an element there where you're looking for ways to entertain yourself. I mean that goes back to our conversation on Pinterest. Pinterest should have also kind of like Snap, a bit of a – they didn’t make that case and it was only a PR. We didn’t get into this long conference call, sit and see what they had to say, but they did talk about the fact that we don't – we have less exposure to these verticals and you got to think, okay, you got housewives sitting at home planning.Home improvement projects. I mean Home Depot, if you think about it and Lowe's, these are not bad ideas. My neighbor is a medical director at a nursing home, all he does – I mean just call – talk about ground zero and all he’s dealing with is Zoom calls of people who can't see, you know, their loved ones who are in these nursing homes and everyone has COVID in the nursing homes, essentially speaking. I mean let’s not make a blanket statement to that level, but, you don't, his level of cases is super high. He hasn’t always been to a nursing home physically in weeks, but inside, they’re stopped testing in some of these places because the presumption is if you have the case, if you have the symptoms, you’re COVID positive and the hospitals won’t take you. They want to bring their nurses.So like the – you’ve got this kind of black hole where you’ve got these nursing home patients and they can’t be transferred to a hospital, you can't come and see them, you don't want to come pick them up and bring them home to you even if you could and the rare case is that a lot of this stuff is going on Zoom virtually and whatnot. So, he is not going into the office or what's he doing when he is not on really depressing Zoom calls, every single home improvement project you could think of. I mean, the guy is watching him building stuff every day and that's kind of the dynamic you got to be thinking is something where a lot of people for a Pinterest sitting around looking for things or ways to spend money, those are places that would benefit.If you believe this thing is going to be something that lasts for over a year and some – in some cases, maybe longer in terms of its overall impact, if you're not to go back to traveling consistently and not talking about from a vacation standpoint, going somewhere notable, and you’re going to be doing something more localized then barbecues, people making stuff, camping these types of things, this is an interesting place for the – even though the overall consumer discretionary pipe may shrink to a certain degree where spend is repurposed.If you’re not going to be doing these activities where kids go to the movies, or some indoor park that's physical adventurer or game rooms or whatever you call them, escape rooms, money has got to be re-spent somewhere, so outdoor local could be one of them and that’s – I think that’s one way look at a Pinterest on the other end of a Snap, which is totally digital in terms of gaming and streaming and connecting to that demographic. You got another one that’s connecting with the housewives and the do-it-yourself, home improvement [indiscernible] projects.DS: There is an article on The Atlantic about that idea. Maybe you saw it about planning your next Pinterest trip.AR: The Atlantic, what a liberal.DS: I’ve been outed…AR: I’ve actually – I’ve literally been – I’m is giving you shit about that because I got – I posted some article and literally somebody on Facebook, on Twitter said stop bashing Trump and read The Atlantic, how is your Shopify short…DS: I saw that.AR: That was the trolling I got. I was like how – what am I really been trolled on this topic? Because I read The Atlantic. I mean I watch a lot of Fox News as well.DS: So – but, yes, but that concept of, planning ahead for your next trip. I should also say I’ve thought about that…AR: Yes, virtual travel.DS: Virtual travel and then I’ve also thought about I own shares in Thor Industries, which is along with Forest River, which the Berkshire Hathaway company also long Berkshire Hathaway, but the leading RV maker in the U.S. and also has bought – went into Europe. They bought a company in Europe, and so, that's…AR: What’s it called, again, somebody pitched that as a long on Twitter.DS: Thor Industries. I think…AR: Yes, you know who pitched it, Marc Cohodes, very notable short seller.DS: Okay, on the same side.AR: Everybody talking about the boom and camping that’s coming.DS: It’s an interesting – they’re – I think they're pretty well-run company. They’re [indiscernible] seen, they’re cyclical. They – I should have sold – I bought – they’re basically back to where I started with them. I should have sold shares when they got up – they got ahead of themselves and were already up in the 80s, but I wanted to hold on for a year for tax gain reasons, which I’ve learned that – I made this point on Twitter, I’ve – that's one of my lessons learned from this is don't get too cute about that stuff. But, yes, its – I think it's – do I think it makes sense that is price where it is now, I'm not sure.They've – they were just recovering from an inventory – dealer inventory correction and now this they’ll definitely going to take on the noise, but it’s a pretty well-run company and they pay down their debt pretty quickly. They do have that recent acquisition. So, when you think about how travel might change, yes, you can see – I mean – and we haven't talked about the fact that the price of oil is – and gas is low. I mean, gas is – I don't know what it is where you are. My dad was saying it was under $2 in Massachusetts, which it hasn't been in a long time, so…AR: And I used to pay $0.79 a gallon in Atlanta when I was in college. So, I mean Trump was like it's never been this cheap, at least not since you guys have been live and I was like actually no.DS: I tried to remind – I reminded my dad that it – when I was in high school, which [indiscernible] I might be a tide younger than you, it was 1998 or 1999, I remember under $1 in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. So, yes, I mean it’s – so, but anyway…AR: $0.79, $0.79. It was probably 1997.DS: Okay. So, you can see tag yourself into that. So when you’re trying to think through what’s changing and what’s going to get more emphasis than other things on the margins and what margins gaming off, that's interesting. And I think that's to tie it back to where we are, it's interesting to think about these – how that benefits different – the different social media companies and how – yes, what I might take away from this conversation is just thinking about the different user bases in different sort of ways to reach Snap users versus Pinterest users versus Twitter users. Facebook is sort of all encompassing, I think, and Google of course and Amazon are both different stories as well, but it seems with these three at least there's a little bit different of a reason to be there, a mindset and an audience and that it might affect each of those companies differently.AR: Yes, right. So, it’s like Pinterest has got do-it-yourselfer and housewives bored at home trying to figure something about cooking. Cooking is so big right now. I mean…DS: Everybody is cooking.AR: Everybody.DS: People got to eat.AR: If this ends, you’re going to be talking about great chefs are coming out of this on the other side.DS: I made a pretty good chicken soup last week, so…AR: There you go, there you go. Who isn't working of their cooking skills right now? So, that's definitely the Pinterest and then on the other end, like you said, video gaming and streaming and the millennial generation, that's Snapchat. And then the two giants kind of have a mix of everything, Facebook and Google, a way you’re definitely going to see a more pronounced hit.I think twitter is just that –I'm really tempted to go long it again, I mean just based on the way Snapchat had traded and now where the valuation is. This is the annoying thing about this market. I mean things are just swinging around so wildly. We just had this when talking about all this craft and we started with the Snapchat focus here. But I mean, at the end of the day Snapchat is trading at 13, 14x. Yes, it’s the fastest growing of all those names, and it’s making the most improvement relatively speaking to where its narrative have been, like it had been burning a lot of cash, it’s getting cash flow positive, positive revenue growth in this environment. Everybody else is likely to be in the negative side or have taken a major hit. I mean, Twitter already told you that they’re going to be flat to slightly down. And…DS: And that was for Q1, not…AR: That’s Q1 March, a couple weeks. So think about how bad the hit they got. But Twitter has got a lot of advertising tied to live spending. They’ve kind of tied themselves into that. Events-oriented, like conferences and sports, these are things that Twitter makes money off of. You take away live and that’s, I mean, as much as finance and politics is – has got a very, super intense and user base. It’s not where advertisers want to be.So, that’s where you struggle with it. And you’ve got the Jack Dorsey. We were just talking about before we started the call, the vanity fair piece on him. While you’re like what’s going on there? He’s living his best life.DS: God bless him. Man does it all.AR: Seven minute ice baths in the morning.DS: Hangs out with Kanye and Kim?AR: Yes. He is in good shape. It’s – whether, I mean, you do look at what’s going on at Twitter. And you’re like, how, like, why is this thing not more robust as a business model from podcasting to disaster relief, monitoring, et cetera that there’s so many things, but let’s not get into that, because that’s going to be a whole waste another hour and we’ve already done that. But yes, I think Snapchat is, I’d say, I came away less bearish than I’ve been, but I can’t touch the stock legislation.DS: Valuation is still crazy.AR: I mean, it’s, look, they’re all advertising businesses, at the end of the day, and they’re not yelps in terms of where they’re getting hit the hardest. Let’s – you’re not, let’s say, a media agency that had some clients spending $15 million, $20 million a year who’s just chopped things in half and you’re taking that hit as far as the creative’s, but they do have some things going in their favor, relatively speaking, but is it $5 billion – is it worth $5 billion more than Twitter as a company today? Because if you do the math on them, the Q2 is probably going to come in around $400 million, maybe a little bit less.So, it’s a sequential decline, probably. I mean, typically, it is – there’s a drop off, but of a little note. But you get that like, you can sit here and model this thing out and be like, “All right, what are they going to do? Like what’s this year look like for them? $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion, I don’t know, $2 billion, how high can they go, but the front half is looking like $860 million, something around there.So, after the growth of Q1, pretty serious revenue drop off for the remainder of the year, even without COVID-19. I mean, that’s – that was going to be an element. And you’re paying minimum $2 multiple, essentially speaking as everybody else. Now granted, they’re still growing. Like I would assume, Twitter’s numbers for the last 10 days, as far as advertising got notably compared to where Snapchat is.I don’t know where Facebook is going to be, but it’s going to be down probably. Question is just how much? And then Google, I mean, I would think Google – so I haven’t seen the breakdown, but I would say, Google App still has a lot of business driven around travel.DS: Yes. I can’t remember, it’s something like 8%, because I follow the travel stocks closely.AR: Expedia got that investment, another Silver Lake.DS: Expedia and Airbnb, the – you may have – yes, Expedia, Airbnb booking, which I’m long still got – I was able to go to just the normal debt market and get much cheaper debt, but yes, but I feel like it’s 8% to 10% of Google’s advertising is travel. I could be don’t – listeners don’t hold me to that, but it’s a meaningful effect.I mean, it’s interesting, maybe the last thing I’ve brought up my colleague, Mark Pentecost before covers our tech vertical for pro on Seeking Alpha and he did a little extrapolation based on Snapchat. And he did some estimations, essentially of how much sequential growth Snapchat usually sees Q1 to Q2, and the – and then compare that to that guidance that they provided on call of 11%, 15%, et cetera, year-over-year growth, and said that there’s a looks, he just came up with a number of 20% shortfall versus what you might have expected without COVID. And so then you sort of back it into some of these other companies Alphabet might be flat year-over-year. Roku and Trade Desk both see double-digit growth rates instead of, like low double-digit instead of the prodigious numbers they’ve been putting up.So, it’s just interesting, that snap is ultimately the first one to go in the pile, and it was obviously better than people were expecting. But it’ll be interesting to see how – what is unique to them and what is common as we get to all these other companies when they actually give the floor…AR: I mean, they did come off a little bit yesterday like 5%, 6% after the huge, what was it 36%?DS: Yes. And it’s down, I mean, it’s back down actually to around $16 a share. So it has pulled back. You were used to had it at $17, but it got – it did get up to $17 and then yes, it came down about $0.5 yesterday and a little bit more today.AR: [Indiscernible] 23,000 people attended the live streaming class. I mean, since that’s a whole another – that’s another one where you can sit there and talk about, well, what’s going to happen in the gym industry and repurposing spend there? You’re not paying your subscription fee for your gym. Where’s that money going to? It’s an interesting pie.I mean, there’s an overall argument that this is just going to last a lot longer than I expected. And that’s where you get into this whole stock market and a macro part, which is so hard, because you don’t – you can’t sit here and be discussing what their Fed exits look like. What I see Snapchat move the way it has on the back of the news the other day.You almost want to sit there and say, “Okay, maybe just wait, there’s way too much going on in this market that’s tied to the intervention we’ve seen, and that’s just the dominant factor in driving price in anything.” Because if we’re dealing with a dynamic where, like we’re at a point right now cadence-wise with anyone who reports where you’re looking at like two months of pre-coronavirus for most of them and two weeks maybe, or like, let’s call it a week of, at least in the U.S. of like, notable coronavirus impact and then into the guidance where like none of you want to give specific.I mean, like Snapchat just did, for example, and say, hey 11% this week from a rate that was 55% in February, where you’re like, okay, this is – the next quarter is going to be a drop off, where you have April is the worst and maybe, like some degree – like, you’ll be looking at June. You’ll be looking at May in terms of like, let’s say, some sort of, let’s call it rebound stabilization. And then it was like June – by – you’re literally talking by June to kind of get a sense of like, where things are leveling around.I mean, is this entire summer a write off for everybody? I don’t know. You got to think about that. I mean, we’re still in this debate of opening things up and back and forth, but talking to people in the medical community, it doesn’t seem like anything is getting resolved anytime soon. And that’s where you get into this dynamic with – if the Fed has stopped mass liquidation for now, well, okay, what we’ve seen is unattractive assets. They didn’t go bankrupt. They didn’t – you’re dealing with a scenario where it’s like I have enough liquidity to not be generating revenue and through for this many months based on right now. And that was the initial type of reaction.But the – for the last week-and-a-half, we’ve seen the resilient businesses getting bid up to the point that you’ve got plenty of making new highs. Where the distortion that exists, let’s talk about it from like, if you were looking at these businesses pre-corona, forget the impact and trying to let think about how it works out for the longer-term. You’re now looking at them and you’re being like, “Wow, what should I be paying for any of these names?” So, does anybody have a clue? I mean, is it – like every relative value type of gap like is – are all software stocks insulated in terms of valuation?DS: For valuation, you need to know what earnings are going to be and that’s just as hard as anything else.AR: And essentially, what type of multiple are you willing to pay? Because I can look at companies like Disney and say, all right, what’s happening? So you saw Netflix. Netflix was an interesting example. They’re reporting at the same time as Snapchat. And they beat – the sub number came in 7 million bigger double on pay subs. And I thought they actually gave you an interesting argument, “Look, we’re essentially assuming that the back-half is a slowdown relative to what we expected, because there’s a lot of pull forward that goes with this.” Because that’s something what you think about with a Zoom. You’re like, “If things start to open back up, what does Zoom look like usage-wise next year, year-over-year?And that’s where we get into a Snapchat. We had the filters. We had – like it’s – I – let’s just say for Snapchat, you got to put them in, like I think the overall conclusion based on this is, you got to put it in the unresolved bucket category. Some good, some still question marks, because when I think back to it and we haven’t even gotten into this, the thing that I focused on the most and a little scatterbrained here on my part, but was TikTok.Part of when I was looking at this Pinterest, Snapchat trade when I put it on last summer, to me, it was just Snapchat was on like a temporary camera filter boost. And you had this new lion coming out of nowhere in TikTok as a competitor to add to the existing Facebook and Instagram, and standard universe of competition that we had. And I don’t really know if any of the question marks regarding that were resolved.And that’s when we started this call and you pulled up those, the rest of the world number, that’s where I look at it. I’m just like “I don’t, I’m not connecting to whether or not this is just a much stronger phenomenon with the youth outside of North America to the point, where that can continue to carry it a lot farther than I would have expected. But I would have thought that TikTok at the rate it’s growing, is benefiting at Snapchat’s expense. And it is like is that how you see it? Like is TikTok winning at Snapchat’s expense, or is that winning at Instagram’s expense? Like whose times to talk eating?DS: I – this is out of my league. I would say, it is probably eating at both. I would say, Instagram’s audience probably tell us, it’s a little bit older, so is a little bit less affected than my impressions from TikTok and Snap is that, that’s both competing with roughly the same audience, whereas Instagram, I think, runs the gamut a little bit more.AR: Okay. Fair enough. I mean, that’s a – that’s one way you look at it and say, I don’t know yet. I mean, I should have a better idea. I have a close relative, but TikTok, but I haven’t really bothered drilling her on it. But it’s something when – that from an investment thesis approach, what I’ve been looking at last year, if we didn’t have coronavirus, I would have really – I really would have been focused on whether or not after this quarter, I was going to ramp up going up like shorting a Snapchat, or covering it and just moving on, potentially even going along, but I couldn’t see that would depend on valuation, like relative to everybody else.And I just don’t think, you don’t want to be shorting these, let’s call them resilient beneficiaries of COVID-19 till we get to the point that there’s some sort of incremental uptake in normalization, and we still haven’t seen that yet. And I think that’s like – that’s definitely a weighing factor if you – if you’ve seen a valuation benefit, because like you said, you own a bunch of, let’s call it, the hardest hit area travel – online travel stocks.So, like what’s your thinking with online travel stocks? Because in theory, I mean, I remember, we discussed this last time and your rationale behind buying price line, but big picture, if you are in the camp that it’s going to be a big summer for camping and you’re in the camp that people aren’t going to be doing international travel, maybe they’re going to like the beach house close to them more, or like a getaway by the lake, then all these names still shape up for a better spending environment as things normalize a little bit.But if you’re in the – if you’re of the view that there’s some sort of decent level of progress where people want to hop back on a plane again and move around the country, or go off to Manhattan and go to Broadway and going back to sporting events regularly, then you’re looking at the valuation of almost this whole bunch collectively and being like yes, this is not – like these are dangerous stocks, because the story narrative is less material to me than getting this whole timing of what’s happening, both in conjunction with liquidity in the market and like the – some sort of return to normalcy off of a base of zero in industries that are typically a critical part of day-to-day life.DS: You’re saying that if we return to normal faster the – which stocks would be dangerous, the travel ones or?AR: No, I’m saying, if you return to normal faster, getting excited about a Snapchat…DS: Right, okay.AR: …for example, here and be like what, video games and streaming great and stay away from all things tied to travel and X, Y and Z restaurants. But if people are going to – starting to dine out just 30% more than they have been for the last five weeks and that goes up again. 30% and like you’re – you don’t want to be in it. You don’t want to – the worst stock obviously is Zoom, if you believe in that.DS: Well, so..AR: But if you believe that there’s – but if you believe that it’s not a V-shaped type rebound in travel and leisure. And I’m not saying it’s going to be a V. I think, that’s definitely not happening, but something a step down from that. If we’re not even there, and we’re talking about an entire year of sub-activity like, let’s say, like if you don’t think schools are going to be in session physically next year, come fall September, the – all these stocks are probably long still.DS: Right. Yes, I think …AR:…everything stay-at-home media.DS: And that’s – I guess, that’s and we should probably wrap after this. But I would say, my age, it’s hard for me to make a bet on any of those things. I don’t – I’m generally content to follow public health guidance into best experts. I could give you my sense. I would assume that we’re back in physical schools by September, I would assume we’re not – the NFL is probably not playing in front of full stadiums at the very least. So that’s sort of my…AR: Yes. I like that. That’s a decent – it’s – I’d say, that’s a moderately bullish case on returning to normal.DS: It’s – yes – and it’s a very – it’s not meant to be differentiated. I’m not trying to standout. And so – but what I – given that I don’t really know, I’m trying to just say, okay, let’s – I don’t want to be totally out of the market, because I just – I saw even in March, my inability to make manage everything to kind of stagger in. So, how do I try to give myself the best chance of having a chip in a chair in this market? And I just look at, all right, what company is going to be fine two years from now and the valuation is not ridiculous?And so something like Snap is interesting on the one hand, because like all of these companies, I don’t know, actually, Twitter has plenty of cash, too, but they have plenty of cash. That’s not – I’m not worried about them or anything like that. But yes, they’re still burning money. They’re still – are they going to be profitable two years from now, for example? I’m not – even if we are at normal, I’m not sure. And so that makes it unless you’re expecting such an uptick.And I guess that’s where the game here is, if you’re expecting such a change in their growth trajectory that it will make them their cost structure more appropriate and it’ll just make it easier to scale, which is not unreasonable, but…AR: I mean, that’s kind of the argument they’re making. They’re crushing it beforehand. Everything we’ve been doing has been working well. Our costs are coming down, we’re cash flow positive. Our user growth was X, Y, and Z. And yes, there’s some things that are happening that are going to be more challenging. But we’re on a standalone basis outperforming.And what we’ve – what we started doing a year ago, is working. And you couldn’t, on this call they provide a pretty decent evidence that that’s the case, because there’s also this kind of added benefit that they could sell to you in terms of – within the COVID-19 environment.But you couldn’t come in and be like, wow, but what percentage is like your cameras, like from when you launched the filters last year and the Snap camera and all this and how much is that headwind? And like you said, like what kind of profitability are you going to get to? Because if you’re not turning into something notably greater than, than a Twitter, well, you’re already at $5 billion larger than – in market cap than them and look at the problems that they continue to have. And they’ve got Luke Skywalker leading them.So it’s a hard – it’s definitely – I get your approach. Because you’re basically buying stocks at prices that they hadn’t been at in five, six years in industries like travel, and you’re buying the leading names. And you’re basically saying, I don’t know what’s going to happen for the rest of this year. I’m – whatever it is, it’s not going to be great.But by next year, some level of normal is going to be returning, like I bought these things where I’m uncomfortable in a couple of years. And that – and that’s – there’s an element for what you’re doing, where – if liquidity dynamics change, like you said, it’s difficult to manage this shit. And I don’t think anyone really can.And the dynamics change money does come out at the margin of your Amazon’s, Walmart, Costco, Zoom’s, all software, where’s it going to go? It’s got – it’s just like a discretionary pie repurposing just a little bit back to the way it was before this. It would have probably a disproportionate positive return impact on the types of names you’re owning, because nobody wants to buy them here. They were – people are predisposed to buying stuff with good news. And…DS: Yes.AR: …the actual, and like, that’s where you get the challenge of, like I said, like you look at it, I got into it. And the – by the time I looked at the value, I was like Jesus Christ, like Twitter’s the cheapest again and Snapchat’s 13 time’s sales. We were in the low single digits for almost everybody and like Snap was six times, like Snap was way our Facebook is two weeks ago and it’s doubled since then almost. Actually, it did double and then it came back down.So that does – that is I think, yes, like you said, to wrap it up, like that’s the challenge here. I mean, like, I think we discussed that – you got different pies and everybody wants to get into the nitty-gritty. But you’re probably right now with these stocks, more exposed to variables that are out of your control, then maybe you are in the names that you’re in.DS: Well, it’s – or it’s that there’s more steps to the process that you have to work through then do people travel or not, or do they travel – I mean, like you have to – and that’s where I – that’s what I think was interesting here was thinking through, well, what’s the audience and what does all that mean? But yes, I think there’s all these second, third fourth levels that you have to kind of think through.AR: Yes. You want pure plays, typically, when we’re investing. It’s like, I want pure – pure play exposure is where you get excited about something and you’re – it’s a lever bet. And then if it goes wrong, you get hurt really hard.I mean, I think that’s one thing to look at in terms of Amazon right now, where it’s – had all these businesses and it was like diversified in the sense, but people weren’t necessarily that excited about it versus Apple selling his iPhone and the services are tied to it a few months ago, or Microsoft with Azure and just enterprise, or something like hey, e-commerce and gaming, okay, and lot of competition and these. But all of a sudden the diversification of Amazon’s business has really come to light and the different pockets of the economy is exposed in almost each one of them looking like a positive pure play.The ultimate pure play from work from home has been Zoom. And I don’t – I think even like the amateur hour investor right now, we’ll look at this and be like, if any really good news on the speed at which there’s a return to some level of normal is disastrous news for a Zoom stock investor. And you just kind of stepped down from there for other names. A lot of people were bitching about Netflix not beating by much.I saw some stuff on Twitter where and I made a comment, but they’re like guys, when they doubled the net ads, yet they beat by a hair on revenue and like their guidance is like roughly in line with consensus. And I was like, “Look, bro, they beat by 7 million users. But that’s 3.8% of their user base now.” I mean, they’re pretty penetrated.So when they tell you, because they didn’t make an argument on the call that they’re like, “Look currency headwinds is – was a drag for us. And currencies like a – Facebook is like a 60% non-U.S. – sorry, Netflix is a 60% non-U.S. revenue business. And you have like, let’s call it, 2%, 3% currency headwinds with $1 strengthening, and that 160% percent of your revenue versus, call it, like two weeks, two-and-a-half weeks above normal subscriber ads. So you’re getting like one-third of it you’re getting…DS: Right, because it’s backloaded…AR: …yes, it doesn’t even kick in, and the drag and if you get that benefit, and that’s a 4% beat. And then you’re talking about losing management’s coming out and saying, ”Hey, if things normalize faster, we’re going to sequentially see pressure from here, remainder of the year.” If they don’t, the pressure will be less and they gave you an estimate on sub-ads for Q2, and they said it’s complete guesswork, but we’re taking a shot.And I think that’s kind of – I think we are in that – when you look at a Snapchat, it’s better and especially to be, but you’re just like, they’re totally guessing in terms of where things are going to be by, let’s call it, the end of Q2, because like the usage isn’t exactly going through the roof.But the spend dynamics, I don’t think they’ve seen the – like I don’t think they have good perspective yet on where they’re normalizing and where the stock trades relative to everybody else, they’re getting a huge premium for that. It’s almost to a degree, Daniel, the opposite scenario of what we discussed with Twitter on when we did the Twitter call.When a new Twitter was making some improvements, when you sort of things were going in their favor, but they still had certain monetization type of challenges. But it was no longer cheap. It was the most expensive in the whole space. And Snapchat is by far that player, again. I mean, yes, the revenue growth is probably going to be the best of all of them. But still the premium you’re paying, far greater.DS: Yes. The market is happy with that, though. I mean, that’s what’s always funny what they…AR: Yes, for a few seconds and then you get through these periods where, let’s say, valuations compress and all of a sudden, I mean, I was amazed at how far Snapchat and Pinterest and those names had fell in, let’s call it March, because what had made more sense to me when Disney and Home Depot and Nike and I did the – this too shall pass portfolio, which within a week was up 30% and stuff like ServiceNow and Salesforce and whatever wasn’t doing as well and the SaaS’ weren’t doing as well.And then all of a sudden, that to me, had made some good sense. Then all of a sudden you get this last week-and-a-half, where Amazon goes up 25%, Shopify, I mean, I don’t remember the last time, I’ve had a move like that and it’s not that I’ve been short. I was up 30% on Shopify and then almost down 50%. That’s in a span of two weeks, and I’ve been short the stock on and off, since the beginning of January.I mean, it’s a small position, relatively speaking, but still, you’re just like, what the [indiscernible] is this? Why is this thing moving so much? I mean, is that – but they come out with using, hey, our average traffic the last week-and-a-half is what it was on Black Friday. And that’s where you’re dealing with these things of usage pattern behavior changes and people started to extrapolate financial impacts around them that can be what can vary wildly. And that’s without digesting the Federal Reserve balance sheet that’s up what 80% in six months.I don’t think anyone’s even bothered discussing that what was the Fed doing from September to February – mid-February before we even got into this craziness now? So there’s those variables where maybe what if they come back into focus that these stocks that have been stay-at-home defensive face that more of a headwind than your Pricelines and Expedia’s you’re doing or even Disney?DS: Yes.AR: Good old Disney.DS: Disney still hanging around $100 a share. All right.AR: It’s boring, but you got to feel better about them over the long-haul.DS: Yes, yes, no…AR: That’s what is it versus Netflix, which has surpassed it recently. I’m – what surprised me is a lot of that, I mean,– let’s not go any further, like you said, let’s wrap it up, but that – these companies aren’t issuing stock here.DS: The Zooms and Netflix.AR: I – Netflix did like a $1 billion in debt yesterday. I was just like, why don’t they issue any equity? It just don’t understand.DS: I never understood. I – we should set that aside as a different discussion. But yes, Netflix…AR:..or Zoom, how is it Zoom at $50 billion, tried to raise $3 billion in cash?DS: But Netflix, specifically, they’ve – I mean, I remember, Whitney Tilson, is just one person, I remember being public, because he’s had exchanges with Hastings in the past, but why does Netflix always raise debt and not equity, it’s always been a strange?AR: There has been a logical reason for them before. But I’m saying there’s points where you’re just – you’re a little bit surprised as because they do convertible. I mean, convert has both characteristics.DS: True.AR: But you’re just surprised that they don’t look at this at $20 billion and say, let’s raise $5 billion to dilute – with a dilutive pure equity raise here.DS: Yes, yes.AR: You just don’t think your stocks, Shopify did that. Shopify raised $2 billion. They did huge equity offerings in the last year at significantly lower than where the stock price is. Then you got these companies that recently have done equity offerings, at purely –just assumingly distress levels, and you’re like, why didn’t they just wait, why don’t they just wait two more weeks?DS: Yes. It’s – I mean, and that’s timing and also just the – I forget what the phrases that people have used, but the fact that’s, if you take a step now, it actually changes your future path. It’s not – it’s path dependent to some degree. And so raising the money at one level and not another makes a big difference to how the story plays out. All right, that was good. There are lots of good stuff on Snap and on the Internet advertising with a lots of good stuff thrown in.I think we disclosed as we went, but I just will wrap up, we mentioned Disney, Thor, Berkshire in addition to Pinterest and Google, those are longs for me I think you’ve – you’re still short shop you said and we mentioned Facebook.AR: Trade Desk, I was a little bit…DS: Okay.AR: …Facebook long.DS: Right.AR: …what else? We didn’t discuss anything else. No position in Snapchat, no position in Pinterest even, no, that’s just Facebook.DS: And not [indiscernible] we’ll see.AR: Yes, tempted, tempted, tempted to pull the trigger long on Twitter.DS: Great management.AR: But earnings are next week, let’s – maybe I’ll make a decision.DS: Well, have you ever go on Twitter? We could try to get Galloway on, and then we can commiserate with him. Maybe we make that as a goal.AR: Well, he is just going to tell you that Twitter is going to 60 and Jack’s with The Walking Dead and that…DS:…he’s got the silver Lake…AR:...private – they’ll take it private – silver, they’ll take it private. I don’t know why you would even try to do that here, unless you have a really good perspective on where things are going picture-wise. I just haven’t seen them doing, let’s not start with Twitter. I just haven’t seen them do anything where I think that they they’ve had a eureka moment and how they’re going to change the way the business is managed.DS: Yes. So, I’m starting to see some minor tweaks that are kind of interesting with how the site works. But yes, I hear what you’re saying.AR: No, a subscription service or, they should be hosting the content to every podcaster, who is nonstop promoting, I’ve discovered all this content on Twitter and forget your pivot and Kara, there’s just so much other stuff you’re listening to. And it’s all coming from them advertising it on Twitter. John Krasinski has some good news now, that, why is it not a Twitter show? What Internet-based platform could benefit more from a show called Some Good News Now?DS: It’s very true.AR: I couldn’t have thought of something – and when I saw him and I discovered it, the first episode out there, this is why I don’t own this stock right now, because it’s on YouTube and I found it on Twitter. How have they not cut him a check. I talked to my brother and he was the influencer marketing space and he is just like, these guys are [indiscernible], he’s already got 30 people lined up to want to work with him brand-wise. It’s a waitlist in terms of being able to get in the door.So, that stuff, you look at Twitter, because it’s busy. And there’s so much going on, but I’m not I’m not engaging with any ads on tour. I’m more likely to engage with ads on just about any other place then on Twitter. It’s just free publicity. It’s a PR firm.DS: Okay. I’m going to jump in, though, because I do think we could go, I hear what you’re saying. But I do think we can call them on Twitter.AR: So, let’s call them that way.DS: So, all right, good stuff, Akram. Thank you as always, and yes, good stuff on Snap and Internet advertising as a whole. So take care.AR: Alright, bro. Take care.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.After a difficult first few years after listing, driven by large losses and stagnating user growth, Snap’s (NYSE:SNAP) stock has begun to find its feet as the performance of the underlying business has improved. Snap has created a unique platform for advertisers to reach users with engaging and interactive brand advertising but must ensure the Snapchat platform remains relevant in the face of strong competition. This will require continuous feature innovation as Snap’s network effects are relatively weak.Snap is often referred to as a social media company, so it is telling that it identifies as a camera company. Snap believes that reinventing the camera represents an opportunity to enable communication and capture user attention which can then be monetized through advertising. Compared to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap has a real focus on creating a platform users enjoy and are engaged with rather than facilitating communication and sharing.Snap is pursuing a number of initiatives to support the growth of its platform, including:The camera applications are Snap’s differentiator and could allow significantly higher ARPU than competitors by enabling unique and highly engaging brand advertising. Social applications are what drives Snap’s extremely high user engagement as Snap is focused on one-to-one communication compared to other platforms which are focused on one-to-many communication. Personal communication demands a response leading to high engagement with the platform. For example, Snapchat users visit the platform more than 18 times each day on average. Snap’s content hosting initiatives offer an additional monetization avenue and drive engagement outside of the social applications.Snapchat has unparalleled reach amongst the younger demographic, particularly teens, and this may be the most compelling reason to invest in Snap. These users are the consumers of tomorrow, have significant lifetime values, and are yet to form brand loyalties, making them extremely attractive to advertisers.Figure 1: U.S. Teens' Favorite Social Platform(Source: businessofapps)The question is whether Snapchat is a phase that users go through, moving on to other platforms as they get older, or does it remain the preferred platform as they get older.Other social media platforms are focused on targeted advertising, as is most of digital advertising, and these platforms have the data to do this extremely well. Snap lacks the data to effectively target users and, as a result, drives less product discovery and e-commerce traffic than comparable platforms, although this may change somewhat as Snap’s platform matures and they further develop their advertising offerings.Figure 2: Percentage of Poll Responders Who Have Discovered Products on a Social Media Platform (U.S. 18-34 years old)(Source: Created by author using data from kleinerperkins)Despite Snapchat’s limitations for targeted advertising, Snap can potentially still offer advertisers a very unique and compelling value proposition. Snapchat can provide brand advertising which is interactive and immersive in the form of Augmented Reality (AR). Snapchat’s capabilities are ahead of marketers in many ways, but they will catch up to the potential of the platform. For most digital advertising companies can create display ads or videos and distribute them across an array of websites and apps. To gain the most from Snapchat’s potential, companies need to create Snapchat-specific content which is interactive and engaging. For example, McDonald’s (MCD) and Coca-Cola (KO) recently utilized Snap’s scan technology, which combines visual search and AR to recognize the company’s logo and then provide related AR experiences.Advertising in a chat-based application is difficult because advertising intrudes into users’ private conversations. Through filters and lenses, Snap has found a way to advertise in a way that adds to the user experience and creates a positive impression for brands. Facebook appears well aware of this problem as it is yet to monetize WhatsApp in any meaningful fashion.Snap offers advertisers a number of ways to reach their audience, including ads, sponsored content, sponsored filters and sponsored lenses. Snap first began to monetize its platform in 2015 by introducing Discover, which allows users to browse media content from partners such as CNN and Cosmopolitan. The pricing for this sponsored content initially started at $750,000 per day but is now as little as $50,000. Snap continues to build out its Discover offerings with original shows, licensed content and more material from publishers. Discover is clearly gaining traction with a 35% year-over-year increase in users watching Discover content and over 50 Discover shows reaching a monthly audience of over 10 million viewers.Advertisers are also able to buy short video ads that appear in-between content called Snap Ads. Revenue from Snap Ads doubled year over year in Q4 2019. The click-through rate for these ads is around five times as high as those for equivalent platforms, and the CPM is approximately $2.95 compared to $4.20 on Instagram and $5.12 on the Facebook mobile app. An example of a Snap Ad which leveraged the potential of the platform is Gatorade’s ad celebrating Serena Williams' 23rd Grand Slam victory. The ad took the form of an 8-bit tennis game which was played almost 30 million times with users spending an average of 3 minutes engaging with the ad.Sponsored lenses allow brands to create a lens for the Snapchat community to use and cost between $450,000 and $700,000. Sponsored lenses can generate significant engagement if they appeal to users. For example, Taco Bell’s sponsored lens was viewed 224 million times. On average, users play with sponsored lenses for an average of 20 seconds.In addition to monetizing the platform through advertising, Snap also has the option to generate revenue through in-app purchases. Snap has experimented with a Snap Store, which lives in the Snapchat app’s Discover section and allows users to buy Snapchat merchandise, like toys and clothing. At this stage, the Snap Store is more of a method to drive brand loyalty than generate revenue, but it provides Snap with an option to diversify its revenue stream. There is also significant potential for in-app purchases of filters, lenses, games and Bitmojis.Snap appears to be counting on AR to be a central part of the future of the Snapchat platform. At this stage, Snap is focused on using the technology to drive user engagement, and it is not clear if they plan to monetize the technology for other applications, such as developing tools for businesses or licensing the technology. AR is a clear differentiator for users with over 75% of Snapchat’s community engaging with augmented reality every day on average. It is also an important tool for advertisers as they can use it to create engaging product promotions. For example, HBO created a lens that allowed users to see one of the dragons from “Game of Thrones” land on the Flatiron Building in New York.Snap initially achieved extremely rapid revenue growth after first beginning to monetize the platform in 2015. Revenue growth declined rapidly in 2017, and this, along with weak user growth, led to concerns over the prospects of the company. These concerns were overblown as Snap has been able to continue achieving strong revenue growth.Figure 3: Snap Revenue(Source: Created by author using data from Snap)Figure 4: Snap Revenue Growth (Source: Created by author using data from Snap)Snap’s revenue is driven by Daily Active Users (DAU) and ARPU which both continue to increase. Snap’s DAUs continue to be dominated by the North American market though and one of the key uncertainties for Snap’s stock is the extent to which they can penetrate international markets.Figure 5: Snap Users Segmented by Geography(Source: Created by author using data from Snap)It is probably unrealistic to expect Snap to achieve a similar user geographic mix as Facebook in the near term, if at all, so Twitter may be a more realistic benchmark. If Snap were to achieve the same user geographic mix as Twitter, that would imply a total user base of approximately 500 million. In the most recent quarter, Snap’s total users grew 17% year over year, and other international users grew 36%.Table 1: Platform User Numbers(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Snap continues to achieve rapid ARPU growth as advertisers become more comfortable with the platform and Snap expands their advertising offerings.Figure 6: Snap ARPU Segmented by Geography (Source: Created by author using data from Snap)It is likely that Snap will achieve significantly higher ARPU than Twitter in coming years, and I believe it is possible Snap’s ARPU will approach that of Facebook. This is in part due to Snapchat’s high user engagement and in part due to the uniqueness of the platform for advertisers.Figure 7: Average Revenue per User for Social Media Companies(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Figure 8: U.S. Adults Usage of Social Media(Source: businessofapps)Relative to other media, Snapchat’s advertising revenue per user hour is quite low, and I believe this will increase in coming years to a similar level to TV and Instagram and will be the primary factor leading to similar ARPU as Facebook.Figure 9: North America Advertising Revenue per User Hour(Source: ARK Investment Management)Snap can easily be criticized for its lack of profitability, but this is to be expected given the company’s strategy.Snap seems to indicate that there is no competitive advantage in the market, and as a result, their strategy is to constantly innovate to remain ahead of their competitors. This helps to explain their high costs in the past and lack of operating profitability. This is a concern as there is no reason to believe these high costs will not continue in the future. Losses are acceptable for a company with a large amount of operating leverage that is competing in a global market, which is winner take all or winner take most. If a company is not focused on costs, though they can create a business with structurally high costs and a culture of unaccountability, it can be difficult to correct. As Snap’s platform matures, investors should look for better expense management.Figure 10: Snap Profitability(Source: Created by author using data from Snap)Snap appears to be moving in the right direction though, as ARPU continues to increase while cost of revenue per user has now stabilized. This should lead to higher gross profit margins, in line with comparable companies.Figure 11: Snap ARPU and Cost of Revenue per User(Source: Created by author using data from Snap)Snap’s operating expenses continue to decline relative to revenue as the company grows, which is leading to rapid improvement in operating profit margins. Operating expenses are still high though, particularly general and administrative expenses, which may indicate poor cost controls. High R&D and sales and marketing expenses are not particularly concerning, provided they are driving future revenue growth, which has proven to be the case so far.Figure 12: Snap Operating Expenses(Source: Created by author using data from Snap)Figure 13: Operating Profit Margins for Social Media Companies(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Figure 14: Revenue Growth and Profitability for Social Media Companies(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Table 2: Social Media Companies Financial Performance (Source: Created by author using data from company reports)The Snapchat platform is differentiated from competitors as it is primarily focused on one-to-one communication and features that users enjoy playing with. Other platforms have a larger focus on one-to-many communication and sharing information. The most similar platform in terms of use cases and core audience is Instagram, although the platforms are still quite different.Figure 15: Social Media Use Cases(Source: Created by author using data from businessofapps)Figure 16: Social Media Competitive Landscape(Source: Created by author)Much has been made of Facebook’s ability to adopt successful features from other platforms and neuter their growth. While Instagram adopting stories likely had an impact on Snapchat, the importance is likely overestimated. Instagram and Snapchat have different value propositions, and stories is a small part of what Snapchat offers. I believe Snap is vulnerable to competing platforms introducing similar features, but I believe Snap’s greatest vulnerability is to new apps which can entertain in innovative ways, like TikTok.Figure 17: Instagram Stories Users Compared to Snapchat Total Users(Source: businessofapps)While there are many potential advantages to Snap’s platform, I think they are at a competitive disadvantage to other platforms as they are entertainment focused. Facebook has historically been social first and has strong network effects. Twitter is communication and information first, and there are strong network effects when engaged users build up a community based on shared interests. Snap is entertainment first with most users likely engaging in communication across multiple platforms. They choose to use Snap because they enjoy its functionality more than other platforms but in turn will abandon the platform if they find an alternative platform which is more engaging. Vine and TikTok are just two examples of apps which have been to achieve rapid user growth through innovative features which are entertaining.Snap’s forays into wearables and AR put it in direct competition with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook, although it is possible each company will focus on different use cases. Apple’s core competency is human-centric design, and Snap will find it difficult to succeed in this area. Snap's focus will need to be on low cost and fun applications compared to Apple’s positioning as a luxury brand.Relative to comparable companies, Snap’s current EV/S ratio is modest for their current growth rate. Given that Snap still has significant opportunity to expand user numbers and ARPU, it appears undervalued, although I would be reluctant to pay a high multiple for Snap, given their relatively small competitive moat and current high cost structure.Figure 18: Social Media Companies Growth and EV/S Ratio(Source: Created by author using data from company reports and Yahoo Finance)Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, I estimate Snap’s intrinsic value to be approximately $18 per share. The main uncertainties when trying to value Snap include:I believe it is likely Snap will achieve strong financial results in the coming years as revenue expands, driven primarily by rising ARPU, and margins improve. Snap is likely to face headwinds over the next 12 months due to the COVID-19 situation, but I believe now is a reasonable entry point for investors who have faith in Snap’s ability to innovate and remain the social media platform of choice for younger demographics. It should be noted that Snap’s CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Robert Murphy hold the vast majority of the company’s stock voting power due to the entitlements of different share classes. Investors are, therefore, buying into the vision of these two co-founders and have little recourse if they are unsatisfied with the direction of the company."
4324906,105304,2020-02-18T09:22:31-05:00,Snap shares are struggling to gain traction in the face of significant losses.Competition from TikTok is a substantial threat.Snap is expected to just barely reach profitability in 2020.,"Snap (NYSE:SNAP) shares had a wild 2019. The stock rallied from low single digits all the way to $17 per share in the first half of the year, followed by a bit of sideways consolidation in the back half of the year. The stock has started out 2020 in a similar sideways fashion. The stock got up to $19.76 at one point in January, but now sits a couple dollars lower at $17.56.The company is still putting up substantial losses. A relatively high valuation and new competition from the rising star app TikTok are seemingly keeping shares under a $20 ceiling. Snap has yet to prove they're capable of turning this app into a cash-generating machine.Data by YChartsSnap posted another billion-dollar loss for the full 2019 year. Investors hardly flinched though, as the stock has remained relatively flat through the first month and a half of 2020 (the stock did initially drop around 15% the day after Q4 earnings, but rallied back a bit since). Snap was expected to lose money in 2019, so a loss was hardly surprising. That story could change going into 2020 however, as analysts have the company putting up a $0.01 EPS profit on 40% revenue growth.Source: Seeking Alpha Snap Earnings PageUser metrics, which are, in my opinion, the most important piece of a fast-growing platform company like Snap continue what now appears to be robust growth. Global DAUs grew 17% for the year. North America and Europe were somewhat of a drag on overall global growth rates, but the rest of the world pulled through for a substantial 36% gain. This was much better than 2018's 0% user growth in the 4th quarter.Source: Snap Inc. Q4 and Full Year 2019 Earnings SlidesSnap shares are by no means cheap. The company trades at 14 times TTM sales and more than 10 times expected 2020 sales. I much prefer Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) at current levels, which is growing just as fast as Snap, and ultimately has a more advertiser-friendly platform, but is trading at under 9 times expected 2020 sales. Both Pinterest and Snap remain above Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) price to 2020 sales ratios.Data by YChartsData by YChartsSnap inched closer to profitability this year by about $200M, but there's still a long way to go. Analysts are expecting a very slight profit for the company in 2020, so any misses or disappointments could result in trouble for the stock. Further competition from apps like TikTok fighting for the same attention could also impact Snap's ability to achieve higher ARPU rates if users are on Snapchat less and TikTok more.And yet Snap continues to add users at a respectable double-digit percentage rate. The company is investing heavily in its products. A loyal and young user base will almost certainly stick around for the foreseeable future. If Snap can indeed get to profitability one day, the operating leverage in the business model could allow for a huge margin improvement.For now, I must reiterate my neutral rating on the stock. The valuation is quite high for a company struggling to hit profitability. Failure to achieve the expected $0.01 of EPS this year could see the stock take a hit.I'll be writing more articles on Snap, as well as other great (or sometimes not so great) stocks.

4322192,22148,2020-02-06T16:53:10-05:00,"Snap missed Q4 revenue estimates despite a 17% jump in DAUs to 218 million.The company saw additional cost pressures to watch in 2020.Snap still had negative free cash flows of $76 million in the quarter.The stock has a market valuation of $27 billion with 1.57 billion shares outstanding, while 2020 revenue targets are only $2.3 billion.","Over the years since the IPO, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has made decent progress in eliminating the operating losses and cash flow burn at the social media company. Unfortunately, the company hasn't come anywhere close to eliminating losses, while the stock trades up at a market valuation of nearly $27 billion now. My investment thesis remains negative on the stock at this valuation.The biggest issue with Snap is that the company can't match user engagement and excitement for the product with the revenues to cover the costs of delivering Snapchat. While the company has floundered around to generate nearly $2 billion in annual revenues, Facebook (FB) has turned Instagram into a $20 billion ad business.For Q4, Snap missed on revenue estimates despite a 44% growth rate. Analysts forecast the social media company generating $561.9 million in revenues for the quarter versus the $560.9 million print. The number didn't miss by much.Normally, this revenue growth rate would be impressive regardless of whether the company hit targets. Especially considering Snap daily active users (DAUs) increased by an impressive 17% to 218 million. Unfortunately, the majority of the growth came from the 17 million additional DAUs from the Rest of the World area.The issue facing the company is that the majority of user growth came from less valuable Android users after updating the related app. One has to question whether the surge in revenue costs was further indication of the inability to generate the revenues to match the usage cost of the service.For Q4, costs of revenues jumped $30 million sequentially and $42 million above last year. Snap had done a decent job of constraining costs in recent quarters, but both infrastructure and revenue share costs are on the rise.Source: Snap Q4'19 presentationIn essence, Snap continues to have a lot low calorie usage. Both Facebook and Twitter (TWTR) have far higher gross margins.The downside of a platform catering to people under 24 is the user avoidance of advertisements. Snap appears to spend far larger amounts on network expenses per user than the other social media sites with even Twitter generating gross margins in the 66% range.Data by YChartsDespite Q4 being the best quarter of the year, Snap still burned $76 million in cash during the quarter. The company burned an absurd $341 million during the year. The social media site has now seen the net cash balance dip to $1.2 billion after having a cash hoard of over $3.2 billion following the IPO back in early 2017.Source: Snap Q4'19 presentationSnap improved the cash burn from $810 million in 2018, but the improvement appeared to stall as 2019 played out. Snap is now guiding towards an adjusted EBITDA loss of $80 million in Q1'20.The guidance forecasts revenues surging 44% to $460 million in the quarter, yet the quarterly EBTIDA loss is going to plunge from the positive Q4 and only improve fractionally from last year levels or a loss of $123 million.The key investor takeaway is that Snap still faces far too much competitive pressure from Instagram and new entrants into the space such as TikTok. The risk remains far too high that the company fails to ever generate the profit levels to support a $27 billion valuation. Investors should not buy this dip."

Snap may reach profitability in Q4.Snap's still burning cash despite growth, and the stock is now trading at more than 16X revenue. We question Snap's ability to continue relying on the North American user base.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha’s service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here. Technology company Snap Inc. (SNAP), known for its camera based smartphone app, has been on a hot streak for much of the past year. While investors who bought the IPO are still in the red, the stock has roared back from lows of just over $5 per share - to more than triple that at $18 per share. The company has benefited from strong revenue growth, and an overall stock market that continues to march higher. The stock's price action has certainly made us look foolish since our previous coverage, but we remain concerned about long term investment prospects. The company continues to burn a lot of cash, despite its growth. Meanwhile, the company's revenue growth is highly concentrated in its existing North American user base. With the stock trading at high revenue multiples, we remain skeptical as to whether shares of Snap can sustain this momentum moving forward.2019 was certainly the ""year of Snap"". After tumbling from IPO highs to just over $5 per share at the end of 2018, Snap has rebounded with aggression. Since lows, the stock has almost tripled to $18 per share. While investors who have held since the IPO still see red, investors who bought anywhere near the stock's lower range have made out extremely well thus far.source: YchartsThis momentum along with Snap's revenue growth and potential to post its first profit in Q4, could be a foundation for the stock to elevate beyond IPO prices in 2020. However, we see some red flags present that could undermine Snap's momentum.This concern is a recurring theme from our previous coverage. The company continues to remain FCF negative, despite Y/Y revenue growth of 50% in the third quarter. We favor non-capital intensive business models, so it's great that CAPEX has been reduced so effectively in recent quarters. However, this puts more onus on operations to turn the business FCF positive. From a CAPEX standpoint, the business really can't get much leaner than it is now.source: Snap Inc.In the short term, Snap will get by. Since our previous coverage, the company sold $1 billion in convertible notes to raise cash. This gives the company a hefty cash balance of $728 million, and another $1.5 billion in marketable securities. Our long term concerns stem around whether the business can sufficiently operate at a cash positive basis.The company still generated more than $227 million in operating losses for Q3 2019 versus $323 million in Q3 2018. In other words, the company grew revenues Y/Y by 50%, but closed its operating losses by just 30%. At current run rates, this business still needs so much more growth in the years ahead. This doesn't even include Snap's recent $166 million purchase of AI Factory. We will likely hear more about this acquisition during the company's Q4 call to learn whether the company just wanted intellectual property, or if/how this new asset will impact Snap's cash appropriations.Snap's Y/Y growth is certainly a positive development for the company. But knowing how much more the company needs moving forward, we aren't sold that Snap can sustain this needed growth in a sea of competition. The short video landscape is becoming increasingly competitive thanks to increased popularity from apps including Facebook (FB)/Instagram, and now Tik-Tok. Fellow contributor WY Capital recently outlined this in their analysis.Furthermore, the company's North American user base - that is easily its most lucrative, has consistently been its slowest growing market from a volume standpoint. The North American user base has grown just a total of 6% over the past year.source: Snap Inc.The company's overall Y/Y user growth of 13% signals that most of that 50% revenue growth is simply due to extracting more out of its existing users. Non-volume growth is difficult to sustain over long periods of time. The company's highest jump in Y/Y revenue per user was in North America. But eventually there is only so much juice to squeeze. To truly sustain long term growth, the company will need to figure out how to better monetize its non-North American user bases, an area where Snap has shown progress - but remains well off of where it needs to be.source: Snap Inc.Compared to the $3.75 generated per user in North America, the remaining user bases generate just 27%-28% as much revenue per user. Further more, the North American market's 40% weight on global users means that either a decline in Snap's popularity, or a dip on revenue per user will be catastrophic to Snap's operating results because so much currently rides on it.This fragility in Snap's revenue growth is why shares are too risky at current pricing levels.source: YchartsThe stock was arguably oversold at the beginning of 2019, but the run on the stock has catapulted shares to approximately 16X revenues. This is an outrageously aggressive multiple, compared to just about any growing tech stock in the sector. This is especially difficult to justify given the company's revenue growth is not even being primarily driven by volume.If we take the midpoint of Q4 guided revenues ($550 million) and take FY2019 revenues at a 10X multiple (a still aggressive multiplier to reflect hypothetical bullish sentiment), the resulting share price of $10.88 per share still implies downside from current levels of 40%.In other words, Snap has been priced at a level that is way too optimistic given the company's trailing operating results. While its perfectly reasonable to be optimistic about Snap's future, the current stock price falls well short of accounting for various risks that Snap must still work through. The company is still burning cash, faces aggressive competition, and has yet to counter its reliance on the North American user base. For these reasons, we see immense risk in Snap shares today.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Though the company posted a positive adjusted EBITDA (for the first time) in Q4, it warned that this trend could reverse negative in Q1.And while cash burn has diminished from prior years thanks to a greater operational focus, Snap is still burning through hundreds of millions of dollars annually.","Throughout 2019, social media company Snap (SNAP) looked like it was staging a resurgence. For awhile, investors cheered the company's stronger-than-expected user growth and progress toward slicing down its cash burn, and pointed to evidence that the company was holding up well despite intensifying competition from fellow social media platforms like Instagram. Snap led an unprecedented rally last year, nearly tripling its share price over the course of the past twelve months and surpassing its original IPO price of $17 (an important psychological threshold).Now, however, with the company's latest Q4 results, investors' fears were stirred fresh. Shares sank more than 10% on the news, with investors' attention turning to a glaring revenue miss in Q4 and the expectations of continued losses in FY20:Data by YChartsIn my view, a lot of air has been let out of the Snap balloon, and more losses are due to follow. At its core, Snap is a company that is trying very hard to define its niche in a very crowded social media landscape, competing against powerhouses like Facebook (FB) and Instagram while also vying for users' online time against smaller niche players like Pinterest (PINS), Twitter (TWTR), and Reddit. Earlier on in its lifecycle, Snap was prized for its ability to retain the coveted set of high-spending teen/millennial generations among its user base. But these types of users are notoriously fickle: the same as what happened to Facebook over the second half of the last decade. Once Facebook was no longer perceived as ""cool"", these valuable younger audiences started abandoning the platform. Luckily, Facebook had ""second acts"" in the form of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as a slew of other revenue-generating initiatives like Facebook @ Work and Facebook Marketplace, and even more recently the cryptocurrency project Libra.What we're most interested in seeing from Snap is its ability to come up with a second act to revitalize revenue growth. So far, the most we've seen are Spectacles - which turned out to be a fad-driven, cash-burning endeavor that earned Snap the ridicule of both consumers and analysts.Snap's fourth-quarter results, and the worrying metrics within them, will once again put Snap's fundamentals in the spotlight of its stock price. There's a deep correction ahead, and investors should take caution to stay on the sidelines and invest elsewhere.Let's start with the (only) piece of good news, however. Snap's user growth beat expectations. I've often posited that for a social media company, user counts are the single most important metric. And while the same is true of Snap, it's unfortunate that the rest of its revenue/profit metrics offset the positive news on the user front.Nevertheless, we acknowledge that Snap saw strong 17% y/y growth in DAUs globally. In Facebook's (FB) most recent quarter, by comparison, DAU growth had slowed to the high single digits (though of course, Facebook's ~1.7 billion DAUs are already at a scale that is nearly 10x that of Snap's).Figure 1. Snap DAU trendsSource: Snap Q4 earnings deckSequentially, Snap added 8 million net new DAUs since Q3, and DAU growth also accelerated four points relative to 13% y/y growth in Q3. Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, had projected Snap to end the quarter at just 215 million DAUs, or 16% y/y growth.CEO Evan Spiegel's prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call also highlights some helpful commentary on user engagement and product traction:Here's the one catch that comes alongside stronger user growth, however. As seen in the DAU trends chart above, most of Snap's user growth is coming from the ""Rest of World"" segment. DAU growth in the saturated North America market, meanwhile, has fallen to the single digits. Unfortunately, the ""Rest of World"" users also have the lowest monetization and average revenue per user:Figure 2. Snap ARPU trendsSource: Snap Q4 earnings deckWhile ARPU growth of 23% y/y is strong, most of that growth is being driven in the U.S. - where user growth has conversely been weakest. Meanwhile, while Rest of World user growth has been strong, ARPU growth has lagged behind.As we'll discuss next, this is why Snap's stronger user trends don't necessarily translate to strong financial results.Now let's take a look at Snap's results for the fourth quarter. See the summary table below:Figure 3. Snap Q4 earnings summarySource: Snap Q4 earnings releaseRevenue grew 44% y/y to $560.1 million, more or less matching the company's full-year 45% y/y growth rate. Unfortunately, Wall Street analysts had projected a consensus revenue target of $561.9 million, a hair higher than what Snap had achieved. But considering that most technology companies (particularly high-growth recent IPOs like Snap) tend to beat Wall Street estimates by a considerable margin each and every quarter, this miss comes as a particular sting.Similarly, Snap's profit results were rather mixed this quarter:Figure 4. Snap profit metricsSource: Snap Q4 earnings deckOn the bright side, Snap posted its first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA of $42 million this quarter as seen in the chart above, a twenty-one point margin improvement over a -13% adjusted EBITDA margin in 4Q18. Similarly, even on a GAAP basis, Snap's net margin improved five points to -45%. Free cash flow losses of -$75.9 million and -$341.4 million in Q4 and FY19, respectively, are also less than half of the prior year's losses.However, this isn't all good news. Snap's absolute net losses still grew on a dollar basis to -$241 million on a GAAP basis, and the company's GAAP EPS of -$0.17 widely missed Wall Street consensus of -$0.12. And despite the seeming turnaround in adjusted EBITDA this quarter, Snap is expected to regress toward wide EBITDA losses again in Q1, with only slight margin improvements (if any) implied by its guidance ranges:Figure 5. Snap guidance updateSource: Snap Q4 earnings deckThe bottom line on Snap: despite a roaring rally that has more than doubled Snap's share price over the past twelve months, Snap's core problems remain the same.With Snap's poor fundamentals hitting center stage after Q4, expect some of Snap's fast-won gains over 2019 to recede. Stay on the sidelines here."
4314589,105040,2019-12-30T15:02:16-05:00,"Short video apps are growing fast and we believe it could be a major threat to Snapchat.While DAUs are growing slowly, ARPU growth is helping to fuel the 50% revenue growth.Profitability is increasing substantially due to operating leverage, but the source of this operating leverage is dubious.Valuation is incredibly high even for such a high growth company.","While the fundamentals of Snap(SNAP) Inc have improved drastically since it hit all time lows early this year, the company still remains overvalued after its massive increase in valuation. Substantial competition is arriving from short form video apps and the company still remains solidly in the red, so we continue to believe that this company is a sell.The competition for user time has never been more intense, both in the US and internationally. On one hand, you have incumbents like Facebook and Tencent buying up smaller companies to grow, or just copying Snapchat's features, and on the other hand you have challengers like Tiktok growing rapidly on its own.While the short form video threat has been brought up many times, investors have mostly dismissed it, believing it is a fad or that it is ""cringe"" for most teenagers. However, after doing some digging, we have found that there is actually a lot of overlap between Tiktok and Snapchat, making Tiktok a serious competitor to Snapchat. For example, Tiktok's userbase skews really young, with most of its users being 13-24, meaning many of its users overlap with Snapchat users, at least in terms of age. Source: Tiktok deckTiktok also has incredibly high engagement metrics, with the average users spending over 46min on the app every day and opening the app 8 times. Considering each teenager only has a limited amount of time to spend on social media, spending time on Tiktok will likely reduce time spent on Snapchat.Source: Tiktok deckIn the long run, Tiktok and other short form video apps are a threat to Snapchat because of their advanced AR capabilities. Snapchat believes it has a lead in AR due to its camera first nature, yet many short video platforms are also camera focused(As you can see from above, 34% of Tiktok's DAUs shoot daily) and have advanced AR capabilities. Below are some of the effects available on Likee, a short form video platform.Source: YoutubeSo are short video platforms a fad? While its hard to say for sure, Tiktok downloads have remained stable from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019 at around 180mil downloads per quarter, so this trend certainly seems to have staying power.Source: SensortowerShort video apps are not the only competition. If you look at the chart above you'll notice that FaceApp, which allows users to edit photos of faces, is also making a comeback. It is very likely that this app is just a fad, considering it has gone viral before, but considering it's used for photo editing, it could definitely reduce time spent on Snapchat. And of course, Facebook's own apps continue to sit atop the download charts.The problem for Snap is twofold - Firstly, users may start spending time on other apps, reducing Snap's ad inventory. Secondly, Snapchat used to be one of the few ways to reach teens, but if more channels of advertising emerge that could serve this purpose, it would take away some of Snap's ad budget.The effects of fierce competition can clearly be seen in Snap's slow user growth. Even after all the improvements they have made, DAUs are growing quite slowly, with YOY growth of only 13%(In comparison, Facebook, which is far larger, is growing at around 8.5%).Source: Q3 2019 presentationTo give Snap some credit, even though their user growth has been abysmal for such a small company, they have been able to monetize their current users very well, growing ARPU 33% YOY. The ARPU growth is the primary reason why revenue growth accelerated to around 50%.As for profitability, strong operating leverage continues to improve profitability substantially. Despite the strong revenue growth, expenses are barely growing less than 10%, allowing losses to shrink from around -320mil to -230mil. Our forecasts show that if Snap can keep up strong revenue growth, it could reach over $13bil in revenue and $3-4bil in yearly operating profit within the next 10 years just by growing its ARPU to Facebook levels.However, there is a dark side to this operating leverage. Some people may argue that Snapchat is monetizing far too quickly - A while back it introduced unskippable ads that really annoyed a lot of its core users. Snap also laid off 120 engineers in an effort to save costs, which could hinder growth in the future. As shown by the strong user and ARPU growth, there are no apparent consequences yet, but this could change in the future.In the long run, Snap plans to continue their push into AR through the continued improvement of their Spectacles product.While the product certainly has potential, at its current stage it is far too expensive and has too little utility to be a viable mainstream option. It would take a lot of R&D and time before Spectacles becomes affordable enough to go mainstream.The main problem with Snap is its incredibly high valuation. The company currently trades at a $22bil valuation, which is incredible for a company with barely above 200mil DAUs. Sure, it has strong revenue growth, but this growth is mainly coming from ARPU growth(basically equivalent to price increases) and not user growth, so we're not sure how sustainable this is.As we mentioned earlier, it is possible for Snap to make $3-4bil per year within 10 years if things go well, which is why we don't think it is a short, but there are just far too many issues with Snap to make it a long - Competition, Execution issues(The company did a redesign a while back that lost it millions of users), and the sheer valuation of the company.Overall, Snap has certainly impressed us with its turnaround, but we still think the current valuation is too high for a company with so many risks. The company, which was once one of the few ways to reach teens, has become only one player in a sea of new social apps. Even with strong revenue growth and operating leverage, we're not biting."
4333429,22148,2020-03-21T20:08:28-04:00,Social media stocks are all down substantially due to real risks on ad spending.Snap was burning substantial cash before the economic shutdown from the coronavirus.The stock has the highest risk profile and the highest relative valuation in the space.,"The social media space has been decimated during the market collapse on fears that ad revenue from small and medium businesses will not only disappear in the short term but never return in the future. Due to ongoing free cash flow losses, Snap (SNAP) remains the stock at most risk of a protracted slowdown. My investment thesis wanted investors out of the stock up at $17 and the relative value proposition hasn't gotten any better with the dip to $10. Image Source: Snap website The easy story here is that Snap is cash flow negative and the coronavirus outbreak is only going to make these numbers worse. The company already guided to an adjusted EBITDA loss for Q1 of at least $80 million. Source: Snap Q4'19 presentation These numbers were based on revenues growing up to 45%. All of this growth might be over for now. Snap forecast revenues growing $140 million over last Q1 with the EBITDA losses improving by $43 million. The numbers suggest a $100 million boost to operating expenses year-over-year and Snap might not see revenues rise at all. The EBITDA loss in Q1 and especially Q2 could exceed the levels from 2019 vs. the expected improvement. Snap had a combined adjusted EBITDA loss of $202 million in first half 2020. The balance sheet is solid with a cash balance of $2.1 billion while Snap does have convertible notes of $892 million. The net cash balance is ~$1.2 billion. Source: Snap Q4'19 earnings releaseThe company burned free cash flow of $341 million last year. An investor can probably make an easy assumption that Snap won't improve cash flows in 2020. Just a repeat of this cash flow loss in 2020 and the company would see the net cash balance dip close to $800 million.A doubling of the cash burn due to a protracted recession and Snap could end the year with a net cash balance of closer to $500 million. Of all the social media stocks, Snap is the least prepared for a downturn having not solved how to generate profits in the booming 2010s. At the end of the crisis, the social media company could be very far from breakeven again. The worst part of the investment story for Snap is that all the other social media stocks are cheaper. Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS) and Twitter (TWTR) all trade at lower forward EV/S multiples. The relative multiples are remarkable due to Facebook having $55 billion in net cash and Twitter having enough cash to recently agreeing to utilize $2 billion for a share buyback. Both of these companies are likely taking advantage of the downturn to reduce the diluted share count. Clearly, Snap isn't richly valued here at an EV of only 4x '21 sales, but the stock doesn't offer the relative value of the other stocks, nor does the company offer the balance sheet to protect investors from a protracted downturn in ad revenues. Facebook and Twitter don't have any concerns regarding cash and Pinterest was projected to generate a positive EBITDA this year. The best stock to own always is the one with the lower risk and better value. In a quick economic rebound, all of these stocks will bounce back anywhere from 50% to 100%. The typical EV/S multiple was closer to 6x in a more normal market. The easy way to avoid this risk is to own the social media stocks without cash flow issues. The key investor takeaway is that Snap is the one social media stock to avoid due to obvious cash flow issues. All of the stocks in the sector should rebound sharply on a quick economic rebound, but Snap remains the one at higher risk in a protracted economic downturn. Invest in the social media stocks with a lower risk profile due to better cash flow situations."
4321694,69905,2020-02-05T15:07:56-05:00,"Revenue growth rates remain positively strong, with no signs of slowing down.All-important North America segment reverses declines and posts growth sequentially and year over year.Ultimately, this stock is overvalued, and investors will struggle to be positively rewarded anywhere near this valuation - despite the after-hours sell-off.","Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) Q4 2019 results came in mixed.Figures point to the continued high growth adoption of the platform, while at the same time, GAAP losses worsen. Given the lack of clear visibility to GAAP profitability together with an irrationally priced stock, investors would do well to take profits and sidestep this investment. Here's why:The avenue that Snap had to deliver, it performed very well - revenue growth rates remain strong. It showed to bearish investors (myself included) that its growth rates are not showing any signs of slowing down:Source: author's calculationsAs always the devil is in the detail, and we can see that, in Q4 2019, North America revenue was up 42% Y/Y, with growth similarly distributed throughout Europe and the Rest of the World. This is a markedly different position for Snap compared with this time a year ago, where North America was clearly underperforming. Why is this important?Because we can see that North America Daily Active Users (DAUs) were up 9% year-over-year compared with down 1% in Q4 2018. Accordingly, this goes to the heart of the bullish thesis. It depicts in clear terms that North America's 42% year-over-year growth is not being driven solely through a rise in ARPUs - North America's ARPUs increased 31% year over year.Again, this is crucial, if North America's numbers show that Snap is not losing appeal amongst its key demographic, then Snap will be able to continue to increase its ARPU and this would, later on, allow for sales to positively leverage its cost structure.As an investor, personally, I'm less obsessed over revenue growth rates. Although, obviously, without strong revenues, the business model is doomed. Nevertheless, revenues are vanity and profits reality.Hence, if Snap is not able to show a realistic path to profits, I will continue to be bearish. You may retort, surely profits come later?Here's the thing, thus far, I find no tangible reasons to believe that the business model is sound. Note, this is not the same to say that the app doesn't have any value. The difference is subtle, but there some. In the case of Snap, even while growing its top line by 44% Y/Y, its bottom line remains negative, thus making its operations uneconomical.Specifically, if we add-back the $100 million legal settlement surrounding its IPO, on a GAAP basis its EPS would still have come in at negative $0.10 in Q4 2019.Snap's $0.03 non-GAAP EPS essentially adds back its main costs, which is management's stock-based compensation. Thus, without considering its main costs of doing business, I have difficulty with affording this figure any weight.What about cash flows? Again, the stock-based compensation is not factored in Snap's cash flow from operations calculations. Not to mention that the number of diluted shares outstanding is up 7% Y/Y, meaning that shareholders continue to get diluted out. In other words, Snap's top line is not yet showing signs of inflecting its earnings, and benefiting from increased revenues.Source: author's calculationsLooking at the table above and we see that Snap is being priced at 14x trailing sales. Implying that even with the after-hours sell-off, this does not leave much room for shareholders to buy into the stock.In 2020, many business models are being valued at approximately 15x sales. However, the bulk of those business models are based on recurring sales. The same cannot be said about Snap's business model.Of course, investors are eyeing Pinterest (PINS) with interest and comparing the two stocks to see which one of the two should be afforded the higher premium. This, I believe, is faulty reasoning.Just because one is overvalued does not automatically make the other one a bargain. In my mind, both stocks ill afford the investors any significant upside potential.It is never easy to read about your stock falling.Admittedly, I had expected Snap's revenue growth rate to rapidly taper off into 2020, but its Q1 2020 guidance shows that not the case, yet. Nevertheless, given Snap's valuation is so extremely overvalued, don't wait for more bad news to act, sidestep this investment now."
4313591,102107,2019-12-23T07:00:00-05:00,"We look at the technology sector for our second year-end Marketplace Roundtable.The sector has been a leader even as the regulatory and valuation bullseye on it has grown, and our authors mostly expect that leadership to continue.They share a few favorite names and ideas, including big ones you expect and a few smaller ones you might not.","2019 finishes with an extra kick for investors. Part of that is the continued strong run of the market, erasing memories of last year's near bear market and extending the decade-long bull. There also are plenty of market headlines and events that have sprung over the end of the year, from Phase 1 trade deals to M&A to political whirlwinds and more.More trivially, the 2010s are ending and the 2020s begin. It's been quite a decade for equity investors, with the S&P 500 returning over 250% in that time. Even underperformance could leave a portfolio in good shape, and any alpha that was found would really leave investors well off.Where does that leave investors and the markets for 2020, at the start of a new decade? That's what we try to answer in our annual Marketplace Roundtable series. We are publishing roundtable discussions featuring more than 80 authors from across the spectrum of investing styles and focuses you find on Seeking Alpha: Macro to value investing, small cap to energy, gold to quant and alternative strategies, and more.Today's discussion focuses on the Tech sector, which was again a market leader. We're featuring the following panel:From Growth to Value: I think too much time and energy is wasted in trying to predict the market. You never know when investor sentiment will turn sour. The fact that this is ""the most hated bull market"" is rather a good thing. I see the constant bear market threat as insurance against irrational valuations.Some stocks that have outstanding results, raise guidance and fall nonetheless because the beats and the raise were already priced in. This is very healthy for the general market. It's only when there is exuberance and overreaction you might see a big fall in stocks. Some stock categories are richly valued but that is always the case in a bull market. As long as not all stocks are severely overvalued, the bull market may continue.Damon Verial: This bull market has been seen as one of momentum. Whenever that momentum is perceived to stop, such as last Q4 or back in August, you start to hear about the bull market ending. Recently, momentum is back up, and the fear mongering has ceased. However, the market doesn’t work as most people believe. Momentum typically is bullish but weakening right before a bear market – not negative. Hence investors should be fearful when they see positive but declining momentum in stocks – not after momentum turns negative.Integrator: I tend to focus more on high quality, secularly growing businesses so I'm less concerned about how the overall market performs but I will say that I expect to see a much stronger divergence in distribution of returns going forward with higher quality growth names continuing to provide stronger returns and lower quality names with limited growth prospects for revenue and earnings struggling to deliver satisfactory returns. As we likely enter into a cycle of more tepid economic growth, you will see a greater disparity between the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" Companies that can grow earnings will be rewarded and those that can't won't. I expect much lower overall returns for markets in 2020.Andres Cardenal: Many analysts tend to lose sight of the fact that the market is not driven by the fundamentals alone, but the fundamentals in comparison to expectations. When expectations are low and there is a healthy degree of fear in the market, it is relatively easy for the fundamentals to outperform those expectations and for stock prices to do well going forward. Bull markets are born on pessimism and die on euphoria, and we have not reached euphoria levels at this stage. This is indicating that the path of least resistance for the market is higher.Bull & Bear Trading: The recent momentum higher will usher us into 2020 with a fully valued market. Near term, the optimism of USMCA and China trade deals may fade as expectations are tempered by reality. A strong U.S. consumer may combine with better global growth for 3% GDP in the U.S next year. A historically strong labor market may be accompanied by further wage growth that could help move inflation toward the Fed's target of 2%. This economic strength means that a key bull market driver of decreasing interest rates may be absent in 2020.The changing interest rate environment may create less favorable conditions for the market. We anticipate 2020 to be a trading range market with a slight upside bias. Near term we are wary of a market correction.Elazar Advisors, LLC: The Fed is pumping money into the market like crazy. Buckle up. The key word being up.Julian Lin: The time to sell the market is when you can't find any stocks to buy. I am still finding many deeply undervalued stocks, and as a result I do not fear any market crash.Robert Castellano: Corporate earnings are rolling the game, but some sectors are overbought.Rick Pendergraft: The momentum is obviously still to the upside, but we all know the rally has to come to an end at some point. I am cautiously optimistic for 2020 with an eye on lowering equity allocations if certain technical events happen.Cestrian Capital Research: We believe the market will continue to rise, albeit punctuated by more spasms and sell-offs than has been the case over the last decade.Mark Hibben: I viewed the collapse of tech stocks, the focus of my service, in December 2018, as panic selling and I made clear that I thought it was a good time to buy. I added to my portfolio as stocks were going down. As I expected, the portfolio recovered, about doubling in value from the December lows and exceeding the high point of the portfolio total return in late August 2018. But that was then.Lately I've had the feeling that we're approaching the end of the bull market, either do to continuing trade tensions or recession, so I took profit and pared back the portfolio to key long term growth companies. In a market downturn, I'll be a buyer once again. In short, I regard an end to the bull market as a buying opportunity.Joe Albano: Most would agree you can't time the market. So why try predicting a massive correction, recession, or depression? Stick to your risk tolerance and goals. Keep cash at all times, and watch the charts. If things look like they're about to fall then situate yourself to hedge. I wrote an article this past month saying the Nasdaq could be in trouble before the year is out. And it could have been based. But the key was I didn't hedge or sell my portfolio. I just created a heads up for myself in case it happened. I circled the key levels and would begin hedging if it got there. If it didn't, then I hadn't changed course and I'm still fully invested (per my goals and cash allocation).EnerTuition: I generally focus on long-term wealth generation through individual stock picking and not the market. Having said that the market is very frothy which is understandable in the context of low interest rates. As a result of ZIRP/NIRP climate, there may be a correction but not a steep one as the money has to go somewhere.From Growth to Value: One of the great things about the stock market is that you never stop learning. There are many things I have learned about investing in 2019. One of the things I like the most is looking the competitive moat of a great company culture. That means how happy employees are but also customers. That can seem petty, but retaining or attracting top talent with little perks and a great company culture is really an advantage and it doesn't show up in the books.Damon Verial: One of my friends, an investment advisor, says that my ability to predict the market accurately comes from being a trader, not an investor. He says that traders, who make daily actions in the market, have their fingers on the market pulse and can predict the market more correctly than can investors. If this is true, then I believe earnings traders have the best pulse-monitoring ability of all traders, as it is earnings that move the market. I have found that monitoring my earnings trades’ directions has helped me in predicting future market movements - More short earnings trades implies a general overpricing in the market, more long trades implies too much pessimism in earnings estimations and a better chance for companies to surprise on the upside, moving markets higher.Integrator: The power of patience. The markets often give you what you want, you just have to be patient and disciplined enough to wait for it. I saw this illustrated really strongly in 2019. I happened to pick up some Facebook (FB) stock during the throes of the late December 2018 panic that saw this name heavily sold off. 2019 saw a return to business as usual and the name rebounded 50%. Similarly, I have had my eye on high growth SaaS business like The Trade Desk (TTD) and Avalara (AVLR) for sometime, but couldn't get my arms around the valuation. Opportunity struck in late 2019. You need to be patient to wait for quality on sale, and if you stick with high quality names long enough and can maintain patience in the face of turmoil, the market eventually rewards you.Andres Cardenal: I reaffirmed a key concept - do not fight the Fed. I was heavily hedged and even net short during the fourth quarter of 2018, mostly because the Fed was mistakenly rising rates and the economic data overseas was looking quite ugly. But then monetary policy started to pivot and markets were oversold, so we turned long in January of 2019. Even if there have been plenty of reasons for concern on the economic and political front during the year, being on the right side of liquidity trends has proven to be of utmost importance once again.Bull & Bear Trading: China's communists have learned to weaponize capitalism and have been waging economic hybrid warfare against the west for decades. Chinese state-sponsored, corporate espionage is an enormous economic threat that is growing rapidly. This trade war was launched by the Chinese against the U.S. decades ago and we are very late in responding. This trade war is very likely to escalate despite the headlines of a Phase I deal. Many Chinese companies listed on both U.S. and Chinese exchanges are not using anything close to accepted accounting practices and some companies are outright fraudulent. China's national debt is a house of cards that is unsustainable. Alarmingly, China has now begun to export its bad debt by the billions on world credit markets. Why would anyone ever believe that communists who refuse to provide transparency of their accounting would be responsible capitalists? These two differing ideologies are incompatible with starkly irreconcilable differences. A dragon cannot also be a lamb any more than a communist can also be a capitalist. The west is allowing the capitalist foundation of the global economy to be destroyed by communist China's refusal to allow transparency into their accounting at all levels. Decades of bad Chinese debt are now unsustainable so they are being exported to the west via world credit markets and the IMF, which may have become corrupted by China. Western capitalists believed that introducing capitalism into communist China would provide a more attractive ideology that all Chinese would embrace. Instead, this effort has gone very wrong with China's communists weaponizing capitalism as a means to increase their power, build a world-class military, become integral to the world's supply chain, and weaken the financial structures of global capitalism. Capitalists have created a communist economic monster that now threatens to destroy its creators.Elazar Advisors, LLC: This economy is incredibly resilient. It held up given this ridiculously annoying trade war. If this trade deal sticks I have to believe the economy can actually improve.Julian Lin: The public has a seemingly universal hate for share buybacks, but the hate confuses me. This year confirmed my belief that share buybacks are an efficient catalyst to take advantage of an underperforming stock price. We saw this with Facebook, which rebounded over 50% from its lows as it directed all of its free cash flow to buying back shares at 16-18 times trailing earnings. Identifying companies trading at a discount with a large share buyback program is a highly underrated investment strategy.Robert Castellano: A correlation of revenues and stock prices doesn't exist in 2019 nor 2018 in tech.Rick Pendergraft: I came in to 2019 expecting the market to rally in the first quarter and then hit some resistance at the long-term moving averages. The resistance never really materialized and I learned to trade what I was seeing, not what I was thinking.Cestrian Capital Research: That nothing matters!Mark Hibben: The big lesson I learned was not to adhere rigidly to the buy and hold philosophy. Not all companies can be the next Apple (AAPL). Some companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) became so overheated in value by mid-summer in 2018 that it would have been worthwhile to sell. The indicator for me was that the share value was far above (like 100% above) my calculated DCF fair value. Nvidia has recovered somewhat since then, and IPGP continued to decline. Neither company returned to their high valuations of 2018. I missed an opportunity to take profit in these companies. I still hold Nvidia, however, since I believe that it does represent a strong long-term growth prospect at its current valuation.Joe Albano: To stick to the data and act on your data. Sometimes it takes longer for a thesis to play out. If your goals and time horizon are long term, don't fuss about the short term. Everyone wants instant gratification but the mature investor knows if the story hasn't changed the market will come to grips with the story.EnerTuition: The ongoing lesson of the booming market is that shorting high valuation is not a great idea and even shorting junk may not be a good idea.From Growth to Value: Tech is the engine of change so, over the long term, it will do great. Some tech stocks have high valuations and a lot of growth baked in. But because of that, some investors shy away from the whole tech sector, which can create opportunities for long-term investors.I think it's always best to scale into tech stocks, as some are very volatile. Because of their often very high gross margins, tech stocks will be rewarding patient long-term investors.Sometimes stocks that need time to grow into their valuation. A great example is Square (SQ) that has not revisited its high of mid-2018. Because some very vocal investors look too much at the stock price as an indication for the underlying business, there have been a lot of negative comments about Square. That gives long-term investors a chance to scale into the stock.Damon Verial: Tech stocks have been taking three steps forward and one step back: For every three good months, expect one correction the next. In the short term, we have several warning signs pointing to a pullback in tech. Recently, I issued warnings for both Apple and Oracle (ORCL), the latter of which we aim to play over earnings. In the medium term, too, the risk/reward is not in favor of the bulls, as many companies are becoming unsustainably overpriced. In the long term, the momentum in tech should continue to hold as companies improve their products/services, the fruits of which will be seen in stronger earnings reports, thereby helping justify the increasingly high prices.Integrator: Tech is home to many long-term secular growth stories including the shift to SaaS (Software as a Service), digital advertising, digital payments and digital commerce. These themes have been playing out over the last few years, but what's less appreciated is that they still have many years to play out. That means more years of strong earnings and cash flows for businesses that have competitive positions in these spaces. I think the SaaS correction that we saw toward the end of 2019 was good for the sector. I see many of the SaaS names having a strong 2020, when investors realize just how disruptive this space will be for a long period of time.Andres Cardenal: Valuations are getting extended in technology, so investors need to be more selective in terms of stock picking in the sector going forward. Short-term pullbacks are perfectly normal and should even be expected. However, over the long term the technology sector is creating enormous amounts of value and innovation, so investors in technology stocks will probably benefit from superior returns over time.Bull & Bear Trading: The character named Old Turkey in Jesse Livermore's classic novel Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" would remind you that, ""It's a bull market, you know."" However, we might like to inquire of Mr. Old Turkey how he feels about very mature bull markets that have the Fed punch bowl of decreasing interest rates taken away at the end of the party? Generally, the scenario of the Fed reaching the end of an interest rate reduction cycle can signal caution in the markets. We believe caution is exactly the correct posture to adopt at this time. Bullish sentiments may be tempered with caution now to protect recent gains. We expect 2020 to be a trading range market where stock pickers excel. The optimistic expectations for the China trade deal may disappoint by the realities of communist China's incalcitrant focus upon its own global ambitions. A strong labor market and economy is likely to combine for the Fed's 2% target on inflation being met. The discussion may evolve to rising interest rates.Elazar Advisors, LLC: We're looking for stocks with 45% upside potential. I think there's always those opportunities in every market, if you do the work. Fundamentals held up nicely in the face of a trade war. Pull that trade war aside for election year and it's easy to see how things can actually get better. Plus the Fed printing and pumping can't hurt.Julian Lin: Everyone - everyone - is saying that tech is in a bubble. While I agree that many firms have traded at lofty valuations at some point in 2019, I however believe that the general skepticism shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the software business model. I have written many times that the lack of profits at tech companies is more of an accounting than fundamental issue - over time, the inherent operating leverage from the software as a subscription ('SAAS') model should generate substantial operating margins. The key, of course, is correctly projecting one's ability to capture market share and the overall size of the market. The big winners in the stock market have been tech companies over the past 10 years, and I expect that to continue over the next 10 years.Rick Pendergraft: I think you have to handle it on a company-by-company basis. I try to start with companies with solid fundamentals and then try to time the entry with sentiment and technical analysis. There are certainly some companies where I think investors should be defensive and I have taken profits on some. I think software is primed to pace the gains within the tech sector in 2020 after semiconductors outpaced the sector in 2019.Cestrian Capital Research: We anticipate continued growth in the sector. Why not? The economy is strong and we are only midway through a tectonic platform shift in tech, from on-premises to cloud. That means plenty of enterprise spending still to come.Mark Hibben: I have been getting more defensive, in the sense that when there was an opportunity to take a substantial profit in a company, I went ahead and sold. If I had thought that the near term (next couple of years) offered better prospects, I might have just held.In many cases, I missed out on some profit. I sold Qualcomm (QCOM), Teradyne (TER), Lumentum (LITE), ASML Holding (ASML), and TSMC (TSM) this year. These companies subsequently rose above my selling price on trade optimism. In most cases, I realized substantial (40% or more) returns, so I'm not too concerned.Generally, these companies were trading well above fair value, as far as I was concerned, so they had become problematic to justify as holds in any case. My perception was that we're very near a high point in the tech sector, so that added to the imperative to sell. But overall, I think tech is a great sector to invest in during a downturn, and some of the companies I sold this year I expect to buy back into.Joe Albano: It's just getting started. Semiconductors are a large part of the sector and they only have just come alive at the end of 2019. Some have hit new 52-week highs while others are still working their way there. Don't discount data center giants like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), or Facebook either though, they are coming up on refreshes of hardware and infrastructure weighted toward the latter half of the year so it may take a few months to get rolling, but I see the momentum starting and the train gaining steam now.EnerTuition: Tech has seen a huge bull run and it is difficult to find good values unless one looks at the market with the lens of ZIRP/NIRP expansion. We are not fans of low growth companies in that context.From Growth to Value: I don't follow semiconductors closely, because I think it is more or less a commoditized sector and it is very dependent on outside factors, especially the trade war and its consequences. A prime example is the Chinese announcement that all foreign PC hardware and operating systems must be removed from all state offices in the next three years.Integrator: Largely macro, but I also feel there is a secular element to this as well. The semi's power all manner of embedded systems for connected devices, and with internet of things (IoT) still in the really early stages of a long term uptrend, I think there's some thought there could be a real structural shift underlying some of this movement and its not merely just cyclical any more. Time will tell.Andres Cardenal: One of the main positive factors is that semiconductors have already been through a slowdown in demand, and many of the companies in the sector delivered superior performance than what the market was expecting. Long-term demand for semiconductors is increasing due to technological trends, and cyclicality risk is proven to be more moderate than it was in the past.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Memory prices like NAND have turned up. DRAM is bottoming. 5G and the trade war behind us can keep the party going.Julian Lin: Commentary from semiconductor management teams has indicated that the cyclical downturn is trade-war related. No one, however, can judge the extent of the downturn. I am positioned only in semiconductor companies with strong balance sheets and ample free cash flow - Texas Instruments (TXN) is a conservative pick in the sector with an A-rated balance sheet, growing dividend, and strong share repurchase program.Robert Castellano: The semi drawdowns this year are largely company dependent depending on exposure to the China trade/technology war. But it is also impacted by micro factors such as delays in Intel (INTC) chip shipments or large inventory of memory chips at Micron (MU).Rick Pendergraft: The downswings from semis were mostly tied to the trade war as so many stocks in the industry are heavily dependent on trade with China. Now that we have the first phase of the trade agreement, we shouldn't see as many wild swings from the chip sector in 2020.Cestrian Capital Research: We believe semis will move up, but remain volatile and are challenging long-term holds, if only for the psychological damage the stocks can inflict. Trading semis can offer rich rewards, however. Trade isn't a real thing. It's just a game. It will wash out in the end.Mark Hibben: I viewed the semiconductor selloffs as trade related. Any time the Chinese market for semiconductors seemed threatened by the state of the trade negotiations, semis tended to sell off. Although my portfolio has been heavily into semis, I've avoided the more cyclical semis such as memory and storage. Instead, I've focused on what I call “new paradigm” semiconductor companies that combine extensive software and hardware into integrated products. Apple is the archetypical new paradigm company. Many of the companies I held fed into the new paradigm such as Lumentum, ASML, and TSMC.The new paradigm is not cyclical in the way memory is (or can be) but it was just as sensitive to trade concerns, especially Apple, given the importance of China to Apple, and the way that Apple's China business declined starting in the December quarter of 2018.Joe Albano: Macro is only part of it. Macro was the cloud over the recovery for semiconductors. It was an added weight on the squat bar as semis tried to stand up again as OEMs digested their inventories. The cycle is now at the bottom, as seen by the upturn in NAND spot and contract pricing and the stabilized DRAM contract pricing and upturn in DRAM spot pricing. The cycles have gotten more shallow, and each wave will be higher than the last. I see more discipline by OEMs and producers on this side of the cycle, so it may be more drawn out and more stable as things move up - which is good for reducing volatility and increasing visibility.EnerTuition: As far as the whole sector is concerned, we are still at the bottom of the cycle in terms of prospects. The valuations already discount strong up tick in the sector and healthy growth for individual companies. Outside of select segments, it is not clear that the view is justified. We see signs of growth but no signs of strong widespread uptick in 2020.From Growth to Value: The fact that Uber, Lyft and WeWork fell from their pedestals is very healthy for the markets. It separates companies that are profitable or have a path to profitability from the windmakers that just trade on sentiment. These companies put on a tech cloak but they are really just in commodity businesses, where pricing power is close to zero: taxis and real estate. The fact that investors saw through the fog these companies created, makes me feel optimistic about the market as a good judge between substance and talk.Damon Verial: Right now, tech stocks show a huge split in winners/losers. The upward momentum in the Nasdaq is mostly due to the winners outpacing the losers. As for unicorns, tech IPOs usually underperform. For long positions, stick with older companies that are producing new tech instead of hopping on the bandwagon with whatever is trendy at the moment. For example, I’ve been shorting the newly listed Slack (WORK), personally, as I do not believe it will outcompete the better-funded, more-experienced Microsoft (MSFT), with its equivalent, Teams.Integrator: I really focus on technology businesses with strong competitive advantages that are profitable, or have a path to profitability, so this is less relevant to me. I don't know if this has major impacts on the sector over all, but what it will do is make investors more discerning. Quality will continue to do well, and speculative business models will get punished. A flow on effect may be to pull down valuations of some of the earlier stage tech businesses coming to market. You are already seeing a retracement in valuations in the unlisted, venture capital space. Really high-quality tech with strong earnings and reasonable valuations will continue to do well.Andres Cardenal: I think investors are smart enough to differentiate between companies with solid fundamentals versus the over-hyped IPOs, so this is not much of a risk for the strong companies in the technology sector. But I still watch the more speculative stocks in the sector only to assess risk appetite levels and to monitor bubble risk.Elazar Advisors, LLC: I was around in the dot.com bubble. I'm earnings focused so I just ignore these distractions until I have some inkling of EPS. Ultimately a stock without earnings is a hot potato.Julian Lin: Poor IPO performance, ironically, indicates a sense of rationality in the markets. At this point, however, investors may actually wish to ask - is the IPO bloodbath overdone? Are there any buying opportunities in the former bubble party?Rick Pendergraft: I think it has a minor reflection on the industry, but almost everything I write about or recommend has been around for a number of years. The analysis tools that I prefer to use aren't really suitable to stocks that haven't been around for at least a few years.Cestrian Capital Research: The collapse of unicorn hubris is a wonderful thing for investors. It will lead to more appealing IPO valuations and more sustainable value growth post-IPO. Less catastrophic but no less meaningful that the dot com collapse. Unicorns were borne of Internet 2.0. They will pass more quietly than the casualties of Internet 1.0 but will be no more mourned.Mark Hibben: I've had no interest or holdings in these types of companies. They don't matter to my portfolio at all. These companies are grossly overvalued, in my opinion.Joe Albano: I see Uber and Lyft as having other issues coming to IPO. Other than any already bloated valuation, there were headwinds with legislation and classification of drivers. It was just a not so great time to have IPO'd with those things on the radar. For the overall tech sector, it's not impactful. For every Lyft there was a Zoom. We just hear about the ""big ones"" and the rest are forgotten or never publicized extensively. The ones with good leadership and a solid product are the ones I follow closely. Zoom is an example of that as it has come down from the IPO high (pun intended). There's going to be winners in the group of the IPOs, research and patience will lead you to the right investment with them.EnerTuition: We have advocated a short in Uber and Lyft with 70% to 80% valuation correction. Most of this has played out in 2019. Given the massive overvaluations, we see correction continuing in 2020 but likely less so given the ZIRP/NIRP dynamics.From Growth to Value: There are several aspects of regulation that make me enthusiastic as an investor. First, I think that the big tech companies are even worth more if they would be split up. The sum of the parts at Amazon (AMZN) or Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is bigger than the total. If there is a restraint on advertising power, The Trade Desk (TTD), one of the Potential Multibaggers, might benefit a lot, because it is the biggest player outside of the walled garden players like Facebook (FB) and Google.Damon Verial: Ignore the news. Focus on the products. Focus on earnings. For example, Facebook is not going to hurt in the long-run from any government pressure on what ads the company can run. Digital marketing is a rapidly growing field, and any rapidly growing field will be the talking point for politicians, who are usually just speaking for the sake of holding onto their own positions. Every company with online presence wants to advertise with Facebook, and, like with YouTube’s changes to its advertisement policies over the years, policy changes to Facebook won’t dent demand for such services.Integrator: I have some meaningful interest in large tech such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, so I'm watching developments closely. Forced divestment of acquired properties would be the most concerning to me, particularly with Facebook and Google, and would undermine their ability to provide the broad user cohort for advertisers at scale that makes them valuable franchises. I don't think this is a realistic outcome though. More likely is a more extensive disclosure regime with opt in/out notices for consumers. I don't see this having meaningful impacts on as users have generally become immune to this. Also likely is a wave of political FTC/DOJ investigations, requiring settlement, which are more a distraction rather than meaningful threat.Andres Cardenal: Chances are that the stock market is overreacting to regulatory risk. The big tech players will need to provide more guarantees in terms of data protection and antitrust compliance, but this will not impair their ability to continue producing growing sales and cash flows for shareholders. If economic history is any valid guide, regulatory uncertainty could be a source of opportunity as much as a risk factor for the sector.Elazar Advisors, LLC: You're right. This is going to be an annoyance for Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and maybe Apple. It can probably help these stocks underperform. Big government can't be good for free trade and capital returns.Julian Lin: Regulation is inevitable, but Wall Street has overestimated the potential effects on fundamentals. Facebook is trading around 24 times trailing earnings with a net cash balance sheet and 25% revenue growth. If FB was trading 50% higher then its fundamentals would still support such a stock price - the fact that shares have traded at a deeply discounted valuation for several years indicates very clearly the negative sentiment seen at mega-cap tech names. In the meantime, mega-cap tech firms continue to buy back shares at a voracious pace.Rick Pendergraft: This is certainly a talking point on the campaign trail, especially with Democratic candidates, and I do think investors need to keep an eye on certain companies. Obviously companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google are big targets and some politicians would love to make a name for themselves for helping take the monopolies down. I can definitely see more regulation toward big tech going forward, but I don't think there is enough support for major changes. One thing that could impact such regulation is whether we continue to see the strong numbers in the labor market. If the jobs numbers start to fall at all, heavier regulations on major job providers will lose their appeal very quickly.Cestrian Capital Research: We assume Amazon will be at risk, Google less so, Facebook not so much and Microsoft not at all.Mark Hibben: Much of the regulatory attention has been focused on social media companies such as Facebook (FB) for a variety of reasons. Social media appears to be easily manipulated by various malefactors spouting fake news. There are issues of competition and how the media platforms govern access. With companies like Apple, there's always going to be concern about competition, just because the company is so big. Apple has shown that it can be stupid about competition as in the e-book price fixing case. Now the main issue before Apple is the way it regulates the iOS app store and the percentage it takes from App sales (30%). Apple will probably face some regulatory push back on the app store and could see itself forced to open up iOS to apps delivered from outside the store. This would amount to legitimizing “jail breaking.” I think Apple will be able to weather whatever happens by way of regulation.Joe Albano: If anyone expects Congress to do anything other than grandstanding and smacking CEOs around, they haven't been watching C-SPAN. Now, if they were to get serious about it, exactly how would the incumbents be hurt? The only way is through telling them and forcing them not to do things with their products. Take the supposed FTC injunction reported to come against Facebook. Meddling first hand in a company's business would be the only way. But I doubt it passes judiciary muster. The market sunk FB stock on that news but has since recovered above where it was prior. Facebook has continued to bring in cash in increasing amounts throughout all of this grandstanding. This issue only slows it down temporarily but doesn't stop the cash machine. Just remember it's about image, not about justice. Equifax (EFX) still exists today.EnerTuition: This is not a threat that we play special attention to. However, of the names that we watch, Uber and Lyft have significantly more regulatory risk than others.From Growth to Value: The integration of tech and health is only starting but will probably be more talked about next year. There are a few interesting companies that try to be the first in their markets and also big tech is moving more and more into health. Apple has the lead in big tech now but if Alphabet integrates Fitbit (FIT) fluently into its ecosystem, it could catch up very quickly.Damon Verial: I don’t think Apple suing NuVia’s CEO will be a mere blip on the radar. I believe Apple will be switching to ARM-based chips for its higher-end laptops and desktops quite soon – which itself should be big news in 2020 – and the timing for the lawsuit coincides with NuVia hiring Jon Masters, the main architect for ARM for Red Hat/International Business Machines (IBM). With Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) both putting ARM development on the backburner, it would be quite a market shake-up for NuVia to go public and pose a public threat to Intel (INTC). We could also see a large movement in Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY), which is the designer of the ARM architecture.Integrator: The role of the Internet of Things in driving digital intelligence and predictive analytics which will power a wave of digital transformation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is certainly hitting hype cycle levels, but IoT's role in powering the wave of data that makes AI really impactful is very underappreciated, because enterprises are still figuring out what IoT means to them and how to deploy it. I think 2020 is the year where this becomes a more prevalent area of focus, and the businesses that are leveraged to this start to become noticed.Andres Cardenal: Artificial intelligence in combination with big data. We are still in the initial stages of this major game changer, and we are not even imagining the possibilities that this technological revolution will produce over the long term. Investing in companies with top AI capabilities and access to strategic and financial resources can produce outstanding gains over the long term. Alphabet is a top name in this area.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Let's talk about Splunk (SPLK) and the data boom. This is a wow story for me. Revenue growth is accelerating. Cash flow is going to triple in three years. Oh and they have EPS which I love. What's crazy about this story is that recurring revenue growth is running 50% vs. their reported revenues running 30%. There's not much reason why their overall growth rate doesn't accelerate those extra 2000 basis points. That doesn't make you giggle? It did me. I like a stock when it makes me giggle.Julian Lin: It's unfortunate, but I think the narrative in tech will remain very similar to now - people will still complain about ""egregious"" price to sales multiples and a lack of profits. It may take a generational shift of investment thinking to change such a narrative.Robert Castellano: 5GRick Pendergraft: I go back to the software industry. My investment theory has always been that the fundamentals tell us what to buy and then the sentiment and technical analysis tell us when to buy it. Right now there a number of software stocks with really strong fundamentals and now it is just a matter of trying to time the entries. Instead of lagging the tech sector, like it did in 2019, I see software leading the tech sector in 2020.Cestrian Capital Research: The Trade Desk. It's a stock which is a favorite of tech folk like ourselves, but still relatively unknown amongst normal people - despite being an $11bn EV stock.Mark Hibben: Probably the arrival of Apple's augmented reality glasses, or “smart glasses.” These will be fairly inconspicuous and resemble normal sun glasses. These will be tethered wirelessly to iPhone and provide an ultra high definition display for iPhone as well as for augmented reality content that is superimposed on the real world. The glasses will also provide a way to control iPhone using voice and hand gestures. Smart glasses will be a boost to the wearables segment for Apple, but sell in small quantities initially do to their high price. Numerous pundits will criticize them as over-priced, non-essential toys.EnerTuition: AMDFrom Growth to Value: As a long-term investor, I think that most of my Potential Multibagger stocks are still great picks, but especially The Trade Desk and Square. They are both in industries at the start of a big secular trend and they are sometimes misunderstood. For Square, investors don't realize the huge potential of Cash App yet. It's only three years old, but it is already the biggest contributor to Square's revenue, bigger than the legacy point -of -sale technology. For The Trade Desk, investors don't understand enough that CTV and audio (podcast) commercials are still in their infancy and both grow by triple digits YoY.Damon Verial: With stocks nearing all-time highs, many have asked me whether to ditch stocks for bonds in 2020. The current state of the market shows that the probability favors the bulls, while the risk-reward favors the bears. In this regard, if you’re looking for both safety and income, the dividends offered in many industries, such as consumer discretionary, outperform the expected gains from bonds. Look for low-volatility, mid-cap stocks with solid dividend histories. Take a look at the ProShares S&P Midcap 400 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (REGL) or Vanguard Consumer Discretionary Index Fund ETF (VCR) for suitable alternatives to bonds.Integrator: Mastercard (MA). I've held this name for quite a long time, but the story and prospects just keep getting better. The part of the story that is known is that this business is a powerful cash generator with exceptional barriers to entry and strong returns on invested capital that is chasing the 85% of the consumer payments expenditure market that is still dominated by cash or cheque. That's a powerful secular growth story right there.What isn't as well appreciated is that the business will be a dominant player in B2B payments in 2-3 years time, through leveraging existing assets and relationships, with an addressable market that is 2-3x the size of its current core consumer payments market. Given the dynamics of this market, I see Mastercard and Visa sharing the spoils in this space over the long haul.I like to buy and hold and compound my capital over a decade long time frame or more, so I don't just see this as just a play for 2020, but one that can be held for a multi year time frame. I expect 2020 will see the company make more significant inroads into the space and that the stock will be rewarded accordingly.Andres Cardenal: The Trade Desk. The company is a market leader in programmatic advertising and it’s benefiting from massive opportunities due to the connected TV revolution and growing demand for online music and podcasting in the years ahead.Customer retention rates are above 95%, and revenue increased 38% last quarter. The company is aggressively investing for growth, but it's already producing positive earnings and cash flows.The Trade Desk has built key alliances with leading players like Amazon (AMZN) and Disney (DIS), so the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on exponential growth opportunities in 2020 and beyond.Bull & Bear Trading: We are proud of our 8-for-8 published and documented track record of trading calls on Snap, Inc. (SNAP). We were long the momentum on Snap's IPO day in March 2017. We sold short at $28 on day 3 after the IPO. And we covered our short and went long in January 2019 at $5 per share, pretty much nailing the inflection point at the bottom of the chart.We covered our short and went long Snap when sentiment was extremely negative, a good indicator of an oversold stock. During interaction in the comments section of a Seeking Alpha article on Snap, another SA contributor guided us to a very significant item of research. It was a brief Digiday article (yeah, rather obscure but that's the point here!) discussing Snap's low-end marketplace strategy just beginning to show first signs of gaining traction. In this case it was another SA contributor that deserves the credit for uncovering this golden research who contributes to SA as True North Alger. We covered our short and established a long position.This social media alternative to Facebook has successfully implemented a low-end of market strategy that has increased their market share among advertisers. 2020 may see the company begin to expand their margins and revenues by increasing prices and gaining a larger portion of ad-spend budgets. Facebook's current challenges are well documented and the threat of anti-trust regulation against tech giants has given Snap an opportunity. Newer, more experienced management has been rescuing Snap's business model methodically for the last 18 months. 2020 may be the time for Snap to begin trading at a premium in this bull market as the company's turnaround justifies the positive sentiment that has been replacing the overly bearish sentiment of the past. Snap has transitioned from the company that Wall Street loved to hate into what may become one of the best turnaround stories in social media since Twitter's (TWTR) financial engineering to boost its own stock price. However, Snap's turnaround may prove to be more legitimately based upon actual revenue growth and the taking of market share in social media than Twitter's turnaround. This revenue growth by Snap in a growth industry is the stuff that often rewards stocks with a very aggressive premium. We anticipate all-time new highs above the $29 per share mark in 2020 for this stock currently trading at about $15.00.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Tesla (TSLA). Way too many bears and volumes and margins are about to launch.Julian Lin: Simon Property Group (SPG) is my repeat favorite idea for 2020. SPG is a real estate landlord of high quality ""Class A"" mall properties. The stock has returned -40% since 2016 vs. +40% for the S&P 500. The fundamentals however remain strong, with the company guiding for 2% comparable cash flow growth in spite of numerous retail bankruptcies. High quality malls have had no trouble finding replacement tenants for store closures, but the high concentration of store closures has made the struggles appear secular rather than cyclical. SPG has a strong balance sheet with an A-credit rating and capacity to take on more leverage. SPG pays a 5.8% dividend and is generating enough free cash flow to fund the dividend, $1 billion to $1.5 billion in anchor redevelopment projects, and buy back stock. There is blood in the streets of malls, and SPG is best of breed.Rick Pendergraft: Looking at the list of stocks that currently meet my fundamental requirements, the two sectors that are most represented are tech and financials. Within those sectors, the software industry in particular is heavily represented so I can see software being attractive this year. In the financial sector, banks are well represented on my list of stocks to watch.Cestrian Capital Research: US space and defense stocks, particularly Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Defense spending is rising and the newly-real Space Force will bring with it the arming of space. NOC and LMT are best placed to take advantage of that trend in our view. A more volatile but equally profit-capable stock riding the same wave is Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD).Mark Hibben: The recession of 2008 and the recovery of the tech sector this past year show how durable technology companies can be in the face of an economic downturn. This is the sector to buy into during the downturn to come. It's important to be selective and focus on quality companies with real technical advantages and good bottom lines. The story for the next few years will be what companies survive and prosper during the downturn compared to what companies do not. I will tend to avoid companies that have racked up large losses during the good times. Uber comes to mind.I think the “platform” companies will ride out any recession just fine. These include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. These companies combine hardware and software into integrated products, and have extended hardware development to the silicon level.Joe Albano: Anything semiconductor. With trade headwinds easing and inventories in the OEM supply chain normalized after a huge build up, 2020 will be setting itself up for anything with a bit or a byte in it.

4312932,104703,2019-12-17T12:28:11-05:00,"Snap shares have declined from the $17-$18 level into the $13-$15 area. In my opinion, it is finally time to buy Snap.The Q3 print and guidance were both solid. In my opinion, it was shocking that the stock fell after the results were announced.DAUs are increasing, revenue growth is accelerating, gross margins are expanding, and Snap is differentiating itself from the competition at least from a features standpoint.Snap does not lack risk however. The biggest problem is likely the valuation, as the stock sits at 11.9X 2019 revenues, much higher than some of the other companies in the social media space.Rating upgraded from HOLD to BUY, PT raised from $19.50 to $22.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) delivered a solid Q3 print, with a solid Q4 guidance across the board. The management team is quickly debunking the bear thesis surrounding profitability, user growth, and competition. So, what were the actual results we are looking at?As you can see, Snap beat on everything except their Q4 revenue guidance. But even then, Snap's ""miss"" on revenue guidance is not even that bad. If anything, this guide might even be a beat. Over the last several quarters, a trend is emerging in Snap's guidance, where the company is surprising their revenue guidance beyond the high-end of the guided range. Basically, they guide conservatively, extremely conservatively. This might explain why after Snap delivered its quarterly report, analysts upped their Q4 revenue estimate to $562.5 million, above the top-end of the range. So the ""miss"" on revenue guidance that caused the stock's next-day decline wasn't really a miss. I believe that mentality has been reflected in the recent price action, as the stock is actually above where it was heading into the print.As the guidance pointed out, Snap is projecting 214-215 million DAUs, an increase of 4-5 million users on the platform. The important thing is, the iOS heavy Europe and U.S. ecosystems remain strong, and steadily growing ecosystems, while the Android revamp is working to grow the ecosystem in emerging markets. This is what has allowed for accelerating user numbers and should continue to enable improvements in the business heading into the fourth quarter.In addition, the company continues to make improvements in monetization, especially as the most advertiser-friendly feature, Discover, is receiving more and more user attention. This may be because in order to view your friends' stories, you have to be in the Discover tab. This means users are more likely to interact with Discover and advertisements within the Discover bar.Most importantly however, Snap needs to keep up solid growth in their predominantly iOS markets, Europe and America, while their Android business takes off.The biggest point Snap made with its Q4 report was this question: What competition? Back when the stock was in the single-digits, the focus was on the negative impacts of Instagram's dominance of the social media space. Since then, Snap has seen an acceleration in DAU growth since these concerns were brought about. Meanwhile, Snap has the fastest growth rate of all major internet advertising companies in terms of raw revenue growth rate. In addition, Snap has made solid progress in fending off competition from TikTok. As a matter of fact, Snap has differentiated itself as a platform from the other social media platforms. From what I understand, the Snapchat platform is a mostly communication based platform, whereas Instagram is utilized more for showing what is going on in your life. Snap continues to differentiate itself in another key social aspect: there is no ""liking"" system, which helps alleviate social anxiety that many people are facing at the behest of social media.Snap has quite a few good things going for it when it comes to growing the business long term.The first part of the bull case longer term is Snap's presence in the augmented reality market. Part of the lucrative nature of Snapchat's platform is the AR aspect of the platform. AR not only offers a unique user experience, it offers a unique advertising experience. Augmented reality allows users to experience a reality that is augmented by software. Basically, you can experience a different version of reality in AR. This is opposed to virtual reality, where the entire reality is virtual, rather than AR's ""software + real-world"" feel. For advertisers, augmented reality offers a truly unique advertising experience. As opposed to banner ads or regular images, AR ads are immersive, and are more likely to evoke emotion from the consumers seeing these ads. Snap is well positioned in the augmented reality arena, already offering sponsored advertiser lenses and other AR advertising features.The second long-term growth tailwind of Snap's business is the expanding internet advertising market size. Overall internet advertising is expected to total $311 billion in 2019. These revenues are expected to continue scaling to $517.62 billion by the year 2023, growing at a CAGR of ~10.7%. However, within the internet advertising pie, social media advertising, the market Snap operates in, is the second largest market.(source: Statista)As the graph above shows, social media advertising is expected to become the largest internet advertising market by 2023. As of now, in 2019, the market is sized at $93 billion. The market is anticipated to grow to a $218 billion market size by 2023. On consensus revenue estimates of $1.72 billion for this year, Snap has a mere ~1.8% of the market. I must stress this is the social media market, not the overall internet advertising market. As Snap invests in expanding augmented reality, and their target demographic (Gen-Z) becomes more attractive to advertisers, it is more likely to gain advertising market share. Think about it like this: With all the other social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter), is there a chance Snap gets to 5-10% of the total market? At 5% market share, in 2023, Snap sees revenues of $10.9 billion. This is assuming a continuation in the growth of the overall market at the pace that is currently anticipated. With the numerous growth vectors in this market, I believe the kind of growth trajectory outlined here is quite likely. This expanding market is what excites me most about Snap going forward long term.These next three points are strategic points that will enable Snap to gain share in this expanding market. The first strategic advantage Snap has is the company's niche market access. The company's access to a younger, more difficult to retain demographic of users gives it a unique competitive advantage in the minds of advertisers. While the belief that Instagram and Snapchat have the same users (at least in terms of age), Instagram is getting older, targeting a more millennial demographic. Meanwhile, Snapchat's userbase remains decently young, targeting a more Generation-Z userbase. Instagram is slowly aging, and while to an extent Snapchat is too (that was the point of the redesign, attracting older users), the core is still Gen-Z. This younger demographic of users is likely a differentiating factor for advertisers going forward.The next part of Snap's long-term strategy is the company's focus on its extremely important ""Stories"" feature. This feature, while not necessarily proprietary to Snapchat itself, is not only a heavily used feature, but also a long-term tool for advertisers who want to lock in Snapchat's younger userbase. Basically, stories allows users to make a post that lasts 24 hours, then disappears, only available to the friends/followers of the user. The incorporation of this feature in advertisements is unique to mostly Snapchat and Instagram, as the stories feature is mostly used in these two platforms. Stories, while not unique to the Snapchat platform exclusively, is definitely a long-term tailwind to Snap's revenue growth and advertising expansion.The final part of Snap's strategic advantage is the company's focus on augmented reality ""filters"". These filters, while I briefly mentioned them when talking about augmented reality, could have enormous upside for advertisers. Snapchat has already begun experimenting with advertisement based filters over the last couple of years.(source)These filters offer a more interactive way to distribute advertisements. These advertisements are less invasive as compared to video/banner advertisements that are more intrusive. This enables a more interactive experience with the ad, building engagement and encouraging higher advertiser demand.There are three approaches I am taking to valuing Snap. The first approach I am taking to valuing Snap is relative valuation on a sales growth basis. I am comparing Snap's revenue growth rate to other names in the social media space.Snap is expected to do $1.72 billion in 2019 revenue, growing 35.4% into next year. Applying this same 0.302X PSG to Snap's valuation, we get ~10.7X sales. On $1.72 billion in revenue, this brings us to a valuation of ~$13.50/share, a slight decline from the current share price. However, I would like to take into consideration other two types of valuations before setting a price target.Under the assumption that the social media advertising market does scale to $218 billion in annual revenues by 2023, and assuming Snap moves from 1.8% share to a more realistic ~5%, the company sees revenues of $10.9 billion. By that point however, Snap's growth should be decelerating, so a less rich P/S valuation is warranted. On $10.9 billion in revenues, a 6X revenue multiple should deliver a value of ~$65.4 billion. Discounted back 13% per year, back to 2020, the company should be worth $37.467 billion. On 1.354 billion shares outstanding, this yields a share price of ~$28/share.The valuation that I am using to determine my price target on Snap however, is a discounted cash flow model.The price target I have on Snap right now is based around my discounted cash flow model for the business going forward. This DCF goes out until the year 2028. Let's start with the discount rate of my discounted cash flow model.My discount rate is WACC, weighted average cost of capital. Let's take the first component of WACC, the cost of equity, derived using the CAPM formula. The first calculation is for the beta. To calculate the beta, I took the average of one, two, and three year unlevered and levered betas. This beta comes out at 1.3. The risk free rate, the yield on the ten-year bond, currently sits at 1.767%. The equity risk premium sits at 509 basis points. This brings us to a total cost of equity of:Here is my overall WACC calculation. The cost of debt figure is a rough estimate, considering that there are no publicly traded Snap bonds to base a yield off of.Now, let's move on to my estimates for the overall business from now on to 2028.My Capex estimates have been scaled back pretty dramatically as Snap has proven that they can lower Capex over the last few quarters. Here is my final valuation of Snap shares.This PT takes into consideration a 1.4 billion share count and a terminal growth rate of 3%, a slight premium to inflation. All things considered, this is my base case price target.Now I am going to break out my projections for Snap's fourth and final quarter of 2019. First let's start by looking at the guidance Snap delivered for the fourth quarter.Going off of this, let's make some rough estimates for what Snap is guiding with regards to ARPU. Taking the low end of the guided revenue range, and dividing it by the low end of the DAU range, we get a low end ARPU estimate of $2.52/DAU. If we do the same thing with the high end of the guided ranges, we get an ARPU of $2.60/DAU. So, Snap is guiding for around 20-24% Y/Y ARPU growth. This a measured deceleration in ARPU growth, from 33% in Q3. However, from Q2 to Q3, ARPU growth decelerated from 36% to 33%, so it wouldn't surprise me too much if Snap reports another deceleration. But a deceleration of this magnitude is surprising. Let's look back to Q4 of last year. From Q3 to Q4 of last year, Snap reported an overall sequential ARPU growth rate of ~30%. This guidance reflects a sequential growth rate of 19-23%, a stark deceleration from last year's sequential growth rate. My anticipation is that while ARPU growth will decelerate on a Y/Y basis, management continues to sandbag, and ARPU growth comes in closer to 28% on a Y/Y basis. This brings me to a Q4 ARPU estimate of $2.67/DAU.Now let's move on to my estimates for DAUs, revenue, and gross margins.Snap guided for Q4 DAUs of 214-215M, up from 210M in Q3, and up from 203M in Q2. As you can see, Snap is guiding for a deceleration in sequential user ads heading into the fourth quarter. This is the first time Snap has released DAU guidance, and I believe that while they traditionally sandbag on their guidance, they will come closer to the 214M area of the range. Of this four million user increase, I am expecting a million to come from North America, and three million to come from the rest-of-world segment. Europe should remain about flat sequentially.Revenues should come in at $571.4 million, above the $540-$560 million guided by management. I get this figure by multiplying the ARPU by the DAU estimate. This contrasts to the average Wall Street estimate of $562.5 million, a decent beat.Moving on to gross margins, I am expecting about a 7% sequential expansion in margins. In Q3, Snap saw infrastructure expenses of $146 million. On a per DAU basis, infrastructure expenses were $0.69/DAU, down from $0.75/DAU in the year ago period. In Q4 of last year, Snap saw $0.72/user. My expectation for this quarter is that Snap sees a slight sequential decline in infrastructure costs per DAU to around $0.68/DAU. On 214 million users, this entails $145.5 million in infrastructure costs, roughly in-line with the previous quarter's expenses.Now let's look at Snap's next portion of gross expenses, the revenue sharing expenses. In the most recent quarter, Snap saw revenue sharing expenses of $45 million, up from $26 million in the year-ago period. In Q4 of last year, Snap saw an expansion in revenue sharing costs from $26 million to $39 million, a 50% increase on a sequential basis. Under the assumption that this happens again to Snap in this Q4, I would anticipate $67.5 million in revenue sharing costs. Q4 is seasonally higher for revenue sharing anyway.The last part of Snap's gross expenses is the ""other"" expenses. These expense have stayed in the $24-$28 million range in the last six quarters. I would anticipate these expenses to stay at around their Q3 level of $26 million, in the fourth quarter.This brings me to an overall gross expense figure of $239 million, up 18% from the year-ago period. This brings me to an overall gross margin of 58.2%, up 720 basis points on a sequential basis.Finally, let's look at my expectations for Snap's Q4 operating expenses. Overall, my expectation is for sequential growth in Snap's operating expenses from Q3 to Q4. Last year, Snap was undergoing a cost restructuring that they are now working out of. That is why we saw a sequential decline in opex from Q3 of last year to Q4. This year should be a different story however, as Snap is invested in sustaining its current growth. I am projecting $96 million in R&D, $105 million in S&M (sales and marketing), and G&A of $86 million. Overall operating expenses should work out to $287 million.So, Snap should see an overall operating margin of ~8% in the quarter, if things play out the way I believe they will. On Snap's 1.4 billion shares, $45 million in operating income works out to ~$0.03/share in earnings. This is tied with the current high estimate for Snap's Q4 earnings number. Factoring in operating income adjustments of ~$30 million, and capex of $8 million, Snap should be slightly cash flow positive this quarter too.The biggest risk to the Snap bull thesis is likely regulation. This regulation is not as much of Snapchat specifically, as much as it is regulation of the overall internet advertising industry. The reason internet advertising is so much more relevant to advertisers, is the use of data and the high amounts of user data these platforms have. If regulators clamp down on the utilization of user data in targeting ads, the expansion of the market will be constrained, making Snap's growth profile less attractive.I am upgrading Snap from a hold to a buy on the premise of re-accelerating user growth, solid monetization expansion, a not-so exuberant valuation and a more prudent direction that management is leading the company in. Snap is a buy."
4308596,105304,2019-11-22T12:24:22-05:00,Snap's 3rd quarter results continued momentum from Q2 in user and revenue growth.Margins are improving and the company is moving toward profitability.Eventual annual profitability could be a catalyst for further share price gains.Snap remains a close watch going into 2020.,"Snap's (SNAP) 3rd quarter results beat expectations slightly, telling a similar story to Q2. The company is approaching profitability on steady user growth and significant revenue growth. Annual profitability could be a substantial catalyst for a climb in Snap's share price, but is also many quarters, and perhaps years, away yet. Snap chat remains a close watch going into 2020.The third quarter of 2019 saw a steady increase in users for Snap once again. A trend that continues from Q2. Globally, users increased by 13%. Momentum outside Europe and North America remains strong with 28% growth in DAUs, while Europe and North America posted respectable 6% and 9% gains year over year.Source: Snap Inc Q3 2019 Earnings SlidesQuarter over quarter global users grew 3.5%. Not spectacular, but also not disastrous like in Q3 of 2018, where users actually decreased quarter over quarter. The company has gotten over what now appears to be a temporary user growth headwind last year. 210 million users globally certainly leaves more room for growth as well.Revenue growth in the third quarter came to 50% year over year. Costs appear to be well managed compared to previous years, as the fastest-growing expense, sales and marketing, grew just 26%. Put simply, revenue is essentially growing twice as fast as the fastest-growing expense. Snapchat is scaling well and illustrating the company's operating leverage this quarter. If you've read some of my other articles, you'll know I like companies moving from unprofitable to profitable with increasing margins. It's one of my favourite catalysts for share price gains. While Snap isn't quite at profitability yet, management is expecting to be very close in Q4.Source: Snap 3rd Quarter 2019 10-QQ4 is seasonally the strongest quarter for social media and internet advertising companies. This is the time of year when advertisers spend the most on ads. Snapchat is no exception. The seasonal boost in revenue could bring the company near breakeven or even slightly profitable in the fourth quarter. Management guided for adjusted EBITDA of breakeven to +$20M, compared to -$50M in Q4 2018. If they can achieve this, the company is clearly heading in the right direction.YChartsSnap currently trades near $15, well below the 52 week high set back in July of $18.36 per share, but the huge year to date rally remains intact. A pullback was probably due in the stock after such a run. It remains to be seen what happens to the stock in the short term going forward.YChartsAs for valuation, Snap remains at elevated levels relative to its peers. A higher TTM sales multiple is justified given Snap has higher revenue growth than it's peers, although Pinterest (PINS) is close as far as revenue growth rates go. 13.5 times trailing twelve month sales is not cheap. I'd like to see a multiple closer to 10-12 before considering a position. I believe it is still early for Snapchat investors as the company remains speculative still posting losses at this point, but Snap is also undeniably making progress that shouldn't be ignored.Snap is still a ways from being profitable on an annual basis. It looks unlikely they will achieve positive EPS in 2020, and perhaps not even in 2021. That said, I continue to believe they will reach profitability over the next few years at some point. High growth companies moving from losses to profitability always have me taking a closer look. While I don't think Snap is a buy yet for most investors, they're certainly on the right track and the company is a close watch in 2020."

Joe, welcome to the podcast.Joe Albano: Nathaniel thanks for having me.NB: Thanks for coming on. It’s good to have you. Why don’t we start off and you tell us a little bit about your investing strategy?JA: Sure. It’s kind of a hybrid of a few things. So, my background is not professional. I’ve learned a lot of what I know from my father and my uncle and from there I just start researching and reading a lot of other people’s opinions and thoughts on the market and stock and how to value them. The reason why I mostly move towards Tech is because that’s where my education, my background, my carrier, and really my passion is, is for technology. And so, I decided, I know a lot of the backend stuff, how the business is produced the technology products or software or hardware or whatever the case maybe and I said, okay well maybe I can equate that from what I have learned and researched from the stock market side of it, you know how to value stocks, how to see where they are going and combine those two things together.So, it’s an unprofessional background with a professional technology background as far as the stocks go as unprofessional, but beyond that, I have moved towards using two methods primarily to look at stocks and the first is fundamental. Okay, so we have the product. How is the product doing? Is it a retail product? Is it a software product? Is it a product for other consumers or is it a product for other businesses? And, I’ve combined that with technical chart analysis because I can find a company that I want to buy, or I think I should sell. And the fundamentals are telling me it’s going well or it’s going downhill, but it may not be the right time to execute the actual trade.That’s when I go to the chart and I look at the chart and say, okay, it’s in free fall, so maybe I should hold off on buying or it’s still in an uptrend, so maybe I should hold off on selling, until I start seeing it peak and put the sell order in there. So, it kind of helps you bring together two different facets of methodology that a lot of people may not agree with in the sense of fundamentals may not matter or in the sense that technical chart analysis is a bunch of Voodoo. So, to me, it kind of brings them together and says, okay, we could take a little bit from both sides and we can formulate something that kind of creates a full picture and not ignore one of the other.So, that’s really how I look at it and that’s how I give my information to my subscribers to Tech Cache and that’s how we have conversations. So, they’ll say, hey this is a good one, what do you think about it. Okay, I like the company, I like what it is doing, but I don’t like where the chart is at right now. It’s kind of shown me some doomsday stuff coming up. So, maybe we will hold-of, maybe wait for another catalyst, but I do like where they are going, I like the balance sheet, I like the company, I like the revenue growth, whatever the case maybe, but I don’t think right now is the time to buy it. Let’s hold off until we see some signals on the chart that kind of tell us the momentum is turning around. So…NB: You mentioned that you don’t have a conventional background in stock analysis and investing analysis, which of course makes the question what you were doing before you started on Seeking Alpha five years ago?JA: Yes, that’s a good question. So, what I was going before was reading and a lot of reading. And a lot of it started with Seeking Alpha. I didn't start writing for Seeking Alpha as soon as I joined the say and signed up. I did a lot of reading, probably two or three worth of just taking in information and seeing how authors and contributors how their ratings have played out, how their fundamentals, how they analyze all their tools and methods, how it played out, and I was able to kind of get a glimpse of who’s worth following and who’s not worth following, and believe me I understand that feeling from the other side now when people give you some constructive criticism, and say I don't like this, I don't like, hey do this you are wrong in this, so, believe me to my fellow contributors, I totally understand how that feels and know what it means from the other side from the leadership side.So, yes it’s – it was a lot of reading, a lot of research, a lot of my technology passion came from myself education of, hey how does chips work and how does software work and how do the two work together, and that’s what drove me to go to college and get a degree in computer an elected electrical engineering. And it really was just hey, I like this, I want to dive into it and do a lot of teaching or teaching myself, and that’s really my personality in the sense, I'm a musician as well, and I taught myself how to play drums and really haven't taken any lessons and have become professional at it just by learning the correct ways to do it and practicing those correct ways correctly, and the same thing happens with the stock and the technology side of it for me. So…NB: Cool. I’m curious how did you come about investing and how did you find yourself into this world from the world of tech and music?JA: Yes. That’s really interesting. I feel like the root of it and where it comes back to as a foundation that my father and my uncle gave me and instead of getting the typical presents as a kind, I was getting stock certificates, and I’d open up a box and it would be like what’s this piece of paper for? And he explained to me. Hey, you own this company now and you share in the profits, especially if that company gave off a dividend and that’s a lot of where the backbone of it came from. And so, I was like, Oh, this is kind of intriguing, how can I own a piece of that building in New York City that the headquarters is at? And it kind of blew my mind as a pre-teen and a teenager of how that was possible and how the stock market worked in general.So, I started watching MSNBC or CNBC and watching shows and trying to understand how the market moves, why does the market moves, what earnings means, and how the basic fundamentals and everything that we know today on a daily basis by going to Seeking Alpha what news breaks would earnings are coming? I just learned that from being interested in it and being passionate for it and wanting to know more and being driven to know more of that. So, I have to thank my father and my uncle for that because they were the life blood that kind of generated that interest in that passion and kind of to just drove me to, hey I can make money with my own money, that’s kind of cool, how can I do that and how can I do it more proficiently?NB: Yes. Certainly, something that a lot of people are trying to understand. Especially, nowadays. So, you have been doing this for a little while, five years, and interesting markets over the last five years, what have you learned, what’s one key lesson that you’ve learned in your investing over this period?JA: It’s sometimes I think is to stick with what you are convicted of, and if that’s hey, the stock doesn’t seem to be working out, then drop it. Don't question it, don't doubt what you’ve already researched and pulled in, and I had to kind of learn that the hard way of like, hey I had a conviction that I should buy the stock or I should sell the stock and it turns out usually that first intuition was correct, and going back and over analyzing it can be a problem. So, I’ve learned that don't overall analyze it. Look at it for what it is, try to make sure you're not missing anything and execute on what you've learned.NB: Cool. And this year, I certainly have been interesting in that respect, markets has been whipsawed a couple of different times.JA: Absolutely.NB: A lot of it by the things that certainly nobody could have really anticipated at the time, that we are certainly looking in the background referring here to tariffs and trade wars and such that like that. Is there something new that you've learned in markets over the past year?JA: Something new is, I guess it’s a reconfirmation or reaffirmation that stick to your risk profile and your time horizon. I’ve noticed that, if you get sucked into the trade war stuff or the macro environment and the volatility that goes with it, you lose track of where you wanted to set your portfolio, and if you’re looking a year or two years or five years or 10 years out, which is normally where I’m looking, I’m not necessarily trading on a daily basis. I may trade around a core position, but it’s fractional to what I actually own in the holding. It’s really to look at it and say, okay, I’m not looking at the next three weeks or three months. I’m looking at the next three years.So, if I think the trade war is going to induce something in the next three years, a lot of people are talking about recession. If I think it’s going to induce a recession in the next three years then maybe I think about it differently, maybe I would take this as a time to exit a lot of my positions or I say, hey this is just transitory, it will be cleared up within a year before the next election probably, and I’m okay with stomaching this volatility and maybe I’ll buy a little bit more on extreme dips.It’s really just sitting and making sure you're not getting ahead of your skis and not changing your goals. You know, you set those goals, don't change them as events or things change. If the thesis change, sure change your stands on that stock, but if your time horizon and your risk profile are set, don't change them.NB: What you think is coming up for technology over the coming months?JA: It’s really interesting. First, it’s interesting that you give a kind or a purview of a couple of months because Tech generally moved so fast, but a lot of Tech recently is moving slow again, and what I mean by that is, artificial intelligence and 5G. We’ve been hearing about this for a couple of years now, probably at least three years. 5G, especially in the last year, year and a half, and it seems that the hardware side is not there yet to catch up with the software side. And even then, when the hardware side catches up, software is going to have to make a lot of adjustments and fine tuning. So, what I mean by all that is, in the next three months, I think we're just going to get a little bit more visibility into the trajectory of AI in 5G and really understand what the impacts are because I think the role of both of those things is rather slow, compared to the advancement of technology or the advancement of like hardware and the ability to put transistors on a smaller dye.I think it’s outside of that. I think it’s the ability for culture and society to adapt to these rather large changes, you know artificial intelligence is and not in its full use. It’s really something to kind of wield carefully, and I think 5G is also going to come in along the lines and open up a whole new set of abilities to run your house wirelessly and run your car wirelessly and be able to do things on your smart phone that you weren’t able to do consistently under 4G. And I think the next few months it’s really going to give us a better visibility.I don't think there’s going to be any big step changes. I think it is going to be just working towards understanding where we are headed with those things and sometimes you see IBM or Google come out with new breakthroughs like Quantum Computing and that little tiff that they had a couple of weeks ago about, you know are we at that point where Quantum Computing can now outmatch any classic computing? I think we’re on the cliff of, once we go there, there’s no turning back. So, I think in the next few months we’ re going to get a visibility into all of that and to understand what the true impact might be?NB: With artificial intelligence, do you think that there is any way that this might be impacted in ways that people are not immediately aware of, like what’s one thing that and please don't say Terminator, I know it's common, but yes.JA: Yes, I think the whole, you know becoming self-aware thing is a great science fiction kind of stands on it, but I think people are just not going to be aware of like what, they don't know what they don't know. They don't understand what may change in their lives or what may be allowed to happen with the onset of true AI where you are getting millions of processing cycles a second, sent back wirelessly to your or to your car wherever you may be for that matter. And I think people are going to feel probably a little uncomfortable. I think it starts, I think you look at the home speakers, the whole market for that, and people are growing, Hey Alexa do this. And you’re like, is that listening to me while I’m not talking to it? I don't know, maybe it is. It’s got a microphone and it’s got the ability to listen. So, it probably is, because it’s always listening for Hey Alexa. So, it’s listening to all the other things that you're saying. And I think people are starting to get comfortable with it. It’s probably closer to and I Robot thing than it is a Terminator Skynet kind of thing where people are like, this is really convenient this is really nice, but what kind of box am I opening up because of this?NB: Let’s certainly hope it is not anywhere close to Skynet type of thing. But you said that is science fiction. Okay, let’s take a short break and then I want to come back and drill in a little bit on your portfolio, some of your analysis, and as well as some stock picks, but let’s take a short break.I am speaking with Joe Albano, who runs the Tech Cache marketplace service here at Seeking Alpha. You can sign up for the service either by going through seekingalpha.com/marketplace. I am looking for Tech Cache or by typing Tech Cache or Joe Albano into the site search bar at seekingalpha.com. And by the way, Tech Cache is spelt C-A-C-H-E, that’s in the cache that you could get on a web browser I guess as opposed to the cash that you use to pay for something in a store. Although that too is going away, thanks to technology. Anyway, Joe welcome back.What’s something that scares you about markets or your portfolio right now?JA: What scares me about my portfolio? Probably the want in the desire to go heavier into tech. I have a pretty balanced portfolio, and again it goes back to my father and my uncle giving me a lot of blue-chip industrials consumer discretionary kind of things, utilities, things that were less volatile in tech. And I think that kind of keeps me safe a little bit from the volatility. For example, today, as we’re talking, I was looking at my portfolio against the NASDAQ and my portfolio was up a couple tens, while the NASDAQ was down a 0.5% and I kind of looked at it and I was like, you know that’s interesting. I’m pretty tech heavy, but it seems that my other stocks can kind of help me in certain situations. Obviously, that can hurt to when tech is up and these discretionary are down and these defensive stocks are down, but I don't have too much of a fear in the portfolio other than what bombshell is going to hit that kind of ripples through the market and technology. That’s always back of the mind kind of consideration, but nothing that doesn't let me sleep at night or sleep well at night.NB: Cool. What will you say as something that gives you confidence in your approach and your portfolio or otherwise with regards to investing?JA: I think the approach is just learning from my mistakes and not repeating those mistakes and seeing how it’s performed against the index or the other benchmarks. Hey, it’s like that, I’m beating the NASDAQ or I’m beating the S&P 500. I must be doing something right, what am I doing right, and then going back and analyzing that and okay, I picked some stocks here and I just didn't go all in. I just went a little bit or I put some towards crypto currencies and those small bets were our huge wins and it’s really a fine balance and making sure you're not over-weighted in certain things and you're not under-weighted in things that you should be kind of heavier and…NB: Cool. I have looked here on your page and looking at some of your recent articles, you have written about GoPro (GPRO) recently, twice actually within the last couple of months and you seem to be pretty optimistic. This is a stock that’s been beaten down, very badly over the last couple of years. Let’s try to rebound the kind of hasn’t and so it’s just sort of dwindling around that. Can you tell us what your views are on that and why you seem to be bullish on it?JA: Yes, actually so, it’s funny you mentioned that. I did write those two articles and they are rather close together. The first one was, hey I think I see a rebound coming because their guidance, they were on the upside with guidance, there was a beat in race or wasn’t a beat last quarter. So, they actually missed a little bit, but they raise guidance, much more than I expected them to and more of the market and they started to take off and head back into the $5 handle. And then they dropped the bombshell that we had a production mishap and we are going to delay our shipments of our new flagship cameras and I went okay, well that’s just a repeat of what’s happened over the last couple of years, but I had to immediately right an article and let my subscribers know first, but then I let my readers publicly know that, hey, I can't deal with that. There is just too much risk here. So, I'm going to drop out and I'm just going to go to the sidelines on it, and I don't think – I think there’s too much execution risk for that and it’s not worth it.NB: Okay. That’s good to know. So, you'll actually. So, it’s risk-realized article from October 3. It looks like you, right.JA: Yeah, I changed my stance in that article. Yes.NB: Interesting, due to the information. Alright. As far as stocks you are currently excited about what can you tell us about that, what’s the favorite idea that you have right now?JA: Yes, it’s actually interesting. I was just talking to my subscribers in that chat room today and we were thrown about a bunch of different Tech stocks, and it’s hard not to be excited about semiconductors right now, Microns, Skyworks, Broadcom and Lam Research. Nobody is really convinced of a recovery as far as chips and memory goes, but I kind of see it coming and I think it is better to be a little early than late on this because once it starts going, it starts going, and it takes off, but all that aside, I think one of my better ones inside of the semis is one of the fab-less ones that’s in Nvidia. And I think, I told my subscribers, I am buying it. I think you should buy it too ahead of last earnings, one is down at the 150 handle or thereabouts, and now it is kind of shut-up about 35% ups into the little below 200s.I think 203 or somewhere in there. And it kind of said, okay, I think it is closer to fair value now, but what made me suddenly say, hey, I think there is more behind Nvidia right now is Intel’s earnings that just came out in the last couple of days and the outperformance it had in the data center that wasn’t expected. And I just saw another article come out today that Microsoft Google and Amazon have spent more this quarter than they have most of the first half of the year. I think it was like, year-over-year it was 27%. So, it looks like data center is back on the move and for Nvidia that’s always good because good, because that’s where the higher margin, higher revenue products are and anything they have to put in the data center and anybody who is building data centers that needs that AI or that deep learning.They are going to look to Nvidia for that, not that there is not competition from AMD or the other ones, but I think they both stand to benefit from that is what I want to say. And with the RTX cards, the GTX cards now cleared out of the inventory and the RTX cards now fully in view and the adoption rate we are seeing for video games, I think real time rate tracing is going to start picking up here during the holiday season. I think, we’ll see a lot of game releases we already have in the call of duty and things like that, but I think last holiday it wasn’t as adoptable.There wasn’t a whole lot of games, nobody was – it’s given them a year now to upgrade their PCs and their desktops to the – and RTX card and I think that this holiday season will be where you get more buyers of those on a consumer side. So, I think the combination of the data center and the consumer side is going to drive an outperformance in Nvidia in the next three to six months. At least in the next quarter and I am really interested to see what they would provide for guidance in two weeks when they report.NB: Yes. NVDA is the Ticker here. Now this is, from a technical standpoint and you did say that you factor that in as well. It is been trading up around 206 as we speak here on Tuesday, October 29, which is the highest it's been since like June.JA: Yes, that’s correct.NB: But that is not a – that big rally is not a concern for you if you are looking to buy right now, if people are looking to buy right now?JA: Yes, it is always a consideration. I think, looking at the chart myself, I think it is still within the channel. I think it is starting to move towards the higher end of the channel. There is a broadening wedge that is going on, and a lot of that, I look at other indicators too. You look at the RSI, you look at the MACD, those are good indicators to tell you how the momentum is moving. And then I look at the chart and say, hey there is gaps that are left behind it is generally going to want to fill those gaps. I think the rally has been pretty good. I mean it has been pretty consistent since that late May beginning of June, recent bottoming, obviously a bottom back in December when most of the tech was headed down the drain, but that recent low in June, it’s moved nicely up off of their, it hasn't been a straight up move.So, I think there has been enough time to consolidate between all the different oscillations that it has had on the chart. I like that the moving averages are now pointing up. The MACD looks pretty decent, it doesn't have any kind of divergence from what we’re seeing on the chart. I would like to see the MACD a little bit higher than where it is, you know because the last few highs, the last – lower highs, they were about the same on the MACD, but we are not getting too technical, but what I'm saying is, I think there is still room to run at least on a channel kind of side of it, and I think it might cool off here, two weeks ahead of earnings, and then maybe we get another boost and it pushes back into the 220 handle in that area.I think there’s couple angles that are expecting 250 in the next 12 months, but on the other hand the risk of it is, it’s moved the way from the moving averages quite a bit. So, it may want to come back down and test that support before it moves up. So, I would be looking to buy on any of those dips on the test of support, but in the meantime, I'm going to hold the [path] with my Holdings. I’m very underweight and I only have an initial position that I took back in August when it was around that 150 area, and on those dips, I may decide I am going to continue to add to that position may be in another quarter of the position that I want to get into.NB: Interesting, yes. The high for Nvidia was back in October 1, 2018, imagine that, $289 a share and then it bottomed with everything else. It looks like Christmas Eve that seems to have been when things in the fourth quarter of last year. Kind of did bottom and like I said, it’s been a little choppy there was a first-quarter rally and it fell down again and as I mentioned since the second half of the year since June has been certainly positive. Okay, very good any other ideas that you have?JA: Yes. Actually, I told my subscribers in my weekly, weekend review, I think it’s time for me to change my stance on Snapchat, yes. I was pretty much a bear ever since the IPO, went up to 20 some odd dollars and I said yes, I think it’s good to be out of this. So, I’m not for shorting, I don’t shorten my own portfolio, but if you want to take some puts and by that and write it down, I said, that was a good time to do it, and then I looked at it all the way back down into the single digits.I said, I am not ready yet, and now it’s worked its way back up to $13 and $14 area, but what was intriguing to me was the opportunity that kind of created on earnings this past week was a drop on what I thought were pretty good numbers. I thought their daily average users was I'm not sure if they do monthly or daily. I got to check that. Well they are ones that do only one, but their numbers were exceeding what I expected and what analysts and the consensus expected. Way passed what they were doing prior. So, they were coming under consensus in the past on users and now they are well ahead.So, they had 210, I don't have the numbers in front of me. 208 or something like that, 210. And that beat the consensus for what people had for this coming quarter. So, they had kind of leap frog ahead and had so much growth in users that it actually exceeded consensus for the following quarter and that caught my attention along with their sales doing pretty well and they looked like the stock dropped on light guidance what analysts were calling light guidance was like, I thought it was pretty in-line, and I thought that was kind of an opportunity there on in-line guidance and watching the stock fall.So, I told my subscribers, I think it’s time for me to change my stance on Snapchat and maybe go along the stock. I’m not terribly thrilled with it. The company obviously is not profitable, but it should – the trajectory is to be more profitable in the future and the next year may be. I’m not overly enthused with management and how they run the business, but I think they swallowed their pride this year and changed some strategies that they thought were below them prior. Growth hacking would be one of those things. I think they’ve changed their stands, which is always good. I like a management that will admit when they’re wrong, maybe not publicly, but they change their strategy and they execute a different way and it proves in the numbers.So, I’m okay with that. I’m closer to being a bull than I ever have been on Snapchat and I think that might be one of my next ideas that I fully ride out for my subscribers.NB: Yes. Snapchat has been the great turnaround story of this year. Shares bottomed out around five and change. Actually, they break down $4.99 on December 21. Now, as we speak, they are around 14.60’s, 14.70’s and the sell-off was not bad at all after earnings, certainly not as bad as Twitter's. If you were looking at that, but quite a story here. Although, still is at current rates it is still below the 52-week high that it’s at in the 17’s in July and still well below the IPO price, which is up in the 20s. So, you’d figure that this would have a little bit of room to run, potentially.Okay wonderful. I have been speaking with Joe Albano of Tech Cache.

4301517,104916,2019-11-04T05:30:00-05:00,Joe Albano of Tech Cache discusses his background in technology and how he came to Seeking Alpha.Artificial intelligence and 5G technology are taking hold slowly and the true impact will not be known for some time.In the meantime there are opportunities in semiconductor stocks and even social media.,"Listen and subscribe to the Marketplace Roundtable on these podcast platforms:By Nathaniel E. BakerJoe Albano rejoins the Marketplace Roundtable Podcast to discuss his investing experience as reflected in his Tech Cache service.Albano's strategy is a hybrid of fundamental and technical methods. He focuses mostly on technology stocks, an industry he knows well from his life pre-Seeking Alpha. Albano has a university degree in computer and electrical engineering but says he is mostly self-taught when it comes to understanding chips and software.""That's really my personality in a sense,"" he says. ""I taught myself how to play drums and really haven't taken any lessons,"" becoming proficient by learning the correct techniques and practicing them repeatedly.When it comes to investing, he did acquire some background knowledge at a young age. ""Instead of getting the typical presents as a kid, I would get stock certificates."" This led to a curiosity and interest in the concept of stock markets and eventually in the type of information that moved stocks and markets.Now, years later he says a key lesson is sticking with one's convictions. ""Don't doubt what you've already researched and pulled in,"" he says. Going back and playing Monday morning quarterback tends to more harm than good. ""Don't over analyze it, look at it for what it is, try to make sure you're not missing anything, and then execute on what you've learned.""Sticking to risk profiles and time horizons is key to avoid getting distracted by events in the news. Albano holds stocks for the long term -- three years or more. Events that are transitory lead to short-term volatility and dips, but these can be opportunities to add more to positions.Playing into this, Albano finds that changes in the latest technology will unfold a little more gradually than in the past. Take two hot button items: artificial intelligence and 5G. ""The roll-out of both of those things is rather slow compared to the advancement of hardware and the ability to put transitors on a smaller die."" Additionally, the potential of these technologies is still not fully understood by the companies that will put them to use.""The ability for culture and society to adapt to these rather large changes."" AI in its full use ""is really something to wield carefully and I think 5G is also going to come along those lines and open up a whole new set of abilities to run your house wirelessly and run your car wirelessly and be able to do things on your smartphone that you weren't able to do consistently under 4G."" The coming months should provide some clues on understanding the true impact -- but probably no more than clues for now.For now, favorite ideas include Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductors. ""Nobody's really convinced of a recovery as far as chips and memory goes. I kind of see it coming and it's better to be a little early than late on this."" Albano also likes Snapchat (SNAP), owing to a recent change in outlook for the stock.Topics Covered"
4311665,69905,2019-12-10T13:19:35-05:00,Dissecting Snap's revenue drivers.Snap is one of the most cash burning platforms among its peer group.Snap is an overvalued stock and its shareholders should sidestep this investment - while they still can.,"Snap (SNAP) has had a terrific 2019, with the stock up more than 145% and by far outperforming the S&P 500 (SPY).The problem though is that looking backward rarely aids investors. What shareholders need to do, is look forward. And then question, is the risk-reward compelling enough?At close to $20 billion market cap, I declare that investors are priming themselves for disappointment. Here's why:The graph below succinctly highlights the reason why Snap has seen its stock more than double in 2019:Source: author's calculationsComing out of Q4 2018, revenue was up 36% (number not shown), and shareholders at the time were ready to embrace continuously slowing revenue growth rates. Thus, investors' sentiment was understandably pessimistic.Accordingly, given that early in 2019 Snap delivered a re-acceleration of its revenue growth rate, investors were positively surprised and it did not matter that Snap was incurring very heavy losses - Snap was back in high-growth mode.To be clear, Snap's guided Q4 2019 looks quite promising; after all, +40% growth rates are nothing to sneer at.But when we start to dig into the drivers of Snap's revenue growth rates something becomes clear:Source: Q3 2019 10-QAs we know, the bulk of Snap's revenues are derived from North America. In actuality, we can assert that just over 70% of Snap's revenues are derived from North America.Further, since North America's revenues were up 52% year-over-year, this breaks down as follows:Source: author's calculations; North AmericaWe can see that the drivers of Snap's strong revenues are significantly tilted towards increasing prices than increasing its daily active users. Why is this a problem? Because it demonstrates the poor growth in users Snap has. Users come on, but don't stay on the platform.The next question shareholders should consider, is just how much more pricing power does Snap have? It has already risen its ARPUs substantially, up 43% year-over-year in Q3 2020, is there any more steam left in the engine?Further confounding Snap's troubles is that raising its ARPUs only advances its strategy so far. For Snap to fundamentally succeed, it must increase the scale of its platform. And realistically, this is proving challenging.Note, as far as social media platforms go, Snap's daily active users (DAUs) are among the lowest:(Source)What's more, even though Twitter (TWTR) has a similar number of users on its platform, it shows that Twitter's ability to cash convert its revenues is a multitude higher. Specifically, Twitter is very close to generating a billion of free cash flow annualized, yet it is priced very close to the same market cap as Snap, at $20 billion.Conversely, Snap is highly priced, but is only just on target to break even on an adjusted EBITDA number.The table below reminds investors of the difference between 'new' social media platforms and 'old' social media platforms - cash generative versus cash-burning. Cheaply valued Facebook (FB) and Twitter, versus expensive ('jazzy') newer platforms.Source: author's calculationsMoreover, investors who follow this space closely will no doubt be aware that Pinterest's (PINS) whole business model has come into question and investors have reacted poorly to its inflated valuation.On the other hand, with Snap, investors have been fairly satisfied to take a wait-and-see approach. After all, this makes sense, which investors are going to start to ask difficult questions from a stock which has been so rewarding for them the past twelve months?Source: Ray DalioThe problem for Snap is that it has to convince advertisers that they are the only platform able to reach the ''hard to reach'' Millennials.Whereas, the problem for shareholders is to put emotions aside and squarely posit whether paying close to $20 billion market cap leaves any upside potential which is not already being priced into this valuation.On this note, I declare that it is simply too challenging to find any sort of edge at this price."
4296519,102101,2019-10-14T19:55:15-04:00,Snap is having a more noticeable presence in  the video advertising space.This has spurred investments in more content to drive its video ad inventory.This move has the potential to drive platform engagement and revenue in the near term.This will make it easy for Snap to hit its near-term revenue target.,"Snap's (SNAP) video ads are gaining traction while favorably competing with Facebook (FB) and YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for video ad budgets amongst advertisers. Advertisers are allocating more budget to Snap since the company launched its unskippable video ad format. This release has the potential to drive more ad revenue in the short term. Also, this demand has spurred Snap to invest money on content to grow its video ad inventory. This has the potential to drive more DAU and engagement growth on the platform. I see a serious driver for more revenue growth due to this initiative, and I am tempted to move from a neutral to a bullish stance as this initiative continues to mature. However, I will keep my neutral position until management demonstrates that it can sustainably improve profitability ratios as Twitter (TWTR) did.Source: AdageYouTube is now a $20-billion a year business. Until recently, YouTube and Facebook have enjoyed the largest share of the digital video ad market. However, the game is changing. Due to the level of competition on both YouTube and Facebook, especially for premium ad inventory, advertisers are beginning to look to other platforms to allocate their video ad budget. Snap has positioned itself to benefit from this via Snap commercials, its unskippable video ad format. The new ad format has a better completion rate, and advertisers prefer it to the old 6-second skippable ad format. Also, it comes at a competitive CPM compared to offerings by Facebook and YouTube, its biggest rivals.According to Digiday:Unlike the skippable version, unskippable ads are capped at 6 seconds. For advertisers who are still in love with the skippable ad format, Snap has extended the maximum play duration to three minutes to give advertisers more creative flexibility. I was able to lay my hands on the pitch deck, which highlights Snap's plan to become the mobile HBO through a video advertising program called Snap Select.The short ad format appeals to the short attention span of its young audience demographic. Snap still touts its ability to reach 75% of the 13-34 age demographic in the United States. Over 50% of them watch premium content on Snapchat daily.If Snap successfully partners with its content creators, it could drive more advertising dollars which will grow to be impactful to bottom-line revenue. But I'm still concerned that Snap is selling these ad slots at a fixed CPM. A programmatic buying approach will be more appropriate as it will let the law of supply and demand dictate how much advertisers should pay. This will help Snap compete even more favorably with YouTube and Facebook on pricing. Google recently made the YouTube masthead available to buy on a flexible CPM basis. The masthead is one of YouTube's premium inventory slots. It is essential that Snap makes pricing as flexible as possible going forward.The video ad market is expanding. It now accounts for over 30% of the total US spend on display ads and 27% in Europe, as reported by Criteo (CRTO). Cisco (CSCO) estimated that by 2021, 80% of the world’s internet traffic would be video.According to IAB:Snap video ads have the potential to drive more app engagement, and the success of these ad formats will continue to be accretive to revenue. This will add more meat to Snap's bullish narrative of growth driven by an expanding digital ad market as more advertisers allocate more budget to online ads. This is due to the increasing shift to online content consumption compared to traditional media platforms like T.V. and radio.The prospect that Snap can rake in more ad revenue from Snap Select will be accretive to revenue. This will make it easy for Snap to beat its revenue guidance going forward. This will also drive user growth and engagement as Snap can make the case to invest in more engaging content to grow its video ad inventory. Though Snap's lack of profitability makes it a tough sell to risk-averse investors, investors who are hoping to play the long-term game shouldn't hesitate to hop on this train as it will continue to be fueled by the rapidly expanding digital ads market.I will be reiterating my Hold rating with a price target of $20. As I highlighted in my previous thesis:"
4294851,69905,2019-10-03T13:56:29-04:00,"Common sense investing.Pinterest's growth rates are one of the best.On balance, why Pinterest's stock should be avoided.","On the back of Snap's (SNAP) Q2 2019 results I noted:Remarkably, no sooner was that bearish article published that its stock slowed its appreciation.If you think that I'm claiming that I called the ""top"" on the stock, rest assured that I did no such thing. Besides, I would not insult your intelligence or waste your time.Having said that, one didn't need to call the top here. Because it has been evident for a long time that Snap is dangerously overvalued.(Source)The thing with investing is that it is never straight forward. It is never clear cut. And the market is not always right or always wrong.In fact, there is much to like about Snap.Source: Author's calculations, press statementsThe graph above reminds us of the bullish thesis. I ask the reader how many social media platforms are growing at close to 35-40% year-over-year?The answer is very few or close to none. Especially, if you buy into the management's spiel that Pinterest is not a social media platform, but a place to get inspiration.So we are left with a young platform growing easily north of 37% or closer to 40% year over year. What's more, Snap has cut out a strong niche for itself and whereby it reaches more than 75% of the 13- to 34-year-old population in the United States. So far, it is certainly highly compelling.Snap's problem though is that boring discussion of cash flow generation. It's not news to anyone who follows Snap closely that its bottom line is negative: be it on an adjusted EBITDA metric or even on a cash flows from operation metric, where its hefty stock-based compensation is added back.To be fair, Snap's balance sheet offers it plenty of maneuverability with just over $1.1 billion of cash and equivalents and no debt. However, management is also highly cognizant of the fact that the business doesn't bring in much in the way of tangible cash.Accordingly, it had few options left on the table aside from raising cash through a convertible offering. Because as the old adage goes, you don't raise debt when you need it; you raise it when you don't!And to be fair, Snap's interest on the convertible is razor-thin at just 0.75%, and its maximum dilution to shareholders is approximately 4%.Great company, but not a great stock, as we can see below.Source: Author's calculationsInvesting is largely about finding assets that are priced with a large discount, so that if things go wrong, as they inevitably do, shareholders can still walk away without much, if any, capital loss.With this in mind, how can anyone rationally argue that Snap being priced at approximately 17x sales offers shareholders enough margin of safety?Furthermore, the last several days have shown how incredibly shaky the markets are ""feeling"". Is it really worthwhile being invested in Snap at this nosebleed valuation? Not a lot needs to go wrong; just slightly lighter-than-expected Q4 2019 guidance and the stock immediately gets a 15-20% discount.Remember, compared with other tech giants, where the past 12 months have seen their valuations remain largely static, Snap's share price has appreciated significantly. Meaning that shareholders are ready to take profits at the earliest signs of a slowdown in revenue growth rates.In conclusion, the risk-reward is not looking particularly attractive at present.Snap certainly has substantial potential. Snap is growing rapidly and may in time become a profitable enterprise. The problem for now is that new shareholders are not likely to benefit from much upside potential. Snap could be reconsidered at a lower valuation."
4298129,69905,2019-10-23T08:52:56-04:00,I note the positive aspects of Snap's third-quarter results.I discuss why investors' reaction was muted post-earnings.Shareholders should avoid Snap before it's too late.,"Snap (SNAP) delivered mind-blowing Q3 2019 results. The market's reaction? Totally muted. Why? Because expectations were just too high.Below is my coverage of Snap over the past 12 months:In my coverage earlier this month, I noted:After seeing Snap's results, I believe those statements are fairly accurate descriptions of Snap's underlying dynamic. Snap is not an investment; it is speculation.The graph below is a colorful reminder that Snap remains incredibly relevant among its audience (18- to 24-year-olds).Source: author's calculationsNot only is its pace of revenue growth strong evidence that Snap's business model is not a pop-and-fizzle fad, but this quarter's revenues succeeded in percolating down the rest of its income statement too.For instance, while its top line was up 50% compared with Q3 2019, its bottom line improved to negative $227 million compared with negative $325 million. While Snap's free cash flow use fared particularly well and came in at negative $84 million compared with negative $159 million in the same period a year ago. What's not to like?Furthermore, Snap's CEO Evan Spiegel highlighted on the call that this year was the first one in which time spent on mobile surpassed television in the U.S. Spiegal contended that his company's value proposition is remarkably well positioned to capitalize on this large opportunity.This was a noteworthy quarter for Snap. Not only were its quarterly results overwhelmingly positive, but its guidance for Q4 2019 of 41% revenue growth reassures investors that Snap is more than rhetoric; it has the numbers to back its vision.Spiegel spoke about Snap's opportunities today over the near term (one to three years' time), medium term and long term. In other words, Snap is firing on all cylinders. Snap's opportunities include augmented reality, maps, and gaming. So far, so good, but now on to the shareholders' perspective.Right away, common sense alone should raise a questioning eyebrow at the fact that Snap is already valued at approximately $20 billion. How much more upside is actually left in its valuation?Source: author's calculationsThe next question should clearly be along the lines of where its profit margins may ultimately fall.Consider this: Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) are remarkable advertising platforms. In my opinion, Facebook, for one, is one of the best free-cash-flow-producing companies, if not the best.Twitter, on the other hand, went through a challenging period but has not turned a corner and has laid the foundation to be a strong cash-flow-generating enterprise.To assume that Snap is in any way on par with these two tech juggernauts is a mistake.However, even if Snap were to somehow go on to become a sustainably strong GAAP-profitable company, once we account for its heavy stock-based compensation are its operating margins likely to fall closer to 10%, similar to those of Twitter? I doubt it.Even if it somehow ended up being as efficient as Twitter is, that would imply that Snap would be making approximately $200 million of operating profits, before taxes and capex and capitalization of intangibles (although Snap doesn't capitalize its intangibles all that much).Nevertheless, this would still make a future conceptual/best-case-scenario Snap trade at 100x this hypothetical scenario.Reading through the prior few paragraphs, readers can note just how many optimist assumptions I have to make for Snap to trade at 100x (hypothetical) operating profits. This is not investing.To be perfectly candid, Snap delivered results that left me dumbfounded.Every aspect of the results and earnings call pointed to a company that had turned a corner.Although arguably even more surprising is the clear investor apathy towards this set of results. The verdict? Investors were already pricing in this quarter a long time ago, and they will need even more consistently strong surprises to see Snap's market cap rise to $30 billion - for a 50% upside potential.In summary, I believe that Snap's valuation is already pricing in all the positive good news. Hence, for investors, Snap offers a negative risk-reward balance, making its stock best avoided."
4299112,104812,2019-10-25T11:34:41-04:00,"SNAP reported impressive revenue and user growth, although some of that momentum was from a carryover of new features launched earlier this year.Operating loss for the company narrowed in Q3 driven by higher revenue per user and supported by tight cost controls, but the outlook for consistent profitability remains uncertain.We think company will be challenged to sustained the current momentum while market expectations are still very bullish.Article recaps latest earnings release and our views on the stock.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Short Ideas subscribers - find out more here.Snap Inc. (NASDAQ:SNAP) has had an impressive 2019 with the stock up 180% from its lows of last year when there was deep pessimism on the company's growth outlook and future as a social media platform. While user numbers stagnated in 2018, even declining in some regions, the company through a number of tweaks to the Snap Chat app interface along with the introduction of new features have led to something of a renaissance in user engagement this year. A narrowing loss and an outlook for continued growth is a positive but the company still faces the challenge of maintaining the current momentum enough to eventually generate a consistent profit and justify its valuation at $18.5 billion. This article recaps the latest earnings release and our view on where SNAP is headed next. (source: Finviz.com)Snap Inc reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on October 22 with a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.04, $0.01 ahead of expectations while the GAAP loss of $0.16 per share also beat by $0.03. The spread here is largely related to stock-based compensation that reached $161 million in the quarter and is excluded in the adjusted non-GAAP amounts. Revenues of $446.2 million represented an increase of 50% year over year driven by higher revenue per user. The story has been ongoing user growth which increased by 7 million globally to 210 million on the quarter, up 13% compared to Q3 2018. Higher advertising on the platform drove an increase in the average revenue per user 'ARPU' to $2.12 globally, up 33% year over year as one of the most important metrics. ARPU in North America reached $3.75.The other theme is a favorable trend of narrowing losses that has been driven by a higher gross margin that reached a record 51% for the company this quarter up from 36% in Q3 2018. Snap has made a commendable effort at containing total costs with general and administrative expenses actually down 1% over the first nine months of the year. Still, considering a total operating loss of $228.9 million in the quarter, the company is still far from profitability.(source: Company IR)Management's own adjusted EBITDA loss at $42 million in Q3 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of negative 9% needs to turn significantly higher to cover the net loss of $227.4 million. One of our concerns his how long SG&A can be sustained at current level, with higher cost pressures in the future like to pressure free cash flow which is negative $265.5 million year to date.(source: Company IR)Looking ahead, the company is guiding for Q4 revenues in the range of $540 to $560 million, which if confirmed represents an increase of 41% year over year at the midpoint. In terms of published consensus adjusted EPS estimates, SNAP is forecast to approach break-even in 2020 with $0.007 while the market sees the potential of a $0.23 in positive EPS by 2021. GAAP EPS is expected to be negative over the next three years.YChartsThese estimates are based on a consensus expectation that revenues will reach $3 billion by 2021, up nearly 80% from the 2019 full year forecast. This type of implied growth remains speculative and will require the company to continue its trend of strong user growth and higher advertising on the platform. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical if these growth rates are sustainable, which we explain below with a bearish view on SNAP's outlook.One of the major product developments for the company this year was the introduction of new augmented reality camera filters or ""lenses"" that allow users to appear as a young child or even a different gender. The introduction of this 'gender swap' and 'baby filter' went viral and helped boost user growth and engagement worldwide as the feature crossed over into popular culture. CNET magazine described the feature by saying; ""New Snapchat filters are fueling excitement on social media"". Other reports suggested the new feature was a big hit. Twitter user demonstrating Snap Chat baby filter. source: @MajorMarvelKingThe timing here is important since the introduction in May of 2019 was about mid-way through the company's fiscal Q2 and likely maintained some momentum through Q3 from the month of July for this latest quarter. Our view is that the company was able to parlay the success of this feature into two fiscal quarters and use the data not only to present a favorable picture to investors but also to drive advertising spending on the platform. As with many trends and fads on social media, it's likely that nearly six months since the lenses innovation, the novelty has begun to wear out and is now less of a driver for curious new users into Q4. It remains to be seen if casual users will stick to the platform over the long run.Looking at the Q3 daily average user numbers 'DAU', the year over year growth figures are respectable, but on a quarter over quarter basis, it appears the momentum slowed from Q2. Global DAU increased by 3.4% q/q globally and just 1.2% q/q in North America. This is in contrast to the larger 'filter bump' in Q2 that showed global DAU increased by 6.8% q/q. The Q3 numbers here are better than the trends from 2018, when the platform had stagnant growth and even lost users in North America but highlights the potentially volatile dynamics and challenging environment for the company to keep users engaged long term. We don't know the breakdown within trends in DAU over the course of the entire third quarter but expect that what may have started off strong in the month of July could have decelerated by September.(source: Company IR)The other component here is the average revenue per user 'ARPU' that was up 33% globally in Q3 to $2.12 from $1.60 in Q3 of 2018. On the other hand, from the graphic below, the data point is less impressive considering the Q3 was just 1.4% higher than the previous peak ARPU number from Q4 of 2018 at $2.09. In North America, similarly, APRU increased by 43% year over year, but a less impressive 10.9% compared to Q4 of 2018. The Q3 number this year on a q/q basis is actually below the 19% increase between Q3 and Q2 2018.(source: Company IR)There is a seasonal aspect and Q4 numbers should once again get a boost from the holiday season, but Snap is going to need significantly higher revenues over the next couple of years to turn a profit. Based on the current user number of 210 million globally, and a flat gross margin at 50% while holding operating costs at the existing level; we estimate that ARPU globally and total revenues would need to double from the current level just to break even at operating income.The bearish case is simply that as the user momentum wanes which is our base-case, advertisers will push back on larger marketing budgets, and the ARPU growth will stall or even decline over the next couple of years. Snap needs another big hit with a product innovation to keep user excited and engaged on the platform. The company is betting on the third iteration of its 'Spectacles 3' sunglasses which we are skeptical will gain traction. The following points lead us to a bearish view on SNAP.Despite impressive growth for Snap Inc in Q3, the company still faces long term challenges to maintain user momentum and more importantly reach a consistent level of profitability. With the stock now down about 27% from its recent highs back in September, we think the market is pulling back some of the sentiment from earlier in the year. The stock remains highly speculative requiring an extrapolation of recent growth trends a number of years out.We are bearish on Snap over the long term but recognize the stock will need a series of disappointing earnings release to really confirm an underlying weakness in its organic growth outlook. The main monitoring points continue to be user growth while 2020 will be an important year for the company as it faces what are now difficult comparables from the current 2019 period. A deeper deterioration in the operating and financial outlook for the company could send share back to its lows of 2018 under $5.00."
4298597,105459,2019-10-24T11:01:31-04:00,"Initiate on SNAP with a bullish view and a $17/share target, implying 26% upside.Operating metric growth remains intact and is supportive of revenue acceleration and future FCF generation.New ad product will continue to attract brands while gaming adds to long-term engagement upside.","We are initiating on Snap (NYSE:SNAP) with a bullish view and a $17/share target price, valuing the stock at 10x 2020E EV/sales, implying 26% potential upside from the current level.Despite soft revenue guidance following the Q3 print, we believe that SNAP’s fundamentals remain intact. Specifically, operating metrics such as DAU and time spent across the board remain healthy while the engagement level maintains an upward trajectory. As such, we expect consensus estimates will see upward revisions and that the stock will re-rate following the print.As long as these metrics remain sound, we believe that SNAP can continue to attract advertisers with its immersive products, which will ultimately add to the revenue numbers. When coupled with incremental cost optimization, we expect material EBITDA improvement, resulting in gradual free cash generation in the foreseeable future.More importantly, we believe that SNAP is one of few potential beneficiaries of the media consumption shift from web 2.0 properties (i.e. Social networking, microblogs, web portals) to short-format entertainments such as mini videos, augmented reality and mobile games.In short, we believe that 2020 will be a turnaround year for SNAP, and investors can expect further share appreciation as the company maintains its execution, particularly on Android improvement. Assuming all goes well, we expect SNAP to crank up the user numbers across all geographies and the path to 500m DAU and $5bn in annual revenue in the next five years could be a distinct possibility.Our target multiple of 10x EV/Sales on 2020E estimates positions SNAP at the high-end of the peer group that trades between 2.5x EV/Sales such as Momo (MOMO) to 10x EV/sales such as Pinterest (PINS) and Match Group (MTCH).Although the valuation will remain a key pushback on the stock, we believe that our 10x EV/Sales target multiple is justified, given the favorable exposure to the millennial media consumption trend, mobile AR, potential upside from gaming, and, more importantly, SNAP’s global exposure, which we feel is an attribute that is becoming increasingly critical for internet companies around the world.Risks to our thesis include:We expect SNAP to continue to leverage its unique value proposition for the advertisers to maintain its turnaround in 2020.Structurally speaking, SNAP’s unique demographic is a key differentiator. Notably, eMarketer estimates that ~80% of SNAP users are under the age of 34, which provides significant value for brands wanting exposure to this demographic. This is particularly important as the consumption level for this group shifts from traditional media (i.e. TV, newspaper) and early web properties (i.e. Social network, web portal, microblogs) to short-form videos and AR-based mobile contents.In terms of R&D, SNAP continues to deliver what advertisers want. Notably, the company rolled out Snap Select in Q2 that delivered high-quality video and pricing experience. The partnership with Shopify (SHOP) makes Snap ads accessible to brands from Shopify. Looking into the later part of the year and 2020, we can expect new products in streaming videos and political advertising for brands that are looking to reach the younger segment.In the medium to long term, eCommerce ads either via a short video or AR (i.e. cosmetics, clothing, furniture) could also attract both brands and user engagement.In short, as long as operating metrics remain intact, we believe brands will continue to be attracted to SNAP, assuming that the company maintains their execution in terms of product development (and so far, they have executed well).Somewhat overlooked but nonetheless important long-term driver for SNAP is its gaming opportunity, which we believe is quite attractive, given that SNAP’s younger audience demographics that is no stranger to multiplayer gaming and SNAP’s high-income users that support long-term monetization.The current game lineup, including Bitmoji Party, Bitmoji Tennis, Tiny Royale, C.A.T.S. Drift Racing, Snake Squad, Alphabear Hustle, Zombie Rescue Squad, and Subway Surfer Airtime is a good start as it caters to SNAP’s demographics that are looking for short-term entertainment. We also believe that SNAP’s decision to involve third-party developers is a critical step towards building the gaming platform to become a core component of driving user engagement.Worth recalling Facebook’s (FB) decision to invite third-party developers to develop games for FB’s desktop site which largely contributed to its early successes on driving MAU and engagement growth. We expect a similar trajectory for SNAP games, given management’s solid execution this year.Increasing DAU and engagement levels across the board reinforce our bullish view on SNAP’s fundamentals despite a soft revenue outlook. We frankly think the sell-side consensus is overly bullish, which resulted in the post-print sell-off, and we would be buyers on weakness.Notably, SNAP’s Discovery platform is evolving into an engaging content ecosystem with daily time spent +40% y/y driven by 100+ channels serving over 10m viewers, which we believe incrementally impacted the strong DAU and ARPU metrics in North America.Additionally, over 50 channels were added internationally with +55% y/y growth in time spent, which we believe partially resulted in the strong user growth numbers in Europe.We believe that Discover is a beneficiary of the shift in media consumption from conventional web 1.0 and 2.0 properties to web 3.0 properties in which content dictates the company’s growth trajectory. SNAP is actively investing in differentiated content which we believe will continue to improve the platform’s stickiness over time.Other notable updates for the quarter include the introduction of Dynamic Ads that allows advertisers to create ads in real-time extensive product catalogs, and new ad functions such as swipe action and time extension, so that the users can easily access the brand’s webpage or get a better understanding of the story.In conclusion, we are bullish on SNAP as we believe the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular ad trend within the younger demographic."

In recent days, there has been a slew of bullish betting that the stock increases to around $20.20, a gain of about 27% from its current price of $15.90.The calls options for expiration on October 18 have witnessed the open interest rise by about 35,000 contracts on August 22 to a total of approximately 43,700 contracts. According to data from Trade Alert, the calls traded on the ASK, an indication they were bought and a bet the stock would rise. The calls traded for a price of roughly $0.20 per contract, giving the trader a break-even price of about $20.20 if they should choose to hold the options until expiration.The technical chart for Snap is very bullish and shows a technical pattern known as a reverse head and shoulders. The pattern indicates that the stock continues to rise. Another pattern that also appears to have formed is known as a falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern. It too would suggest the stock increases to around $18.50. Should shares rise above resistance at $18.50, the next level to watch for would come around $20.80.The relative strength index has also been steadily trending higher in recent weeks. It indicates that bullish momentum is entering Snap's stock.If you'd like to learn more about these patterns, I offer a video to the subscribers of my Market Place service. Technical Analysis 103: Reversal PatternsOne reason why the stock is rising is improving company fundamentals. Snap reported earnings that came in about 38% higher than analysts' consensus estimates for the latest quarter. Additionally, the company reported revenue that was over 8% higher than analysts' estimates.Also, the number of daily active users (DAU) increased by 203 million in the second quarter from 188 million in the quarter a year ago. Meanwhile, the average revenue per user increased by 37% to $1.91 from $1.40 last year.The second quarter of 2019 was the first time that Snap saw its DAU increase to over 200 million. Additionally, it was the first meaningful quarter of growth since the first quarter of 2018.(NYSE:SNAP)The stock doesn't come cheap trading with a one-year forward price to sales ratio of about 9.5. That is much higher than Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) valuation of around six times one-year forward sales estimates.Data by YChartsHowever, analysts have been boosting their revenue estimates for Snap since the beginning of the year. It should help to bring that valuation down or slow its rise in the future if the estimates continue to increase.If the stock is unable to break out and fall below technical support around $15.50, the equity could fall to approximately $13.60, a decline of about 13% from its current price based on the technical chart.Additionally, it is always clear why traders make options bet. It is possible that the rise in the call options as part of a hedge against a short-position, a bet that the stock would fall.The last time I wrote on Snap was on June 12. At the time, the stock was trading around $13.75, and I had noted it was likely to rise to around $16. You can track all of my articles on Snap and my free stories on Seeking Alpha on this Google spreadsheet. I offer a similar spreadsheet to my premium members with ideas exclusive for them.If the current momentum in Snap's stock continues and the company posts strong results, then it would seem shares could continue to climb. At least that is what the current betting in the options would suggest."

(SNAP) has been one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the market, up 205% year to date and even greater 250% since its December 2018 52-week low. There was a point last year when the situation looked dire as the stock traded under $5.00 per share falling as much as 82% from its all-time high. The recovery really picked up steam with its earnings release in January that beat expectations presenting a recovery in user numbers and a narrowing loss driven by higher revenues and cost control efforts. One big development was the introduction of the new ""gender-swap"" and ""baby-face"" filters in the Snapchat app that became a hit on social media and even crossed over into popular culture back in May. Separately, the company just announced the latest version of its augmented reality wearable camera, the Spectacles 3, set to launch in November. In our view, this is likely the last chance for Snap to prove the Spectacles segment is a viable business after two failed attempts. We're skeptical the product reaches the required critical mass to meaningfully drive growth and continue to be bearish on SNAP's long-term outlook. This article looks at where the stock is headed next.SNAP stock price chart. Source: finviz.comFor a company that continues to use the brand slogan ""Snap Inc. is a camera company"", it's becoming increasingly crucial that its latest version of the wearable camera device gains traction to reach mainstream success. The Spectacles 3 was just announced with major changes compared to the previous models that suffered from low sales. The original version from 2017 resulted in a $40 million write-off of unsold inventory. User complaints at the time were related to the bulky design, generally, lower quality imaging compared to premium smartphones, poor functionality, and otherwise described as a niche product with limited uses.SNAP 2019 Spectacles 3 marketing screenshot. Source: Snap.comFor the 2019 version, Snap is going towards the higher end with a combination of more premium materials (less plastic) and a fashion-oriented design. The main update is the inclusion of a second HD camera capable of capturing a wider field of view and depth to photos and videos required to integrate augmented reality ""AR"". The announced price tag of $380 is significantly higher than last year's version launch price of $170, with the company likely focusing more on margins this time around compared to a previous attempt at volume. According to comments from Snap Inc.'s Chief Tech Officer Bobby Murphy in a recent interview with the magazine Fast Company, Snap is betting that AR is the future of the company.Snap sees a potential future where many people walk around everywhere with Spectacles interacting with these AR overlays. The reality is that it remains an open-ended question as to whether or not ""wearable cameras"" indeed represent a significant market opportunity. The core idea of recording Snapchat messages and ""stories"" with Spectacles and uploading them through a mobile device may or may not appeal to all users.What could help the Spectacles 3 succeed is that management, hopefully, learned some lessons from the attempted and failed roll-out of the original Spectacles. Snapchat itself has also evolved in just the past year that could be more receptive to this product based on how users are utilizing the platform. The greater focus on AR lenses and stories compared to 2017 probably represents a better opportunity for a wearable camera. The original version of Spectacles was more centered around messaging.Still, considering the data suggesting 90% of Snapchat user are between the age of 13 and 24 years old, it's also likely the price point keeps it out of reach of most. The November launch date in the holiday shopping season and potentially significant internal marketing within the Snapchat app will nevertheless generate a buzz. Snap reported 203 million daily active users in Q2, and we're sure most will be made aware of the product and features through the public content on the Snapchat app. We can imagine Snap handing out hundreds of test devices to key ""influencers"" this year that will be able to reach a global audience as a form of advertising directly to the targeted users.With that said, we cynically ""roll our eyes"" at the Spectacles 3 and question why not just use the smartphone to record videos and take pictures (which is a core feature) instead of spending $380 on this device that needs to be connected wirelessly to the mobile devices anyways. Specific applications where hands-free operations are necessary are likely limited compared to what Snapchat is typically used for today. We're not buying it and give it a greater than 50% chance it remains little more than a curiosity among a small group of hard-core users. Hardly, the next big growth driver that will pull Snap Inc. to profitability. Still, given the higher price point, Snap will have less pressure to sell a significant number of units to make this work based on a presumably higher margin. On the other hand, the real risk is more related to the stock sentiment should the product turn out to be a commercial failure. This may be the company's last chance to prove Spectacles as a viable business segment.Investors should monitor early reviews in the next couple of months to gauge sales trends, with a risk that weaker than expected traction represents downside risks for earnings with a hit to operating income. The first look at hard numbers will come in the Q4 earnings release in early February 2020.The more pressing concern is the firm-wide financial outlook and continued uncertainty over user growth. As mentioned, the introduction of the ""gender swap"" and ""baby-face"" filter/lenses in Q2 helped drive user growth. Management confirmed this as a key factor in the quarter. The question into Q3 is whether the new users simply downloaded the app to check out what all the fuss was about only to abandon the platform after a few weeks, or if the trend here represents a permanently higher user base that continues to accelerate.Twitter user demonstrating Snap Chat baby filter. source: @MajorMarvelKingGlobal DAU increased 8% in Q2 to 203 million, with 13 million more users compared to Q1. Indeed, the numbers were strong, but our view is that this was simply a temporary boost from the filters and already 3 months later, the novelty may have already worn out.Trends in social media come and go and the latest example of this was an even more recent phenomenon of the ""FaceApp"" old-age filter from a Russian startup with no connection to Snap Inc. The app focuses on image editing and went viral briefly becoming one of the most downloaded apps in the world in July with the curiosity of manipulating person's faces to appear old age. The point here is that along with the FaceApp fad, we view Snapchat's momentum in Q2 will taper while highlighting the relative ambiguity of the technology.Twitter user demonstrating ""FaceApp"". source: @UMusicIn 2018, when Snapchat was losing users, the issue was poor retention and the bearish case sees this dynamic of slowing operational momentum returning in the coming quarters.Snap Inc. daily active users. Source: Company IRIn terms of earnings, SNAP remains unprofitable with consensus estimates expecting the company to report a loss of $0.205 this year and a loss of $0.12 in 2020. Higher average revenue per user, up 37% y/y to $1.91 globally in Q2 is favorable, but the company needs to more than double this amount going forward to approach profitability. This becomes challenging considering they are competing with various other platforms including Facebook Inc.'s Instagram (FB) and even China's Tik-Tok among others for the same advertising dollars.According to consensus estimates, SNAP is expected to remain unprofitable over the next year with an EPS loss of -$0.20 in 2019 and -$0.15 in 2020. The estimates face downside should user growth lose momentum, which is our base case. The stock currently trades at 16x sales with -$491 million in negative free cash flow over the past year.Data by YChartsWith Spectacles 3, Snap is trying to prove that wearable cameras are ""a thing"" and that consumers are willing to pay $380 for what is essentially an accessory the Snapchat app. While SNAP has big plans for the future of AR technology, we see the company is set up to strike out here with the third iteration of the Spectacles product.User growth in Q2 may have been based on a temporary boost from the introduction of new filters, and we're skeptical the company can maintain this momentum. SNAP remains unprofitable and will need to significantly increase average revenue per user from current levels going forward to justify lofty valuations. We remain bearish on the stock and see the recent rally in the stock price as another opportunity to sell. Waning user growth momentum in the coming quarter may be a catalyst for a return in negative sentiment."

This rise comes after two straight impressive quarters that saw its user base return to growth and earnings beats in every area of its business. As I previously wrote, this reversal ""renewed optimism in the company"" and pushed some analysts to quickly ""predict a turnaround.""However, investors should remain wary that despite improved results, Snap still faces many of the same questions investors asked before and right after its 2017 IPO. The company’s future growth prospects are still uncertain and it continues to have issues attracting advertisers to advertise on its platform. This article will explain that despite progress in 2019, Snapchat has limited growth prospects and is clearly overvalued.Snapchat’s main problem is that nearly all of its users come from one demographic, the 13 to 34-year-old age group. While this is not inherently an issue, it makes future growth opportunities unclear. Even though the company did post total daily active users (DAU) growth of 8% in Q2, this was an outlier from past periods of consistent stagnation.Source: Snap Q2 Earnings PresentationSlow growth is due to the fact that in its main market, the United States, it has nearly reached a user peak. Snapchat is already used by 90% of those between 13-24 and 75% of those between 13-34, meaning there is little room for growth. While it has tried to expand to other age groups, those efforts have not been very successful and the platform remains predominantly for those in younger age groups. This ceiling has caused continued sluggish growth in the US, with DAU increasing just 3% (in North America) in the most recent quarter.Faced with bleak growth prospects at home, Snapchat has looked overseas, particularly in developing countries, to try and fuel user growth. One way it has worked towards this is by launching an updated Android app that is faster and more user-friendly. Management partially credits this change for strong growth in its rest of world users (countries outside of Europe and North America), which jumped 21% YOY.However, can this growth be continued? Internationally, Snapchat has not been able to clearly differentiate itself from its competitors. Instead of being primarily a social platform, it is seen as more of messaging app. As a result, it has not gained much traction and operates in a highly competitive environment with larger companies such as Facebook’s (FB) WhatsApp and Line (LN) along with regional apps such as KakaoTalk in Korea. Additionally, even after recent growth, Snapchat has just 56 million total international users. This is tiny when compared to WhatsApp’s 400 million users in just India and Instagram’s 70 million users in Brazil.Even after recent advances, Snapchat still must answer a lingering question. How will the company be able to grow its user base? It must do much more than simply rebuild its Android app. Management must differentiate the platform so it is unique from the hundreds of other messaging apps available. If it cannot accomplish this and the inevitable halt in user growth occurs, the subsequent results will be disastrous for Snap. The company got a taste of this pain when the stock fell over 60% in 2018 when stagnant DAU numbers disappointed investors. The same may happen again.Another enduring problem for Snapchat is that it has consistently had trouble luring advertisers to its platform. While advertising costs have fallen significantly from its peak, the costs of developing high-quality content make overall advertising still quite expensive. For many companies, they cannot simply recycle what they used elsewhere such as on Facebook or Instagram. This is especially true for Snapchat’s new augmented reality (AR) advertising products. While the feature has overall been quite successful for advertisers, creating AR experiences, known as lenses, is expensive and does not always lead to high rates of engagement and conversion. Kerry Flynn for Digiday wrote that:Later, she concludes that ""Indeed, lenses still appear as a brand-safety concern.""Additionally, Snapchat has been hurt from increased competition by its direct rival in the US, Facebook-owned Instagram. Both social platforms target a similar audience and after Instagram launched its stories feature, both offer similar features. However, Instagram is widely more popular than Snapchat with over 1 billion monthly users and over 500 million DAU on Instagram stories alone. This greater reach, along with better targeting capabilities and performance-monitoring tools, is why nearly all advertisers prefer Instagram over Snapchat.These combined factors cause Snapchat to struggle to attract advertisers. Even after offering new products such as Snap Select and making it easier to create ads through its Instant Create workshop, the company still has not been able to fill all of its advertising slots. Jeremi Gorman, Chief Business Officer, said on Snap’s Q2 Conference Call that:Snapchat still has not resolved its advertising uncertainties. It must accomplish this for investors to be able to confidently invest in the stock.Snapchat in the past has been incredibly successful at attracting and retaining users. Its retention rate was incredibly strong with 95% of those who were active after one year remaining active five years later. However, as Snapchat seeks to make more money off each user through increased ads, those strong retention rates may shift lower. Surveys have found that Snapchat users were some of the most likely people to skip ads with 69% of overall users and 80% of those between 18-24 reporting that they “often” skipped ads. This trend makes it very clear that users are strongly against video ads that disrupt their app experience.However, in an appeal to potential advertisers, Snapchat introduced new 6-second unskippable ads in April 2019 as part of its new Snap Select ad product. The video ads are placed in some of Snapchat’s most premium content and management promoted it as a way for advertisers to effectively target their desired audience. However, a by-product of Snap Select was the immense outrage voiced by users as a result of the increased amount of commercials. As Select continues to be ramped-up in the future, Snapchat may be able to increase monetization and revenues. At the same time though, it is risking the very users its business depends on.Even though Snapchat achieved 48% YOY revenue growth in Q2 and expects an additional 40% increase in Q3, the company is overvalued. Underneath those numbers, its user base is growing sluggishly and Snap’s ability to increase monetization with a stagnant user base is uncertain. In addition, its recent debt offering puts into question when the company will be able to become profitable. In its effort to expand its app features and drive engagement, Snap has and will continue to experience higher expenses related to investments in new ventures such as AR technology and its own gaming platform. These investments are necessary but will test the patience of anxious investors.At current prices, other social media companies look more attractive. One pick is Facebook. In the second quarter, it also reported an increase of 8% in its DAU but off a much larger base than Snapchat. Its 8% increase represented an additional 116 million users compared to Snap’s increase of just around 15 million. Additionally, Facebook is a very profitable company and also much more mature. Its advanced data capabilities allow it to offer more to advertisers and makes it easier for them to increase monetization of their users. Finally, Facebook’s PS ratio is significantly lower than Snapchat’s.Snapchat’s revival in 2019 has been driven by clear positive change in its underlying business. However, the stock’s rally has gone too far and ignores glaring concerns in Snap’s business that still remain unresolved. While its DAU jumped in Q2, this is likely an outlier and will be difficult to replicate in the upcoming quarters. While expansion into international markets looks promising, it will face fierce competition from larger and more entrenched competitors. Additionally, the company continues to have trouble attracting advertisers, proven by the company’s admission that ad supply exceeds demand. Finally, Snap’s increased monetization efforts threaten its user base who are already fed up with the increased amounts of advertising. Investors looking to invest in social media should turn to more attractive options such as Facebook and avoid Snapchat."
4293447,102646,2019-09-25T10:51:38-04:00,"Snap is up by almost 200% this year driven by the perceived turnaround.
        I argue that Snap holders should exit the company now before the upcoming earnings on a risk-reward basis.
        I also argue that the company continues to face old challenges like those on demographics.","Snap (SNAP) stock has soared by almost 200% this year as investors have cheered the company’s turnaround. The company has had two impressive quarters, with stronger daily active users and increased engagements. The company has also increased its guidance for the year. Further, investors have been impressed by the company’s increased innovation that has seen it move into gaming and augmented reality. The surge in the stock price means that Snap is now valued at more than $20 billion. In this article, we will explain why we recommend shorting the stock at the current level. First, the company’s growth concerns will continue to remain especially as its core demographic ages. Second, we believe that the current company’s growth does not justify the premium valuation.Snap released its Q2 earnings on July 23rd. In the quarter, the company reported that it had more than 203 million daily active users, which was a 7% increase. This increase in the DAU was also accompanied by a stronger average revenue per user, which increased by 37% to $1.91. Revenue increased by almost 50% to more than $388 million while gross margins increased by 17% to 46%. While these numbers were good, the company continued to generate losses. Net losses narrowed slightly to $255 million. Shortly after the quarter, the company went to the debt market where it raised more than $1.1 billion in convertible senior notes due in 2026.When Snap went public, most analysts were concerned that the company’s app could face growth problems. In the quarters that followed, this growth moved lower as investors expected. This was partly because of the perceived competition from Instagram and the company’s disastrous redesign of its app. This led the stock price to drop to $5. To many investors, these fears have dissipated following the positive results of the past two quarters.However, we submit that the previous growth concerns that investors had still continue. The company’s app is still popularly used by young people who are under 34 years. 90% of these users are between 12 years and 24 years. On a positive note, this allows the company’s advertisers to target this demographic, which is key when it comes to spending.However, the two concerns I have is that as these young people continue to age, they will use Snap less. A good example of this is what happened with Facebook, which has seen the number of posts start to decline. Indeed, I believe that we are already seeing this. In a recent report by eMarketer, the company said that it expects the users in the US to start declining. Another report by SensorTower said that the number of app downloads in the US was declining. All this action has led to a decline in the company’s revenue growth as shown below. We expect this growth to weaken further especially as companies and investors continue to price-in a recession. Already, we have seen many SAAS companies report weaker numbers, which is an indication that companies are holding back on spending. The chart below shows the company’s revenue quarterly revenue growth.Valuation has come to focus as investors have focused on the problems revealed by WeWork. For years, investors have given these loss-making companies a pass because they believe that the company will be profitable in future. The challenge with Snap is that its revenue growth is slowing and the number of users has remained relatively flat as seen in the chart below.Source: Seeking AlphaWith the company struggling to grow in North America, the company has turned to overseas where it is trying to establish itself as a serious social media platform. The challenge with this is that most young people don’t have the resources that their North American counterparts have. In addition, most companies there don’t seem to have a need for an additional advertising platform. Instead, they are focused on leveraging the success of Instagram, Facebook, and Google. Consider the following statement published in DigiDay:At the same time, the company is currently trading at 9x forward sales. This is a higher premium than the likes of Facebook and Twitter which have a forward PS ratio of 6.5 and 7 respectively. Further, the company has a negative EV to EBITDA multiple of 77. Compare this with that of Facebook and Twitter which have a forward EV to EBITDA multiple of 12 and 22 respectively. A negative EV to EBITDA multiple is usually a sign that a company has significant problems. Further, the company is operating at a negative free cash flows, which is possibly the reason why it recently raised money. Therefore, with such poor numbers, we believe that Snap should not be trading at a premium valuation.Snap has been a great stock for investors. Its recent growth has seen the company being compared to Twitter, which was once written-off as a failure. However, the reality is that Snap continues to face significant challenges. Its growth has relatively stalled and its valuation multiples don’t make sense especially for a company that has never turned a profit. Therefore, we recommend that investors should either avoid the company or short it."
4285194,104227,2019-08-13T14:07:34-04:00,"Snap has delivered strong earnings in 2019, and in Q2, its user base returned to growth following several quarters of stagnation.Snap's focus on engagement has led to improvements in its content platform, something that has attracted more advertisers.Snap’s new gaming platform and AR technologies provide more features for users and are helping to turn the app into an ecosystem, rather than just a messaging service.However, many of the same problems Snap once faced remain and investors should wait for more clarity.","Snap’s (SNAP) 2019 earnings revived hope in a company that has suffered greatly since its IPO in 2017. In both Q1 and Q2, it beat on users, revenue, and EPS, pushing the stock above its IPO price for the first time since early 2018. In Q2, it reported growth of 8% in daily active users (DAU), a pleasant reversal from past quarters of stagnation or even DAU decline. This reversal in Snap’s fortunes has led to renewed optimism in the company once considered by many to be the future of social media. Strong recent performance has pushed one analyst to predict a turnaround and even call the stock a “Cinderella Story.”Snap’s revival has been driven by a focus on engagement and the increase in more interesting content on its platform. Instead of being content with simply dominating messaging, it has expanded to other areas such as video and shows, gaming, and AR. This article will analyze Snap’s efforts to expand its service while increasing capabilities for advertisers while discussing the issues still facing the business.An early concern for Snapchat was the lack of engagement on the platform beyond simply messaging. Management recognized this, which is why they have consistently focused on turning Snapchat from a messaging app into an overarching ecosystem that users can turn to for everything in their lives from following their friends to learning about the latest news. A key part of this is their Discover platform. First introduced in 2015, Discover was meant to be Snapchat’s content platform, providing news and TV shows to users. After its launch, though, the feature was not met with overwhelming success. It was reported that less than a quarter of users even used it and it was far from the go-to media source Snapchat envisioned. The company tried to boost Discover in 2018 with a major app redesign, but instead, it angered millions of users and was threatened with the loss of some of its most valuable influencers from the platform.While those efforts failed horrifically, the company has since taken more subtle actions to boost the feature. These efforts include working with publishers to create more interesting and engaging content for users. One such example is ESPN. While in the past ESPN’s content on Snapchat consisted primarily of previously published articles from its website, it has since shifted to more video content and now offer to Snapchat users their popular “SportsCenter” and “ESPN Daily” programs. This shift has been successful for both parties and has pushed ESPN to increase its activity on Snapchat with the new weekly “ESPN MMA Show.”New content has been successful at driving more usage of Discover. In the second quarter, its audience grew by 35% YOY. Along with that, people were using Discover more and the average time spent on it per day grew by over 60%. These increases were also helped by Snap opening Discover up to new non-exclusive video shows. In Discover, publishers have found that they can attract a new audience for content after it has already appeared on Facebook and YouTube. Popular shows, such as BuzzFeed’s “Worth It” and Complex Networks’ “Sneaker Shopping,” have appeared on Discover after they were specifically edited to fit a Snapchat audience.Beyond content, Snap has looked to increase engagement by expanding its app into gaming. In April 2019, it introduced Snap Games, a platform where users can play real-time multiplayer games with their friends while texting. On this platform, it launched its first original game, Bitmoji Party, along with several others that so far have received surprisingly good reviews. The platform is monetized through short ads which users can watch in order to receive advantages in the games. Later, Snap may add in-game purchases to further increase its monetization.Snap is also developing other projects that it believes will be important in the future. One important area it has been building is its augmented reality (AR) features. It recently launched AR Lenses, something that has quickly become popular with over 200 million users using it in just the first two weeks. In response, Snap has invested heavily into its Lens studio, a desktop program for creators to make AR experiences, which Snap calls Lenses. Over half a million Lenses have already been created and engagement with these new AR experiences has been strong.Snapchat has always been able to offer an extremely valuable asset to advertisers: the ability to promote directly to the valuable 13-34 year-old demographic. However, demand for advertising on Snapchat in the past has always been lower than one would expect. The combination of high prices, poor data capabilities, and the need for custom-designed commercials made it difficult for most to effectively promote on Snapchat.Since then, though, the company has added new features and capabilities that make it easier for advertisers to use Snapchat. In April, it launched a new ad product called Snap Select which allows advertisers to purchase and reserve 6-second unskippable commercials in its premium shows at a fixed CPM. These advertising slots are in some of Snap’s most popular shows and will be extremely valuable for advertisers. David Roter, VP of global agency partnerships, called the new ad product “a direct path to reach Millennial and Gen Z audiences that are increasingly difficult to reach elsewhere.”In addition, Snap launched Instant Create to simplify the process of creating a Snapchat ad for advertisers. Before, developing an effective ad for Snapchat was notoriously expensive. Instant Create streamlines the process into just three simple steps and offers tools that allow advertisers to quickly and inexpensively create unique designs.AR ad products have also attracted companies to use Snapchat to promote their product. Using AR, companies can now place their item into a realistic setting and create an ad experience that is more engaging and fun. If users swipe up, they can activate a branded Lens that allows them to virtually explore the new product. This advertising feature has been successfully used by many companies including HBO (for Game of Thrones) and BMW, whose AR campaign let users experience BMW’s new X2 model in a showroom setting. Both of these campaigns were successful and received positive remarks from users. The BMW AR campaign was particularly engaging and received an average playtime of 54 seconds.Snapchat’s increased ability to attract advertisers coupled with a user base that returned to growth resulted in improved financial results for the company. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 48% YOY to $388 million. Even as revenue has soared, the company has still been able to limit costs while simultaneously investing into new features such as gaming and AR. Total operating expenses were $259 million, a 5% increase but falling 27 percent to 67% of revenue. In fact, Snap has been able to continuously limit operating expenses while still spending over $90 million per quarter on R&D.Source: Snap Q2 Earnings PresentationAs a result, Snap’s loss narrowed in the quarter to just -$0.06 per share, beating EPS expectations of -$0.10.More importantly than sheer revenue, the company showed in Q2 that it still has the ability to increase monetization while still satisfying users. Average revenue per user (ARPU) came in at $1.91, jumping 37% YOY and 14% sequentially. This was driven by strong growth in its largest market, the United States, which led to North American ARPU to rise 42% to $3.14. ARPU growth elsewhere was robust as well including a 43% increase in Europe and a 25% increase elsewhere internationally.While 2019 has been a great year for Snap, the company still faces several problems that it must quickly address. Most significantly, Snap needs to continue to find ways to grow its user base. While 8% DAU growth in Q2 was strong, replicating this will be difficult considering in previous quarters, its DAU count was stagnant or even in decline. The company has almost reached its ceiling in the US with most people in the 13-34-year-old demographic already on the platform. For growth, Snap is turning to international markets, particularly in more developing countries, where it believes its newly updated Android app will help attract millions of new users. However, growth overseas will be a challenge because Snapchat is seen primarily as a messaging app, rather than a social platform. In messaging, it faces heavy competition from apps such as LINE (LN) or Facebook’s (FB) WhatsApp.Additionally, Snap still needs to prove that it can continue to increase its monetization of users. While the number of advertisers using the platform has increased, many still prefer promoting on its competitors such as Instagram. This has caused Snap to struggle to find demand to fill its ad supply, causing ad prices to fall to bargain prices. Snap has made efforts to change this with increased engagement and by offering more valuable ad slots on its Discover platform, a valuable asset for advertisers seeking to attract the attention of the 13-34 age group. However, additional work and capabilities are still needed to prove to advertisers that Snapchat is an effective platform.Snap’s successful 2019 has been driven by exciting developments in its core business. It has worked to become much more than just a messaging app, expanding into areas such as gaming and AR. In addition, new and improved content on its Discover platform has led to increased usage and engagement with the app, a positive sign that attracts both new advertisers and creators. These improvements have led to strong financial growth, with revenue jumping 48% YOY and forecasted to increase an additional 40% YOY in the third quarter. However, despite Snap’s rally, the company still faces similar issues it did before its recovery, namely uncertainty in user growth and demand by advertisers. Right now, Snap’s stock is not yet a buy and investors should wait for more clarity in the future."

It has what it takes to take on Facebook (FB) or at least grab a share of the market, thanks to Generation Z.A while ago, I proposed that Facebook was close to a monopoly, and the only competitor was Snapchat. While Snap might not be a threat to Facebook now, it could become one and the Q2 results proved it.Source: StatistaThe chart above shows the percentage of Snapchat users worldwide by age and gender, and while the bars look quite even, the age brackets are not evenly distributed.Using the UN population tool, we can get the average population distribution by age and compare it with the percentage of users that Snapchat has in each bracket. Considering a target population of 1.5 billion users that have smartphones, we have the following chart.Source: Author's ChartsThe chart shows that current market penetration for Snapchat is peaking at 21, where it has an estimated market penetration of 65%. If we consider that Snapchat can grow only 1% per quarter in total market penetration and keep its current users, Q2 of 2024 will look like this.With this market penetration, Snapchat would have more than half a billion users. The estimate already takes into account mortality rate and population growth for the 13-35 age gap. The increase is consistent with the market estimations in revenue and could be surpassed as the smartphone market grows, and Snapchat can run cheaper devices.Source: Author's ChartsSnap's strategy for keeping the young engaged consists of using its small size to target more precisely that demographic, its biggest rival is Instagram.Snap is pushing four tools to target the young: Discover, Augmented Reality, Games, and non-permanent content. Discover and Instagram TV are very similar. The only way Snap can compete with Instagram is having more content that interests younger people. Snap is making some exciting advances in Augmented Reality, but Facebook has much more cash and firepower.Games and non-permanent content is the only way Snap can outdo the current king of social media. Facebook offers games on its central platform but not on Instagram. WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram offer ""stories"" which are non-permanent, but Snapchat consists only of non-permanent content, and there is its edge.Source: AZ quotesTeenagers have a disadvantage when it comes to Facebook and Instagram. The only memories they have are from their childhood, from which they want to distance themselves. Facebook has managed to capture older generations using nostalgia, but the young are prouder of their present than of their past. Snap allows them only to project their present and forget about the past.Considering revenue growth could range between 26.3% and 34.1%, projecting that gross margin is in the range of 63% and 73.8%, considering R&D as a percentage of revenue is in the range of 33.2% to 32.5%, projecting that G&A as a percentage of revenue has a minimum and maximum of 27.5% and 22.5%, we have the following chart.Source: Author's ChartsThese approximations are in line with the market expectations for Snap in the next couple of years, as the image below shows.Source: Seeking AlphaI like to use Peter Lynch's ratio when valuing a stock.

4277688,22148,2019-07-25T14:54:40-04:00,Snap beat Q2 estimates due in large part to resurgence in DAUs.The company is seeing growth pick up mainly due to lower value Android users outside of North America.The stock has a valuation of $26 billion and will top $30 billion on a likely rally to $20.Investors need to pay attention to the raw numbers that still show substantial losses.,"As predicted, Snap (SNAP) reported solid user growth during Q2. The stock is rallying to post-crash highs, but the raw numbers still aren't that impressive for a stock that now has a market valuation above $26 billion.Image Source: Snapchat websiteThe big debate for the rest of the year will be whether Snapchat usage is just seeing a snap back to Q4'17 levels or whether the company has officially returned to a lasting growth phase.Clearly, daily active users (DAUs) are on a pace to smash the peak from early 2018. Snap reached 191 million DAUs back in Q1'18 and Q2'19 jumped to 203 million DAUs on the back on a redesigned Android app that drove 7 million sequential DAUs in the Rest of World.Source: Snap Q2'19 presentationThe growth in the key North America segment was only 3 million DAUs sequentially and up only 2 million from the 81 million DAU peak back in Q1'18. Europe saw a similar trend where the company turned around the growth path, but the gains weren't substantial.Another key metric is snaps per day where Snapchat saw a huge rebound in demand. This number speaks to the level of engagement on the platform for each DAU. As with any site, the number of DAUs or monthly average users is a great metric, but the ultimate revenue driver is how much a user actually engages on the platform on a daily and monthly basis.In this case, the snaps per day were back up to the peaks at the end of 2017 of 3.5 billion per day. The numbers had dipped to below 3.1 billion snaps per day during 2018.Source: Twitter - Rich GreenfieldPart of the issue is that the snaps per DAU are still below the peak of 20 back in Q3'17. Again here, a big part of the gain in total snaps per day came from Android devices where the average user sent 7% more snaps compared to the old app version.So, Snap is clearly in an uptrend on users whether the company has regained the usage levels of the pre-app redesign. Another issue is whether a shift to more Android usage is actually going to solve some of the financial problems still faced by the social messaging company.The market appears to miss the key diluted share count when valuing the stock. Snap has 1.553 billion shares outstanding. At a $17 stock price, Snap is now worth over $26 billion. For comparisons, Twitter (TWTR) is only worth $29 billion now.The big difference between the social media companies is that Twitter generates a ton of positive cash flow while Snap hasn't come close to turning the corner. The raw financial improvements provided by Snap sound impressive:The issue here is that Snap still produced a quarterly EBITDA loss of $79 million and a free cash flow burn over $100 million. The financial improvements still leave Snap far from even reaching breakeven.Source: Snap Q2'19 presentationThe Q3 guidance for an adjusted EBITDA loss of at least $60 million continues to show the problem facing the social platform that went public back in 2017. The company faces pressures from Facebook (FB) that has historically used Instagram to duplicate the functions on Snapchat that has generally prevented the platform from growing beyond key teenagers.Facebook is being slapped with a $5 billion fine by the FTC, so the company might be less aggressive in targeting Snapchat functions. For now, Snap appears on a path to return to the previous highs of at least $20 reached in early 2018.At $20, Snap would have a market valuation of $30 billion while still vulnerable to Facebook copying functions that prevent the user and revenue growth necessary to reach breakeven financial metrics like EBITDA and FCFs. Even at break even, the stock would have a hard time justifying a stock trading at nearly 15x 2020 revenue estimates.The key investor takeaway is that the stock is playing the momentum game. The rally has gone too far and huge risks still exist preventing the company from achieving the results to warrant a market valuation closing in on $30 billion.Snap likely hits $20 before facing strong resistance along with major questions of how the stock will ever justify the next step of valuing the company at $40 billion or $50 billion that one would need to justify holding Snap above $20. The raw numbers just don't support this rally, much less an even bigger rally."

In the long term, we are bearish on its upside opportunities.Given the global competition landscape in social network space, we think that Snap will at best be the next Twitter.","As technology venture investors, there is nothing we like more than seeing fast-growing tech companies such as Snap (SNAP), Uber (UBER), or Lyft (LYFT) making their way into their IPO rounds. One thing that these companies share in common is, of course, the fact that they all sacrifice today’s profits for future ones. In some cases, it takes a long time before a technology venture becomes profitable, which helps create a perception that a lot of these investments are Ponzi schemes. While we certainly don’t think that is true at all as we are bullish in almost every technology company today, one solid bearish position we have developed for some time is that one of Snap.

Though we are pleased to see such improvement, overall we are still in doubts over Snap’s future potential today even after its strong Q2 earnings call.One of our greater concerns that we did not discuss in-depth in our previous post expressing our doubts on Snap’s IPO readiness is Snap’s ability to expand its market size. Often times we argue that Snap’s core business is more of a feature than an app. The general demographics that Snap targets is pretty much the 18 - 34-year-old iOS and mid-to-high-end Android smartphone users in developed markets. Currently, as reported in the Q2 earnings call, Snap’s latest DAU is 203 million, though it does not report how much of its user base it can successfully monetize.On the other hand, Twitter (TWTR), what we think is one of its competitors alongside Facebook (FB), always reports mDAU (Monetizable DAUs). Twitter’s last reported mDAU in Q2 2019 is 139 million. While Snap aims to be a camera company, we are unfortunately not seeing how the Spectacle product can help Snap secure its larger addressable market at scale and how it is changing the camera industry. We see Snap as a social media stock, which will continue generating its revenue out of advertisement money through monetizing its UGC (User Generated Content). Therefore, its ability to monetize its user base is critical to its revenue growth. Though Snap is currently enjoying its growth in Q2, sooner or later Snap will have to implement a similar growth strategy by following Facebook and Twitter footsteps to serve the international audiences in major developing countries and monetize further from there. Somehow, we think that on the way before that happens, Snap will be trading sideways again, while after that happens, that could be where the ultimate growth problem will begin.Some of the particular reasons why Twitter and Facebook are so successful is that there is a critical problem-solving use case that creates stickiness as they evolve as a social network. For Twitter, it is the news headline use case where its platform enables users to microblog latest news or trends in real-time. For Facebook, it is the chat and photo-sharing application which includes Messenger, Whatsapp, or Instagram product lines which enable its users to regularly send texts, share photos, and, as we see in most of the Asian countries, conduct businesses.(Source: Author, compiled using data from the companies’ fillings. Overall comparison of Snap, Twitter, and Facebook)With Snap, we do not yet see any of these problem-solving use cases as we imagine it evolving from its current state today. Claiming itself to be a camera company, we believe that Snap changes neither camera nor social network industry globally in a problem-solving way. There is obviously a younger demographic niche market in the developed world that Snap will be able to retain and monetize handsomely. Given the strong competitive landscape already set by better-positioned players like Tiktok/Bytedance, LINE, Kakao, and even YouTube/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in markets where Snap could potentially further its growth, we strongly feel that Snap should stick to it and optimize its strategy in its current market so it would not need to fuel its growth through burning $800 million in cash on average each year. Unfortunately, however, even assuming Snap could seize that opportunity, we are confident enough that Snap would not be the next Facebook anyway. At best, it would be the next Twitter in terms of profitability and scale.To be fair, we also feel that by looking at the direction it took, Twitter would never be as big a social media competitor as Facebook. Twitter realized it, and it took a less risky approach by optimizing the monetization of all of its core business through advertising and data licensing. As of last year, Twitter’s overall net income of $1.2 billion is still higher than what Snap made throughout 2018.This Q2, Snap has shown that it has done its homework through major product redesign and that there is a huge advertising revenue potential in AR (Augmented Reality)-driven contents. Snap grew its DAU by 6.8% to 203 million compared to the previous quarter.(Source: Snap’s Q2 2019 10-Q Report. Improved Quarterly ARPU in Q2 2019)At the same time, Snap’s ARPU also improved to a level similar to its all-time-high of $2.09, driven by the increased advertisers’ spending within Snap’s redesigned platform. In the short term, particularly throughout Q3, we feel that this momentum will stay as advertisers will need some time to review its ROI before entering the more opportunistic spending for the holiday season in Q4. Q3 will be an important quarter for Snap to prove that it has an engaging user base which would drive ROI for advertisers.(Source: Stockrow. Revenue growth comparison of Snap, Twitter, and Facebook)However, of course, our concern is the one for the longer term. One thing we learned from analyzing Snap and its competitors in the social network space is that the annual revenue growth rate for the market would slow down to around 25% to 30% sometime after reaching later-stage profitability. We also learned that Snap had reached some critical mass as its revenue growth has come down to a more sustainable level. Facebook, in particular, had done great to be able to even grow its revenue higher at 50% - 60% YoY around the 2014 - 2016 after it reached both critical mass and profitability level. This is why taking Facebook as a comparison to Snap would not be quite relevant. As it stands today, Snap can not grow higher than 40% YoY without being unprofitable.As of the end of last year, we observed that Snap’s P/S ratio stood at 6.04. While it may seem like the stock was slightly undervalued compared to the prior years, it was more of a sign that the market back then had a similar concern to ours when it comes to growth potential. This year, given the major improvements in the platform, we have seen Snap’s P/S climbed back to 11.8 and 13.8 for Q1 and Q2 2019 respectively. Trading at close to its IPO price per share of $17, this could be the right opportunity for more risk-taking short-term traders to somehow come in “at cost” with better unit economics and see how Snap takes advantage of the momentum in Q2. For us as a long-term investor, it would be a very difficult task to value Snap. One thing we know for sure is we still do not feel that Snap is the one to hold.We think that the lack of strong problem-solving use cases will hurt Snap in the long term, and especially during crunch time when the management has to make the decision where to take the company in order to further its growth. Q2 was exciting for all of us as we are seeing improvements in DAU and advertising revenue. However, we are still under the impression that the trend will not last. As venture capitalists, we have seen technology companies hit boom or bust. In the social network space, there is arguably only one boom, which is Facebook. We stand by our initial thesis that there is not much conviction that: 1) Snap is more than a social media company, 2) Snap is more than just a feature than an app, and 3) Snap will be well-positioned to secure the larger market-share globally and be the next Facebook. Snap will at best be the next Twitter."
4278747,25120,2019-07-29T15:40:07-04:00,"Snap is demonstrating on accelerating revenue growth, driven by greater ARPU.The company is delivering on a modest reduction in operating losses, yet much more work remains to be done.I have been too cautious in the past and unfortunately did not buy long dated upside calls, yet current valuations look more than fair.","Snap (SNAP) has made a real comeback in 2019. In February I noted that the company has reported solid results for 2018 as operating momentum was a first step, yet much more work was to be done in 2019.I was concerned about engagement and fierce competition and in hindsight have been a bit too cautious on the back of these concerns and losses. After a few very strong quarters shares have tripled in the time frame of just half a year, as accelerating revenue growth has made investors quite optimistic about Snap, although much more (margin) works remains to be done.Snap reported a 43% increase in revenues in 2018 which came in at $1.18 billion. The company reported a staggering loss of $1.27 billion on this revenue base, which believe it or not was down nearly two-thirds compared to the year before when huge stock-based compensation in connection to the IPO caused very large losses.The company reported adjusted losses as well and on the back of this methodology losses narrowed from $712 million in 2017 to $612 million in 2018, yet it kindly excludes $538 million in real dilutive and thereby costly stock-based compensation expenses as well. Note that this is even more costly for shareholders when shares are down a lot, which was certainly the case last year.On the bright side, the company has seen adjusted fourth quarter losses narrow from $156 million in Q4 of 2017 to $59 million in the final quarter of 2018. At this rate the company was posting sales in excess of $1.5 billion per annum with realistic losses seen around $750 million.Alongside the release of the fourth quarter results the company guided for first quarter revenues of $285-$310 million, marking 24-34% growth on an annual basis. Adjusted EBITDA was seen at $140-165 million, losses that are. Revenues did actually increase by 39% to $320 million as the EBITDA loss of $123 million was better than guided for as well. Note that an adjusted loss of nearly $131 million excluded nearly $163 million in stock-based compensation expenses as well, for large realistic losses of nearly $300 million. The company guided for second quarter revenues of $335-$360 million, or 28-37% growth on an annual basis, while EBITDA losses were seen at $125-$150 million. Second quarter revenue growth accelerated to 48% as revenues of $388 million far exceeded the original guidance. An EBITDA loss of $79 million was better than expected as well. While an adjusted loss of $82 million looks compelling, it again excludes $196 million in stock-based compensation, for a realistic loss of around $280 million.The company sees continued improvements with third quarter sales seen at $410-$435 million, marking 37-46% expected growth as recent momentum has been very strong. Adjusted EBITDA losses are seen flattish on a sequential basis at $60-$85 million.Note that the issuance of shares makes that the reported losses do not entirely ¨eat¨ the cash balances, although cash balances have fallen to $1.18 billion, with no debt obligations outstanding other than some lease liabilities. A diluted share count of 1.36 billion shares trading at $18 per share makes for an equity valuation of $24.5 billion and an enterprise valuation of little over $23 billion.This compares to just $6 billion around Christmas time last year when shares were trading at just $5 and change, before three strong quarterly earnings reports hit the newswires. Note that the fully diluted share count even hits 1.53 billion upon conversion of all the award to employees. This makes that the valuation is even $3 billion higher compared to the calculations above.With revenues seen around $1.6 billion this year, it goes without saying that a 15 times sales multiple seems high as losses remain quite high as well. While adjusted loss are roughly cut in half so far this year compared to last year, we have to note that stock-based compensation (a real expense) is up year over year. Hence I see modest leverage on the bottom line alongside the spectacular revenue growth year yet note that economic losses are still very steep at near a billion per annum.To illustrate the huge extent of stock-based compensation: stock-based compensation totalled $196 million for the second quarter alone for little over 2,700 workers, equivalent to $73,000 per worker. Note that this applies just for the quarterly period. Hence it is needless to say this is not just an extra, but marks a core component of the pay package to workers.Safe to say the company is doing something very good as 48% revenue growth came with just a 8% increase in the number of daily active users. The user base of 208 million is relatively modest compared to some other platforms. Reported ARPU of $1.91 is relatively modest versus some other platforms as well, with North American ARPU surpassing $3, while Europe and the rest of the world are stuck around a dollar.I have been somewhat attracted to Snap given its relative small footprint and notably in recent times relatively modest valuation based on sales multiples in relation to reported growth. The issue however was that this revenue growth was accompanied by very steep losses, which remains the case today.By now revenue growth has accelerated yet sales multiples have expanded at the same time as well, while progress on the bottom line is relatively modest. On the other hand, the space remains interesting for large technology companies although large scale M&A is not really apparent anymore as Facebook (FB) was an obvious buyer but bought Instagram and Whatsapp and Microsoft (MSFT) acquired LinkedIn.Unfortunately I founded long-dated call option premiums too pricey to make a bet on the shares, as that would have created a potential great pay-off. Congratulations on all those believing in the shares earlier this year and late 2018, yet at current times I can only remain on the sidelines."
4278934,102101,2019-07-30T09:52:49-04:00,Bears keep underestimating the tailwind from the expanding digital ad market.DAU re-acceleration and improved app engagement will continue to drive more ad revenue.Snap is not revisiting the low-teens to single-digit share price territory anytime soon.Bears need to see beyond DAU growth and explore the positive drivers of app engagement.,"When you're ravaging and disrupting an industry, your tiny mistakes are invisible, and your big mistakes become tiny.Anytime I review Snap's (SNAP) earnings report after a quarterly beat, I can't help but remember some of the lyrics to a popular song by American rapper Wale.Source: RapGeniusT.V. disrupted the radio, the internet disrupted T.V., and here we are with Instagram, Twitter (TWTR), and Snapchat. The T.V. industry makes its money from ads by grabbing people's attention for a prolonged time in which they are alternatively served entertaining content with ads interspersed.Source: ZenithData from the measurement company, Zenith, is forecasting that users around the world will spend more time online than they do watching TV. Snap bears have given me a bad rap for sticking to a net bullish thesis. I ended my last article with a HOLD rating as data from eMarketer projects the digital marketing industry will continue taking market share from T.V. The stock is up 22% since I published the article. I understand the need to pay attention to the stagnating DAU growth narrative. However, that narrative bows to an ever-growing digital ad market. A lot of bulls have lost money as a result of this simple fact. It's not sufficient to short a stock if the overall industry is rapidly expanding.A similar development is playing out in EV and video rentals. Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) continue to defy the intense gravitational pull of short-sellers because people want to drive electric cars to work and return home to Netflix and Chill with their family. It's a cultural shift, and a mistake older investors keep making.In the case of Snap, there is also the issue of growing competition. Regardless, Snap has been able to increase impressions and engagement, thereby creating more ad real estate and inventory to sell to advertisers. That's how you make money.Source: SnapI have to admit I was wrong on the positive impact of the incremental DAU growth and Android app redesign. My bullish thesis revolves around Snap games and a better ad engine. The 37% growth in ARPU means Snap was able to raise ad prices even in the face of the dilutive effect of DAU reacceleration and stiff competition. The fact that Snap was able to increase ARPU means user engagement has significantly improved.I won't be too much in haste to bet big on Snap. The platform is still in the early innings of the engagement uncertainty phase that Twitter battled in 2016. DAU means nothing if users are only logging in once a month to check if anything has changed. My biggest bet is still on gaming though the younger generation of Snap users are proving to be increasingly content with just their filters and creative lenses.Investors should beware of the dangers inherent in underestimating Snap's ability to capture more market share. Remember, Snap isn't taking market share from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), it's taking it from T.V. and radio, and advertisers see it as appropriate to allocate more marketing spend to online ads as users spend more time on their phone compared to T.V.I'll be valuing Snap based on its projected ARPU acceleration and DAU growth. I'll present a DCF valuation later in the month.Source: AuthorI expect ARPU growth to accelerate to $2.38 exiting 2019 driven by more user engagement on Snap gaming, filters, and lens refresh. I’m estimating DAU to maintain a 4% QoQ growth exiting 2019 which will decelerate to 3% as more users reengage with the app. I expect the price-to-sale ratio to stay moderate assuming Snap exits 2019 with revenue of $1.693 billion.Given the assumptions, Snap could see further market cap gain, which will see shares rising to $20 with a further acceleration to $26/share if the momentum is sustained in 1H’2020.Source: AuthorThe table above provides a range of quarterly revenue run rate in 2019 at a varying P/S. Risk-averse investors would opt for a moderate to low quarterly revenue run rate, which would drive a low P/S ratio. In that scenario, Snap could touch $9/share. On the other hand, exiting 2019 at a quarterly revenue run rate of $700 million and a P/S multiple of 20 would result in a share price of $26 assuming shares outstanding of 1,405 million.Assuming a 50/50 possibility of exiting 2019 at $10/share (which represents the lower bound/bearish case) and $20/share (which represents the upper bound/bullish case), the average payoff to be derived for investing in shares of Snap will be a -13% loss to the current trading price. This average payoff rises if we increase the upper bound above $20/share. With over 200 million DAU, Snap is more likely to trade above $20/share versus the sub $10/share bears are expecting.I reiterate a HOLD rating with a price target of $20 as I see more prospects beyond 2020 with gaming and the improved ad platform set to outperform and drive more advertisers to Snap."
4275709,102101,2019-07-18T10:26:44-04:00,"An Android app redesign will not suffice to drive DAU growth.Snap trades at a lofty P/S valuation, while it requires more investment to solidify its new bets.Gaming has a strong potential to drive the next $1 billion in revenue.The growing digital ads market remains the best, short-term growth catalyst.Initiating a BUY rating is expensive at the current market cap of $21 billion, though an earnings beat can drive unexpected market euphoria.","While Snap (SNAP) primarily derives its revenue from ad real estates driven by lenses, filters and the discover section, its forays into gaming hold strong prospects for it to achieve the $2.11 billion in annual revenue, which is the median analyst estimate in 2020. While this estimate seems lofty on paper, missing this estimate will lead to a significant stock correction, and we might retouch single-digit stock price just like 2018.A lot of bulls have been trying to understand the reason for Snap's stagnating DAUs. This is because the DAU is a key driver of growth and revenue. If Snap is able to raise its DAUs significantly, it will create more ad inventory for the company to sell to advertisers without increasing the price, thereby ensuring it remains competitive. As a big fan of Snap, I did some research into the claim by the company that it can reach 90% of US teenagers. If that claim is valid, that means Snap is still supposed to be trending like Instagram and Twitter (TWTR). In the course of my research, I found the chart below.Source: Google TrendsInstagram is hot like fire. The momentum has been never-ending since the app launched in 2012. It's obvious these teenagers are spending their time on Instagram, not Snapchat.Source: Google TrendsHowever, If we take a closer look at the chart above (leaving out other social media platforms), you'll notice a spike. It appears there is a resurgence. After the Android app redesign, Snap's CEO highlighted the observed increase in user engagement during the last earnings call. If that's true, how easy will it be for the company to sustain the newfound momentum? Will the momentum last and what does this mean to advertisers and Snap's valuation?Firstly, while Snap's app redesign was a step in the right direction, the reality is that some users have moved on to other social media platforms. While most have not entirely abandoned the app, they spend less time on it, making it tough for Snap to grow its ad inventory. This means the company will require more than a redesign to gain the users back. To achieve this, the company is set to mimic the latest social trend, most notably TikTok. TikTok is a new social media platform for short-form music content. By doing this, Snap is trying to skate to where the puck will be. The new strategy for social media platforms is to emulate the latest trend and style of communicating. While TikTok is still in the early innings of becoming a worldwide craze, it's a good strategy to try to beat it at its own game. Snap suffered a similar fate when it released Stories, and it's competitively apt that it's learning how the game is played.Asides TikTok, Snap is investing in three key areas that can potentially improve its market valuation.Gaming: Investing in gaming is a brilliant move due to the new 5G technology that is going to be rolled out next year. One of Snap's weaknesses had been the data-heavy issue with the app. Snap consumes a lot of data, and this has restricted its usage to developed countries where internet speed is super fast. Users in other emerging markets are mostly the upper-middle class and rich kids who can afford the considerable cost of a reliable 4G network.The new iPhone that will be released in 2020 is going to be 5G-enabled. That's a significant boost to Snap's user experience, a move which will usher in a new demographic of teenage gamers who have mostly been hanging out on Twitch and YouTube. Just like 4G made Instagram and other data-heavy platforms a possibility, 5G is going to make it easier for even more data-intensive mobile-based workloads to become mainstream. This is going to drive DAUs. More DAUs mean more app engagement, which will ultimately drive more ad real estate. Currently, Snap makes money from the games via the six-second-long videos that pops-up in-game. However, the company hasn't stated if that's already significantly impacting revenue.Ad engine: Snap's ad engine is now self-serve. This is the bread and butter of its revenue model. This new programmatic platform will make it easy for brands to manage and optimize their campaigns to set marketing goals. While it's still not as robust as Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DoubleClick or Ads platform, the gap in capabilities keeps narrowing as it will only get better with time. Though it will take longer for Snap's ad inventory to command the same premium pricing as Facebook (FB), Twitter, or Google due to its smaller DAUs and ad engagement time.Content: Getting content right is like a chicken and egg situation. Since users are porting to other platforms, getting publishers to stick around is going to be a daunting task. If users can attract more followers on Instagram or achieve easy fame on TikTok because it is new, and there is less competition, the incentive to remain on Snap is weak. Snap will require more than an app redesign or filters to get new users back. Like TikTok which has partnered with artists and music labels to allow its users legal access to copyrighted music, Snap needs to find creative ways for its users to create content on its platform. It's beginning to look like filters, bitmojis, and lenses won't suffice to convince advertisers to cut the next billion-dollar check in yearly ad revenue.Data from SensorTower confirms that Snap was the most downloaded social media mobile app in the U.S. in Q2'19.Source: SensorTowerWhile this echoes BofA's case for renewed optimism, the global app install data is pointing otherwise.Source: SensorTowerSnap is a distant fourth, behind its most feared competitors. This confirms the bear thesis that Snap is still lagging Instagram and new entrant TikTok in the fight for social media market share of the teen and relatively younger internet demographic.Data by YChartsSnap's valuation remains more pricey compared to competitors. Getting advertisers to allocate more money to Snap ads will require the company to come up with more creative ways to drive DAUs and user retention. The emergence of TikTok has proven that Snap has more competitors to battle, and this will only drive up its customer acquisition and infrastructure costs as echoed by Lara Sweet in the last earnings call. I expect gaming to drive the next leg of Snap's growth. While the bulk of the investment has been laid down over the past two years, getting the kind of traction and audience that the likes of Twitch and YouTube command will require more reinvestment.Snap CEO highlighted this in the last earnings call:Data by YChartsTherefore, until the gaming platform becomes mainstream, I expect Snap's margins to remain fairly steady with minimal tailwinds. This will continue to make valuation ratios below the gross margin line comparatively bloated.Source: eMarketerWhile Snap's gaming platform is an investment that can yield outsized returns in terms of user growth and app engagement, it is still not clear how the company will marry it with its ad model to drive significant revenue growth. Snap is currently overvalued compared to competitors using its price/sales ratio. At a forward P/S ratio of 13, investors are expecting revenue of $1.6 billion in 2019 and $2.11 billion in 2020. Snap did $1.18 billion in revenue in 2018. Hitting the lofty 2019 and 2020 marks is going to require a lot of growth in DAUs for Snap to be able to justify the corresponding ARPU growth that will ensue. While I don't think it's unachievable, it will come at a huge cost on the income statement. If investors are willing to overlook this, there is a case to be made to hold the stock at the current valuation. However, I don't expect a significant price appreciation in the near term.Therefore, I will be initiating a HOLD rating as the growing digital ad market remains the only clear-cut revenue catalyst in the near term."
4280662,104703,2019-08-02T09:35:42-04:00,"Snap shares are surging to $17.25/share, up over 16% from the close of the market. This comes on top of a nearly 5% run heading into earnings.Snap had what appears to be a phenomenal Q2, with user growth and ARPU blowing out numbers. Operating leverage is kicking in, and losses are shrinking.I made my SA debut anticipating a continued downturn in growth, a deceleration in ARPU, and thus sluggish price action in the stock. Let's just say, my mind has changed.The long-term reward of the business is much greater than the risk. One of my few problems with Snap's stock has to do with the company's valuation.Rating reiterated at HOLD, PT raised from $10 to $19.50.","I made my Seeking Alpha debut with an article on Snap (SNAP) expressing my concerns about the company's current fundamentals and future trajectory. That was on August 8, 2018. Since then, I have written an additional five articles on Snap. At one point in time, I was short Snap via puts and locked in a solid return when the stock collapsed.While I am not trying to gloat, upon initiating Snap at a sell and an $8 price target, the stock closed at $12.57. Just a few weeks later, the company delivered an earnings release that confirmed my skepticism surrounding the company. Sure enough, the stock crashed, falling far below my $8 target, bottoming in penny-stock territory at $4.82, a ~$6 billion market cap. I was looking pretty smart.However, there is a point in time with every beaten-down stock, including Snap, where the stock simply cannot go any lower. So, I sold my puts and moved from a sell to a hold rating long term. Short term, I had been bullish on the stock because of low analysts estimates and a high short interest. Since bottoming, the stock has risen a staggering 265%. It is now above its $17 IPO price. Analysts are upgrading, investors are buying the rejuvenated growth story, and most importantly, there seem to be less bears on Wall Street.There was a point in time where I would find research reports from analysts suggesting the stock would collapse to the $4-5 area. One example is an analyst from BTIG, who held a $5 price target and a sell. Now, he sits on a buy rating and $20 target.Notice the change of tune:Granted a lot can happen in nine months, has the value of the business really quadrupled in that time frame? Or did the analyst just get the story wrong? I believe it is the later, and analysts are playing a game of catch-up. It is okay for analysts to make mistakes. Heck, I've made a few. But a lot of the propulsion for this rally has to do with analysts raising targets and boosting ratings, energizing the bullish community around the stock. These were the same analysts who were cutting targets into the single digits.I've been at neutral for a while now on Snap, and remain at neutral. I am not buying the stock at ~$17.50. The valuation isn't compelling. Could the stock run to $20 purely based on momentum and short-covering? Sure. It did exactly that back in February of 2018, rising to as high as $21. We all know what happened from there. Snap turned into the poster child for IPOs gone wrong. So, we'll revisit my bear thesis from last August and ask the simple question: Is July 2019 another February 2018 for Snap? Is this rally a head fake?Here were the basic tenets of my bear thesis:To be clear, this was my bear thesis about a year ago, this is not my bear thesis today. Let's look at each of these elements one by one, starting from the bottom and working upward.Continuously missing expectations: This part of the bear thesis has been completely disproven lately, with Snap continuously exceeding expectations for revenue, earnings, DAUs, and ARPU.Here is Snap's actual results versus consensus for EPS.Snap has beat EPS expectations for five consecutive quarters and has beat expectation seven out of the last eight quarters for EPS. At this point in time, Snap continues to make strides towards profitability while still exceeding analysts' estimates. The charts speak for themselves.Notice the long term, generally improving trend in Snap's EPS. The company has gone from losing ~$0.16/share in Q2'17 to losing ~$0.06/share in Q2'19. And this is just the EPS side, we see continued progress on the revenue side.Again, Snap has exceeded revenue expectations consistently for the last five consecutive quarters and has exceeded expectations six out of eight times over the last two years. The company continues to outperform analyst projections, a stark contrast to the company Snap was post-IPO.Nothing unique about Snap: The next part of my Snap bear thesis had to do with Snap's inability to address the elephant in the room, competition (notably Instagram). This point, as evident by Snap's Q2 user growth data, no longer holds any water. Snap has differentiated itself as a product, as a platform. While true that features can be copied off of Snap, the underlying infrastructure and value proposition of the platform cannot be. In an era where platforms like Facebook (FB) are being heavily scrutinized for their lack of privacy-oriented approach, opposing platforms like Snapchat appear more compelling.And while it is naive to assume Snap's recent user growth has come directly from Facebook's user base, Snap is definitely benefiting from a weaker Facebook. So, what's so unique about Snap? It really boils down to a few things.Let's start with the first idea. This idea is that Snapchat is organized around more personal relationships between users, rather than followers like Twitter (TWTR) or Instagram/Facebook. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook ""reward"" you for having a greeting following. Snapchat's core model is not based around developing a following for particular users. It is mostly based around the connection individual users have with each other, differentiating itself from the competition. Hence, the idea of Snap streaks, a way of measuring the amount of dedication between a pair of users on Snapchat. They aren't followers, they're friends.Next is Snap's more than a little unique augmented reality experience. Back in my initial article, I believed that augmented reality was something not totally unique to Snap. And to be honest, it really isn't that unique. However, what is unique about Snap's augmented reality strategy, is there laser-focus towards AR. Augmented reality isn't simply just a feature as it is on Instagram, it seems to be the lifeblood of Snapchat, allowing users to develop pictures in unique ways. Even better, Snapchat is consistently updating their scroll of filters and experiences to further engage the user. On top of this, Snapchat is selling some of these filters and AR experiences to advertisers, allowing them to profit off the sticky ecosystem. Augmented reality on Snapchat isn't a feature, it's the lifeblood of the platform.Almost, if not as important as augmented reality, is the general infrastructure of the platform. Snap's user interface is geared towards privacy, a particularly sensitive buzzword in today's society. Messages and posts ""disappear"" after a short period of time. While nothing truly just disappears off the internet, it gives users a sense of security that their messages and posts won't sit there forever. While this UI may seem a little misleading, it is what differentiates Snap from Instagram. The only part of Instagram that disappears is ""Stories"" which are geared towards a twenty-four hour time window anyway (they copied stories from Snap). A privacy first UI is definitely a key advantage for Snap.Accelerating cash burn: This part of the bear thesis has been downright discredited. While Snap is still burning millions of dollars in cash per quarter, cash burn is not intensifying. As a matter of fact, the company is quickly working to decrease cash burn. With the recent strides the company has made, I am confident the company will not need a capital raise before turning a profit (targeting profits in 2H'20). This chart says it all.(source: Snap IR)Snap's cash flow is still negative, meaning the company continues to burn cash rather than make cash, but the problem is getting better, not worse. By being more prudent with operating expenses (layoffs) and scaling back Capex, the company is quickly moving towards becoming a cash generative one.As gross margins and overall revenue continue to grow, Snap will see a trend of improving operating leverage, positively affecting their cash flow.Continuous executive turnover: Another point of the bear thesis I used to tout, was Snap's continuous executive turnover. A few months ago, Snap was seeing an almost never-ending stream of executive departures. However, the times have changed. Now that it seems Snap is done laying off employees, and restructuring upper management, the company is seeing a solidified management team. After Tim Stone, the company's former chief financial officer left the company, and the executive restructuring that followed, we haven't seen any major executive departures. Coupled with a rising stock price and reaccelerating growth, I believe the executive turnover aspect of the bear case has been permanently put to rest.Executive control (share structure): One of the tenets of my bear thesis that still exists is the company's share structure. Like many other IPOs and big tech firms, management is largely in control of the power in the company. With regards to voting rights, Snap's two cofounders, Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel control 96% of the voting rights in the company. Murphy and Spiegel still control 96% of the voting rights in the company. The problem I had with their control was that shareholders had almost no say in what happened with regards to corporate governance. Simply put, I did, and still do believe that Snap's voting structure is ridiculous.However, the real problem has to do with trust in management. I didn't trust management previously. The company was losing users, calling itself a ""camera company"", continuously missing sell-side estimates, and on top of it all, the CEO was taking a $638 million stock option bonus. That has changed.As we have already seen, the company has reversed its trend of missing estimates, is seeing accelerating user growth, and the stock is jumping. With voting structures like the ones employed by Snap and other tech companies, it boils down to your ability to trust management. Do you trust that these people are running the company correctly? In Snap's case, I didn't buy into management. But with the recent reorganization and acquisition of new talent, Snap's management team is maturing. I trust management.Exuberant valuation: This is probably the most valid part of the Snap bear thesis now. The valuation is extreme, at least on a relative basis. The valuation compared to other tech stocks is downright crazy. But if we analyze it using a DCF (which I will do later), the company is not so ""irrationally valued"" as it may seem.Let's start by valuing Snap relative to the competition on sales and sales growth alone.Applying this ""PSG"" multiple of 0.313 to Snap's projected top-line growth of 34.1%, we get a ""fair"" 2020 P/S sales multiple of 10.673X sales. On $2.27 billion in 2020 revenues, we get to a fair value of $24.228 billion. Assuming an outstanding share count of 1.379 billion shares, we get a stock price of $17.56. So based on Snap's sales-based valuation relative to peers, the stock is worth ~$17.50/share. This isn't my price target, it is just the valuation of the company relative to its group of peers.This valuation disproves the idea that relative to other companies Snap is overvalued. So, the exuberant valuation, at first sight, seems to be a serious issue. But diving just a little bit deeper shows us that Snap isn't so egregiously valued.The price targets I use in my base case valuations of most of the companies I cover are generated by my discounted cash flow model. My rating on the stock is then created based on the upside/downside in the stock. Never have I ever seen my price target move in such a violent way. In my previous article, my target was at $10, and my rating neutral. Now, however, my target is $19.50. My rating is still neutral. Let's start with some cost of capital assumptions.This model uses WACC (weighted average cost of capital) as the assumed rate at which cash flows should be discounted. In order to get to a WACC calculation, we have to first find the company's cost of equity, using the CAPM formula.This model assumes a beta of 1.43. This beta is calculated by taking the average of the unlevered and levered betas for the last two years of trading. This model assumes a risk-free rate as the yield on the ten-year bond, which currently yields 2.054%. And last, the model assumes an equity risk premium of 511 basis points. So, Snap's cost of equity is 9.36%. Let's plug this into a WACC model.So, Snap's discount rate is 9.32%.Let's move on to my estimates for Snap's business. This is a ten-year long DCF model.This model assumes fairly robust revenue growth, driven by increased advertiser stickiness, a large TAM, growth into new markets (AR, gaming, eCommerce), and a maturing user base. The long-term gross margin estimates are meant to reflect a push to match or nearly match competing social media platforms gross margins. Overall, this enables a solid path to profitability. Keep in mind, however, these EPS estimates are based on the current share count, not factoring in new shares added via stock-based compensation or raw dilution.This is the kind of growth that investors are paying high valuations for:Now that we have the business estimates and discount rate lined up, what is the final valuation of the company?The rating is a hold. Snap, despite its significant progress, is a highly volatile stock. While the company's prospects look strong going forward, are you really willing to invest in Snap with an upside potential of just 15%? I've made the mistake of missing out on big rallies, hoping for corrections, before. However, I am not ready to become a long-term shareholder until the stock falls a decent amount. $15.50-16 looks a lot more compelling than $17.It's been about a year since I debuted on SA with an article on Snap. Back then, I was bearish and short via puts. Thank goodness I locked in my profits on those puts. The fundamentals of the company have changed, and the stock seems to have reasonable upside ahead. While the majority of short sellers have been squeezed out of the stock, some remain. The bear thesis on the stock is a shadow of what it once was. The bulls are in control now."

        I don't know when flat to slightly down became synonymous with growth. Snap's DAU figures paint a confusing picture.
        When a company spends over $400 million beyond the cost of sales to generate $320 million in revenue, cash flow is going to be under pressure.","This has been a very good year for Snap (NYSE: SNAP) investors. The shares have rallied from under $6 a share to more than $14. Investors seem to believe that the company has begun to solve its problem of user growth. The app known mainly for its popularity among Generation Z and camera filters is trying to expand into video and games. Snap’s management is telling a compelling story by saying, “our ads can now reach more 13 to 34-year olds than Instagram in the United States.” This is challenging age group for advertisers to get access to, which helps explain the surge in the shares. However, there are some red flags that investors need to watch for in the next earnings report. In the short-term it may not be users that should determine the direction of the stock.Snap reported back in 2017 that it would be laying off some employees and slowing down its hiring. Investors probably see this as a past issue that doesn’t have bearing on the company’s current fortunes. Snap said its slowdown in hiring is “logical” and simply a function of the company’s fast growth.Investors need to do some logical reasoning of their own and decide if this explanation makes sense. At the end of 2017, and into the beginning of 2018, Snap grew its employee count at a significant clip. The growth rate of total employees moved from 65%, to 27%, to 10% over this time frame. As of the end of 2018 and into this year, the company’s employee count started moving in the opposite direction. In fact, in each of the last two quarters, the company’s total employee count shows a decline of 6% annually.Just to put this in context, in the first quarter of 2018 total employees increased by 27%. By the same quarter of 2019, Snap’s total employees declined by 6%. The company grew its employees by a large amount, then a year later decided it overshot the mark. This is a key number for investors to watch in the upcoming earnings report. Snap may expect more tempered growth in the short-term, yet it needs employees to support this growth. If Snap reports further declines in employees and doesn’t hint at when this trend will abate, investors should worry for the company’s future.I know that Stranger Things on Netflix is somewhat of a cultural phenomenon, yet investors in Snap seem to be living in The Upside Down. In no great surprise, Snap’s massive growth in employees also coincided with the company witnessing strong daily active user (DAU) growth. Following a similar path to the decline in employees, Snap’s DAU growth has moved from strong increases to significant challenges.(Source: Snap Q1 earnings)(Source: Snapchat Download)If a company was growing users, then reports flat growth, ""solving"" this problem normally means reverting back to growth. The last two quarters Snap posted flat and declining user growth, this looks like anything other than a solution. A company investors might compare to Snap is Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) given somewhat similar user bases. While both companies are constantly scrutinized over their number of users, Twitter seems to be on the right track, whereas Snap’s growth has stalled.In Twitter’s last earnings report, the company reported its average monetizable daily active users increased by nearly 12% on an annual basis. If we look at Q4 of last year, this same measure increased just under 10%, and the prior quarter increased by 9% annually. In short, Snap’s DAU moved from growth to decline in the last three quarters, while Twitter’s DAU annual growth moved up sequentially.(Source: Twitter Q1 Slide Presentation)This is the second figure investors need to watch in Snap’s next earnings report. Much has been made about how Snap might be getting back on track. However, for this to be the case, Snap needs to report annual growth in DAU not just a minimal decline. With shares recovering sharply this year, for the run to continue, investors should get more than this upside-down type of “improvement.”Snap’s DAU or employee counts aren’t going to matter much if the company can’t figure out how to generate free cash flow. This is probably the key difference between Snap and its social media peer Twitter. Last quarter, Twitter generated over $200 million in core free cash flow. Predictably the company’s operating margin was not only positive, but came in at 12%. By point of comparison, Snap’s operating margin was negative and its core free cash flow was negative by more than $275 million.Not to put too fine a point on this issue. Snap’s stock recovery may not have legs if the company doesn’t have a way to generate free cash flow. If we break apart why Snap is burning through cash, there seem to be two main culprits, R&D and SG&A. When it comes to R&D spending, in the technology business investors may be willing to accept a higher level of cost if it leads to better future results. The company spent just over $216 million on R&D compared to about $201 million in last year’s similar quarter. It’s not the increase of 7.6% that bothers me relative to Snap’s revenue growth of 39%. What is a problem is R&D represented more than 67% of revenue. When $0.67 of every dollar of revenue is wiped out by R&D spending, its nearly impossible to generate positive free cash flow.In an ironic twist, Snap’s SG&A spending came to just over $216 million last quarter as well. Without beating a dead horse, if you can’t spend 67% of your revenue on R&D, then you really can’t spend this percentage on SG&A as well. To put this a different way, if Snap spent $0 on R&D or on SG&A last quarter, the company’s operating margin still would have been negative by more than $100 million.If we look at Snap’s balance sheet, its clear that its negative free cash flow is taking a toll. Last quarter, Snap’s net cash and investments totaled about $880 million. There are two big problems. First, at the company’s rate of cash burn last quarter it would eat through this amount in less than a year. Second, this $880 million was already down more than 30% from last year.Snap’s expenses are the third item investors need to watch when the company reports earnings. The company has done an okay job of mitigating expense growth in R&D and SG&A, but it simply doesn’t appear to have much operating leverage. Snap needs to continue to grow revenue of course, but investors should watch for R&D and SG&A to become a significantly smaller percentage of revenue for the stock’s run to continue.To be fair, the run in Snap’s stock has been nothing short of incredible this year. However, investing doesn’t involve looking at how much money you’ve made, but determining if you can make money in the future. On the positive side, Snap has a multi-quarter winning streak behind it when it comes to beating analyst estimates.Over the last four quarters, Snap beat earnings estimates each time by an average of nearly 23% per quarter. In addition, some positive notes are being brought to light by Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse suggesting Snap can “substantially improve monetization of user time,” and “Snap is a scarce asset that offers advertisers access to a coveted younger demographic,” respectively.It’s true that sometimes companies can recover and generate better operating leverage. The challenge with believing Snap’s story in the short-term was voiced by its own CFO Lara Sweet on last quarter’s conference call. She said,Given the dual challenge of high percentages of R&D and SG&A expenses combined with a lack of DAU growth, Snap’s results hardly seem to warrant the present risk. The stock is up significantly, yet in this situation I try to remember a wise saying by Peter Lynch. He said, “stocks are not lottery tickets. There is a company behind every stock, and earnings behind every company. You can become an expert investor, but you need to do your homework, which most investors usually skimp on.”Right now, Snap seems like a stock that is being treated like a lottery ticket. The shares are up, but the company’s fundamental business doesn’t appear to have improved. Long-term investors need to look beyond the short-term prognostications and wait for a real turnaround before investing."
4274404,105040,2019-07-11T04:52:00-04:00,"Snap has risen significantly on the back of analyst upgrades and positive news.However, the company’s valuation has now reached $20 billion, which is not warranted by the fundamentals.Bulls still think that Snap should be a buy because of its lower valuation per DAU compared to Twitter, but this is a flawed metric to value the company.","Unlike most people who are bearish on Snap Inc. (SNAP), we are not perma bears, and we are optimistic about the company's long-term future. Recently, however, it has turned more into a momentum play rather than a value/growth play and is way too expensive to be considered for a long-term investment. Having increased over 160% since January, Snap now trades at a $20 billion market cap, making it one of the largest bubbles in the market.One of the main reasons Snap has risen so much is the sheer number of analyst upgrades, with 4 upgrades since June from multiple different analysts and many more before that.(Source: Seeking Alpha)This, combined with a great earnings report in April and with a lack of bad news, is a self-fulfilling cycle propelling Snap stock towards new highs.Of course, there is no fundamental basis for a significant increase in the price based on analyst upgrades alone. Many studies have proven that analysts frequently get things wrong, and like the retail investor crowd, they suffer from psychological biases like herding or FOMO. However, analysts are very respected among the majority of retail and institutional investors, and therefore, their calls can significantly influence the stock price.Analysts' ratings are not the only factors pushing up the stock, of course. The company itself has launched a partnership with Shopify (SHOP) to display its ads on Snapchat and has launched features like Snap Games, which Zynga (ZNGA) recently launched a battle royale game for.(Source: Google Images)TickerTags, a research company, has also recorded higher engagement from users and even a new influx of users who are downloading the app yet again.It also helps that Snap recently hired a new CFO and Chief People Officer.This is all good and all, except that the company is trading at a $20 billion valuation, so all these new fundamental developments are more than priced into the stock.As great as these developments sound, they aren't going to generate billions in revenues overnight, which is what Snap needs to warrant its current valuation, which we’ll discuss in the next section.Bulls have frequently pointed out that Snap is cheaper on a per DAU basis than peers like Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB). While that is true, its DAUs are much less valuable than Twitter's or Facebook's. For example, Twitter generates 3 times the revenue of Snap despite only having 134 million DAUs, much less than the 190 million DAUs that Snap possesses. Facebook has nearly 60x the revenues of Snap, yet only has around 20x the latter's user base.The picture gets worse when you look at profitability, with Twitter and Facebook both profitable while Snap is unprofitable - though that is changing.We believe fundamentally that Snap's users are worth much less than those of Twitter or Facebook, probably because most of Snap's users are young and have very little disposable income. Therefore, a lower valuation per DAU is justified.At $20 billion and 15x revenues, Snap is priced for high growth for many years. We believe this is extremely unrealistic, as the company’s revenue growth now is mainly dependent on additional ads displayed and not user growth. At some point, Snap will need to slow down ad growth on its app or risk user attrition. In fact, the company is implementing its widely criticized six-second unskippable ads in its new platform to try and increase monetization.Peers like Facebook and Twitter trade at around 8x-10x revenues, but we believe Snap should trade around 6x-7x revenues, due to the fact that it is unprofitable and has slower user growth than Facebook. At that valuation, the company would trade at less than half its current price, or around $6-7.For all the criticism we have levied at the stock, we actually do like Snap a lot as a company, and we believe that it has great long-term potential. Its AR is pretty much unrivaled, and there are few apps that can universally attract and engage a teenage audience.It's also great that Snap has finally managed to start growing users again after a large exodus of users last year. There's no denying that Snap is a much better company than it was in December 2018. It may even make a profit in the medium term as operating leverage kicks in and helps reduce operating losses.(Source: Seeking Alpha)Overall, Snap is an extremely expensive company that trades at a stupendously high valuation due to non-fundamental factors like analyst upgrades. We do believe Snap has great long-term potential, with millions of engaged teens on its platform, but we would rather not touch it at this inflated price."
4274930,92586,2019-07-15T07:57:58-04:00,"The market seems enamored with Snap Inc. this year, and the company will have a chance to support bullishness when it reports 2Q19 results on July 23.I think Snap could impress on ARPU once again, but also doubt that usage, dead in the water for many quarters, will recover.Given a number of factors that range from unimpressive DAU growth to fast-rising valuations, I choose to keep a safe distance from SNAP.","I was never a Snap Inc. (SNAP) cheerleader. As I stated nearly a year ago, the last time that I wrote about the company on Seeking Alpha, results up to that point suggested ""more of the same in regard to sluggish user growth, depressed margins and sizable cash burn that had yet to impress.""But the tides have clearly started to turn -- at least this is what the market has been signaling. SNAP has been on an impressive run, nearly tripling in market value so far this year. Credit: FortuneGiven the stock's sharp u-turn (up very strongly in the past six months, but largely flat over the trailing 12-month period), I believe it will be important for investors to pay close attention to Snap's earnings report, scheduled to come out on July 23, after the closing bell. The Street is expecting to see revenues rise by a robust 37% YOY, following the trend set by the past couple of quarters. Adjusted per-share loss of $0.10, if achieved, would be a mild improvement over last year's bottom-line results.In my view, Snap has a better chance at impressing on monetization than on usage growth. The latter, in fact, has been dead in the water for quite some time (see chart on the right below). The platform is starting to look a lot like CEO and founder Evan Spiegel's vision of a ""network that may stay relatively small and intimate"", in true ""bigger isn't better"" fashion. Source: company's 1Q19 earnings press release But when it comes to producing revenues out of its user base, Snap has been proving competent so far. ARPU increased by an encouraging 39% in 1Q19, fully accounting for the revenue boost in the period and possibly suggesting improvement in advertising ROI and ad load growth.The company's efforts to make the ecosystem more palatable and to boost engagement by, for example, developing the Discover feature and launching Snap Games seem to have been successful up to this point. Not unlike in the recent past, I expect Snap's top-line growth in the second quarter to be almost entirely fueled by an increase in per-unit revenues.A bit less important to the growth story, it will be interesting to see how margin trends continue to evolve. In the past, I had been critical of Snap's apparent lack of expense management diligence, particularly right after the company's 2017 IPO.But two key developments seem to have had a positive impact on profits. First, gain of scale has progressively lowered cost of revenue relative to the top line. And second, lack of inspiring performance on key growth drivers seem to have forced the management team to focus a bit more on cost containment. Last quarter, for example, opex ex-share based compensation was down 4% YOY.To determine if SNAP might be a buy at current levels, I prefer to set earnings aside for a moment and take a step back. Bear with me as I walk through a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation.I estimated, a couple of years ago, that SNAP would need to deliver at least $1 in annual EPS to justify the price of $23 that shares reached immediately after the IPO. To me, this is also the minimum price target that I would entertain in order to accept a high-risk investment in this stock.To achieve this particular earnings goal, I had to assume:It seems highly speculative to bet on usage improving much in the foreseeable future, let alone growing aggressively -- it hasn't at all in the past six quarters at least. ARPU has been improving, and could very well reach the base-case scenario described above if it continues to grow at the current pace for another two to three years. Margins have also been trending favorably, but losses are still so sizable that it is hard to make high-conviction margin projections for the long run at this point.Sure, SNAP could continue to trade on momentum, especially if 2Q19 earnings results confirm early 2019 trends in ARPU and margin that have been favorable. But fundamentally, I still can not see good enough reasons to bet on this name, particularly after the stock's mind-boggling recovery in the past six months set the bar high for potential investors.Data by YCharts Given the usage growth challenges that show no signs of being resolved, margins that are still far from reaching acceptable levels and valuation that is nowhere near de-risked (see EV/revenues chart above), I prefer to keep a safe distance from SNAP."

Things are finally going right for the company that has lost 2/3rds of its market value since its IPO. Snap Show, announced on July 10th of 2019, will draw influencers to the app, which will help direct consistent traffic to Snapchat, build up its infrastructure and boost ad revenue.Snap launched 50 shows during Q1'19 to a strong and positive response from users. The filters that they implemented in May doubled the number of app downloads from 600k a day to more than 1.5 million. They cleaned up the Android app, boosting their base by 6%.SNAP's ad revenue growth grew 36% during Q4'18, and they expect to continue to tap into that growth as Snap Show and Collection Ads continue on the uptrend. Things are looking good for the company going into this next round of earnings on July 23rd.Based on my technical observations, things are strong for SNAP going into the end of the month. I believe that they have the potential to hit a $20 price target, and there are several options plays that investors can implement to take advantage of that. I do think that there will be a ~20% drawdown immediately after earnings, but the stock will recover in the months following, potentially reaching beyond its IPO price.SNAP was oversold in December 2018 when liquidity entered the markets and short coverings helped to bring the price action inside the Keltner Channel (KC), then above the 10 week moving-average, then a cross of 10 to 21 week moving average. There was a continuation above the Keltner Channel until April, when SNAP pulled back to the pink trend-line that connects the IPO high to the February 2018 earnings beat. That represented a pullback to buy, as represented by the yellow arrow.Source: AuthorThe combination of support at 30-week with the 50-week trend-line at $10 fair valuation allowed SNAP to continue on the uptrend along the 10-week moving average to a $14.47 neckline, where it has been trading sideways the last few weeks.The inverse Head and Shoulder formation is shown below, beginning with the May 2018 $10 bounce to $14.47 and then down to the December 2018 lows of $4.82, before returning back again to the $14.47 neckline in June 2019. A total of a $9.65 higher, and a $24.12 measured move.Source: AuthorFibonacci analysis shows $16.19 as 78.6% retracement, $17.86 at 100% retracement, and $20 at a 127.5% retracement. This point could be an area where SNAP pulls back. I believe that this drawdown will follow earnings, and could be 20%, should market weakness persist into late July and August.Source: AuthorInterestingly enough, SNAP has had a similar chart look to PAGS, a Brazilian software application unicorn that has flown higher after a pull-back to trend-line support and neckline breakout. SNAP will take out its ""IPO High"" after staying above $21.22. The higher ""PAGS-like-number"" above IPO is $30.50, which will more than likely happen after the 20% pullback post-earnings this summer, and despite of markets tendency to trade sideways-to-lower into 2020. The risk is that market action prevents SNAP from following the PAGS fractal and achieving its measured move this year.Source: AuthorSNAP has earnings on July 23rd, and the below trades give investors exposure to any upside movement that could happen before this day.Hard Run: Buying the July 26 $15C for $1.15 with a price target between $16.25 and $17.50 before July 23, assuming that the price can stay above $14.Slow Grind: The August 15x16 Call Spread for $0.40 for a potential profit of $1.00. The stock price needs to stay above $14 and close at $16. I personally prefer not to hold call spreads into EPS, and I prefer financed call spreads like the Aug 16 15x17 call spread with a short $14.5 Put for a small debit. Or there is a ratio call spread with 2 Long OTM Calls to 1 Short ITM Call like the Aug 16 $16x2 with a short $14 call for $0 debit.Into and After Earnings: The October $16 Call for $1.50 with $20 price target. A volatility crush after earnings would hurt this option price if the expected move is not exceeded, but there is time built in for the price to recover after earnings if the stock continues on the uptrend.EPS Play With Theta: January 2020 $15x20 call spread with a short January 10 put for $0.40. Assuming that the spread doesn't trade below $15, this trade can deliver between 8-10x return on investment if SNAP reaches the $20 price target.Very Bullish: Buy the October 16 Call and Sell the October 14 Put for $0.30. Selling puts to offset buying calls will be financially rewarding if the trade is directionally right. Otherwise, the debit turns into a credit and would turn into a loss greater than the investment. Worst case scenario, you lose the value of your investment, and are exercised at $14 level at expiration.SNAP will more than likely touch $20 before July 23 earnings, after which they will have a subsequent 20% pullback, especially if market weakness persists into the end of the summer. I expect the stock to recover after earnings, with a momentum price target of $30.50. There are some risks to getting there, including continued overall market weakness and uncertainty. However, there are both short-term and medium-term ways to play the recent pop in SNAP, which will benefit investors across several different preferred risk levels."

Revenue increased 48% to $388m from $262m in Q2 2018. Expenses saw significant declines as a percentage of revenue, and Snap's loss per share decreased from $-0.27 a year ago to $-0.19 this quarter.

After several quarters in a row of very lackluster user growth, Snap redeemed itself adding 13 million new users globally from Q1, and 15 million from Q2 2018.Source: Snap Q2 2019 Earnings SlidesThe real question here is whether this growth is temporary as a result of app updates, or is this growth sustainable over a longer period of time. For now, it seems to be speculative either way. One quarter does not make a reliable trend.Source: Snap Q2 2019 Earnings SlidesAlthough Snap did grow users, Snap's impressive revenue growth was mostly due to an increase in revenue per user. Globally, Q2 saw a 37% increase QoQ in ARPU. At $1.91 in revenue per user for the quarter, Snap has a ton of room for growth. For comparison, Facebook (FB) achieved ARPU worldwide of $7.05 in Q2 2019, more than three times that of Snap's number. In Q2 2019 Facebook did over $33 of revenue per user in North America, compared to Snap's measly $3.14 per North American user. Now I do not think Snap is an app that monetizes as well as a platform like Facebook (at-least not right now), but this does help illustrate just how much growth potential still exists for Snap.Snap's stock price has been on a wild ride over the last 12 months. From a low of $4.82 in December to the $17s immediately after Q2 earnings. Such a large rally warrants skepticism. The price increase has been based on speculation of continued growth. Those that bought when the stock was below $5 were taking a gamble and won this time. That is not how I like to invest. I want to see sustainable growth over several quarters, with fundamental reasons for such growth that can continue to deliver strong numbers going forward.From a multiples perspective, Snap has rallied from being under peer's multiples, to being much higher than peers. Snap currently trades at nearly double the TTM sales multiple of Facebook and Twitter (TWTR). But Snap is also growing revenue much faster. As of the time of writing this article, Twitter has not reported Q2 2019 results, but I'm estimating approximately 20% revenue growth. Facebook reported revenue growth of 28% in Q2 2019 from Q2 2018. Snap's 48% revenue growth blows the others out of the water. Still, it is difficult to justify paying twice the sales multiple in my opinion if you're not extremely confident the growth can continue.Snap at $17 per share is still highly speculative. It is certainly worth watching, especially as they approach profitability, but guessing on profitability can be a dangerous game. I am not looking to short the stock here either, as there is still plenty of growth in this company. The stock may very well hang around in the mid teens until the company grows into it's valuation, or it could continue upward momentum. There are much better companies to target for a short in my opinion. For these reasons I am neutral on the stock.Snap has returned to significant user growth, but whether this is temporary, or can last multiple quarters or even years has yet to be seen. One quarter is not indicative of the rest of this year or future years. Snap's share price has come a long way off the lows, and now looks quite pricey. It is as if the market is projecting the most recent quarter's growth into the future to price this stock. As proven in past quarters with SNAP, user growth can be fleeting. But with an app re-work behind them, the company seems to be picking up more users once again.Ultimately, there is a fair amount of risk in this stock. User growth remains speculative. A move down to near $10-$12 could get me interested in taking a position, but I remain on the sidelines watching closely for now."
4276952,69905,2019-07-24T07:45:31-04:00,"Snap's results show that it is once more viewed as a very rapidly growing company.For now, Snap continues to be unprofitable.Snap's $0.03 GAAP beat was driven by a mysterious divestiture.Although there is little question that the stock is indeed overvalued, near-term momentum will mean that bulls are now firmly in control.","Snap's (SNAP) year-to-date performance has been nothing short of astonishing. I have been bearish the name several times, most recently in June 2019.Yesterday's Q2 2019 results show that the company continues to improve its financial operations, but that ultimately, its stock is red hot and leaves investors with absolutely no margin of safety.Snap's top-line performance was certainly astonishing. There is no question that many analysts, myself included, were firmly resolved that Snap's growth rate would largely fizzle out.But the graph below squarely refutes that assertion. Not only did Q2 2019 post very stellar growth of 48% YoY, but further emphasizing the solid momentum behind Snap, its guidance for Q3 is similarly impressive and expected to come in at approximately 42% on its top-line.Source: author's calculations, SEC filings, Press StatementsFor now, it's doubtless to everyone, Snap is back towards being viewed as a high growth stock, given that its growth rates are likely to remain firmly above 35% CAGR.This essentially implies that Snap will be among the fastest (if not the fastest) growing publicly traded social media platform.Accordingly, in the near term, given Snap's explosive top-line growth rates, investors will be willing to proclaim any multiple to Snap's revenues as being undervalued - for now, the sky is the limit, and who is to argue otherwise?Snap's Q2 2019 adjusted EBITDA figures jumped by 53%. This gives investors plenty of reason to celebrate, and Snap is not shy about peddling this figure forward.The fact that the vast majority of the discrepancy between Snap's net loss figures and its adjusted EBITDA figures boils down to approximately $200 million of ''non-cash'' compensation which is backed out from its EBITDA figures, is easily disregarded by investors.However, interestingly, this quarter there was a divestiture of $39.9 million which is backed out of Snap's adjusted net loss figure, but this divestiture does not appear to have been backed out of its adjusted EBITDA number. This is curious. I searched high and low through the earnings call, and there is no mention of this divestiture.Furthermore, I suspect that this divestiture was accounted for in Snap's income statement under the line ''other income (expense), net''. If this one-off figure is backed out of the GAAP income statement, it amounts to approximately $0.03 of EPS - which is the exact amount by which Snap beat analysts' bottom line consensus figures by.At the time of writing, Snap's 10-Q has not been published, so there are no further clues at present.Snap has one competitive advantage over its peers, in that it can boldly assert that its hold over its younger audiences is stronger than Facebook's (FB) and Instagram's and obviously Twitter's (TWTR).Furthermore, and this is key to its business proposition, user's time engagement with the platform not only is steady but also continues to grow very rapidly. During Q2 2019, we saw these numbers soar by 60% year-over-year through Snap's heavy investment into its Discover platform.Snap declares that advertisers are resonating very strongly with its offering. Advertisers are particularly noticing a very high return on investment through Snap's 6-second non-skippable video ads.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comHaving said all that, should investors really be clambering to participate in its stock? What kind of margin of safety does Snap hold when it has no history of profitability?The truth of the matter is that investors are fundamentally clueless as to what sort of profit margin profile Snap may eventually hold in time.Assuming that Snap might post operating profit margins as high as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at its peak, in the high 20% to low 30% range, while bearing in mind that Alphabet is one of the best companies in the world, are investors really getting any sort of upside potential when they are already paying 16x trailing revenues?I'll be the first to concede that I did not expect Snap's top line to reignite once again. This quarter's guidance not only puts bears such as myself back in their corner, but it is firm vindication that Snap continues to be a high growth company.Even if its stock continues to be unreasonably expensive, for now, given Snap's very strong momentum, investors are likely to continue to bid up its share price higher.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4270809,69905,2019-06-18T10:05:36-04:00,"Revenue is decelerating at a rapid clip. Forcing me to question Snap's overall sustainability as an investment.Having never generated either profits or cash flows, investors are forced to price the stock off its top-line.Snap's valuation has no margin of safety and investors are best off protecting their capital by sidestepping this investment.","Snap (SNAP) has soared in its year to date performance and is up more than 130%.Despite the positive investor sentiment towards the stock, I explain why investors today have no more upside potential.(Source)Snap's business model positions itself as the go-to platform for advertisers to reach the hard to reach, namely millennials and Gen Z.As of Q1 2019, Snap's DAU (daily active users) was flat year over year at 190 million. Having said that, its top line was mighty strong and up 39% year-over-year. The reason for this growth was strong monetization of its user base with its ARPU (average revenue per user) being up 39%. Furthermore, CEO Evan Spiegel contends that Snap is building on the success of the Discover platform to keep strong user retention.Ultimately, having a large audience of difficult to engage millennials and Gen Z is Snap's primary differentiator. To that extent, Snap continues to grow its ad product suite and offers advertisers the tools to measure penetration and return on investment.Other opportunities for advertisers include Snap's optimization of its 6-second non-skippable mobile ad units for maximum benefit for advertisers, while at the same time, minimal disruption for users who have short attention spans.Next, on the first impression, knowing that Snap is up 39% in Q1 2019 compared with the same period a year ago sounds terrific.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comBut when we look back and see its previous growth rates, our excitement should quickly abate. Just two years' ago, Snap finished 2017 being up more than 100% year-over-year. Fast forward to now, and its latest figures look lackluster in comparison.Immediately, readers should question the sustainability of its business model. What is the likely growth rate for Snap this time next year?Given its present rate of deceleration, it would not be all that surprising if this time next year Snap's top line growth rate was sub 30%. At that stage, investors will no longer view Snap as an explosive growth company which should be valued off revenue alone, but investors will start to question Snap's ability to generate actual cash flows.As you will know, since Snap's inception, it has accumulated net losses of more than $6 billion.Moreover, the reality is that Snap's main costs are in the form of stock-based compensation. As of Q1 2019, more than 50% of Snap's revenue is eaten up in as stock-based compensation, which amounted to $162 million.Consequently, it is perhaps unsurprising to see that Snap finished 2017 with an average of 1,166 million shares and that of its most recent quarter, this number has increased by more than 32% to 1,544 million.Accordingly, given that Snap's balance sheet carries just $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents, yet, it burns through more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow per year, investors should expect to continue to see Snap using its shares as a source of funds.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comAs you can see in the table, Snap is being valued solely off its top line. This fact, given its rapidly decelerating top-line growth, together with the reality that investors simply have no real idea of Snap's overall profit margins makes it extremely difficult to ascertain how valuable those revenues could actually transpire to be.Moreover, reflected in the table, you can see that Snap's peers have seen investors turn cautious on them of late. Granted, Snap has no privacy or antitrust overhanging risk, but neither does Twitter (TWTR).I'm not recommending that anyone shorts Snap. I don't believe that shorting offers investors a positive risk-reward. This article specifically addresses the fact that Snap valuation is not congruent with its sustainable growth rates.What's more, given that Snap is, as of present, still substantially unprofitable, investors are thus speculating that when they are paying up $18 billion market cap that someone else is willing to pay more. But this game is somewhere between risky and foolhardy and it will not end well.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4274222,102107,2019-07-10T07:30:22-04:00,"We kick off a Marketplace Midyear Roundtable series by looking at tech.Disruption and hot IPOs have stolen headlines so far this year. Do they deserve investors' continued attention?And amidst a resurgent market and an everchanging dynamic, how should investors position?Our Marketplace authors share how they are thinking about the sector.","by Daniel ShvartsmanThe first half of 2019 saw a lot of green in the markets, as broader indices recovered from the brief bear market in the second half of 2018 and returned to new heights. Despite that, the wall of worry continued to grow, even if the specific concerns changed. Instead of a rising rate environment, expectations have shifted to a possible rate cut even with good job numbers. Geopolitical flashpoints have (re-)emerged in Venezuela, Iran, and in the ongoing China-US trade conflict. European economic growth appears to be slowing, and nobody's quite sure where we are in the US cycle. Oh, and another presidential election cycle is beginning.So what to make of this all? We decided to take the temperature of the markets with a midyear Marketplace Roundtable. We asked our Seeking Alpha Marketplace contributors - authors who run investing services and provide ideas and guidance to members about how to think about the markets or at least certain parts of it - to share their views on the current climate and how they're positioning as a result.Over 55 authors participated in our survey. We've grouped their responses into several categories, ranging from tech to commodities, biotech to dividends and income investing. We're going to share their responses in those grouped categories over the coming week or so. Each discussion will have two common questions about the market as a whole, two sector-specific questions, and a round of current favorite ideas. We hope you enjoy the discussion and welcome you to join with comments on these issues or on any key points that didn't come up, or follow-up questions.We start with tech. The story in tech for so long has been about FAANG in whatever permutation. But 2019 has also seen a crest in IPOs and a resurgence in bitcoin steal headlines. Where does that leave us? Here's today's panel to discuss:Please check the end of article for disclosures - authors disclosed positions based on stocks they respectively discussed.Cestrian Capital Research: No. The market is caught between fundamentals (slowing) and external factors (2020 election, Fed/White House tension, China). We anticipate an upward drift towards the 2020 election, tempered by fundamentals.Jeffrey Himelson: I believe the driving force behind the resurgence in the stock market has been the consensus that the Fed will not only stop raising rates in 2019 but will also be cutting rates. By cutting rates, the Fed will be throwing some more lighter fluid on the fire that is the economy. Sorry for throwing in two analogies, but the market is like a junkie and the Fed is giving the market another fix of stimulus with a rate cut. Eventually, the market will face a correction, but with a bit more stimulus coming from the Fed, the market will be churning along a bit longer.Ranjit Thomas: No. I think the market has come around to the realization that the President is conscious about the markets, and if they decline, he will reverse the policies that caused this. The Fed seems to have buckled under pressure. The economic cycle has room to run further if the economy is allowed to function freely. If anything, there are excesses that continue to build up in the valuation of profitless growth companies, not to mention concepts like Bitcoin.App Economy Insights: Rather than trying to predict macro movements, I focus on company research and keep adding to existing or new positions diligently, no matter where we are in the business cycle. Markets draw-downs can happen with no apparent reason and I save a lot of time not thinking about this kind of questions.Bull & Bear Trading: This is an excellent question. Perhaps ""market doubt"" never gets completely resolved, but instead morphs to adjust for the progression of real-world developments in real-time. This is one of the dynamics that make markets so interesting to follow and provides us with trading opportunities. U.S. markets may have adopted a collective perception that the Trump administration's efforts in the so-called trade war will achieve greater economic parity for our nation's economic interests versus our global trading rivals. There is a growing sense of confidence that Trump and his team are acting competently on behalf of American economic interests both domestically and abroad. This is a welcome improvement from past administrations in Washington.General Expert: It's hard to say what the market was exactly thinking; but if the narrative for the Q4 2018 pullback was that the Fed was going to stubbornly raise rates rapidly despite international uncertainties, then I can definitively say that such fear no longer exists.Paulo Santos: It would actually seem the market has been rallying through the trade war and a slowdown in the economic cycle while carrying expensive valuations. Neither of these things were resolved - the latest celebration on the trade war referred only to negotiations with China restarting.Cestrian Capital Research: We focus on the space sector which is experiencing solid growth. The key drivers are militarization (= government spend) and cost reduction (= commercial spend). So far the sector is less volatile than say Big Tech; no change to our approach this year vs the last two years.Elazar Advisors: Tech fundamentals, in general, have deteriorated but optimism has not waned. Still, regardless of deteriorating fundamentals, we're still doing the bottoms-up work because there are companies out there with upside earnings momentum.Jeffrey Himelson: One sector that has faced a massive rebound in the first half has been tech stocks, i.e. FANG, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. My main concern with these names is the risk of regulations up-ending their business models. I believe anti-trust enforcement and new privacy regulations are coming and these stocks are most vulnerable. I am currently looking at smaller-cap value opportunities.App Economy Insights: I focus on the disruptors of the App Economy and beyond. If you look at SaaS businesses for example, investors are starting to clearly separate the wheat from the chaff. Under-performing businesses are being punished hard and fast, while those that keep on beating and raising numbers are valued with very high multiples. Investors have to look for quality, companies that they would be happy to hold strong should a downturn occur.Bull & Bear Trading: Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has experienced 5 major crashes in its brief history and has recovered to make new highs after the first 4 crashes. Trader's Idea Flow believes that Bitcoin is now in the process of marching to a 5th new high that may result in a blow-off, top rally that will surprise even most Bitcoin bulls. Increased potential demand in the form of a doubling of blockchain wallets that can be used to purchase Bitcoin and a doubling of blockchain global growth measured in megabytes has taken place since the last all-time high for Bitcoin in December 2017. Also, institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as part of a recognized cryptocurrency asset class has resulted in strong institutional buying globally in this current rally. Juxtapose this demand side of the equation for Bitcoin with the meager growth in supply of Bitcoin since the December 2017 ATH for Bitcoin. In fact, we are approaching the top-end of the limited supply of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency when the nearly 20% acknowledged ""forever loss"" of 3.5 million Bitcoins is factored in. We are calling for new highs above $20,000 in Bitcoin by year end 2019 with a peak trade in this cryptocurrency above $50,000 in 2020.General Expert: I personally don't pay too much attention to sector allocation. All else equal, one would want to find great ideas across all industries, but given my time constraint and the lack of good ideas, sector allocation comes after security selection. The Core Value Portfolio did take a meaningful position in a real estate company, not because it is a real estate company, but because I believe that it's a good company capable of generating superior returns in the future.Paulo Santos: Effects which already came from 2018 became much more pronounced in 2019. That is, the US market's valuation gulf to other markets has increased further still. The gulf between growth and value has also increased further still. This has led to something rather rare - we have a reasonably high net long exposure in spite of the US market being at valuations and in a point in the economy which would usually argue against it.Cestrian Capital Research: We assume a generally supportive market backdrop in the runup to the 2020 election, which gives us confidence in our Buys over and above the individual company attributes.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Frankly, I have 12-month targets for stocks but shorter term I just want to respect the market if it's moving up or down. I can try to predict but I prefer to be long when it's going up or net short when it's going down. Respecting markets has been one driver to our performance.Jeffrey Himelson: With the yield curve inverting three months ago, I believe we are due for a recession in the next 18 months. The bull rally may be extended through some rate cuts, but if trade negotiations break down, the Fed may not have enough ammunition to avert a recession. I am positioning my portfolio into value opportunities that will not suffer much in the face of a recession.Ranjit Thomas: Continue to hold positions in well-run companies that compound earnings over time and return cash to shareholders.App Economy Insights: My portfolio has very little rotation with most positions held for five years or more. My buying strategy has been focused on quality businesses that have temporary weakness in their price. I'm also happy to have added to some Chinese internet companies that have been beaten down over the past year. I also continue building positions in best-of-breed enterprise software companies and genomics, both industries that are recession-proof.Bull & Bear Trading: As a short-term trader, Trader's Idea Flow occasionally holds winning positions for what extends into a longer-term holding. For example, we sold Snap (SNAP) short on day 3 after the IPO at $27.78 on March 6, 2017, as posted for our Trader's Idea Flow subscribers. We covered this winning short at $5.64 as published in our January 17, 2019 post for our Trader's Idea Flow community. Importantly, in this same post that we announced our short cover, we also stated that we had become long Snap with a position at $5.64. We called for an upside forecast for both short and long-term traders. Nearly 6 months later Snap now trades at about $15.20 up about 190% from our short cover and call for a long position. In Trader's Idea Flow we address the bull thesis for why we believe Snap will trade to new all-time highs in the next 12 months. Our published, documented trading record on Snap shares is now a consecutive 6-for-6 successful trading calls with the most recent call being up about 190% in the last six months.We remain long Snap shares as the company's turnaround continues and may gain momentum while Facebook now is pre-occupied with anti-trust concerns from international regulators. It seems that the rabid determination of Facebook to destroy Snap now may have relented in the realization that regulators may not appreciate the optics of Mark Zuckerberg and company attempting to crush competitors in their marketplace. This breathing room may provide Snap with great opportunity for the next year at least. We see Snap shares trading above $30 in the next 12 months as continued upside momentum prevails.General Expert: I try not to get ahead of myself when looking at macros. Obviously 2020 is the big year politically, but none of my investments are contingent on any particular party winning; furthermore, I have no strong opinion of who will win, or do I have any confidence in predicting how markets will react even if I did know the result. Given the above, I will not position the second half of 2019 differently.Paulo Santos: We have a high net long exposure because in the midst of an expensive market, there's a large number of high-quality foreign companies that trade at incredibly depressed valuations even though their prospects are normal, not poor. The companies' valuations and prospects are what's driving our positioning - not an opinion on the US market, which seems both stretched, speculative and overvalued.Cestrian Capital Research: A number of the tech IPOs in 2018 and 2019 have been excellent companies. The unicorns get the attention but there are many smaller stocks that are truly great businesses and we think have big long-term potential. We would point to Zscaler (ZS) as an example. It closed its first trading day in March 2018 at $34 and currently sits at $76 - market cap about $9.6bn. The company is profitable and cash generative and also offers the potential to be acquired. There are many other examples of this type of IPO. We think there is good hunting to be had in these below-the-radar stocks which launch at a market cap of sub $4-5bn.Elazar Advisors: I remember the end of the 90s. Lots of loss-making business models went to zero. I think this series has more funding to back them even with losses. That said, I'm earnings focused so if earnings are not there I don't have the valuation support.Jeffrey Himelson: I believe there is a dichotomy of recent IPOs: the companies that are coming public all pretty much have good business models, which is a distinction between the IPO market in the early 2000s. However, there are a few names, such as Beyond Meat (BYND) that are trading at levels that are clearly not justified by their business fundamentals. I believe BYND is trading at a very lofty valuation as a result of a small float and the realization from the market that the food industry is facing a huge secular shift that BYND is set to capitalize on. However, investors are not considering the risk and competition involved. It's great to invest in companies that will reap the benefits of huge market shifts, but you need to conduct a bottom-up analysis as well to ensure a company will be a good investment in the long-term. When the share lock-up period expires in a few months, I expect BYND to crash.Ranjit Thomas: Let's face it, almost all these companies are overvalued, with hardly any earnings to speak of. The hope is that one of the larger companies will buy them one day. I think many of them will make for good short candidates once their market cap exceeds $20 billion (making an acquisition less likely) or when the next recession nears.App Economy Insights: I try to shy away from new hot IPOs until I can listen to a few earnings call and see the price settle. I want to get a good sense of management style and the path forward for the business. It's usually smart to wait for a few quarters before starting a position, particularly the end of a lock-up period.My focus remains on the disruptors of our time. Among recent IPOs, I invested in Guardant Health (GH) that has delivered outstanding returns so far. There is still a lot more unicorns to come with companies like Palantir, Stripe, Robinhood, Sofi, and Airbnb still private.Bull & Bear Trading: Failing business models such as Lyft and Uber coming to market with great fanfare is reminiscent of the late 1990's dot com tech boom that painfully transitioned into the dot com bust. For those of us who were trading those markets, some of us may be having flashbacks that raise cautionary concerns. I was a stockbroker with NYSE-member Oppenheimer & Co. in the late '80s and early '90s. I acquired Series 24 General Securities Principal licensing to manage other brokers and established my own research boutique in the early to mid-'90s. In about '95 I launched my own hedge fund with a modest amount of assets under management. The inflection point at the top of that dot com market was not announced on CNBC for investors to take defensive actions. Market tops are rarely announced. However, the dot com market top was preceded by a number of questionable IPOs with perhaps Pets.com being the poster-child for most outlandish IPO audacity.Today's wave of unicorn IPO's, such as Uber, dwarf yesterday's dot com lower quality IPOs in size. The sheer size of an Uber IPO who has not demonstrated a pathway to profitability is a concern. Perhaps, the Uber and Lyft business models have room for price increases to be implemented. Maybe cost-efficiencies can be learned for these companies. Until then, such IPOs are reason for concern and for keeping one cautious eye on the market exits. Exiting too early can be as bad as exiting too late. Remaining vigilant and aware of not just the reported market news, but the underlying market events that do not get reported is the job of any valuable investor subscription service. Trader's Idea Flow brings over 30 years of market experience to this discussion.General Expert: Everyone wants to be the next Amazon, but no one talks about the fact that Amazon was operating cash flow positive in the early 2000s and the company also had a huge profit center that will become a behemoth (AWS).Both Uber and Lyft are fueled by VC money and are trying desperately to find an AWS. Both are so delusional that their management is spinning autonomous driving as the endgame, something that is completely out of both company's expertise. The solution to slowing growth seems to be finding more opportunities to create losses, which brings in more revenue. The eagerness of both company to jump on the scooter hype illustrates this exact point. When such experiments have failed in China en masse, with survivors being gobbled up by even bigger money losing entities (e.g. Meituan and Mobike), trying to replicate the same experiment in the less population dense West is just insanity to me.Thanks SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY).Paulo Santos: In my view, the market is going through a tech bubble that's very similar to the dotcom bubble. If we consider tech (especially cloud stocks) + crypto (already crashed somewhat) + cannabis (already crashed somewhat), the current euphoria crop isn't much different from what was seen back in late 1999/early 2000.The IPOs represent supply, and this kind of bubble usually breaks due to exhaustion also brought about by significant supply. That said, some companies will likely become high margin players. Although I am not long, I believe Uber (UBER) - due to the nature of its business - is one.Cestrian Capital Research: Northrop Grumman (NOC). We have been at Buy on this stock since February 2019 and it has rewarded us by coming very close to our 3-yr price target already - plus which it hiked its dividend by 10% last quarter. Our ongoing thesis for the stock is that NOC will at least hold share in its core defense and military space markets, gain share in commercial space thanks to its 2018 acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA), and improve operating margins a little under the new CEO.Elazar Advisors: I've fallen in love with Amazon (AMZN) all over again. Last quarter was amazing. AWS and North America margins point to big EPS upside. I think in a world of slowing economies, Amazon is in its own global economy. With lower prices and convenience, Amazon's taking share from other ""global economies.""Jeffrey Himelson: My readers know all too well that Fitbit (FIT) is my favorite stock right now. A few years ago, I invested in Chegg (CHGG) which was undergoing a pivot in its business model from one-time book sales towards recurring revenue software revenue. CHGG remained incredibly undervalued at that time. I believe FIT is currently in this transitory phase from episodic hardware sales (i.e. trackers and smart watches) towards creating a platform to generate higher-margin recurring revenue streams.Ranjit Thomas: Selling options on Beyond Meat to make use of the high implied volatility. This is a cult stock with a low float before the IPO lock up ends. The product is no healthier than the alternative, is worse for the environment since it costs more to make, and has an inferior taste (subjective), which in a weird way provides a competitive advantage since it is hard for a competitive offering to beat it by being functionally better.App Economy Insights: My current favorite idea is Huya (HUYA), a video-game-content-streaming company with popular platforms in China, South East Asia, and Latam. Huya is one of the fastest growing companies in China, more than doubling its revenue in 2018. It's also a pure play in the e-Sports segment. The company is still small (EV of $5 billion) given its addressable market.Bull & Bear Trading: The romance phase of story stock Tesla (TSLA) is over. Valuation is now becoming increasingly relevant for investors as EV competition rises in the auto industry. Actual revenues and EPS will continue to become more important to Tesla investors. Imagine the concept of money actually being important for the valuation of Tesla on Wall Street. Wow, will miraculous wonders never cease? Tesla's days of trading into the stratosphere on disingenuous hype are ending, if not already over. Tesla's most recent smoke and mirrors trick states that, ""... we are entering Q3 with an increase in our order backlog."" While technically true, the fact is that Tesla's website allows potential customers to ""order"" the Model Y and Tesla China is also accepting pre-orders. Neither of those vehicles are currently even close to being in production. In fact, it will take billions of dollars in capital expenditures that are not provided for currently and years of time to build the factories that will build these vehicles. Perhaps the disingenuous hype of Mr. Musk is not completely dead yet but investors have become cynical. Shares of Tesla no longer are so easily managed higher by this overly-promotional CEO.General Expert: I like Newmark Group (NMRK). The company is a partial IPO/spinoff from BGC Partners. The stock cratered soon after the separation. The company's highly complex income statement probably scared off investors who didn't understand them, even analysts were confused. However, it was clear to me that the management understands how the business works as they focus on cash flow generation. The stock didn't screen well due to its complexity. It was so bad that S&P gave the company BB+ even though it had a huge stream of earnouts that effectively made it debt free. Some post-separation clauses also prevented the company from repurchasing a significant amount of shares, which were trading at mid-single digits cash flow. The stock has rebounded somewhat along with the market; however, I believe that there remains significant upside.Paulo Santos: My favorite idea right now is Mobile TeleSystems (MBT). Its core mobile business is growing due to increased data demand. By H2 2019 it laps the removal of roaming fees in Russia. MBT is also investing in cloud growth businesses, and at the same time it carries a sustainable 9.8% gross dividend yield, while carrying an absurdly low valuation when compared to companies with much poorer prospects in developed markets.***Thanks to our panel for participating!

The technical patterns in the chart suggest that the shares may climb even higher. Meanwhile, the options betting indicate the stock may be heading higher by more than 15%. I have not written on SNAP before, so I'm throwing my hat into the ring. The company is a compelling niche player to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) but has faced multiple challenges growing its business, which make the bullish technical and options betting exciting. I give you a three-pronged approach to breaking down Snap's stock and where it may be heading. You can now track my success and failure rate from these articles on this Google Spreadsheet I created. SNAP's chart shows the making of what could be a sizable technical reversal pattern that's forming, known as an inverse head and shoulders. It may signal that the stock rises to as high as $16. Additionally, the stock is now breaking above technical resistance at $13.60, another bullish indication. Volume has steadily been on the rise since the beginning of May as the stock price has been rising. It would indicate that more buyers have been stepping into the shares in recent weeks. Also, the relative strength index has risen and is trending higher since bottoming in October 2018. It would suggest that momentum has shifted, from bearish to bullish. Interestingly, the options have been seeing some bullish betting at the August 15, $15 calls with the open interest rising to around 33,000 contracts. On May 30, the open interest for that contract was at 0. For the buyer of the $15 calls to earn a profit, the stock would need to rise to around $16 by the expiration date. That's because the calls have a premium of $0.95 per contract. It's not a small wager either. The dollar value of the open interest is almost $3.1 million.One reason investors may be becoming more hopeful on SNAP is that for the first time in many quarters, the number of active users ticked higher to 190 million. That was up from 186 million in the fourth quarter, but down from 191 million in the first quarter a year ago. (Data from Statisa)Another positive trend is that ARPU has been not only been trending higher, but it has been making a series of higher lows and higher highs. First quarter ARPU increased by almost 40% vs. a year ago to $1.68 per user.(Data from Statisa)These are two compelling trends, and should they both continue to rise it could help to power the stock higher over time since it could help drive top-line revenue growth for the business. Another positive trend has been improving gross profit margins, which have risen to 36.4% in the first quarter from 14.7% in the first quarter of 2018. It doesn't signal that the company is about to turn a profit anytime soon, but in time where Facebook has seen its gross profit margins decline, it's a trend that is worth watching. The most significant risk for Snap has been its inability to deliver results consistently. Despite seeing sequential growth in its daily active users, one could argue that the number of users on the platform has plateaued since the fourth quarter of 2017. It's very different than Facebook, which has seen its daily active users continue to grow consistently and has not leveled off or dipped. The lack of user growth for SNAP could severely limit the company's ability to grow its revenue in the future.Despite showing strong ARPU growth in recent quarters, these numbers are not even close to those of Facebook's ARPU of $6.42 in the first quarter of 2019. That wide margin suggests that Snap's ability to monetize its audience is not nearly as high as that of Facebook. It makes one wonder how it is that Snap will be able to grow its revenue to meet consensus analysts' estimates of $2.675 billion the year 2021. That's more than double the total revenue the company had in 2018 of $1.18 billion. Perhaps it's possible, but for SNAP to reach those lofty expectations, it will need to grow its user base significantly, or it will need to figure out a better way to monetize its current audience. At the moment, it isn't clear that SNAP will be able to do that long term. There's no doubting that SNAP is showing signs of improvement in its business, and that is likely why the bulls are jumping into the stock. But Snap still has a lot to prove to make any move higher in the equity stick."
4266983,104812,2019-05-29T08:02:26-04:00,Stock has been on a rebound this year as company is reporting narrowing losses despite user numbers that remains weak.Introduction of new filters on the Snapchat app including 'gender-swap' and 'baby face' introduced recently appear to be a hit and should boost Q2 engagement numbers.The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is in talks with record lables to offer music integration as a response to emergence of rival 'Tik-Tok'.I remain bearish on the stock but acknowledge the near term momentum while unconvinced of the long term outlook.,"Shares of Snap Inc (NASDAQ:SNAP) have displayed relative strength this month up 4.0% through May 27, solidly outperforming the broader market and tech stocks that have sold off amid rising tensions from the U.S.-China trade dispute. I previously wrote about SNAP highlighting my bearish thesis focusing on the emergence of 'TikTok'. The Chinese app owned by Bytedance Ltd  has become a global phenomenon and in my view threatens SNAP's growth particularly in international markets. TikTok is just ""one more reason to short"" among a number of bearish factors. I felt this update was necessary because a couple of very recent developments have frankly spooked my conviction as a SNAP bear. I reiterate my concerns for the long term outlook of the stock but acknowledge that the near term trading sentiment has improved.Snap Inc daily stock price chart. source: FinViz.comOne of the features that made Snap Chat very popular helping the app to amass a user base approaching 190 million was its innovative use of augmented reality filters or ""lenses"" back in 2014. Users were able to superimpose a virtual mask on their videos that became a defining feature of the app. Fast forward to today and this technology has basically been copied many times over by rivals and is hardly revolutionary. Still, Snap Chat apparently had an ace up their sleeve when they introduced the baby-face and gender swap filters last month that may have given a breath of air to the brand momentum. CNET magazine describes the development saying; ""New Snapchat filters are fueling excitement on social media"". Other reports suggest the new feature has been a big hit. Twitter user demonstrating Snap Chat baby filter. source: @MajorMarvelKingAs the name suggests, the Snap Chat software makes a persons' faces either appear as a child for the baby-face swap or as the opposite gender in the gender-swap version. This technology isn't revolutionary or even at the cutting edge of augmented reality but Snap Chat appears to be effectively capitalizing on the marketing. For traders and investors this likely translates to a boost in user numbers for the current quarter. I can already picture management at the next earnings release conference call talking up the improvement in engagement which will in turn be used to draw in more advertising. The set up here is for a stronger than previously expected Q2. The question remains how long this boost will play out and if it's enough to reverse trends of weak user growth on the platform over the long term going forward. I don't think so. The cynical side of me expects Facebook's Instagram (NASDAQ:FB) to launch their own version of these camera effects soon and the excitement for Snap Chat to again fade as the novelty wears off. The other development cam last week when The Wall Street Journal reported Snap Inc is in talks with record labels to integrate music into the Snap Chat app essentially acknowledging the emergence and success of TikTok. The company is looking to expand its music access with broad rights to Universal Music Group (OTCPK:OTCPK:VIVEF), Sony Music Entertainment (NYSE:SNE), and Warner Music Group (NYSE:T). This access would allow Snap Chat users to incorporate music into their creations similar to features already available on TikTok and Instagram.Tik Tok Logo displayed on smartphone. source: Time Magazine/ Getty ImagesTikTok is regularly cited among the top downloaded apps in the world over the past year building a social media platform with features similar to Snap Chat but centered around music videos. Reports suggests that it is a big hit with Snap's key demographics of teenagers and young adults particularly in emerging Asian markets. On this development, I believe Snap is just a little to late to the music trend. Numbers out of India and Southeast Asia suggest TikToK has a clear dominance in the category and SNAP will be challenged to catch up as the preferred platform for the demographic across many markets where TikTok is number one. The emergence of TikTok in my view threatens Snap's global growth strategy even if it holds a user share in some markets like the U.S. better than others. My view is that Snap attempting to now add a feature that users are finding on rival platforms is too little, too late. The cost of these licenses, should SNAP proceed in this direction, remains unknown and could further add to losses by pressuring margins. Snap Inc. Daily Active Users. Source: Q1 Earnings PresentationUser numbers are the most important metric for this company that should act as a barometer to trends in brand momentum. I believe the new filters introduced in May should help boost near term user numbers. Going forward however; the bearish case is based on longer term trends of weaker engagement as the novelty of filters and the platform wanes. The company faces intense competition not only from TikTok in the international market but the continued growth of Instagram that has become the leader in 'causal social media'. Separately; the current valuation of SNAP remains a key concern as the company is not expected to turn a profit till at least 2021 based on consensus estimate. It's still possible the company never become profitable. There are also questions about the SNAP's long term strategy including the Spectacles division that has yet to prove to be a viable product with mass adoption. SNAP needs Spectables and its next iteration to be successful as the potential for another flop in sales would be negative for the stock.To reiterate, I believe this is a case of near term strength within longer term weakness. The developments in recent weeks at least show management is committed to addressing market trends and I concede that the outlook has somewhat improved since my last article. Snap remains a highly speculative stock for bulls and bears. I remain net ""short"" SNAP managing a position of option spreads. The volatility here makes SNAP a great trading instrument and I choose to take the bearish side based on my pessimistic long term view. I would not be surprised to see momentum build in the coming weeks ahead of a potential solid Q2 earnings result to be released in late July and may consider hedging my bets into that report. SNAP continues to face significant long term growth uncertainties. Be careful with this one and good luck."

The stock market has given the company and founding CEO Even Spiegel some incredible respect by pushing the stock all the way back to $15. A bullish investment thesis at the current price and even up to $20 just isn't plausible.Image Source: Snapchat website The consensus view has turned towards Snapchat having returned to user growth following a disastrous app update at the end of 2017. OneZero shows that weekly installs surged following the new filters confirming the idea that Q2 should show solid daily active user (DAU) growth.Source: OneZero What new investors are forgetting is that Snapchat was already losing momentum prior to the app update that sent user numbers spiraling down. The company has a long way to go in order to generate meaningful growth the Q1'18 peak levels.For Q1, Snap reported 190 million daily DAUs leading to sequential growth of about 2%. The updated Android app and new filters should generally help boost DAUs this year and beyond, but the company has to reach 210 million by next Q1 to return to 10% annualized DAU growth.Source: Snap Q1'19 presentationThe company is no longer in the death spiral that led to my correct call for the stock to dip below $5 that occurred in December. The updated prospects for improving app usage don't necessarily alter that valuation prediction for the stock, but they do change the momentum in the stock.One has to question whether the prospects have improved enough to warrant a stock up 170% this year and now worth about $22.5 billion based on a fully diluted share count of 1.5 billion shares.Data by YChartsThe bullish analyst call that got our attention was the BTIG prediction that Snap was headed to $20. Analyst Rich Greenfield revised his estimates for 2019 revenue up to $1.68 billion from $1.65 billion. The BTIG analyst predicted adjusted EBITDA would dip to a loss of $253 million, an improvement from a loss of $268 million.The issue here is that Snap still isn't getting past the threshold of losing tons of cash on a yearly basis on limited revenues. The average analyst revenue prediction for 2020 is $2.1 billion with the company still losing money for the fourth year after going public.The average analyst has become slowly less negative on the stock over the last year. Last July, a large number of analysts had Underperform or Sell ratings on the stock, while most ratings are now Holds with the average rating at 3.05.Source: Sell Side RatingsThe analyst recommendations are perplexing, considering the valuation on Snap has worsened lately. Snap trades at a far higher EV/S multiple compared to Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR). Over the last year, the stocks have traded in a volatile range, suggesting the next move is for Snap to return to the group average around 6x forward sales targets.Data by YChartsThe stock should easily have a target below $10 until the company can prove a real path to profitability.The key investor takeaway is that Snap has started generating improved financial metrics due to improved user numbers, but the company still isn't producing metrics that are worthy of a hike in the stock price. At a $20 price target, Snap would have a $30 billion market cap and sail past Twitter.The momentum in Snap could easily push the stock soaring to $20, but investors would be wise to abandon ship at such an unrealistic valuation."
4258390,50452,2019-05-01T05:06:44-04:00,"Snap shares have doubled up since the beginning of the year. The recent quarter was also a step in the right direction. Free cash flow improved markedly.However, the company's lack of user growth means that it must keep pulling more revenue from its existing base. We question how sustainable this is.With cash on hand now at $245 million, the company may need to raise capital by issuing shares. We see more downside risk than upside in Snap at this time.","One of the hot trends in the investing community these days is chasing after the next Facebook (FB) or Amazon (AMZN). Various companies have launched IPOs, and investors are jumping on them. Often times they have failed to maintain initial momentum, trading with volatility in the months following their launch. While Snap Inc. (SNAP) has been trading on the open market for approximately two years, the stock has been a disappointment to investors who chased the IPO.While the stock still remains well below its IPO price, shares have come to life appreciating more than 100% since the beginning of the year. Despite this momentum, we remain bearish on the stock. The company continues to burn cash while it grows. Additionally, the company's low user base growth means that more revenues must be generated from its existing user base. It's debatable how much and how long Snap can grow revenues from existing customers. Until the company can generate positive cash flow/EBITDA or grow its user base in a meaningful way, we remain bearish on Snap.Source: YChartsIt seems that Snap has largely plateaued in growing its user base. The company DAU (average daily users) is flat going back to Q1 2018. The global figure has been buoyed by emerging markets which have cancelled out the loss of users in North America and Europe.Source: Snap, Inc.Snap has seen success with its Discover program, which has increased interaction with users. The program features more than 450 premium channels which have successfully driven ad impressions and revenues per user. With operating expenses remaining stable, margins have flourished over the past year. Year-over-year gross margin has expanded from 17% to 39%. The result has been a sizeable leap of progress in bringing Snap closer to being cash flow positive. Source: Snap, Inc.Despite this progress, we have some concerns. Snap's inability to meaningfully grow its user base places pressure on the business to generate increasing amounts of revenue from its existing base. Snap needs to continue building on this success in order to even reach a break-even point with cash flows and earnings. In a highly competitive landscape that includes Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram competing for eyeballs along with Twitter (TWTR), Snap's ability to continue this trend is anything but a sure bet. The company ultimately needs to bring new users in.Unless Snap can reignite user base growth in its developed markets, the onus falls to its ""rest of the world"" demographic. With these emerging markets, we will be monitoring the revenue per user (lower than the global average), as well as the marketing and acquisition expenses needed to grow this demographic. Given that the North American user is much more lucrative for Snap, even growth in emerging markets may not provide as much ""bang for the buck"" from users as Snap has benefited from in the past.Source: Snap, Inc.Our other major concern is that Snap has yet to generate a profit. While it appears that the success of Discover means that the worst may be behind Snap, we were disappointed to see that Q2 EBITDA is projected at -$125 million to -$150 million. This forecast places Q2 as potentially its worst EBITDA output since Q2 2018. This is despite revenues being expected to jump as high as 37% from last year's mark.Source: Snap, Inc.This brings on the question, when will Snap become profitable? And not just generate positive EBITDA, but how can Snap grow its earnings consistently over time? Yes, Snap could continue to generate more revenue from its user base, but the longevity of this trend is questionable and doesn't instill confidence in an investment thesis.Source: YChartsSnap's cash pile is down to $245 million, and $1.2 billion when you factor in marketable securities (from more than $3 billion just over two years ago). This will buy Snap some time to continue working towards positive cash flow. Given the slowing burn over the past few quarters, Snap probably has a safe year before having to worry about funds. However a setback-type of quarter with a larger than anticipated cash burn could force Snap to raise more capital by issuing stock - a move that would surely apply downward pressure to the share price. With shares already doubling since the beginning of the year, we see more downside risk than short-term upside at the current share price.We would need to see positive cash flow and continued progress towards profitability in order to alter our bearish stance on Snap. Considering that Q2 is projecting EBITDA to post what would potentially be its largest loss in a year, it's still too early to put much weight into Snap's positive developments as of late.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

(NASDAQ:SNAP) has staged an impressive turnaround in 2019. The stock is now up 110% YTD and 140% since reaching a low $4.82 in December. The recovery has been based on better than expected 2018 fiscal Q4 results released in January along with a positive outlook in its latest Q1 report. The company has yet to make a profit but is narrowing its loss while revenues continue to grow. Despite the recent optimism, investors should take note of emerging Chinese rival application 'Tik-Tok' which has a similar concept of short videos and targets the same user demographic. Apparently; 'Tik-Tok' has become something of a global phenomenon gaining traction in recent months among teenagers and reports suggest its already drawing users away from the Snapchat platform. While it remains to be seen what impact Tik-Tok will have on Snap's long term growth, it highlights what I view to be the relative fragility of Snap's core business among fast changing youth fads and tech platform popularity. I'm bearish on SNAP given significant long term uncertainties. This article covers my bearish view on SNAP including information on why Tik-Tok is now seen as disruptive.Snap Inc. weekly stock price chart. source: FinViz.comThe following points highlight my bearish views on shares of SNAP:SNAP released its Q1 earnings April 23rd posting Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.10, beating by $0.02 and Revenue of $320.4 million ahead of expectations by $14.2 million. Quarterly revenues grew 39% year over year while the company did a commendable job of holding operating expenses down which actually declined 4% y/y. Still; reported free cash flow remained a negative at $78 million on the quarter compared to larger negative of $268 million for the period last year. The story has been a narrowing loss with improving cash flow. Management offered Q2 revenue guidance to be between $335 million and $360 million, or growth between 28% and 37% y/y. Snap Inc. Quarterly Free Cash Flow. Source: Q1 Earnings PresentationIn terms of user data, reported daily average users (DAUs) was slightly down year over year at 190 million compared to 191 million in Q1 last year.

Source: Q1 Earnings PresentationSnap DAU numbers are in contrast to other social media juggernauts including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) which each reported growth of 7.7% and 11.6% for the metric each respectively. Snap instead likes to point out that the average revenue per user (ARPU) is surging, up 39% globally in Q1 at $1.68. Basically, advertisers are throwing more money at the platform against a flat number of users. This is unsustainable in my opinion. Snap Inc. Average Revenue Per User. Source: Q1 Earnings PresentationThe following points highlight my bearish views on shares of SNAP:Shares of SNAP command a premium to that of Facebook and Twitter in terms of price-to-sales and to me this seems unjustified. Considering the scale of the three platforms and current expected growth, the forward price to sales ratio of SNAP at 9.9 suggests the stock is overvalued by at least 16% related to an average of the other two comparable and probably more in my opinion. Looking at consensus earnings estimates, SNAP is expected to lose ($0.30) per share this year which would narrow to a loss of ($0.12) in 2020 and potentially turn a profit $0.07 in 2021 according to the yCharts database. By this measure the stock currently trades at 3-year forward earnings multiple of 165x. The way I analyze ""growth"" stocks, I can accept these type of multiples in cases where a company has clear growth momentum with favorable brand/product adoption trends. I don't see it in SNAP. In terms of social media and messaging there is an argument to be made that Snap Chap is a 2nd tier platform behind Facebook/Instagram and Twitter and should trade at a discount. The stock is objectively expensive. Unless you're a teenager or otherwise heavily into social media, it's understandable the first question you may be asking is; Tik-Tok who? Tik-Tok is a social media platform that allows users to create and share short videos similar to those on Snapchat. Time Magazine recently published an exposé on the app describing it as ""entering the mainstream and gaining global appeal"". Tik Tok Logo displayed on smartphone. source: Time Magazine/ Getty ImagesTik-Tok's ""hook"" is that it has secured broad copyright agreements with major music publishers, allowing users to add music to the videos for which users creatively make music-videos or lip sync along to popular songs. Users also use the platform with landing page type profiles, sharing non-music related videos stories that to me appear to be a cross between Snapchat and Facebook's Instagram Stories. The concept has proven to be successful; some of the recent available stats suggest Tik Tok as one of the most popular apps in the world, surpassing 1 billion installs. Apparently the kids love it.Tik Tok data stats. source: MediaKixxLaunched in China in 2016, owner Bytedance Ltd is reported to be worth $75 billion according to funding rounds as recently as Q4 of last year. The company has major resources and backing to invest in a global product with scale. Unlike Snapchat, Tik-Tok does not have an advertising based revenue model, but instead sells virtual goods like limited edition stickers and digital gifts. This article isn't to address Tik-Tok's business model or their long term potential; the point is that over the past year it seemingly came out from nowhere and represents the fast changing landscape of social media tech that makes Snapchat vulnerable.Even if the rise of Tik-Tok does not ""conquer"" the United States, keep in mind it has a major presence in other markets where Snap operates and could slow Snapchat's growth globally. I anticipate SNAP bulls claiming the apps are different enough and don't serve the same purpose, but the fact of the matter is that Tik Tok is drawing screen-time away from potential Snapchat users every day. A new generation of youths getting into social media may be leaving Snapchat behind. While Facebook and Twitter may have a ""moat"" as a uniquely differentiated platform, Tik Tok at the very least proves that Snapchat is vulnerable to emerging rivals. Current consensus estimates of SNAP turning a profit by 2021 are based on a revenue forecast for that year of $2.668 billion, ~125% higher than the fiscal 2018 level of $1.18 billion. Should this growth under-perform the stock price could face significant downside, and I think it will. There is uncertainty whether SNAP will indeed double their revenues in the next three years. Given that current user growth on Snapchat is flat, the estimates above require a significant increase in the average revenue per user (ARPU). My skepticism is based on questioning why advertisers would essentially double the spending on the platform if user data trends lower which. I find it unlikely that Snapchat will suddenly see a renaissance of app installs or user growth considering the current product momentum and evolving social media space (Tik Tok among any other new entrant). If user numbers disappoint in the near term like next quarter, look for advertisers to being to pull back from the platform and the estimates above will face revisions lower. Snap wants investors to know that it's more than the Snapchat app and is betting that its Spectacles product division can be a driver for future growth. Spectacles 1 and 2 were both poorly reviewed and it appears the company is going in the direction of a higher price point with potentially AR technology for the third iteration. To me the whole things sounds like a weak business school marketing class proposal and may never take off. Snap Inc needs this product to work. I believe CEO Evan Spiegel had a brilliant idea with the original Snapchat application but is now lacking some needed strategy direction. The company was too slow to innovate as rivals like Instagram for example incorporated many of the concepts previously unique to Snapchat. I believe there is enough doubt in the SNAP resurgence story that investors should at least stay away. I'm shorting SNAP via puts because I'm not convinced the company will be around in 5-10 years down the line in its current iteration. I see the stock trading lower over the next year to eventually test its historical lows around $5. The near term catalyst is my expectation of under-performance of user data that will superseded any improvement in financials. The long term bear case is simply that the Snapchat product will slowly fail and be seen as an artifact of this period; otherwise a victim of fast changing fads in social tech. Risks to the bearish case is user growth exceeds expectations and the financial targets are met. I see risks as tilted to the downside."

For a large number of young people, Snap has replaced text messaging and other traditional forms of communication. The company has struggled to translate its popularity into profits. However, the stock has been an incredible trade off the December lows, it is up a staggering 161% this year.Data by YChartsThe first step in analyzing Snap is thinking about the value of the platform. DAU growth has slowed to a crawl, but nonetheless the platform still boasts 190 million DAUs and 287 million active accounts. I believe that any doubts regarding Snap's popularity are unfounded. While user growth has slowed, Snap is still very much a part of everyday life for many teens and young adults.SourceSnap significantly trails other social media apps such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and YouTube in terms of active users.SourceHowever, it is very popular among teens and younger users. As Mediakix estimates Snap has more teen users than Facebook and Instagram, and that 83% of teens use Snapchat on a monthly basis.SourceWhile Snap is winning with teens, the company continues to burn through its pile of cash. There can be a negative connotation in terms of internet companies being valued based on users as opposed to cash flow. Since Snap is losing money, it's important to understand if we can correlate users to value. Aswath Damodaran, ""The Dean of Valuation"" believes social media companies are priced on user numbers in this video (at 47:30). He makes the case that an easy way to value social media stocks is to value each user at $100. In his analysis this users showed the greatest correlation to market cap.Damodaran calls equating uses to stock prices as pricing rather than valuation. For a company like Snap, we have to get creative regarding our valuation, which is inherently speculative. Damodaran is correct in that we can't really accurately assess Snap's future cash flows based on user numbers. I don't think we can completely dismiss user numbers, but cash is king.Companies that rely on advertising for revenues are dependent on the number of viewers. Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) are the gorillas in the space because of their appeal to wide reaching audiences of various interests and backgrounds. Snapchat also has a wide reaching appeal among a younger demographic. We can't reasonably predict Snap's cash flows because of the company's inconsistency. Social media is a product of trends and behaviors as opposed to projections based on growth of markets and needs. But, users are valuable if they can be effectively monetized. The market will use numbers like active users because it struggles to grapple with what cash flows a company could produce in the future. The market is going to attempt to price the company at scale. If it didn't, it would look like incredible stupidity in hindsight. Users give us an idea at attempting to grasp the future, but it is not a proper form of valuation.If we look at the active users figure from above we see that Snap is trading at $69 per user, as opposed to Facebook at $167 per user (including Instagram but excluding Messenger and WhatsApp), Twitter at $85, and Pinterest at $59. While users may show the greatest correlation, there is some premium to be paid for companies that produce cash flows, and certainly some disparity.Data by YChartsSnap and Pinterest are expected to continue to lose money while Facebook and Twitter are expected to increase profits. Users are one way to think about the company, but as Damodaran points out, the future cash flows are what will drive Snap's future valuation. Thus we have to critically assess the intangibles that underlie the business that will create value.This is a challenge that relates to many emerging tech companies. Think of Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) as well. Much like Snap, these companies have become a common part of everyday life for many people. Despite the usefulness, the businesses behind the services have yet to prove they are sustainable. This leads to what some would consider a stock market that is incredibly overvalued. But, if we reasonably think about the future cash flows of a company like Snap could produce, the market can't reasonably assign a super low valuation. If the company were to begin generating meaningful cash flow it would appear far too obvious in hindsight. The risk to reward would be very off balanced. Situations like this can offer tremendous upside, which is what I believe happened with Snap over the first half of 2019. So much risk was priced in when the market tanked over the back half of 2018 that the market had too much pessimism baked in.The Dotcom Bubble is synonymous with excessive euphoria in regards to this phenomenon of tech valuation. Deep value oriented investors seem to cry that this is repeating itself today with names like Snap. There indeed was the horrible failures like Pets.com in the Dotcom bust, but there also was names like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN). It may be easy to view the parabolic moves of these companies as unjustified pandemonium. But was it? Perhaps it was actually incredible foresight that took years to unravel. While certainly these stocks were ahead of themselves, even buying the peak of the winners would have produced market beating returns over the long term. I wouldn't count Snap out, but it's going to be a long road.Data by YChartsUnlike Uber and Lyft, Snap has model social media companies like Facebook and Twitter that have proven to be sustainable businesses. This key difference makes Snap a more compelling speculation than Uber or Lyft. In spite of that, all social media businesses are very different. If Snap's business was in direct competition with Facebook or Twitter, I think it would have been crushed long ago. Snap's direct communications will make it harder for the company to effectively monetize. Snap could face similar issues Facebook is facing privacy issues trying to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp.I think Snap's biggest advantage is advertising based on location. Snap is a bit like Facebook or Instagram in real time. Snap is most valuable to businesses that sell an experience. Users use Snapchat to document experiences. Local businesses or events that may not be widely known that can promote to local people taking advantage of Snap's location services. Snap could better leverage its ""heat map"" which shows areas where activity on Snap is greater. Snap could give users a better understanding of the happening events in the surrounding area while charging advertisers access to their large user base.Snap's current layout features a camera screen to take pictures and videos to send to friends, an inbox of messages and stories from friends, and discover section that looks a lot like a tabloid news site. I think Snap could benefit users and shareholders by emphasizing local businesses and events as opposed to the current discover tab now. No one wants to watch commercials on Snap, but promoting events and experiences would add value to both users and advertisers.Snap is very difficult to value. The company is burning cash at a rate of 68 million per month. The stock's meteoric rise has shown that the market is struggling to understand the business. I use Snapchat every day, and I see the usefulness of its platform. However, there is no way to place a confident value on the business. I think Damodaran is correct in that regard.Snapchat is a speculative stock, but I will certainly follow the company closely. Should management make changes and outline a clear path to profitability, and if shares come down in price I may take a shot with owning Snapchat.While Snapchat is undoubtedly a popular, valuable platform, there is simply no way to place a clear valuation on the stock. The path to profitability is murky. A 20 billion dollar price tag is far too rich to pay for a company with as much up in the air as Snapchat. Should the stock again fall into the mid-single digits the stock could be an intriguing speculative pick-up. While I have seen Snapchat displace text messaging, I struggle to conclude that there is significant upside when the company has continually floundered in producing meaningful cash flows. Snapchat is a wonderful platform but the business is a mess to make for a solid investment. For now, I'll stay on the sidelines, but that certainly could change."
4256679,105040,2019-04-25T11:14:21-04:00,"Snap has executed well and has rebounded over 100% in the past few months.However, we believe the price now substantially exceeds its intrinsic value.We are not permanent bears on Snap and will consider buying if conditions are right.Snap should be avoided for now.","After reporting two consecutive blockbuster earnings, Snap (SNAP) has substantially appreciated from its $5 lows to above $12. Although we do agree that Snap's fundamentals have improved significantly, we believe this isn't enough to account for the sharp rise in its price.Snap has arguably executed quite well in its recent quarter. We believe the most impressive feat was turning its slow, buggy Android app into a much faster, more functional app. According to Snap, this has caused a 6% increase in people sending snaps within the first week of the update.Google ImagesSnap has also launched a host of new features, including games, augmented reality features, and new camera features. These new features, along with the improved Android app, seem to have helped the company increase DAUs from 186mil in Q4 to 190mil in Q1. According to Snap, it reaches more 13-34-year olds than Instagram in the US now.We believe these are substantial fundamental improvements for the company, which had lost users due to its redesign in 2018. This user growth shows that Snapchat is still quite attractive to teens around the world. Snapchat definitely has its own niche that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram cannot occupy, even if Instagram does copy some aspects of Snapchat.The numbers are great, too. Global ARPU rose 39%, and losses were cut significantly due to operating leverage. In fact, despite revenues rising near 40% YOY, operating expenses barely budged, which led to an $80mil improvement in profitability from a $390mil loss to a $310mil loss.Overall, Snap had a great quarter. Engagement improved substantially and users seem to be slowly returning to the platform. However, despite all this improvement, we believe Snap is still overvalued.We don't believe Snap is spiraling towards bankruptcy, like some bears believe, considering it has over $1.2bil in cash and marketable securities, but we don't believe a company without substantial user growth like Snap should trade at such a high valuation.Snap currently trades at over 14x FY 2018 revenues, which is insane for a company whose growth is pretty much dependent on ARPU growth alone. In fact, YOY ARPU growth is exactly the same as YOY revenue growth. This means that the only way Snap is driving growth is serving more ads to each user, like the six-second unskippable ads it introduced in 2018. However, purely introducing more ads will draw the ire of users. You can only monetize each user a certain amount before they leave the platform.Google ImagesDon't get me wrong, Snap still has a lot of room to monetize its users, especially those in North America and Europe, but without a larger pool of users, it's doubtful that the company will be able to command an extremely high ARPU.Snap does trade at a lower valuation per user than Facebook, but Facebook is much more profitable than Snap and has a broader base of users. Without substantial user growth, Snap will never reap Facebook's economies of scale and thus will never be as profitable as Facebook, which means this much lower valuation per user is justified.We're not permanent bears on Snap, and we will start being bullish under a few circumstances.1. User growth continues or acceleratesThis would not only give confidence to advertisers who are advertising on Snap, but may also attract new advertisers to advertise on Snap. A large and growing user pool is worth its weight in gold and should bolster and maintain the company's revenue growth. We would be much more interested in buying Snap if this happens.2. Snap corrects substantiallyWe believe that Snap can increase its revenues by 2-3x purely based on ARPU expansion alone with its current user base without a significant increase in cost before growth dies out. This means we believe Snap could make annualized profits of $1-1.2bil at some point. We would be willing to pay 6-7x of this future profit for Snap, or $8.4bil at the maximum.We believe Snap is a unique offering in the marketplace that has great potential for future revenue growth. Having said that, the math just doesn't work out, and we'll need much more substantial fundamental improvement or a much cheaper valuation before buying into Snap."
4256322,22148,2019-04-24T14:11:33-04:00,Snap generally exceeds Q1 analyst estimates in a sign that the social-messaging site has bounced off the bottom.The company provided horrible Q2 adjusted EBITDA guidance for a $137.5 million loss.The stock has a fully diluted market valuation of $18.5 billion that is far too expensive for unprofitable revenues that might only reach $1.55 billion this year.,"While Snap (SNAP) produced some improving financial metrics during Q1, the social-messaging company came up short on many other metrics. The guidance suggests that some of the initiatives started in Q2 places the company right back into substantial losses due to an inability to scale efficiently. The stock is not very appealing at $12 with a market valuation in excess of $18 billion.Image Source: Snapchat websiteBy just about all metrics, the Q1 numbers were an impressive improvement from last year and beat analyst estimates. Revenues grew by 39% to $320 million and operating expenses declined. The mix is a great combination for improving margins and income metrics.Snapchat even returned to user growth as measured by daily active users (DAUs). The social-messaging service approached the record high of 191 million back in Q1'18 in a sign that the site has climbed out of the abyss created by the app redesign last year.The user numbers should see another boost with the updated Android app launched at the end of Q1. Snap has already seen a boost in Android users. Along with a successful Snap Partner Summit back in early April, Snap appears back on an innovative path.Yet, the company still reported a substantial $123 million adjusted EBITDA loss. Sure, Snap reported a substantial improvement over the $218 million loss last year, but the guidance should halt all excitement over the improving trends.Source: Snap Q1'19 presentationSnap guided to a Q2 adjusted EBITDA loss of $125 million to $150 million. The company is hardly forecasting an improvement from the $169 million loss from last Q2 despite revenues set to surge 30%.The problem here is that Android customers aren't exactly the most profitable customer base around. Snap already losing substantial amounts of cash before entering this user base is troubling. In addition, the excitement over Bitmoji and augmented reality launched at the Partner Summit will only be copied by Facebook (FB) in short order.If anything, Snap had the largest tailwind in the last few quarters due to concerns over privacy at Facebook. Even Twitter (TWTR) potentially benefited from issues at Facebook to drive user growth.The bigger problem for the stock is that Snap has already had an incredible run to $12. The company has the constant overhanging threat of Facebook stealing their business while the financials remain horrible.My previous investment thesis predicted the death spiral dip to $5 that occurred. The major surprise now is that the market has been so willing to embrace this turnaround before Snap has shown any ability to get onto the other side of massive losses. New innovations are only good when they lead to improving financials, yet the Q2 guidance suggests the surge in Android usage is going to cause the social-messaging company to take a step back.With the surging share counts, Snap now has a market valuation of over $18.5 billion. Financial websites tend to list the market valuation somewhere below $16.0 billion as the 209 million shares for stock-based awards aren't always accurately included in numbers.Source: Snap Q1'19 presentationThe crazy part is that Snap now trades at a higher forward P/S multiple than both Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) despite the troubling financial trends. Using the accurate valuation, Snap trades closer to 12.0x forward sales estimates.The key investor takeaway is that Snap's Q2 guidance supports a company that still can't scale. The new innovations and update of the Android app are being met with some rather weak EBITDA guidance. These users are typically unattractive and the users outside of North America fails to generate even $1 in ARPU. Even worse, Facebook hasn't even fully stolen the new innovations yet, leaving Snap right back in the same money-losing situation as after the IPO. Do not chase this rally in the stock."
4256439,103480,2019-04-25T10:15:00-04:00,"Shares of Snap wavered between gains and losses in the days after posting its Q1 results.
        The company reported a massive beat on both revenue and EPS, while free cash flow losses thinned dramatically as well.
        Snap chalked up a big portion of the beat to its new Discover offering, which has grown to 450 premium channels.
        On the negative side, however, the company still shed DAUs on a year-over-year basis, leading us to believe that its user base is already quite saturated.","At first glance, it seems that for Snap (SNAP), the worst is over. The onetime social media darling has just posted Q1 results that investors initially cheered. After a rocky 2018 that saw a ballooning of Snap's losses, an exodus of top executives, and a risky re-design of the user interface that was poorly received, Snap seems to be on firmer footing now with a stabilization in the user base and a thinning of losses. But is it enough to merit the stock's huge gains since January?As seen in the chart above, Snap's stock has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, and at its current share price in the mid-$11 range, the company has reclaimed a market cap of $15.0 billion. That's still significantly below the $31 billion valuation at which Snap went public, and even below the $18 billion that Snap was worth in its last round of private funding. Traditional valuation metrics are less illuminating for a rapid-growth, high-losses stock like Snap, but after netting off the company's $1.21 billion in cash, the company has an enterprise value of $13.8 billion. Against Wall Street's consensus revenue estimate of $1.55 billion (per Yahoo Finance) for the current fiscal year, Snap trades at approximately ~9x EV/FY19 revenues. As seen in the chart below, that's significantly below the mid-teens multiple at which Snap was trading last year:Despite a more reasonable valuation, do investors have any fundamental reasons to continue backing Snap? In my view, there are now many puts and takes on this company especially coming out of its mixed first-quarter print, which we'll discuss in further detail in this article. Overall, however, I think Snap's weak user growth and saturation problem outweighs its impressive revenue and FCF results. It's difficult to justify a ~2x rally in the stock this year when Snap's DAU count has stalled. Investors would be wise to stay on the sidelines until Snap can show initiatives or progress toward reclaiming user growth. Make no mistake - even Snap bears can point to a lot of positive notes coming out of Snap's first quarter. Here's a look at the earnings summary below:Figure 1. Snap 1Q19 resultsSource: Snap Q1 earnings releaseRevenues grew 39% y/y this quarter to $320.4 million, far surpassing Wall Street's estimates of $306.2 million (+33% y/y) by a huge six-point margin. Note also that revenue growth accelerated three points relative to 36% y/y growth in Q4, whereas Wall Street had expected a three-point deceleration.One of the biggest drivers behind Snap's revenue growth is a successful rollout of Discover, which is where Snap users can watch branded content (and Snap, of course, receives advertising dollars). Here's what Evan Spiegel, Snap's co-founder and CEO, had to say on Discover's progress on the Q1 earnings call:Alongside stronger revenue growth, Snap managed to pare down its expenses as well. On a pro forma basis, the company noted that operating expenses declined -4% y/y, driven by reductions in both R&D (product) and sales personnel costs. As a result of these cost-down efforts as well as the outperformance in revenues, Snap managed to dramatically reduce its cash burn to ""just"" -$78 million, versus a massive FCF loss of -$268 million in 1Q18:Figure 2. Snap FCFSource: Snap Q1 earnings deckWhen Snap was burning cash at a quarterly rate of ~$250 million, investors were scared that the company would have to raise a dilutive secondary offering on an already-weak share price. Now, with north of $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an FCF run rate of under -$100 million, Snap's liquidity seems secure, at least in the near term. That's where the good news ends, however. In my view, Snap's user trends are still miserable, and continue to reflect an incredibly competitive landscape in which Instagram (and in particular, Instagram stories) has gained millennials' favor. A report last year noted that Instagram Stories has doubled Snap's DAU count. Note as well that parent company Facebook (FB) has also launched a virtual clone called Facebook Stories, which appears directly in the Facebook news feed.Snap ended Q1 with 190 million DAUs, a 1 million decline (-1% y/y) versus 191 million in the year-ago quarter. This is a repeat of last quarter's trends, where Snap shed 1 million users in Q4 on a year-over-year basis as well. Figure 3. Snap DAU trendsSource: Snap Q1 earnings deckSnap's own commentary on its install rates continue to cast doubt on the company's ability to meaningfully expand its DAU counts. In its earnings materials, the company reported that ""As of March, Snapchat reaches 90% of all 13-24 year-olds and 75% of all 13-34 year-olds in the U.S."" To me, that's a terrifying statistic: if Snap is already so well-entrenched in its flagship market, is there any more room for user growth?It's true that Snap drove incredible revenue acceleration this quarter, but when we account for the fact that DAUs were more or less flat, we're less impressed. The company managed to drive revenue growth solely through growth in ad impressions. Per CFO Lara Sweet's comments on the Q1 earnings call:Ad volumes have grown substantially (to the point where market pricing on ads has decreased double-digits), driving the entirety of Snap's revenue growth. I recently made a similar argument regarding Pinterest (PINS): there's only so much that a company can grow from increased ad load. At a certain point, ""ad load"" reaches a limit (as we've seen in the past with Facebook) and companies like Snap have to curtail ad space if they don't want to alienate users. In essence, long-term growth hinges on Snap's ability to grow its DAU counts - but in its key markets in Europe and North America, DAUs are on the decline. A social media company like Snap needs a critical network mass in order to thrive - if the company can't quickly turn around its user counts, millennials will move on to the next platform (as it seems many have already done with Instagram stories) and leave Snap in the dust.Though Snap delivered excellent financial results on both revenue and free cash flow, as well as guiding bullishly for next quarter (revenues expected at +28-37% y/y, the midpoint of which is in-line with consensus), Snap failed to deliver on the one metric that counts: DAUs. The company's advertising-driven growth isn't sustainable over the long term, and in order for Snap stock to rally back to its post-IPO heights, it'll have to first fix its user growth issues. And with the saturation that Snap is indicating in its core U.S. market, that possibility seems even more remote. Investors would be better off staying on the sidelines here."
4266366,104703,2019-05-24T12:44:09-04:00,"Snap shares continue to exhibit signs of solid momentum. The stock's continued upward trajectory has made it a great comeback story.Despite my initial bearishness on the story, signs of fundamental progress at Snap cannot be ignored.A return to user growth, a rejuvenated Android and iOS monetization story, original content, and gaming all provide long-term tailwinds to Snap's growth.Despite this, there are some risks. These risks include continued cash burn, poor share structure, hyper-competitive social media landscape, and a lack of general uniqueness.Raising price target from $9 to $10, rating reiterated at HOLD.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is a company that has been riddled with controversy ever since its March 2017 IPO (initial public offering). The stock IPO'd at $17, and over the next couple of days, the stock traded as high as $29.44. That marked Snap as a $30 billion plus company. Fast forward more than two years, and we get a stock trading at ~$11.50, with a market cap of ~$15 billion. The value of the business has been cut in half.However, there is another side to that coin. Back in December of last year, Snap shares reached penny stock status, moving as low as $4.82/share, a market cap of ~$6 billion. Since then, the stock has more than doubled, as investors are beginning to buy into the Snap turnaround story. When Snap shares were at $6, I hypothesized that we had significant upside ahead. Sure enough, here we are at $11.50. That leaves me with one question, where does the stock go from here?To answer this question, I will delve into the various bull and bear cases for the stock.The first case that bulls make for the stock, is that the company is well positioned in the massive social media advertising market. Digital advertising is a massive, and continuously growing market. This has been a key part of my bull thesis on rival Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares. The digital advertising market is massive and is quickly growing. The astonishing growth of the digital advertising market will benefit all of its players. Some of these players include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Snap, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook, and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). Facebook and Google operate as the duopoly in the internet advertising market. Together, they hold more than 60% of the overall internet advertising market. However, Snap doesn't operate in the internet advertising market, they operate in a subset. The social media advertising market.When we filter out internet advertising companies, and look just at social media advertising, the addressable market shrinks, but so does the competitive landscape. In fact, I believe Snap's only real competitors in this space are Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and TikTok. Google is excluded, because it doesn't own any real social media platforms of any relevance, other than YouTube. Even then however, I do not believe that YouTube is a social media player.So, let's size up this market.(Source: Statista)Right now, in 2019, the overall internet advertising market is sized at $311 billion, up 17% Y/Y. However, we need to analyze the subsegments of the advertising market. Search advertising is the largest part of the digital advertising market. Social media is the second largest segment. However, look out to 2023, where social media is expected to be the largest subcategory of the overall digital advertising market. Because of this, social media should be the fastest growing segment in the digital ad market.As of 2019, the social media advertising market is a staggering $93 billion. By 2023, it is expected to more than double to $218 billion in size. For 2019, consensus revenue estimates are for $1.59 billion. This means a total market of 1.7%. If we extrapolate this exact same share to a far larger market, conservatively assuming that Snap sees no increase in market share, then we get 2023 revenues of $3.706 billion, more than triple Snap's 2018 revenue. And this is assuming Snap gains absolutely no market share in social media advertising.If Snap, by 2023, reaches 3% share, a more realistic target, they see revenues closer to $6.5 billion. However, how does Snap achieve this level of market share?I believe Snap is in a unique position in the advertising market. In the advertising market, you have to have a demographic or a product niche that helps you stand out amongst advertisers.With Snap, I believe they have found somewhat of a niche. This niche is in the market for teenage/Generation Z consumers. While right now they have less purchasing power than Generation X consumers and even millennials, they will dictate future purchasing trends. Right now, most Generation Z consumers lack consistent and high income. Thus, they are not as good targets for advertising, because they are less likely to spend money on products. Many of them are still reliant on their parents' income. So, it will take a few years before these consumers end up having higher levels of purchasing power.However, in the past, I have argued that Instagram is eating Snap's lunch. I still believe that. However, a recent report says that 41% of Gen Z consumers list Snapchat as their favorite social networking platform. In second place, we see Instagram at 35%. However, Snap's figure is down from 46% in the fall of 2018.Overall, Snap's young user base, despite robust competition from Instagram, will be an attractive selling point amongst advertisers. Combined with the huge size of the overall social media advertising market, and we can see a significant revenue opportunity is existent for Snap in advertising alone.In addition to advertising, Snap has been broadening its business into gaming and eCommerce. I consider what Snap is doing with eCommerce and gaming similar to what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been doing over the last few years. Snap is attempting to build a robust user ecosystem. Right now, Snap's entire business is built around advertisements on their core Snapchat platform. However, the chat feature, discover, and stories are all creating a social media ecosystem.By creating a gaming platform and an eCommerce platform within the Snapchat product, Snap is further locking in users into the Snapchat ecosystem. In addition, innovative augmented reality-based video games may help the narrative of Snap being an innovative company, deserving an innovation premium in its valuation.Snap's ability to integrate gaming and eCommerce into the platform enables the ecosystem to grow stronger and stickier.The only problem with this is that other social media platform like Instagram and TikTok can just as easily implement gaming and eCommerce into their platforms. This has happened before. For example, the stories feature was invented by Snapchat and copied by Instagram. As a result, Instagram Stories were far more popular than Snapchat Stories and even Snapchat as a whole. We have already seen Instagram implement eCommerce partnerships into their platform.Basically, Snap's expansion into other businesses like gaming and eCommerce can improve the stickiness of the overall Snapchat ecosystem.Up until a couple of months ago, Snap shares were in a free fall as investors digested declining user numbers, and decelerating revenue growth. However, in Q4 and Q1 we saw improving user trends. Granted this was bolstered by a solid Android update, the company's iOS user growth remained strong in the last couple of quarters.(source: Snap IR)This is reflected in Snap's rest-of-world segment. The ROW segment is a mostly Android-based market, while North America and Europe are more iOS-focused markets. Even in these more developed European and North American markets, Snap reported an additional 2 million users.So, even in increasingly saturated markets like the US and Europe, Snap is finding a way to grow its user base. In emerging markets, the Android update is undoubtedly a user growth tailwind.As Evan Spiegel mentioned in the Q1 conference call, the effects of Snap's Android update are yet to really boost Snap's top line results. We should see continued user recovery over the next several quarters as users come back to Snap on the Android platform.Now, let's look at Snap's monetization progress.(Source: Snap IR)In Q1, Snap reported overall ARPU growth of 39%. As with Snap's user growth, monetization growth has been the fastest in developing ROW operating segments. Something interesting keen observers will notice, is that overall ARPU growth accelerated in Q1. In Q4, Snap saw ARPU growth of 36.6%. In Q1, we saw ARPU growth of 39%. While this was fueled by Snap's Android update, we saw an acceleration from 23% in Q4 to 34% in Q1. This acceleration is attributable to a few factors.Original content shows, the Android redesign, and increased ad impressions all contributed to accelerating monetization growth. Accelerating monetization growth coupled with recovering user numbers brings about a re-accelerating revenue growth story.Maybe most important to the Snap story, the company is showing a path to profitable results. The company's operating leverage is quickly improving, as gross margins expand and operating expenses decline.(Source: Snap IR)Most importantly for Snap shareholders, the company is showing signs of gross margin expansion. While ad prices had been tanking recently because of increased programmatic exposure, the number of advertisement impressions has skyrocketed. This combination, coupled with mostly flat gross spending, has led to gross margin expansion at Snap.The company's revenue share margin is contracting as a percentage of the company's revenue, while the company's infrastructure cost hasn't grown much despite the new Android update, and a steady iOS user base.Couple this with lower operating expenses Y/Y, and we get a clearer path to profitability than I have seen from Snap in several years.(source: Snap IR)As you can see, Snap is tightening its expenses. In Q1, Snap actually reported a 4% operating cost decline. There is a balance of good and bad when it comes to this cost-cutting maneuver.On one hand, we see G&A, cost associated with labor and hiring employees increase by $2 million sequentially. This means, that rather than cut costs via layoffs, destroying employee morale, the company is finding other ways to effectively reduce expenses. For example, they are witnessing a Y/Y decline in marketing spend. Coupled with a generally recovering stock price and re-accelerating revenue growth, and we see that Snap employees may be more optimistic than they were previously.On the other hand, we also saw a drastic, nearly 11% reduction in R&D spend. This may be due to a change in strategic focus away from expanding into the aforementioned gaming and eCommerce markets, and sticking with enhancing the Snap advertisement business. It may also be an example of management learning a lesson from the costly and disastrous Snapchat app redesign. Management may becoming more prudent, and risk-averse, prioritizing projects with the greatest likelihood of pleasing both advertisers and users.Over the long haul however, I believe Snap will return to expanding operating costs, as they invest heavier in future products that enhance the ecosystem. This will take more employees, and potentially higher costs of marketing.Snap's business model has been deemed a financially unviable one recently with continuous cash burn and a lack of profitability. However, a reaccelerating revenue growth number coupled with expanding gross margins will make higher cost growth easier to digest. Because of this, the company is likely to be more ambitious in operating expenses in the quarters and years ahead.While the bear thesis has come under pressure in the last couple of quarters, there are still a few valid points that bears make. Here are the final pillars of the Snap bear thesis:First, let's address Snap's continued cash burn.Snap's multibillion-dollar IPO in March of 2017 has been quickly burnt through. Snap's lack of profitability has been a key propellant of the bear thesis over the last several years. After all, companies can only be valued (at the end of the day) based on profits longer term. The company's continued lack of success when it comes to turning Snap into a profitable business has left investors anxious about the company's ever-decreasing cash position.However, the rate of cash burn has been drastically decreasing over the last few quarters, as EBITDA loss is rained in as well as CapEx.(source: Snap IR)On a Y/Y basis, free cash flow improved a staggering%. However, we should note that this free cash flow number could be skewed by a cut of two thirds Y/Y in CapEx. Operating cash burn on the other hand saw a decline of 71%, the same as free cash flow overall.Continued improvements in Snap's free cash flow line have led investors to become increasingly optimistic on the overall Snap story. While cash burn continues, we can see that losses are quickly improving at the company. Coupling decreasing operating losses with lower capital spending should quickly de-risk the concern that the company will need to raise capital.The next point bears will make, is Snap's valuation. Let me first point out that my Snap price target is based on a discounted cash flow model. You will see this model in a later section. However, the valuation most bears are talking about has to do with the company's relative valuation, particularly on a sales basis.Data by YChartsAs you can see, against these other five companies, Snap trades at the highest valuation. However, we need to weight these valuations for growth.While revenue growth has definitely decelerated recently, it is still much stronger than many of these companies.As you can see here, it appears that Snap is slightly undervalued relative to its peers. When valuing high growth tech companies like Snap, it is important to weigh the company's valuation to its growth rate.Finally, the last pillar of the bear thesis has to do with a long-term structural problem with Snap's business, hardcore competition. Because users have been so flimsy and disloyal to the Snapchat brand, investors have been worried (rightfully so) that competing platforms like Instagram and TikTok would take users from Snap. Because Snap had no lock on intellectual property embedded in the platform (i.e. Stories, Discover), Instagram could copy such features at greater scale, and steal users. This threat is still very real, and is the greatest threat to any bull thesis on Snap.Coupled with the rise to fame of TikTok, an app that also aims at the teenage Gen-Z market, and we can see just how severe the competitive threat is for Snap. On top of all of this, advertisers have found much higher ROI on platforms like Instagram than on platforms like Snapchat.Overall, the biggest risk to the Snap bull thesis is hardcore competition. It is one of the reasons I am neutral overall on the stock.As mentioned earlier, and in the description of the article, I value Snap using a discounted cash flow model. It is the model I use to derive my price target.Unlike other DCF calculations I have used in the past, I am instead using Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju's estimate for Snap's WACC (weighted average cost of capital) of 13%, and a terminal growth rate of 3%.Now, let's go into my assumptions for the business.This model assumes ~225 million users at an annual ARPU run rate of $27.83/user, as opposed to the $6.35/user we saw in 2018. This significant expansion is due to mass advertiser re-budgeting into social media ads, continued ecosystem enhancement (eCommerce, gaming, original content), and an increased advertiser push towards Gen Z consumers as they age.All of these factors put together, with modest growth in revenue share and infrastructure costs combine to create a compelling gross margin profile. Competing social media platforms operate at or above my 10-year estimate for Snap's gross margins. This model also assumes double-digit percentage growth in OpEx for the most part, with CapEx doubling over the next decade.All of this gets me to a 2028 FCF estimate of ~$1.8 billion.Now, let's plug all of this into the model itself.As you can see, relative to the current market price of the stock, my fair value estimate is roughly 8% below the current market price. Because of the stock's overvaluation, I rate the company as a hold with a $10 target.Snap shareholders have seen a drastic increase in share price over the last few months, as investors are beginning to buy into the turnaround story. However, I urge caution to investors considering buying. I would wait for an entry point in the $6-$8 area before buying the stock, considering its significant risk. Until then, Snap is a hold with a $10 target."
4256295,104722,2019-04-24T13:40:44-04:00,"Snap earnings beat on the top and the bottom line, and validated my past bullish call.The company has come a long way since its IPO and potentially has a bright horizon.That being said, I don't see much upside looking out towards the end of the year.If operating expenses continue to decline I may change my mind, but I'm revising my price target a bit down and giving this a hold.","Last month I covered Snap, Inc (SNAP) and gave the company a buy rating, citing my belief the company had turned itself around and had finally reached a point of fair valuation. The response from readers was largely positive, but I had plenty of critics who feared the recent rally in share prices would be undone with the company's next financial disclosure. Since then, Snap has announced Q1 2019 results beating on top & bottom line earnings, as well as user growth. Additionally, sentiment in the market has continued to swing to the positive with macro fears of global recession and interest rate hikes being calmed by recent economic reads and Fed statements. The result has been a validation of my investment thesis, however I do not see any evidence at this time, that the stock should be trading higher than it already is.Source: Equity ZenBefore Lyft (LYFT), Uber (UBER), Pinterest (PINS), and the many other tech deca-unicorns, there was Snap. A Los Angeles communications/tech company that was a true darling of the top Silicon Valley venture capital firms, with a growth curve that extended steeply into the private markets. It debuted unprofitable, with unsustainably high revenue multiples, and was a favorite among millennials and investors using the app Robinhood. Many of the justifications for buying Snap matched those heard today in regards to Lyft, Pinterest, and Zoom (ZM) including the sentiment that the high growth justifies the high multiples, that there was untapped potential for monetization, and that ""the kids use it, not Facebook (FB)"". All of this caused the stock to shoot up 60% to $29 before tumbling below IPO price, below the cost basis of many venture investors, and ultimately to a low around $5 dollars.Data by YChartsThere were many major factors in the decline of Snap, but the biggest was that the valuation was ahead of itself without proof of concept (path to profit). Additionally, there was a significant amount of negativity towards management and the share class structuring giving more than 90% of voting rights to the CEO and Co-Founder. Instagram also emerged with competing story-based content, and immediately took a significant amount of market share, making many question the company's moat. Additionally, that rapid revenue growth justification backing the ""growth investment"" thesis showed faster than expected weakness. Finally, the stock had lost adoration of venture investors, who were racing to exit following the lockup expiration, and quickly caught the attention of short sellers who found the stock to be a favorite, leading to negative sell pressure.Data by YChartsSince then, management has taken steps to turn the story around. One of the first indicators for me that the company could be making better strategic choices, was the onboarding ex-Amazon and HuffPost executives to join the C-Suite. Further evidence was the research showing Snap's popularity with massive Gen-Z demographic, which implied the potential for staying power. Finally, expectations had just gotten so low for the company, that seemingly anything short of a path to bankruptcy seemingly would be positive for the company, and fortunately, the company appears to be turning its story around.Source: SNAP Investor RelationsSnap's financials have come a long way from its 2017 IPO. The company consolidating losses and continuing to bring in impressive revenue growth. Several key metrics reported in its Q1 FY19 disclosure are as follows:There are two primary factors that drive the performance of Snap, and those factors are daily active users (DAUs) and average revenue per user (ARPU). Much like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) Snap reports DAUs on a geographic basis, with the majority of its users coming from international regions, but the most profitable region being the United States.Source: Contributor ResearchI am expecting daily active users to remain fairly flat going forward if not a slight decline as competitors, such as TikTok, continue to gain market share. This is not inherently bad as Snapchat has the potential for superior international monetization compared to its previously mentioned social media peers.Snap user engagement has shown a long trend of seasonality and I expect this to continue. The fastest growing region, in terms of profitibility, has surprisingly been Rest of World. I believe this has to do the expansion of the smartphone market and the relative culturally agnostic branding and experience that Snapchat offers. After all, pictures instant messages do not require a translation, which is a reason I believe it has been so popular abroad.From these estimates, I have built out a model of the company's income statement looking forward to Q4 2020.Source: Contributor ResearchSeveral key items of note are as follows:I especially want to highlight my positive EPS forecast for 2020. This may prove a bit too bullish, but my price targets are based on this year's expected performance, so this is not of too much concern. That being said, if operating expense does, in fact, continue to decline as a percent of sales over the next several quarters, then this stock could end up looking much cheaper than it does right now very quickly.My valuation is based on sales multiple comparable companies analysis, specifically, I am looking at the price/sales ratio of its peers in the social media/communications services space. My assumption for year-end 2019 revenue per share is $1.22 based on the forecasts that I have previously shown. The results of this analysis can be seen in the figure below:The range of P/S inputs is 6.44x to 10.59x with an average of 9.22x. I feel this level is fair for Snap as the company is still growing revenues at a rapid double-digit pace, and is near profitability. The implied price (assuming $1.22 revenue per share) ranges from $7.84 to $12.90, with $11.22 being the most likely outcome based on my expected inputs.Snap has done well turning itself around, but it is still an uphill climb and getting too far ahead of earnings would not be a wise play. Investors who have been in the stock since IPO will likely not be happy for some time and may be better off reallocating their money elsewhere. That being said, those who bought in earlier this year, or when I previously recommended it can either cash out or hold, as I do foresee sales continuing to grow into the next year. For these reasons, I am downgrading the stock from Buy to Hold and adjusting the price target FY19 down from $11.50 to $11.25."
4254964,102646,2019-04-17T12:01:16-04:00,"Snap's stock has gained by more than 110% this year.
        Investors have been optimistic about the stable user growth and company initiatives.
        Users will continue to decrease as its core users age.","The stock price of Snap (SNAP) has more than doubled this year. Investors have cheered the company’s revenue increase, improved margins, increased revenue per user, and its iOS app updates. In addition, they have cheered its continued boost of the Snap Originals and its recent entry to the gaming industry. It has received a number of upgrades from analysts at Citi (C), RBC Capital Markets, Summit Insights, Raymond James, and Cowen (COWN).I have been short for a long time. Before it became a public company, I argued that it’s IPO provided the best opportunity for short sellers. Since its IPO, the company has lost more than 50% of value. While the current rally has been painful for me as a short seller, it has not changed my thinking about the company. In this article, I will explain why I have increased my short position ahead of the upcoming earnings.User GrowthInvestors have cheered the company’s growth in average revenue per user (ARPU), which increased by 37% in the last quarter to $2.09. While this improvement was good, I believe that it does not tell the whole story. According to Snap’s 10k, the ARPU is calculated by dividing the quarterly revenue by the average daily Active Users (DAU). If the revenue increases and the number of users decline, the ARPU will definitely be high. This has been the case with Snap, which has seen its annual revenues grow from just $54 million in 2015 to more than $1.18 billion in 2018. Its daily active users have decreased from a peak of 191 million in Q1’18 to 186 million in Q4’19.Source: SnapThe company’s product has been losing members, which is not a good thing for a social media company. These members are jumping ship to Instagram, which has more than 500 million daily active users. In addition, new social media platforms that target the young demographics are coming up. An example of this is TikTok, which has more than 150 million DAUs in China alone. In a recent report, eMarketer expects the number of Snap users in the US to remain relatively unchanged.I believe that Snap will continue losing users in future. This is because it is now mostly used by people between 18 and 35 years. In the next ten years, the current generation will likely not be using the app. The young students who use it will be busy with work while the older generation will be busy with work and raising their families. The younger audience the company will target will probably be in other platforms. This cycle has been proven by Facebook, which was once viewed as the cool place in the internet by young people. Today, most of its users are between 25 and 44 years. Facebook’s strong financial position has made it pivot to other platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp.To increase engagement, Snap has pivoted to original content and gaming. While the originals is a step in the right direction, I believe that only a small portion of its users will watch the clips. Very few users will create accounts with the goal of watching these clips also. The same is true with gaming, which I believe will be a small niche product. Also, production of these shows will be expensive, coming at a time when the company is yet to turn a profit.Snap does not solve any problemAs an investor, I like buying companies that solve a problem. For example, I have invested in Shopify (SHOP) because I believe its e-commerce platform is better than that of its peers. I have invested in Alphabet (GOOG) because it is the best search engine provider that has more room to grow in the cloud industry. I have a small stake in Twitter (TWTR) because I believe that its platform is valuable for news distribution.According to the 10K, the company says that it contributes to human progress by empowering people to ‘express themselves’, ‘learn about the world’, and ‘have fun together’. The company surely does these things but I don’t believe that it solves any problem. By this, I mean that the world would do just fine if Snap stopped operating today. If this happened, the company’s users would simply move to Instagram, which is exactly similar. In fact, its most influential figures like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Taylor Swift are also the biggest influencers in Instagram. The problem with companies that don’t solve any problem is that they can easily be replaced.Snap’s ValuationWhen investing in companies, I always recommend companies that are a bit cheaper. However, I often break this rule when investing in some technology companies like Shopify and Twilio (TWLO). This is because their growth can compensate for their stretched valuations. In Snap’s case, we have a highly overvalued money-losing company, whose growth is slowing. At the current valuation of more than $15 billion, the company’s forward price-to-sales ratio for this year is about 7.8, which is higher than Facebook’s 6.1, Twitter’s 6.6, and Alphabet’s 4.4.With this valuation investors are assuming a few things. First, they assume that Snap will be immune to the privacy problems that have been a thorn in the flesh for Facebook. If regulations come, I believe they will also apply to Snap. Second, they assume that the new content will help retain users. I believe that these new additions will be used by only a tiny number of users. Third, some assume that the company could be taken private or acquired. I believe that no major company would want to buy the company at these valuations.ConclusionI have been short Snap for a long time. Even with the current bull run, I believe that the company’s model is still broken. For this reason, I have increased my short position ahead of the upcoming earnings, which will be released on April 23rd. To be clear, the short position forms only a small part of my entire portfolio. Also, as a long-term investor, I intend to hold this short position for the next 5-10 years."
4251819,104722,2019-03-29T14:30:00-04:00,"The recovery of Snap Inc. shares appears to be justified.If trends continue, the company could actually post a profit in the near future.I am giving this company a buy, though my price target is not much higher than current prices at the time of writing.","Snap, Inc. (SNAP), the parent company of the high profile messaging platform Snapchat, is a company with which I have a long relationship. My sentiment on the company has long been bearish, and as time has proven, the company's $17 IPO valuation was higher than justified; let alone its mid-20s opening trade price. Today, however, I am surprised to say that I actually believe SNAP shares are showing upside potential.Source: Equity ZenSnap, Inc. was founded by Evan Speigel and Bobby Murphy in 2011 in Santa Monica, California. The company is a key player in communications services and camera hardware and is comprised of a portfolio of brands including Snapchat, Spectacles, Bitmoji, and Zenly. Its primary product is Snapchat, the messaging service made famous by its vanishing picture communications and for being an early mover in the space of ""story-based"" content vs. say, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), or Instagram, which had then previously exclusively used timeline-based content. The company quickly grew to Unicorn status and, eventually, IPO'd in 2017 at a $23 billion valuation or $17 per share; however, the stock's opening trades were closer to $24 per share putting its valuation 41% higher at ~$32 billion.Share Price and Brief FinancialsData by YChartsSnap's public offering has gone down as something of a debacle and a cautionary tale to exuberance in investor cash wealthy private markets. Initially, shares jumped to $29 per share, due in no small part to the fact the stock was a darling with young, retail investors, with activity on the prominent free trading platform Robinhood increasing 50% the day of SNAP's IPO; however, this was not to last. Once the inflow of negative analyst sentiments began, the floor fell out, so-to-speak, and thing only worsened after the company's lockup expiration date. At its worst, share prices have dropped below $5 per share, but since then, shares have rallied and are above the $10 mark at the time of writing.From a reporting standpoint, the company has shown strong top-line growth, though has yet to turn a profit. Several key highlights from the company's latest filing are as follows:ProjectionsThe company divides its revenues into three distinct geographic segments; North America (including the US, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean), Europe, and Rest of World. Performance in these segments is evaluated on a monetization per user basis. In the case of Snap, daily active users (DAUs) and their associated average revenue per user (ARPU) are the driving metrics behind revenue growth. In projecting the company's future performance, this is the first area I examined and projected forward.Source: Contributor ResearchThe figures above represent my quarterly-user forecast for upcoming quarters through the fiscal year 2020. Globally, Q4 2019 and 2020 DAUs continue to be relatively flat at 186 and 187 users respectively. While this is not a positive estimate, the company is saved by its trend of increased ARPUs, as the company is showing a better ability to monetize its user base. From a global standpoint, I expect ARPUs of $2.82 and $3.53 in 2019 and 2020, which represents 35.34% and 25.00% y/y growth. Using the estimates, I have projected the company's consolidated statement of income (see below).Source: Contributor ResearchThe table above is my projected quarterly statement of income. Several key highlights from the document are as follows:Using these projections, I will now explain my valuation of SNAP looking forward to the disclosure of 2019 fiscal year's results.While I predict the company to generate a positive net income next fiscal year, it is currently posting both a quarterly and an annual net loss. For this reason, my valuation is based on comparables analysis using revenue multiples. I have chosen a pool of companies with similar business models reporting per-user monetization and deriving their funds from ad revenues. The results can be seen below.Source: Contributor ResearchIt is immediately evident that there is a clear trend in the price multiples of the companies examined. The values sit in a range from a low of 5.96x (GOOG) (GOOGL) to a high of 8.89x (MTCH), with an average of 7.84x which equates to a per share value of $11.61.Slowing User GrowthMuch like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest (PINS), North American users are the most profitable and the slowest growing segment. Unlike the aforementioned companies, however, growth looks to be slow in all reporting segments on a per-user basis. The saving grace here is that the spread between US ARPUs and those international markets is nowhere near as significant, and I predict international users could actually even end up becoming more profitable the further out we look. While this is good news, if monetization rates significantly change in these international markets, investors could experience significant risk to the downside.Share structureOne of the reasons Snap has garnered a level of infamy is its share class voting structure that leaves 95% of voting rights to founders Spiegel and Murphy, which are also transferable in the event of death, resignation, or retirement. This means investors have little to no control of the decisions made by the company. The move has even proved so controversial that it led the company to be excluded from the S&P 500. Investors should consider this lack of control and exclusion from indices.Data Regulation ConcernsThis is something to address when discussing any company that derives revenue from the monetization of user data. Snap, though otherwise controversial, has been spared from much of the heat its peers Twitter, Facebook, and Google have endured from the public and on in Congress. That being said, Snap will be very much exposed to the negative ramifications should the US and other major governments continue to crack down on business activities related to user data. For that reason, there is a significant legislative risk to consider this stock.Snapchat is not my top choice for social media investments, but it is one of them. Investing in the company as it prepares to post a positive net income in the coming years may prove very rewarding. I will certainly be watching the guidance from the company very closely in the coming months. At this time, I am rating Snap a buy with a price target of $11.50 per share."
4243865,102870,2019-02-25T10:49:41-05:00,"Snap has had a tumultuous time as a public company, crashing by about 85% from its post-IPO high.Yet, the company reported a very strong quarter earlier this month.The company's stronger-than-expected results suggest Snap is likely to continue to expand revenues, improve profitability, and could return to DAU growth in future quarters.In fact, like other social networking companies, Snap could become a very profitable enterprise as its business matures in future years.While shares are very overbought on a technical basis right now, the stock is likely to trend higher longer-term.","Source: Variety.comSnap (SNAP) has had a tumultuous time since it became a public company. The stock had collapsed by as much as 85% from its post-IPO high of around $30 to below $5 last December.Snap 2-YearsSource: Stockcharts.comHowever, Snap reported a much better than expected quarter earlier this month, and the company's user growth stabilized.So, is this it for Snap, has the company finally turned the corner? Perhaps more importantly, have we seen the bottom in Snap, and what is this stock likely going to do going forward?The issues that caused Snap's temporary decline in DAUs have been largely addressed. Furthermore, due to Snap's enormous popularity amongst young people, the company is likely to return to DAU growth in future quarters and years. Additionally, Snap should continue to become more profitable as the company continues to monetize its platform and its business matures.Ultimately, its profitability margins could rise to levels comparable with other social networking businesses. Given the company's substantial revenue growth and profitably prospects, shares could be headed notably higher over the next several years.Snap reported a very strong quarter in Q4. However, this is not its first outperformance EPS or revenue wise. In fact, this is the third consecutive quarter where the company has beat analysts' estimates, and while the financial results in the prior two quarters were overshadowed by the company's declining user growth, this quarter's weren't.In Q4 Snap reported:Earnings TakeawayThe most troubling element throughout recent quarters has been Snap's declining DAU growth. DAUs topped out in Q1 2018 at 191 and had been declining until this quarter. Now DAU growth has stabilized and could return to growth in future quarters.Snap DAUs by QuarterSource: Statista.comUser growth likely went through a transitory period of decline due to the company's questionable redesign of its app. However, Snap addressed the issues and user growth appears to be stabilizing. Furthermore, user growth could return in future quarters, which should reflect very favorably on the company's stock.The company has also beat EPS estimates for three straight quarters now, and revenues as well as ARPU continue to beat analysts' estimates. Furthermore, costs are being cut aggressively and the company's profitability is improving dramatically.Due to the higher-than-expected earnings and revenues, Snap could become profitable sooner than many analysts expect. Furthermore, Snap could become more profitable than is currently expected. Additionally, its profitability effect could be amplified if the company returns to robust user growth in future quarters and years.Snap is a relatively new company, is still in significant growth mode, and is not yet profitable. Therefore, we will be evaluating Snap's valuation based on sales and probable future earnings.Snap is expected to deliver between $1.38 and $1.68 billion this year and $1.63 and $2.32 billion next year. Given that the company typically beats its EPS and revenue estimates, let's assume Snap can deliver towards the higher end of this range, roughly $1.6 billion this year and $2.1 billion next year.Snap's current market cap is about $12.35 billion, so the company is essentially trading at 7.7 times this year's expected revenues and about 5.9 times next year's expected revenues. At the same time, Snap is expected to grow revenues by roughly 30% this year and next, but given that it has shown a distinct ability to surpass analysts' revenue estimates, let's presume the company can deliver sales growth of around 35% this year and roughly 31% next year, consistent with our revenue forecasts.It is difficult to find a comparative company to Snap, as both competitors in social media, Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), are far more mature. Nevertheless, Facebook currently has a forward revenue growth rate of about 20-23% and is trading at 5.5 times 2020's projected revenues, very close to Snap's valuation.Twitter has a projected sales growth rate of just 14% for the next two years, and trades at about 5.8 times 2020's sales estimates, also essentially in the same ball park as Snap and Facebook. So, going by sales, we see that despite having substantially higher revenue growth momentum, Snap is trading at around the same valuation compared to its counterparts in the social media segment.As far as profitability goes, we see that Snap is doing quite well in reducing operating costs, and its gross margin is improving substantially. The company's gross margin went from negative in 2016, to 13% in 2017, to almost 33% in 2018. Therefore, Snap could become profitable within the next few years; the question is how profitable.Let's presume Snap delivers our estimated $2.1 billion in revenues in 2020, and then the company's growth rate declines gradually to 25% in 2021, 22% in 2022, 20% in 2023, down to 18% in 2024 and down to 15% in 2025.Snap's revenues would be up to $2.62 billion in 2021, $3.2 billion in 2022, $3.84 billion in 2023, $4.53 billion in 2024, and $5.21 billion in 2025.At this level of maturity social media companies typically become quite profitable. For instance, Twitter reported a net income margin of nearly 40% last year. Likewise, Facebook also reported a net income margin of roughly 40% last year.Therefore, it is conceivable that Snap could earn about $2.08 billion in net income in 2025 (if the company grows revenues at my projected pace and produces a 40% income margin). Likewise, in 2023, Snap could earn $1.54 billion in net income if the company can produce a comparable 40% income margin.Both Facebook and Twitter trade at around 20 times earnings. Snap's current share price is about $9.37 at the time of writing this article, which is understandable, as the company has no earnings to speak of yet.Nevertheless, if the company can meet my 2023 and 2025 revenue and profitability estimates, its market cap would need to be at around $30.8 billion in 2023 and at $41.6 billion in 2025 to properly reflect a 20 times earnings valuation.Right now, the company has a market cap of about $12.37 billion, thus at $30.8 billion the stock price would be at around $23.33, and at $41.6 billion, the stock price would need to be at around $31.58.Snap is a high growth company with significant earnings potential, and the market is not likely to wait until 2023 or 2025 to price the shares properly. Therefore, if user growth returns to Snap, the stock could appreciate quickly, and will likely reflect a forward 20x earnings valuation a couple of years in advance.Hence, I would look for Snap to appreciate to around $23 sometime in 2020, or in 2021, and I would look for Snap to appreciate to around $32 sometime in 2022.A few things are necessary for the share price to reach my targets. Snap needs to return to user growth (even if it is relatively modest), the company needs to continue to generate revenue growth, and Snap needs to continue to become more profitable.One crucial factor that makes Snap stand out from other social media companies is its incredible popularity amongst young people. Roughly 95% of teens in the U.S. now have smartphones, and about 45% of them say that they are online ""almost constantly"".About 69% of teens in the U.S. reportedly use Snap, and roughly 35% of teens say that they use Snap most often out of any social media platform.Source: Pewinternet.orgIn comparison, only 10%, and 15% of teens say that they use Facebook and Instagram most often. These statistics indicate that teens in the U.S. use Snap more often than any other social networking platform. This also implies that teens spend the most time on Snap, which equate to more advertising dollars. This phenomenon helps explain why Snap's ARPU continuously surpasses analysts' estimates.Most Popular Social Networks Amongst Teenagers in U.S.Despite some issues and the slight dip, Snap has not given up much ground over the past year. In fact, the company could continue to gain market share as more positive developments materialize down the line.Also, Snap reported 79 million DAUs in the U.S. last quarter, while reporting 60 million in Europe. European DAUs actually grew last quarter from about 59 million to 60 million, illustrating that growth is already returning in the European continent.Snap DAUs by RegionSnap is also introducing an Android upgrade, which should ultimately lead to higher user growth as the improved app promises to significantly improve the user experience for Android users.The majority of Snap's users are likely teens from the U.S. and Europe. These are the two most profitable markets for social networking companies as they deliver the highest ad revenues.Teens are especially lucrative to target with ads, as teens are very impressionable, and could be guided into becoming early adopters and lifelong users of a brand. Therefore, companies looking to increase ad spending will likely target young users via Snap's platform.Teens and young people in general can be viewed as the early adopters of Snap's platform, and are likely to transition into lifelong users of Snap going forward. Additionally, large percentage of teens and young people coming online and going to Snap's service will likely also become long-term users of the platform.We see growth in Europe already starting to return, and U.S. growth should follow last quarter's stabilization period. The redesign jitters caused growth to falter temporarily, but ultimately growth should return, and Snap has a lot of untapped market share potential in the U.S., Europe, and across the globe longer-term.At 186 million DAUs, Snap is currently at around 6% penetration rate of the estimated 3.2 billion internet users around the globe. Therefore, as Snap's young users become long-term adopters of the platform and new users come online and join Snap, overall global market share should increase over time.Certainly, Snap is somewhat of a high-risk investment, as this is still a relatively new company, is yet to become profitable, and has shown some signs of hardship in the past.There are risks from competitors, most notably Instagram, as the service has already infringed on Snap's market share, offering many similar services and features on its platform. Users could potentially continue to switch over to Instagram over time, especially if Snap continues to make strategic mistakes, like its faulty redesign last year.Another risk factor is the company's inability to meet users' demands. The company already faltered once with a terrible redesign that caused many users to jump ship. Another fiasco such as this could seriously damage its growth prospects long-term.Profitability is another risk, as the company is known for burning cash. Despite Snap's better-than-expected profitability results in recent quarters, concerns linger as to whether Snap can ever reach profitability measures on par with Facebook, or even Twitter for that matter.Snap's most notable risk is its inability to return to user growth. If the company cannot get back on track to attracting new users, and perhaps more importantly, retaining existing ones, Snap may enter a period of terminal decline.Snap shares have snapped back by about 100% in two months since the company hit an all-time low below $5 last December. But with the RSI now close to 80, and the full-stochastic at 98, the technical image is screaming that the company is very overbought right now.Snap 1-YearTherefore, I would be hesitant to rush out and buy shares right now. However, on a pullback, the stock becomes much more attractive not only from a technical standpoint but also from a fundamental one as well.We see that Snap has the potential to grow into a very profitable enterprise, and if the company can return to sustainable user growth, the stock is likely to appreciate substantially over the next several years.Therefore, I want to buy Snap on a pullback to the $7-8 range, right where the giant post-earnings gap-up occurred. It is likely that the stock will come back to retest this level and may even fill this gap completely, all the way back down to the $7 level.I think this would be a great level to pick up some Snap shares, or to add to existing positions. While Snap remains a relatively high-risk equity investment, it comes with substantial possibility for significant reward as well. Given the right set of circumstances, Snap could be trading in the $23-32 range within the next several years."
4246804,102646,2019-03-06T17:38:14-05:00,Snap stock has gained more than 70% this year.Investors have cheered the strong Q4 results.Other investors have compared its turnaround to that of Twitter.,"Snap (SNAP) is one of the best-performing technology stocks this year. The stock has gained by 77%, which is higher than Facebook's (FB) 23% and Twitter's (TWTR) 7%. The upward trend improved after the release of Q4 results on February 6. In the results, revenue rose by 36% while net loss improved by $158 million to -$192 million. The Daily Active Users declined by 1 million from 187 million to 186 million. These results led to revision by analysts with Credit Suisse (CS), RBC, and Raymond James upgrading their targets. In Seeking Alpha, a number of analysts such as Victor Dergunov, Mango Tree, and The Value Investor hailed the results as the return of a turnaround. The company has also been compared to Twitter (TWTR), whose stock has gained by 71% in the past three years following a prolonged period of weak performance. This article calls for caution on Snap, especially among long-term investors.Snap has managed to build a company generating revenues of more than $1 billion in less than ten years. This revenue has grown from just $58 million in 2015 to more than $1 billion in 2018. This growth has because Snapchat is one of the most popular apps in the United States. Recent data shows that it is used by more than 70 million people in the US every day. Most of these users are people between 12 years and 24 years. More than 77% of college students use the app, which makes it an attractive medium for companies targeting at the younger demographic.Source: iTunesSnap's problems are well known. After its IPO, Facebook's Instagram launched Instagram stories, a feature that is fully like Snap. Today, the number of Instagram stories has grown to more than 500 million. Soon afterwards, it launched Whatsapp Stories, a feature that has more than 450 million daily active users as shown below.Source: StatistaOther than competition, Snap also went through other challenges. Its plans to diversify its revenue by selling spectacles failed. Its attempts to update its applications met a roadblock when many users, including Kylie Jenner trashed the decision. Further, its DAUs have been slowing, and there are fears that they will continue to decline as the young people using the app outgrow it.With the company's stock gaining, a number of analysts have compared it to that of Twitter. As a reminder, after its IPO, Twitter's stock declined sharply as investors grew increasingly concerned about the slowing revenue growth and active users. In May 2016, the stock reached an all-time low of $14. Before that, I had published an article where I declared that I was ""eternally optimistic"" about the company. In the article, I argued that investors were downplaying the importance of Twitter in the global stage. The company's core product had - still is - the leading source of local and international news. In other words, it is playing the same role that newspapers played in the past. I also argued that other factors such as its international growth provided a good opportunity for growth. It also had low-hanging fruits to monetize its services such as data selling and monetizing corporate chats. While Twitter has not achieved everything I envisioned in the article, it's stock has managed to gain by more than 80%.Now, the question is whether Snap will follow in Twitter's footsteps and be a viable holding for long-term investors. I believe that the answer to this question is no.First, unlike Twitter, Snap does not solve a major problem. Most of Twitter's users use its website and platforms to stay up-to-date with local and international events. It is the first place they turn to early in the morning to know what is happening around the world. It has solved a ""news problem"" that Facebook has not been able to solve especially after the algorithm change in 2018. It has become one of the biggest media companies in the world. It is constantly used by people who love it and even those who believe it is biased against them.Snap on the other hand is an entertainment app, which most of the users use for ""creativity"" purposes. Most of its users believe that it's a fad, without any staying power. The problem with entertainment apps is that they can easily be replaced by other better and fresh products. A good example of this is the new app called Tik Tok, which has garnered more than 500 million daily active users. The value of Snap will continue to decline as people prefer using Instagram and Whatsapp. According to Forrester's Jessicah Liu:Second, the fact that Snap does not solve a major problem brings another challenge to investors who believe that it will be acquired. At the current valuation of more than $12 billion, it is impossible to imagine a company that would consider acquiring Snap. The only potential acquirer would be Facebook, which had attempted to buy it for $3 billion in 2016. Since then, Facebook's own Instagram Stories and Whatsapp Status have become bigger than Snap. While it is unlikely for Twitter to be acquired at the current valuation of $23 billion, I still believe that it could be acquired at a good price or if it puts itself for sale.Third, Snap's attempt to diversify its earnings seem to have hit a wall. In 2016, Snap launched spectacles as it tried to diversify its revenues. While the initial response for the product was good, sales declined sharply after that. In the just-released 10K, the company said that sales of the spectacles were not material. Twitter on the other hand, has continued to grow its other revenues, with data licensing revenues growing from $280 million in 2016 to more than $420 million in 2018.Fourth, as Snap's user growth slows, the company will continue to see a slowdown in revenue growth. As a public company, its quarterly revenue growth has slowed from more than 285% to the current 36%. While this slowdown is common in all new technology companies, Snap seems to be more vulnerable because it does not solve a major problem. In fact, questions have been raised about the value of Snap ads to advertisers. Twitter had its own phase of slowed revenue growth, which bottomed in March 2017. Since then, the company has seen some substantial growth.Source: YChartsIn 2017, before Snap went public, I argued that the company was overvalued and provided a good opportunity for short sellers. Even with the revenue increase, the short case for Snap remains relevant, but only for long-term investors. This year alone, its stock has gained by more than 70% but I don't think this growth will continue. This is mostly because of the competition it faces from Facebook, its staying power, its weak international growth, and the overall stagnation in its user growth. However, in the short and medium-term, being short Snap is not advisable at this point because of the volatility associated with shorting technology companies."
4240762,104703,2019-02-13T17:23:43-05:00,"Snap's Q4 release sparked a one-day run-up of ~27%. My call on an upward surge in Snap shares was accurate.A top and bottom-line beat reported, with non-GAAP EPS nearing a break-even.Gross margins are the number to watch, with gross margins hitting 48% in Q4. While this is meaningfully lower than say Twitter or Facebook, the upward trend is forming.In the next 6-12 months, the focus should turn from Snap's ability to grow its ecosystem to its ability to better monetize its ecosystem. This could be similar to Twitter in 1H'2017.Reiterating HOLD rating. Price target raised from $7 to $9 off lower loss expectations. Expecting FY profitability and free cash flow in 2022.","As of writing, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) shares are rising a staggering 26%. Here are the results:Across the board, particularly with profitability, Snap beat both my expectations and consensus expectations. In my last couple of articles on Snap, I believed the stock would have substantial upside short term, with the stock moving to $8-9 short term. Sure enough, the stock closed at $8.59 (sorry, I had to take a victory lap). In the short term, there is not much of a limit to Snap's price action. In my view, between here and the next quarterly report, we could get a jump to $10.That being said, I am reiterating my ""hold/neutral"" rating on the stock for the next twelve months, but I am raising my target from $7 to $9.Now, let's talk about Snap's guidance:With regards to their revenue guidance, the midpoint of their guidance ($297.5 million) came in shy of the consensus expectation for $307 million. With regards to their EBITDA loss guide, the company posted better than expected results. The midpoint of this guidance implies an $0.11/share loss, whereas the Q1 expectation was for a $0.13/share loss.Snap did not provide an FY'2019 guide.Earnings Slides:In Snap's earnings slides, they noted that their iOS DAUs increased on a Y/Y basis, meaning the negative offset that led to the overall flatness came from Android. If you believe that Snap's Android redesign is coming, and that it will be effective, than a growing Android, coupled with a growing iOS, will further help Snap's overall financial results as well as their user growth results. On top of this, Snap notes that their time spent on the platform is growing, with a reported acceleration in Q4 of 2018 versus Q4 of 2017.This line shows the scale and reach Snapchat has within the younger Generation Z and the millennial community, despite Instagram's continued expansion. Snap's relevance amongst the youth should bode well once these consumers further their purchasing power over the next several years.Snap is beginning to roll out their updated Android app, and the results are already showing performance improvements, even with simple tasks like opening the app itself. If iOS has a strong trajectory, then once Android is fixed, and is fixed for good, DAUs should move much higher. Snap's updates on Android progress will be essential in terms of their overall DAU number.The Conference Call:My notes for the conference call include notes from management's opening statement as well as the Q&A session with analysts.This is an important comment, as Snap continues to move quickly through its cash pile.(Source: Snap IR)While Snap has been able to better control its cash burn over the past few quarters, the company is still operating at a $100 mln+ quarterly cash burn. Unless the company turns cash generative soon, one would believe that the company would need to raise capital again. Whether it be from an equity dilution or a direct sale of stock to a large company like Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), or even some kind of sovereign wealth fund.The company's profits and cash flow or lack thereof has led many to question Snap's long-term solvency without a substantial capital raise. The chief accounting officer seems to be putting capital raise concerns to rest, at least for the short term.Snap says their stretch goal of Q4 profitability came close and helped them get to their strong results. They mention that their ability to get to profitability and cash generation comes from revenue growth, with cost cutting in the background. Cost cutting, mostly from lowering operating expenses, has yielded better-than-expected earnings results many quarters in a row. Lowering their headcount, R&D, and marketing expenses has driven Snap's losses lower and lower.(Source: Snap IR)Longer term, we should expect Snap exhibit traits of cost growth as their community expands. Cloud hosting costs, as well as a higher headcount and marketing costs, will create a long-term trajectory of cost growth.A recent note from RBC suggests that Snap may be reminiscent of the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) turnaround.He also cites a stronger stories environment overall, with the stronger tide lifting all boats.The short answer is no, not yet.Despite my short-term optimism on the stock, the company has a substantial risk profile that could lead to a continued revenue growth slowdown and push-out of profitability. If we see anything change with Snap, we should see a change in the narrative, the story per se, around Snap's stock similar to the change in attitude investors exhibited towards Twitter when their turnaround first began. This change is the change from a company focused on growing its user count, to a company that is focused on monetizing its user base.As a matter of fact, Twitter has reported a trend of declining users, but stronger monetization and its data licensing business have driven revenue growth and profitability. Meanwhile, Snap reported a strengthening iOS user base and a flat overall base. Now, the company is prioritizing monetization pathways.A combination of rejuvenated user growth from the new Android rollout and the continued monetization of the platform itself will pave the way for continued growth over the next several years.In order to understand why a turnaround could be in store, we need to understand where the business's growth will come from. Most notably, Snap has two things going for it: Exposure to stories and heavy exposure to the 13-34 demographic.With regards to stories, any exposure at all is good. While advertisers prefer Instagram Stories over Snapchat Stories wholeheartedly, having some exposure to the newest social media and internet advertising trends will be beneficial longer term. Snap's ability to capitalize on advertiser's eagerness to purchase stories ads could further benefit their revenue growth.The Snapchat platform's Discover sponsored content section has been ridiculed by investors, and mostly neglected by users. Snapchat users have historically used the platform for chatting, rather than viewing sponsored content. This sponsored content is where Snap fills in their ad slots. A lack of usage on this ""Discover"" side of the platform leads to less willingness from advertisers to advertise.That being said, outside of the chat feature within the Snapchat app, users interact with each other primarily through stories. An increase in Stories ad output will offset any potential weakness from Discover. Stories may be Snap's solution to one of its most challenging problems: monetizing Discover.Secondly, Snap may have one asset that will be crucial to retaining and increasing their advertiser base. This factor is Snap's heavy exposure to the 13-34 demographic. While Instagram has no doubt taken massive share in this demographic from Snap, Snap's core user base remains this younger audience. Snap is almost totally exposed, particularly to Generation Z users, an asset that proves scarce in the social media world. Snap's ability to lock in younger users could be an invaluable asset for advertisers.Basically, Snap's exposure to stories and younger users can help accelerate monetization improvements on the platform.Snap's risk profile, at a high level, boils down to these three factors. With Snap's recent strength, I believe its risk profile has shrunk to these three key factors.Corporate Governance: Snap's first issue is its corporate governance and management. My first problem with Snap's corporate governance is its voting share structure. This is a topic that, in my personal view, should concern the bulls on Snap deeply. Basically, CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Bobby Murphy hold 96% of all voting shares, with owners of SNAP shares listed on the NYSE having zero voting rights. Class B shares hold 4% of the voting rights, while Class C shares (96% of the voting rights) are exclusive to founders.This structure completely limits ""shareholders"" from making key decisions like determining Snap's board. Basically, if you own Snap's stock, you have to have absolute faith in management. If you don't, then you cannot help install a board that ousts the current management and implements a new one. You sit on the sidelines without any real say in the company's direction. It all hinges on your trust in management's ability to run the company smoothly.Speaking of which, management lately has been a revolving door. This comes most notably from the departure of Snap's relatively new CFO Tim Stone. While I have some theories on his departure, I acknowledge that his departure follows that of over a dozen other executives. The trend of executive departures at Snap is unmistakable and could deal a blow on Snap's overall reputation. Continued executive turnover remains a risk to Snap's stock, but not as much to the business.Competition: Competition is Snap's most relevant threat to their business. They recently disclosed to investors that they are listing TikTok as a competitor. For those that don't know, TikTok is a platform owned by Chinese social media company ByteDance that is extremely popular amongst the 13-34 demographic that Snapchat had previously established as its own. ByteDance also owns Toutiao, a digital Chinese news and information platform that people like Andrew Left have compared to Twitter. There are 500 million people using TikTok on a monthly basis. While we are all aware of Instagram's continued impact on Snapchat's user base, I would like to take some time to investigate TikTok a little more closely.I have a very good in-depth source of this information here that delves into this information. I want to give them the credit for compiling these facts, not myself.In 2017 (the most recent data I could find), TikTok generated meager user spend of $3.5 million. My points are not made to demonstrate TikTok's economic success but the potential harm they could cause to Snap as users migrate towards the TikTok platform. The parent company, ByteDance, is the highest valued privately held startup at $75 billion. The company, in October of last year, raised some $3 billion led primarily by SoftBank.The bottom line is, TikTok is already extremely big and has exposure to their parent company ByteDance's vast economic resources.This is something that Snap, as a standalone, doesn't have. With more money, TikTok can design better features, further drawing users towards TikTok, away from Snapchat.Here is TikTok's relevancy in the App Store:(Source: BusinessofApps)Here is another chart showing TikTok's download growth versus other social platforms, including Snapchat.(Source: BusinessofApps)When TikTok is being downloaded more than platforms like YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), platforms that are already proven successful, you know they are extremely popular.In terms of TikTok's popularity in the all-important Android category, the company utterly demolishes the competing apps.(Source: BusinessofApps)In terms of engagement, however, TikTok pales in comparison with Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.(Source: BusinessofApps)This engagement figure is a measure of the total number of MAUs that log into the app on a daily basis. While the other major social media apps are in the mid-90% area, TikTok is struggling at roughly 28%. If you take 28% of the 500 million reported MAUs, you get a total DAU base of ~142.8 million users, over 40 million less users than Snapchat has.Despite all the traction TikTok has gotten in the last handful of quarters, its current DAU number holds 40 million less users than a plateauing Snapchat. That all being said, TikTok's surge into relevancy amongst the 13-34 demographic should be carefully watched amongst Snap investors.Cash: I believe Snap's final major risk is their cash pile. After their IPO, the company was flush with cash, recording as much as $2.04 billion at the end of 2017. Since then, the company has burned through an additional $760 million of its cash pile.While the company continues to burn through $100 million plus per quarter, they are taking measures to improve their current cash bleed standing.(Source: Snap IR)A combination of continued revenue growth and controlling/lowering costs has allowed the company to push closer and closer towards cash generative and profitable results. Such cost-cutting moves include lowering their headcount, scaling back R&D efforts, and lowering marketing for their Spectacles hardware products. The company remains dedicated to lowering costs, something that will more than likely benefit their cash situation over the long term.The real question pertains to whether or not Snap needs a capital raise to keep on going. I am of the belief that, in this environment, where interest rates are rising and credit markets are tightening, companies that need capital should not wait for another time to raise capital. In the case of Snap, the company has a few roads it could head down.These roads include a direct equity dilution, a convertible bond offering, junk bonds, or reaching out to mega investors like sovereign wealth funds and tech titans.With regards to equity dilution, there has been enough scrutiny already on Snap's dilution and stock-based compensation. So, the odds of a direct equity dilution are slim to none. A convertible bond offers Snap more flexibility to manage dilution while getting the funding they need at a more favorable interest rate than a junk bond. In my view, a substantial convertible bond may be the best route for Snap to take. The company only has $16.8 million in total debt, none of which is in publicly-traded bonds. Even with Snap's egregious cash burn, the company's debt levels are extremely low relative to their cash pile. A convertible bond offering also allows Snap to retrieve flexibility that it might not have otherwise with regular dilution or a junk bond.Finally, we have the option of a large investor giving the company a cash infusion. While I won't speculate too much as to who and on what terms, there has been interest expressed from other external firms in the past. In November, Tencent purchased a 12% stake in the company. In addition, Snap has received buyout offers from Facebook in the past, and it was rumored that Google offered as much as $30 billion for the company. Evan Spiegel also met with the Saudis at one point in time. Though with recent political turmoil, an investment from the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia may be unlikely.Overall, there are multiple ways Snap can raise capital to offset concerns surrounding its shrinking cash pile. The company is implementing internal controls on costs to help improve its cash burn, but if it doesn't, I believe the company has the ability to raise capital.For my valuation, I use a DCF model going from 2019 to 2028. I use a WACC of 13%, the same discount rate used by Credit Suisse's research team, with a terminal growth rate of 3%.Here are my expectations for the business:Moving on to the discount rates and final valuation:This assumes Snap gets to a revenue profile of $6 billion in a decade's time. With a platform the size of Snapchat's, having 186 million users, $6 billion is not an unreasonable expectation. This assumes a continued deceleration in revenue growth as the years go on. To put this $6 billion into context, this is about the size of Spotify's (NYSE:SPOT) revenue profile today. While the two companies operate in different spaces entirely, they are both technology companies growing at high growth rates. And if you put this $6 billion revenue figure against the size of the internet advertising market as a whole, you see that Snap has plenty of room to grow.Snap's delivered a solid Q4 report and has a strong growth trajectory ahead. I believe the stock is fairly valued at roughly $9. The company's risk profile is being minimized right now down to three main pillars. The company's strong revenue growth and higher gross margins deliver better than expected results. This may be the beginning of a Twitter-esque turnaround. Stabilization of user growth and strong monetization will drive revenue growth and eventually cash flow and profits."
4249518,24849,2019-03-18T14:04:14-04:00,Shares have more than doubled from their low.Cash burn will continue for near term.Company needs to prove it can grow users.,"When we look back at the first quarter of 2019, there may not have been a bigger winner than camera company and social media firm Snap (SNAP). As you can see in the chart below, shares bottomed out in late December under $5.00, but have more than doubled since. With sentiment in the name having clearly turned recently, perhaps it is time for the company to use this rally to strengthen its balance sheet a bit.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)One of my biggest worries ever since Snap went public was the company's financial situation. Huge GAAP losses were leading to significant cash burn from operations, and then there was still additional money used for capital expenditures as well as acquisitions. While things have improved a bit since, the company still burned nearly $150 million in its latest quarter, which is the highest revenue quarter of the year. The graphic below shows the last six quarters of cash burn, excluding any additional cash paid for acquisitions.(Source: Snap Q4 slides, seen here)The company finished 2018 with about $1.28 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet after two years where free cash flow was a negative $810 million plus each year. Even if the number comes down in half this year, that still would put the company under $900 million in cash, and that assumes tremendous improvement along with no additional cash used for acquisitions. What is the minimum level of cash on the balance sheet that management would be comfortable with?At the moment, another major problem for Snap is that it hasn't been able to grow its user base recently. From Q4 2017 to Q4 2018, average daily active users actually declined from 187 million to 186 million, and the comparison number for Q1 2018 is 191 million. So without a meaningful increase during the current period, the year-over-year decline could be in the mid-single digits, millions wise. The company can talk all it wants about rising average revenues per user, but it needs to increase its user base. When a competitor like Facebook (FB) can grow 9% while having 1.52 billion daily active users in December, Snap should be able to grow while having less than 200 million.While looking at Snap against Facebook as well as Twitter (TWTR), I should also point out that the camera name trades at a significant premium to its social media counterparts. The chart below shows a price to sales comparison based on expected 2020 revenues, because you can't do a P/E chart when Snap is losing tons of money. Facebook is massively profitable at the moment and features a sizable buyback plan, while Twitter has also become GAAP profitable. Facebook and Twitter have impressive cash flow, the opposite of what we are seeing with Snap.(Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimates, for instance Snap seen here)Obviously, the best time for a company to raise capital is when its shares are doing well. If Snap decides an equity offering is in the cards, selling at $11 plus would be much better than had it happened sub $5.00 a share. However, investors also have to realize that dilution is already significant for this company. Over the past five quarters, the number of common shares outstanding has gone from 1.202 billion to 1.318 billion, and there're another 189 million shares of stock-based awards outstanding currently.If a capital raise is needed, not doing it via equity would mean the issuance of some form of debt. Convertible debt would contain a much lower coupon interest rate, but that would mean the potential of more dilution moving forward if the bonds are eventually converted. On the flip side, an offering of say $500 million in 5-year regular notes could have an interest rate of say 6% or more, meaning $30 million a year in interest expenses. Holding all else equal, that would hurt the company's chances of getting to GAAP profitability and positive free cash flow in the near term, much more than a convertible offering would be at this point.In the end, it may be time for Snap to raise capital, especially since the major rally will make it much less painful for shareholders than it would have been a few months back. With the company still running large losses and burning through cash, it seems like another capital infusion is just a matter of time. At this point, the major question would be what type of raise, with convertible debt likely seeming to be the best option at this point. Do you think Snap needs to raise capital now, and if so, what should a raise look like? I look forward to your comments below."
4237093,101557,2019-01-31T11:42:36-05:00,"Total DAU and APRU show a less than optimistic growth trajectory, as DAU growth falters.SNAP is not trading significantly above or below its ""comps.""Lack of ""premium"" features vs. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter significantly impacts the user experience.","When Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) IPOed, I wrote several articles regarding the company's lofty valuation. If you would like to check out my original thesis, you can find the original article here, as well as SNAP's comparison to Whatsapp and Instagram here. The basic crux of my argument was that, at the time, SNAP was trading significantly higher compared to its incredibly more mature comps.In addition, the platform itself could not grow its daily active users or its average revenue per user significantly enough to justify its lofty valuation. It took some time for the thesis to fully play itself out. It's important to note that the downward pressure on SNAP is not entirely a result of weak performance metrics, but it's also a victim of the recent bear run. Regardless, let's take a look SNAP again and see where the company is at and where it might go.Currently, SNAP has tumbled down rather far compared to its peak immediately after its IPO. After some less than impressive earnings results, the market's confidence that SNAP would follow Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or even Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) began to falter. The results can see below:Source: Yahoo FinanceSo, let's dive into SNAP and see how different its actual performance metrics were from my original projections, and what its story looks like moving forward.As a company, SNAP differs from its competitors in several key ways that are important to understand when using comparables for valuation. Under my original thesis, we looked at the DAU and ARPU metrics of Facebook and Twitter as indicators of where SNAP's numbers could go. But this should be taken with a grain of salt as these platforms are rather different than Snapchat's.Due to the nature of the app, it seems as if SNAP's platform varies significantly from the likes of Facebook, Instagram or Twitter (we will refer to these as ""FIT"" for the rest of this article so that it doesn't get too repetitive) and favors a similar model to Whatsapp. Unfortunately, while Whatsapp is seen more as a necessity in global communication, Snapchat has taken a back seat as an entertainment app. The result of this is that SNAP does not fit well in either camp. The app is not an essential app and, as an entertainment app, it fails to engage its users like FIT. The non-permanence of the content on the platform might prevent users from meaningfully engaging with each other over time. Every time a user ""snaps"" another one, the video or image disappears after a few seconds and can't be commented on or looked back on like a Facebook status or a Tweet. In addition to this, the platform only allows single peer-to-peer connections to be made - with the exception of Snapchat groups, which were a good idea that was never expanded on.The Snapchat groups and Snapchat Stories are good examples of how SNAP has fallen behind FIT in meaningful ways. It took a small step in the right direction of encouraging users to spend more time on its platform, but then was almost immediately overshadowed by Facebook and Instagram, which introduced Stories and allowed them to have live and public comments. The conclusion of this is that a ""newcomer"" like SNAP doesn't fully understand how to drive user engagement, nor does it have the ability to increase monetization opportunities. While FIT are able to natively display ads to users, SNAP must display ads in the public figure and company story sections, which struggle to engage any users.With all this considered, let's take a look at how accurate my original projection was compared to its actual performance. My original projections were published in March 2017 and were designed to be highly conservative in growth projections. Though it was indeed used to back a short thesis, it was more predicated on SNAP's overvaluation on a comparable basis and an outsized growth story. A great number of things have changed with SNAP since then, and my predictions were not updated and published quarter to quarter. With that disclaimer, let's dive into it.Source: Data taken from SNAP's 10-QThe tables above show the raw data between my projections and SNAP's actual metrics. The coloring is a bit strange but, basically, the closer the delta is to zero, the darker the color. For the sake of brevity, I won't go through it line by line. So, what are some key takeaways? I underestimated the DAU growth in Europe in the later quarters. While the delta is small in the first several periods, it has grown steadily. As for total revenue, the higher DAU led to higher revenue for Europe and rest of the world, but I overestimated U.S. growth. The net effect on total revenue is not too far off (with the exception of a couple quarters with big misses).Source: Data taken from SNAP's 10-QSource: Data taken from SNAP's 10-QSource: Data taken from SNAP's 10-QThe charts above outline an extremely conservative growth for SNAP. In fact, calling it ""growth"" is a stretch. I kept a lot of the numbers constant and decelerated the growth of revenues and some DAU regions. I did this for a number of reasons, but I think ARPU won't meaningfully increase past the $2.65 ceiling unless the company can bring new features to the app to engage users and natively display ads. I modeled it out without the intent to support a bull or bear thesis similar to how I did in the original article. This in itself doesn't mean much unless you look at the total revenue projections, which show quarterly revenues remaining rather stable with some skewed downward. However, the one key difference is that I am writing this article right before the Android update, which has the potential to increase the user base if done correctly.Obviously, this above model is very pessimistic, but I did it to make a point. If you value SNAP like I did above and keep quarterly revenues relatively constant, you can compare this vs. Facebook and Twitter to reach a ""base-case"" scenario on a multiples basis. We did this same conservative method before when valuing SNAP as the story comes out as an easy thesis; in other words, if the company in the base case of revenues is considerably lower or higher than comps, then you have an easy thesis.Source: Data taken from Yahoo FinanceThe multiples analysis yields itself to a bearish thesis, but just by a sliver. To me, this indicates several things. For one, the risk-adjusted returns of a pure short would not materially be favorable for a long-term investor at this time. If we look at this backwards, using comps, the market is estimating $1260.72M in full-year revenue for 2019 compared to our $1151.27M estimate using our stable revenue model. For me, the metrics and numbers show that SNAP is obviously distressed, but it's not a juicy short or far from a convincing long right now.Now, let's look at a slightly more optimistic view of the company. It shouldn't come as a surprise that SNAP's executives have been vocal about the new android app update. For a long time now the platform has focused heavily on the iOS environment, which has left Android users chronically ignored. The result of this has become a poorly optimized app that is cumbersome and difficult to use. Some investors believe that this latest update will reinvigorate SNAP's user base and welcome back its ignored and marginalized Android users, while others believe it is too little too late.While I have presented a more pessimistic view on SNAP, there is a case to be made on the more bullish conservative side, which you can see below. I took the same model above, but adjusted the daily active user growth and ARPU numbers to be in line with a reasonably successful Android update leading users coming back to the platform. This DAU growth in turn allows for ARPU growth of a once-again expanding platform, thus increasing SNAP's revenue. This optimistic model is still in line with the ""conservative but reasonable"" growth sticker on the former model as well.Source: Data taken from SNAP's 10-QFrom the breakdowns above, you can see that I held the growth rather constant with ARPU increasing at a slightly higher than constant rate as DAU continued to improve. While this might not look very conservative, it's important to remember exactly how many more Android users there are than iOS users. With that in mind, I think the DAU growth, given a successful app update, is fairly reasonable.Taking this and using it for our multiples analysis, we arrive at the table below. It is the same as the previous multiples analysis above, with the noted exception of using a higher 2019 revenue number. The table below shows SNAP at a 9.88% discount to its comparables' trading multiples, which lends itself to a bull thesis.Source: Data taken from Yahoo FinanceAs you can see from the new scenarios, the jury is still out on which way SNAP will go. It could continue its current path and the cash burn will continue until it bleeds out or a successful app update reenergizes the struggling company. SNAP is at a tipping point that could push it either way in the coming few quarters. I believe the next quarter will shed more light on which direction SNAP will move. My guess is that it will, in the long term, continue to suffer as Facebook and Instagram continue to roll out more features compared to SNAP.While the Android app update might give the company a nice boost in key performance metrics, the underlying problem remains: Its comparables are significantly better at monetizing their platforms and instituting new features. At present, SNAP is failing to optimize its platform in order to drive user engagement as well as optimizing to display ads more natively and increase ARPU. As the pressure of decreasing DAU begins to mount, SNAP will need to somehow save ARPU by either adding new revenue-generating features or increasing ad display frequencies. Overall, I think it's apparent that SNAP is beginning to struggle. Without a strong influx of content or features, the struggle will continue for the young company - unless it can radically change and begin to mirror the update culture of its more mature competitors."

At the time of the initial report, the stock received an Unattractive rating. Our short thesis highlighted declining economic earnings, slowing user growth, and an inability to compete against entrenched social media giants. Where other investors saw the next Facebook (FB), we saw the next Twitter (TWTR): a platform that was limited in size and would always struggle with monetization.During the 707-day holding period, SNAP outperformed as a short position, declining 65% from its IPO day closing price of $24/share and 50% from its offering price of $17/share, compared to a 14% gain for the S&P 500.In the nearly two years since its IPO, just about everything that we said could go wrong for SNAP has gone wrong. A short list of SNAP's woes includes:None of the issues we identified in our initial report have changed. However, it appears the market has absorbed so much bad news at this point that there's little left to drive the stock down further and a low bar for it to pop back up. In its latest earnings report, SNAP reported no user growth and nearly $200 million in operating losses. Since the market expected users to decline and losses to be even larger, the stock jumped 25%.With the market willing to reward such a poor quarter - along with the possibility of an acquisition if CEO Evan Spiegel ever changes his mind - we've decided to take our gains and close our position. SNAP still earns an Unattractive rating in our model, but we're not recommending it as a short idea at these levels.Figure 1: SNAP vs. S&P 500 - Price Return - Successful Short CallSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsNote: Gain/Decline performance analysis excludes transaction costs and dividends.This article originally published on February 8, 2019.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."

Disastrous financial results during 2018, combined with significant turmoil inside the company, have resulted in the company's stock losing over half of its value over the past year, with shares recently trading just 33% above all-time lows:SNAP longs should be forgiven if they view the best path forward as a buyout of the company, rather than trudging on alone. First of all, a buyout at a healthy premium would mitigate some of their unrealized losses in Snap stock. Merger premiums recently for tech companies have been quite healthy. Witness, for example, the 63% premium that IBM (IBM) paid for Red Hat (RHT) (see here); a similar premium for Snap would put the buyout price over $10/share. Second, a sale of the company to a financially healthy buyer (such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) or Alphabet aka Google (GOOG)) would allow Snap to continue scaling its cash-burning business model without distracting funding concerns, as well as stem the recent mass exodus of senior executives (for example, note the unexpected departure of the CFO several weeks ago). Industry observers have stoked buyout hopes over the past year as Snap's shares have declined. A writer for Techcrunch had the following to say on the matter in late October 2018 (source):Another commentator observed last September as follows (source):Even luminaries of the sports world have chimed in on this subject, with Patriots head coach Bill Belichick in 2017 fantasizing about a ""Snapface"" or ""Instachat"". Certainly, no one can doubt the credibility of NFL head coaches when it comes to the advisability of potential large cap tech mergers. (OK, we have inserted this paragraph for some comic relief, however it is timely given a certain upcoming football game involving a certain team from the New England region.)Unfortunately for hopeful longs, a buyout of Snap remains unlikely for the following reasons:Because of the foregoing, we believe SNAP longs will need to pin their hopes on a turnaround of the underlying business rather than a possible buyout. In this respect, the company has announced that Q4 2018 earnings will be released on February 5th (see here). Any turnaround will need to hinge on DAU and MAU growth, as well as Snap's ability to monetize its existing user base. Investors can refresh themselves on the market's reaction to the company's last earnings release (for Q3 2018) here."
4232021,104703,2019-01-08T09:23:46-05:00,"My long-term view on Snap is one of skepticism about the business, share structure, and management. This is a stock I will neither long nor short over the long haul.That being said, I believe Snap will report a blockbuster Q4 that will temporarily boost optimism around the stock. I believe shares could go as a high as $8-$9.My end of 2019 price target is $7. Rating remains at HOLD.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has many longer term risks that make me skeptical about the resilience of a potential Q4 rally. While I do expect Snap's shares to be resilient and exhibit strength in the short term, I question the sustainability of stock price appreciation.But for the short term, I am leaning bullish on Snap.In order to gauge my short-term optimism on Snap shares, we have to look back at the months leading up to the Q4 report back in February of last year.Snap's stock had been extremely volatile, but stuck in the teens. Why? Snap had delivered three straight quarters of disappointing results, leading sell-side analysts to drastically slash back their revenue and earnings targets for the highly anticipated fourth quarter.At this point in time, short interest was high, expectations were low, and we were headed into Q4, a quarter that is traditionally strong for media companies in general.This is what short interest looked like in Snap's shares leading up to the report:SNAP data by YChartsThen, Snap delivered a ""blowout"" quarter on low expectations:Thus, Snap's shares ripped higher. The size of the rip was phenomenal.(source: Google Finance)The stock surged 47% on the back of this report, in a single day. Jim Cramer even said that he thought ""Snap could go a lot higher"" after the rip.After all, it took a few quarters after the IPO of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for the stock to gain traction amongst investors.The narrative was Snap was finally getting a handle on itself and the stock would roar higher from there on out.As we now know, that narrative was false, and Snap's shares have slid a staggering 72% from their 52-week high achieved in early February of last year.Snap reports quarterly earnings on February 5th. There are three reasons (again) for why I believe Snap will deliver strength in Q4:Management SandbaggingI believe that in the Q3 report, Snap's management (Tim Stone and Evan Spiegel) was extremely conservative with their guidance. To understand why, let's take a look at Snap's Q2 report.(source: Snap IR)The midpoint of Snap's Q3 revenue guidance was $277.5 million, while the midpoint EBITDA loss was -$172.5 million.Revenue ended up coming in at $298 million (7% above the midpoint and 3% above the top-end of $290 million). EBITDA came in at -$138 million (20% above the midpoint and 14% above the top-end of -$160 million).Snap handily beat their own guidance for both revenue and earnings. If we look at the sell-side estimates heading into Q3, we see that the sell-side was nowhere close to the reported results.The figures that worried Wall Street were Snap's DAU figures and its Q4 guidance.On the DAU side, Snap has chosen to report its DAUs in the millions, not the hundreds of thousands. And because of SEC scrutiny on rounding, if Snap had 186.9 million DAUs, they couldn't report 187 million as that would overstate their total number of actual users. Instead, they would have to round down to 186 million. Despite that, the consensus estimates for DAUs seems to be rounded to the hundreds of thousands. Snap ""missed"" by <1% on the user side. This miss is negligible, and should be taken with a grain of salt.As I talked about earlier, Snap's Q3 results were materially higher than guided for in the Q2 report. As such, fearing lower than expected guidance is irrational if Q4 will be a repeat of Q3.Let's look at management's Q4 guidance:(source: Snap IR)Now, the midpoint for Snap's revenue guidance is $367.5 million, while the EBITDA midpoint is -$87.5 million (~$0.07/share in losses assuming a share count of 1.295 billion).Here are sell-side estimates for Snap's Q4 according to Yahoo Finance:(source: Yahoo! Finance)As you can see, the midpoint of the revenue guide is slightly lower than consensus revenue estimates, while the midpoint of the EBITDA guide is slightly higher than consensus EPS estimates.Here is what I personally am expecting Snap to report:In Q3, Snap grew ARPU as a whole by 37%. I am assuming that despite an increase in monetization tools at advertisers' disposal, this ARPU growth decelerates to 35% in Q4, landing at $2.06. I'm also assuming Snap loses another million users per management's guidance, to get to 185 million DAUs.Another quarter will go by where Snap continues its transition to programmatic advertising, lowering cost of revenue growth from 17% Y/Y in Q3 to 16% Y/Y in Q4.And for the fourth straight quarter, I am anticipating Snap will lower operating costs as the company continues focusing on profitability. I anticipate Snap will lower OpEx growth from 10% in Q3 to nearly flat. This will come from less spending growth in marketing, R&D, and SG&A. The big change will come from SG&A, as Snap will be able to spend less on ad salespeople and transition to a programmatic system, allowing Snap to lower cost growth in this segment.Short InterestSnap's short interest is getting high again, which is the big reason I am so optimistic on Snap's stock heading into the quarter. According to the Wall Street Journal, 22.4% of Snap's total float is currently held short with days to cover sitting at 8 days. Short sellers make up a great portion of Snap's stock. The stock is now ripe for a short squeeze. All we need is a positive catalyst. Assuming Snap delivers a solid Q4 that beats estimates, an initial rally in Snap's shares could be exaggerated by short covering. After all, Snap's shares wouldn't have rallied in such a drastic manner last February without the short sellers.Some bears are even switching sides. BTIG upgraded Snap from underperform to neutral, saying that Snap was no longer a compelling short. While that is only one example, a positive report may cause some bears to change sides.The bottom line is, there are lots of short sellers in the stock. If a positive fundamental catalyst emerges, whether it be the Q4 report or something else, these short sellers will be in a precarious position. This could lead to greater upside in the stock.Low ExpectationsThe sell-side community on Snap is not expecting much out of the company over the coming quarters. The consensus rating on Snap is at hold, with few analysts being bullish on the stock. Couple that with weaker than hoped for results, and you get the low expectations we see right now.Snapchat has had multiple consecutive quarters of deteriorating or negative user growth that has put pressure on price targets and quarterly expectations from analysts.My 12-month rating on Snap's shares remains a hold/neutral, while I am maintaining my $7 price target. While I am neutral on Snap longer term, I believe Snap's shares could have strong upside in the short term.(source: Variety)"
4233986,104703,2019-01-17T10:43:05-05:00,"Snap shares are plunging roughly 7% in the extended-hours session, on the back of news that Snap CFO is resigning after joining in May of last year.Tim Stone, former finance VP at Amazon is leaving Snap ""to pursue other opportunities"". Looking back at Stone's accomplishments at Amazon, we see that the resignation COULD be a nothing burger.The real story of the release was that Snap delivered a phenomenal blowout quarter. In my view, Snap is beginning to turnaround. Once sentiment turns, this stock could explode.End of year PT remains $7, rating remains HOLD. Short term, I could see potential for great upside in shares.","Snap (SNAP) CFO Tim Stone is resigning, adding yet another name to the Snap executive departures list. This comes less than a year after he replaced Snap's previous CFO Drew Vollero. Mr. Stone left to ""pursue other opportunities"". While some may interpret his departure as a lack of confidence, I believe the departure is not as bad as it seems. Snap has had a recent problem with executive departures. Snap's problems with executive departures have not been few and far between. This was one of the key reasons I used to be short and bearish on Snap.Here are the most important lines from the 8-K. I highlighted the most important phrases used in the filing:While the market is interpreting his resignation as a negative, his case could be like Imran Khan's, where he may look to pursue a new job or his passion. While I do not have confirmation of this theory, I believe it is not far-fetched.Secondly, I believe the market is interpreting the resignation as being caused by a disagreement between Mr. Stone and the direction of the company. This address seems to put those fears to rest. He did not leave because of a disagreement about corporate strategy, at least according to the filing.Finally, if Mr. Stone was bitter with Snap, why would he continue to act as CFO until a replacement was found? On top of that, he is assisting with the search for a new CFO. His transition out of the company is being treated like it dented the integrity of Snap's general strategic goals. In reality, his transition will most likely be a professional one. I believe the selloff is extremely overdone.More important than anything else in the 8-K was this line:Back at the end of Q3, Snap guided for revenues of $355-380 million and an EBITDA loss of $100 to $75 million. A slight beat, let's call it a $2 or $3 million on revenue gets us $382 million in revenue for Q4. Consensus estimates are calling for $374 million in revenues. If EBITDA is at $75 million, on 1.295 billion shares implies ~$0.06/share in losses. And that's assuming EBITDA comes in at the high end of the guidance, not above the high end. EPS expectations are for $0.08 in losses. So, on both the revenue and earnings sides, Snap should report numbers above their own guidance and above consensus estimates.If Snap reports blowout numbers that surpass expectations, we could see a sentiment turnaround in the short term similar to Twitter's (TWTR) turnaround when the company made progress monetizing their user base despite reporting a weaker overall user base.If Snap reports an acceleration in ARPU growth in Q4, the story on Snap can change from an ability to grow and retain users to its ability to monetize its 186 million DAUs. As I detailed in my last article, Snap's Q3 wasn't a bad quarter. If anything, it was a pretty strong quarter. And yet, the sell-side has been even more bearish then they were previously, while Q4 remains the best quarter because of seasonality. If ARPU numbers come in above expectations, the 22% short interest and eight days to cover could ignite a short squeeze.While challenges remain for Snap, both Citi and Cowen have been more bullish recently, both of them upgrading the stock from sell to hold, off of stronger ad buyer confidence. According to Cowen, their ad buyer survey showed improving trends and ad spending since Snap moved to programmable auction-based ad placements. Citi says ARPU growth accelerated in the quarter. If this is true, then Q4 should bode well for Snap.Longer term, Snap's business has many challenges that are caused both by competition (Instagram, stories, etc.) and local issues, like long-term advertiser traction. Please do not believe that long term, I am a bull. I, if anything, am more skeptical on the long-term Snap story than ever. Short-term though, Snap shares could have tremendous upside ahead of them."
4218297,22148,2018-11-05T13:55:54-05:00,Snap reported another quarter of declining users.Industry surveys continue to show Instagram successfully take market share and killing all momentum in Snapchat.The company is burning far too much cash to play any turnaround story.,"The quarterly results for Snap (SNAP) were so bad that my recently issued price target of $5 now appears aggressive. The original story of out-of-control spending has been replaced by active user declines. The social-messaging platform won't have a rewarding future based on projected user declines.A social network can quickly die when users abandon the platform as friends no longer use the platform causing a death spiral. Despite massive cash flow problems, the user problem is alarming.Snapchat saw the North American daily active user (DAU) growth start to stall all the way back last Q4 at 187 million users. Based on guidance of further DAU declines, the company could see users fall over 10 million DAUs from the 191 million peak in Q1.Source: Snap Q3'18 presentationThe app update at the end of 2017 was a big reason for stalling user growth, but also the success of Instagram (FB) has caused the problem. At this point, fixing the app doesn't necessarily resolve the problem.According to the Piper Jaffray survey, teens now use Instagram more often than Snapchat. Snapchat still wins the popularity contest, but Instagram has the network to pull teens over highlighting the prime weakness of having such a powerful competitor in Facebook.Source: Piper Jaffray TwitterSnap saw a vast improvement to the cash flow metrics during Q3, but the numbers were ultimately still massive losses. Improving the free cash flow losses by $60 million over last Q3 still left the losses at an incredibly large $159 million.Source: Snap Q3'18 presentationThe company now appears to have operating spending growth under control. Snap has seen operating expenses decline sequentially for the last three quarters.Again, the problem here is the implications that DAUs are dropping while expenses drop. The company has spent less on sales and marketing over the last year suggesting maybe Snap has under-spent in certain categories.This all gets us to whether Snap can even breakeven at this rate. The Q4 guidance is for another impressive reduction in the EBITDA loss to somewhere below $100 million, down from a $159 million loss last Q4.Revenues are only expected to grow by around 30% suggesting revenue growth is quickly heading to zero. As DAUs decline, investors should look for drastic cuts to 2019 analyst estimates.SNAP Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsSnap needs to achieve that 30% revenue grow by next Q4 to bring the company to the break-even EBITDA levels. Snap would generate about $90 million in additional revenue that when mirrored with zero cost growth would virtually wipe out all of the projected EBITDA losses for this Q4.The problem is that Snap needs to continue investing in the future to keep up with Instagram. New CFO Tim Sloan confirmed this need to invest:With forecasted DAU declines continuing into the future, one should expect only limited revenue growth next year. On top of that, Snap is going to have a hard time cutting cash flow losses in the face of declining users while needing to invest.The key investor takeaway is that Snap remains in a death spiral with a declining user base while burning hundreds of millions in cash each quarter. My $5 price target and a market cap of nearly $7.5 billion is starting to appear too bullish. Avoid any temptation to play a turnaround in the stock just because the company beat lowered estimates.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4227892,104952,2018-12-12T11:08:29-05:00,"Snap trades near an all-time low at $5.83 price/share, which is 4x lower than its post-IPO price/share at $24.48.

Snap has to reverse its $1.3 billion TTM EBITDA loss in the next 12 months.Evan Spiegel’s long-term (10 year-plus) strategic goal will be better served by going private.The long-term plan should focus more on transforming Snap into a platform with access to various monetization models than on launching another unproven Spectacle-based product.","We believe Snap (SNAP) has a fundamental problem, and was too early for IPO. It positions itself as a camera company competing against social network companies such as Facebook (FB), Snow, or LINE (NASDAQ:LN) that have transformed themselves into platforms with rich use cases and access to various monetization models. Snap’s main product, which is the vanishing photo app, looks more like a feature than a platform.The lack of use cases as a product contributed to the recent drops in both active users and time spent within the app. Snap is currently trading near its all-time low at $5.83/share. Following the unsatisfactory result of the first-generation Spectacle product launch and key executives leaving, it would be wise for Snap to reorganize and focus on a very long-term strategy as a private company.Snap’s 2019 profitability plan will include launching a new double-camera Spectacle product line at a higher price point ($350) than its predecessor. Seeing how the past Spectacle line has not generated significant revenue, we found this thesis unconvincing and half baked at best. If any, it only strengthens our hypothesis that distractions have eroded the management's ability to focus on a long-term goal.(Source: Snap Inc 10-Q Oct 25, 2018. Quarterly Average Revenue Per User in millions)The majority of Snap’s $1.1 billion TTM revenue has come from its advertising products such as Snap Ads, Sponsored Lenses, and Geofilters. Therefore, instead of launching another Spectacle product, we believe it would be wise for Snap to consider doing three things in 2019:Snap needs to become more of a platform than a feature. The main objective would be to improve its ARPU and DAU growth through diversified monetization models such as in-app commerce, gaming, or payment. The key to this strategy would be the use cases incentivizing its users to stay longer in-app.For instance, the large part of Facebook and Instagram users from regions such as Brazil, India and Indonesia have been using its platform as an online commerce instead of traditional social network platform. As per Facebook's 10-Q filing back in 2012, these users have been proven to contribute massively to Facebook's DAU growth and ARPU in 2012 as a private pre-IPO company:Going private would allow Snap to focus on considering a path to more exponential growth, such as the one Facebook took, without any distraction.Snap has a market cap of roughly $7.7 billion to $8 billion and P/S ratio of $7.16 today. Considering Snap can execute its long-term strategies well enough and achieve a target of 56% increase in global ARPU to $2.5 by 2019 (on par to Facebook’s 2014 ARPU), it could be a bargain to any sovereign wealth fund, tech giants, or overseas unicorns.(Source: Zacks. Facebook price/sales)As the analyst from Pivotal suggested in October, the target price could be somewhere around $8/share or slightly lower. This comes down to almost a $10 billion market cap. We feel that the deal could require some potential buyers to chip in an all-cash transaction. One possible move would be Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) increasing its current 12% stake in the company alongside a sovereign wealth fund buyer or several financial investors. (Source: author, Tencent Holding Ltd. Financials)As one of China’s tech unicorns with $373 billion market cap, Tencent is a cash giant. Last year alone they had more than $15 billion in cash to spend, which was mostly generated from $10 billion of cash from operations after capex (FCF) that grows 42% YoY. Furthermore, Tencent’s track record when it comes to acquisition has indicated that they have not only the capacity but also the experience to execute deals at such size.(Source: Venture Beat)In 2016, Tencent teamed up with several financial investors to acquire more than an 80% stake of a video game company Supercell for $8.6 billion from another giant Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY). As we know, Tencent is very keen to gain a dominance in the global gaming market. Supercell and their other major gaming investments such as Ubisoft (OTCPK:UBSFY), Activision (ATVI), or Riot Games have covered 13% of the global gaming market. The potential Snap acquisition could create another major opportunity for Tencent to build a new overseas gaming revenue stream by leveraging Snap’s existing platform and their relatively young user base.With the strong likelihood of Snap still burning a lot of cash throughout 2019, any debt-funded transaction could be more challenging. It's also possible that Snap’s earnings situation could put pressure on Tencent’s market valuation in the short term if the deals are viewed negatively. Throughout 2014 to 2017 when Tencent had been making various high-profile acquisitions, their P/E multiples had stably remained in between 30 and 50 before it hit the recent high at 62 in November. Many of Tencent’s past acquisitions have established stable revenue streams.(Source: Tencent’s PE ratio 2014 - 2017)We think Snap has a fundamental problem which they can better fix as a private company. We've come to the conclusion that there's no other upside case for Snap other than the possibility of a private takeover transaction. The last two weeks of November 2018 has seen Snap trading sideways between $5.9/share and $6.5/share, which was followed by the recent decline to $5.8/share. Considering a takeover happening in the next six to eight months, Snap would be a bargain today at almost a 40% discount off the expected acquisition price."
4231147,25120,2019-01-02T18:45:59-05:00,"Snap's stock has snapped in 2018 as many investors look forward to a better 2019.The company has a real engagement and management issue, but sees steady revenue growth and narrowing losses.Real economic losses remain very big, however, as I continue to be cautious despite the big reduction in the expectations for the business.","Snap (SNAP) cannot seem to catch a positive break. The company, which once was a target of Facebook (FB) to be acquired by the much larger social media giant, has reportedly declined multi-billion offers in the past and decided to go after it alone. Despite rapid growth of the category at large and huge public outcry about practices of Facebook, Snap cannot seem to find real traction, let alone be able to report break-even results or profits.Despite troubles at its major competitor, which was once interested to acquire the company, Snap has only seen continued headwinds amidst disappointing growth and continued losses. That makes that shares continue to trade near the all-time low at $5 and change, down a lot from the IPO price of $17 in spring of 2017, and down much more from a post-IPO high of nearly $30 per share.Despite the continued fall in the share price, I am not just yet becoming enthusiastic on the share price, given the continued losses putting continued upward pressure on the operating valuation amidst worrying engagement trends.With nearly 1.25 billion shares outstanding at the end of 2017, it was clear that expectations on Snap were pretty high, with the company being awarded a +$20 billion valuation around the time of the IPO and even more so in the weeks which followed that event.Ever since, a lot of things have happened. Revenues more than doubled in 2017 to $824.9 million, with fourth quarter sales growth slowing down to still an impressive 74%, for a run rate of more than $1.1 billion a year. The problem is that the company lost a ton of money, with adjusted EBITDA losses running at $720 million for the year as it excludes various charges such as D&A as well as massive stock-based compensation costs. Assuming ""normalised"" stock-based compensation into account at roughly $750 million a year, realistic loss numbers are easily double that of the reported adjusted EBITDA loss.Note that at the time these results were released in early 2018, shares were still trading around the IPO levels. From here, it went downhill as shares fell to $11 in May upon the first quarter earnings release. Revenue growth slowed down to 54% with revenues coming in at $230 million, and adjusted EBITDA losses totalling $218 million, which of course is a very much adjusted number.Shares traded around those same levels in August with second quarter revenue growth slowing down to 44% with revenues amounting to $262 million, while adjusted EBITDA losses amounted to $169 million. Third quarter results showed resilience, with revenues up 43% to $298 million as adjusted EBITDA losses narrowed further to $138 million. Despite the modest improvements, shares have plummeted to just $5 and change.The reason for that is simple. While adjusted EBITDA losses of $138 million are down a lot, they exclude a similar dollar amount of stock-based compensation which makes that actual losses (not cash flow losses) still come in above a billion a year, resulting in continued dilution for shareholders. With a diluted share count of 1.43 billion shares, that represents a $7.9 billion equity valuation at $5.50 per share. On the bright side, included in this valuation is little over $2 billion in cash and equivalents, for an enterprise valuation of roughly $6 billion.For a $6 billion valuation, one can currently buy Snap which is doing about $1.2 billion in sales, translating into a 5 times sales multiple. That is the only positive news as realistic losses come in around a billion, or actually close to $1.2 billion if we use the adjusted EBITDA number and subtract D&A charges as well as stock-based compensation.On the bright side is that the same methodology works down to a $1.7 billion annualised loss rate in Q3 of last year, as revenue growth still comes in around 40%, despite just 5% daily active user growth numbers. While the 186 million daily user number looks impressive, the number of daily active users is down two quarters in a row, as this kind of engagement number is crucial in the long term.Any valuation methodology for Snap is always based on relative valuations as absolute multiples are useless except for perhaps the revenue multiple. Facebook actually has a market capitalisation of $385 billion at $132 per share, although that includes over $41 billion in cash and equivalents, for a $344 billion operating asset valuation. Its revenues probably come in around $55 billion, for a 6.2 times sales multiple, and while year-on-year revenue growth of 33% in the most recent quarter is not as impressive, it is posting real GAAP operating margins in excess of 40%!The lower sales multiple for Snap, in combination with higher growth, do not automatically create appeal, given the dramatic difference in the margins of both firms. Furthermore, Snap is seeing a real slowdown in operating momentum. Fourth quarter resales of $355-380 million are seen up just 24-33% year on year, although adjusted losses are expected to narrow further to $75-100 million.Truth of the matter is that Snap is making slow but gradual progress in growing revenues and narrowing losses, although the company has a long way to go to achieve break-even results in adjusted EBITDA, and even far further removed from posting real break-even results.This gradual pace of improvements, losses incurred along the way, and fierce competition mean that investors grow nervous as it does not appear that Snap's executives appear eager to sell the company out to a much larger competitor. This comes as Facebook has essentially created an in-house competitor with Instagram Stories.At this point, a short thesis seems no longer appealing from a risk-reward stance, yet I see no compelling reason to own the shares just yet despite continued but weakening growth and slowly narrowing losses. The reason for that is the fact that shares are not cheap just yet in terms of sales multiples, as losses continue to be very large, while options on long-dated calls remain relatively rich in order to bet on a recovery that way.Hence, I continue to watch the story develop with interest going forward, but simply find it too early to buy a stake at this point amidst real traction issues for the app, real continued losses, and continued elevated valuations (amidst continued dilution) despite the optically low share price."
4238993,25120,2019-02-07T10:46:19-05:00,"Snap has ""snapped"" higher after fourth quarter results were stronger than feared.The company sees solid growth and is making progress on the bottom line, yet a lot of work remains.Engagement (as in the number of users) remains a real challenge, as a result of fierce competition from Instagram and other social platforms.Between $6 and $11, I consider shares to be ""fairly valued"" and see no reason to alter the neutral stance on the shares.","At the start of the year, I looked at the prospects for Snap (NYSE:SNAP) in an article called ""the curious case of Snap."" I observed that 2018 has been a dismal year for the company and investors, as Snap has engagement and management issues at hand, despite growing revenues and narrowing losses.Trading at nearly $6 at the time, I concluded to be cautious despite the low expectations on the back of the large losses and real operational challenges, including that of engagement. While the end of the year was stronger than expected, or better said feared, Snap still has plenty to prove in 2019.The law of large numbers is catching up with Snap as well although the numbers are not yet so large, especially versus its peers. From a revenue base with annual sales of $825 million in 2017, the company has seen growth decelerate a bit during 2018. First quarter sales growth for 2018 came in at 54%, while growth slowed down to 44% in the second quarter and 43% in the third quarter of last year. On revenues coming in at $298 million in the third quarter, the company has seen EBITDA losses come down significantly. First quarter EBITDA loss of $218 million narrowed to $169 million in the second quarter and $138 million in the third quarter.The company originally guided for fourth quarter sales of $355-$380 million, as EBITDA losses were seen at $75-$100 million in the seasonally stronger quarter. The good news is that growth came in at 34% as sales hit $390 million while EBITDA losses came in at $50 million. Note that this latter number is further removed from break-even levels as you might expect at first sight. This number excludes a real $23 million depreciation expense and real costly $122 million stock-based compensation expense as well. Adjusted for these items, losses come in at nearly $200 million.Thus, the business is now posting sales in excess of $1.5 billion at an annualised rate, yet it continues to post real economic losses at around $750-$800 million. Furthermore, note that the fourth quarter is typically strong, as the guidance for the seasonally softer first quarter is not necessarily very comforting. Revenues are seen up 24-34% to $285-$310 million as adjusted EBITDA losses are seen at $140-$165 million, with no full year guidance being issued.So while the business had a better quarter than anticipated, or better said feared, how are the operational metrics holding up? Daily active users came in at 186 million, the same as Q3 of 2018, but down a million compared to the same period a year before, indicating that all of the growth comes from revenues per user. The company attributes this to games, publishing stories and shows which are more actively consumed by users. This is important as growth in the user base is flat in North America, but also in ""emerging"" places like Europe and the rest of the world.With cash and equivalents still comfortably above the $2.0 billion mark, valuations have jumped quite a bit as shares rose from $7.00 to $8.70 in response to the earnings release. With 1.51 billion shares outstanding, the equity valuation has jumped from $10.6 billion to $13.1 billion. This 25% jump is even bigger if we look at the current enterprise valuation of $11.1 billion, as the valuation jumped by roughly 30% based on this metric.The current enterprise value has risen a lot from the lows in early January when I pegged the enterprise value at roughly $6 billion. This means that sales multiples have risen from about 5 times sales to about 9 times sales based on trailing sales, a steep multiple given the steep losses and growth rates seen around 30%.The potential for the business remains despite lack of user growth as ARPU in North America rose to $3.38 per user, while the rest of the world comes in at $1.24 per user, actually larger than the $1.04 generated per user in Europe. The good news is that sales growth is directly seen on the bottom line as total expenses are flattish for a year now, marking real improvements on the bottom line with >30% sales growth.As I concluded at the start of the year, valuation discussions with regards to Snap are based on the relative valuation multiples as the company continues to lose money. A 7.5 times annualised sales multiple, and 9 times trailing sales multiple, seems reasonable compared to some other SaaS names which grow at >30% revenue growth rates. On the other hand, it can be questioned if social media names deserve a similar multiple as enterprise cloud software platforms or programs.The obvious buyer Facebook (FB) is not the most logical candidate anymore, while it was interested in the past in the business. Of course, the success of Instagram, with nearly 3 times as many users, makes that its interest has faded. Furthermore, the controversy around social media, practices of the platforms and engagement issues do not make this space an automatic growth area anymore for a technology company which ""missed the boat."" Then again, it should be said that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has done really good things with LinkedIn of course.The good news is that Snap appears to be conservative in its revenue guidance, as seen in the Q4 results, and is really delivering on real improvements on the bottom line, although economic losses still trend at $800 million a year. These losses, lack of potential buyers and not being a motivated seller, as well as fierce competition from Facebook make that I continue to be cautious.Hence I reiterate my conclusion from January that Snap is not a compelling short (given the continuation of growth and reduced losses) although triggers on the long side are not convincing enough, while long-dated call option premiums remain too pricey to make a bet that way."

Is it good for the economy to put so much wealth in the hands of so few people?The answer could be foreboding for financial markets and SNAP. Sell SNAP.","Snapchat co-founders Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel at the NYSE. Source: Hollywood ReporterIn late September, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hiked interest rates by a quarter point and intimated the U.S. was experiencing strong economic activity. There could be more interest rate hikes to follow. It was likely his comments on asset prices that caused volatility for financial markets; in a response to Sam Fleming of the Financial Times, Powell had this to say:Jerome Powell:If asset prices are in the upper reach of their historical ranges, then the Fed's removal of the punch bowl could drive prices lower. From late September (around the time of Powell's comments) to October 10th, the Dow Jones (DIA) fell about 3%. President Trump called the sell-off a long-awaited ""correction"" and suggested the Fed had gone crazy with rate hikes. In my opinion, a perpetual run-up of the stock market is not necessarily good for the economy.Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke wanted to keep rates low and to help spike asset prices, and put assets on individuals' balance sheets. After a decade of record low interest rates and the Fed ""providing liquidity"" to financial markets, the Dow Jones has more than tripled in value. That represents a 10-year compound annual growth rate (""CAGR"") of about 11%.The rapid rise in financial markets puts assets on people's balance sheet, but did it help the economy? The Fed's ""unconventional"" policy has yet to be proven right, in my opinion.The October jobs report showed unemployment of 3.7 percent. Unemployment has not consistently been at or below 4.0 percent since late 2000. The number of people no longer in the labor force is still over 95 million, which could be considered a national crisis. Secondly, over 80% of the value of total stocks was controlled by the richest 10% in 2016:In effect, the lion's share of the rewards from the Fed's unconventional policy has gone to the richest 10%. When critics accuse the Fed of ""picking the winners,"" this could be what they are referring to. If the economy is being managed for the richest 10% of the country, then what happens to the other 90%?I have been on record that the Fed's unconventional policy has inured to the benefit of the investor class - Wall Street titans, hedge fund managers, venture capital firms, et. al. Snap (SNAP) could be the poster child for the Fed stimulus gone wrong. Snapchat made a name for itself with exploding videos. Just because someone created a cool app does not mean it should be a publicly-traded company. The company raised an estimated $3.7 billion with its 2017 IPO.According to Recode, (1) founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy received $272 million each, (2) Benchmark (venture capital) received $340 million, (3) Lightspeed (venture capital) received $156 million, and (4) Snap chairman Michael Lynton received $1 million. Per Snap's public filings, the company received $2.7 billion from the sale of shares. That totaled about $3.7 billion in IPO proceeds.I think Snap's model of allowing exploding videos is value-added and unique. The question remains, ""Can you monetize it?"" So far there is no certainty that the business model works. For full-year 2017, the company had cash flow from operations of -$735 million. Through year-to-date September 2018, the company reported cash flow from operations of -$564 million. The company has burned about $1.3 billion in less than two years.Snap's products require high-bandwidth capabilities. The more its users or user engagement grows, the more data usage Snap requires. More data usage leads to higher bandwidth costs. That could make it difficult for Snap to gain leverage in its operations as revenue grows.In Q3, its revenue of $298 million was up 43% Y/Y. Its cost of revenue - which includes bandwidth costs - declined by 6%. Still, the company's gross margin was rail thin at 34%. There was little left over to cover R&D and SG&A expense. Said another way, its average revenue per user (""ARPU"") of $1.60, less cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU"") of $.1.06, left a mere $0.54 to cover other costs. Its EBITDA per user was -$1.60 after tallying up R&D and SG&A costs.The company currently relies on Google (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud for the majority of its computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services. According to its IPO prospectus, the company has committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next few years. It also built its ""software and computer systems to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by Google, some of which do not have an alternative in the market.""CEO Evan Spiegel recently intimated the company was looking to reduce the amount of bandwidth the service uses. However, with a commitment to spend $2 billion with Google over the next few years, how much can it really reduce costs? It may have behooved Snap to (1) have spent a few hundred million to build its own cloud services platform, which (2) could have drastically reduced it data usage costs. A company-owned cloud services network may have allowed Snap to benefit from scale.It may have also required Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, Lightspeed and Benchmark to have taken less of the IPO proceeds. They took over $1 billion of IPO proceeds that could have been plowed into a cloud network to potentially help the company develop a sustainable business model. At this juncture, it remains unclear if Snapchat is a real business or simply a neat idea.Investors who apparently love Snap's business prospects appear interested in speculating in the stock in the secondary market. There has been no talk of putting new money up, though. In May, Citron Research started coverage of SNAP with a $17 price target. The stock shot up in the mid-single-digits on the news. I assumed Citron's report was an attempt to change sentiment on SNAP or a dog whistle to Amazon (AMZN) or Google to make a play for the company.Last month, a MoffettNathanson analyst said SNAP is quickly running out of cash and may need a capital raise next year. The fact that Citron, Spiegel, Murphy, Benchmark or Lightspeed have not offered to invest new money to save the company appears telling. Maybe they do not believe in the long-term prospects of the business, or simply think the company's nearly $9 billion market capitalization is too rich.IPO proceeds helped Snap to grow its employees to 3,069 at year-end 2017 from 1,859 at year-end 2016. That represented over 1,200 new high-paying jobs created by Snap. However, a few months ago the company cut 7% of its workforce - mostly in the areas of engineering and sales. More layoffs could lie ahead amid consistent cash burn.A perpetually rising stock market helped Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy make over $270 million apiece on a neat idea. If Snap folds, then the 3,069 jobs it created could evaporate, yet Spiegel and Murphy will keep the $540 million from the IPO proceeds. The question remains, ""Is it good for the economy to put so much wealth in the hands of so few people?"" I doubt it.It appears time for Jerome Powell to end the Fed's unconventional economic policy. That sounds foreboding for financial markets and for SNAP. Sell SNAP."
4218260,104703,2018-11-05T12:04:19-05:00,"I published my first article on Seeking Alpha ~three months ago. Since then, Snap's stock has been cut in half. Lowering my price target from $8 to $7.50.I am no longer short Snap, but after two straight quarters of user loss, and guidance for a third, I can't help but wonder what Snap is now worth.I had been expecting the drop in overall usage to be a one-off event.  But now, it seems like growth is a one-off event, at least until the Android refresh.That being said, Snap is hard at work to bring back users while simultaneously increasing monetization.  If they are successful, Snap's stock is a bargain.Investors should neither long nor short the stock, with significant risk on both sides.","If you looked at Snap's stock over the last couple of days, you would have expected that based on the price action in the stock, Snap reported numbers that were far lower than Wall Street estimates. If you look at the one month chart alone, you understand how ugly the picture has become.Except, Snap reported relatively sold numbers, with only two key items missing Wall Street expectations. Here is a breakdown of Snap's Q3, and Q4 guidance:The only two places where Snap missed estimates were on the revenue guidance side, and on Q3 DAUs. It is important to also point out that Snap has guided for a sequential decline in their DAU totals in Q4, a fact that also played into Wall Street fears.With the DAU miss, the miss was <1%. And while DAUs did fall in North America, a place where Snapchat is not affected by a more hostile regulatory climate, the miss was slim if not negligible to say the least.On the revenue guidance miss, we have to look at the Q4 guidance miss retrospectively. Q2 was the first time that Snap provided revenue guidance, which came in for Q3. The guidance was for $277.5 million in revenue and EBITDA of -$172.5 million.(source: Snap Q2 Earnings Slides)The result was revenues 7% higher than the guidance, and an EBITDA loss $17.5 million less than guidance. To put it bluntly, since Tim Stone arrived at Snap, it seems like management has installed sandbagging tactics. Why should we expect anything different out of Q4?Here are my personal Q4 expectations for DAUs:Notice that the DAU estimate not only implies <1% deterioration in the user base, it also implies ~1% Y/Y decline in the user base, the first time that Snapchat's user base has ever declined Y/Y.Here are my monetization and revenue targets for Q4:This is higher than both Snap's Q4 guidance of $367.5 million, and the consensus estimate of $371.2 million by a wide margin. This will be primarily driven by growth in ARPU, with the loss of users being narrow.Here are my cost and profitability targets:I'm most focused on Snap's ability to crack down on cash burn. I'm expecting Snap's cash burn to decrease dramatically in Q4. And while I expect spending to ramp again in Q1 of 2019, I expect a Q4 decline of 23% in capital expenditures. Overall though, cash burn should improve quite a bit next quarter.(source: Snap IR)Previously, bulls like Citron Research have cited Snap's lock on teens as a reason to buy the stock, as teens with eventually drive purchasing trends, and will be the most coveted demographic in the internet advertising space. As such, Snap will gain market share in the massive ads market when these teens begin to generate their own income. This Piper Jaffray graphic was a key component to the bull thesis:(source: Citron Research)Snapchat was dominating the landscape amongst US teens, with Facebook beginning to fade into irrelevancy. And while Facebook is indeed beginning to fade into irrelevancy with teens, Snapchat has now barely leading Instagram in the teens category.(source: eMarketer)And with Snapchat continuing to lose users as Instagram's growth skyrockets, it is only a matter of time before Instagram pulls ahead of Snapchat and the reason for buying Snap Ads, having exposure to teens, will have a significant hole in it.In order to hit higher revenue numbers, profitability, and a turnaround in user growth, Snap is trying to make the Snapchat app more friendly to users that are older than 34 years old. While I expect Snapchat to lose some more younger users to competition from Instagram, the real negative catalysts for Snapchat moving forward could be its push for older users to join the platform. For a bit of history, when Facebook's platform first began to see older users hit the platform, its user numbers amongst teens and millennials began to decline. If teenage users begin to see older people infiltrate the platform, Snap's ""cool factor"" may begin to fade off, just like it did with Facebook. This is just assuming Snapchat begins marketing to older users. Once older users come onto the platform, Snapchat may encounter more redesigns to simplify the platform for these older users, which could draw away even more teenage users away from the product.It seems like Snap is attempting to age its key user demographic in order to hit higher ARPU levels and eventually get to profitability. The problem is, the Snap story is based around it being a growth stock. If Snap pushes for more mature users, all the sudden there is no real differentiating factor between it and Facebook, except for Facebook being better than Snapchat in general for advertisers.Snap should be investing its capital into R&D initiatives that would increase Snap's share with younger users, and keep them highly engaged with the platform. Instead, Snap is cutting costs and targeting better monetization on less users.(source: Snap IR)Forget about the ""my daughter and all her friends use Snapchat, so I'm long the stock"" argument that some bulls use with Snapchat. Instagram has become one of, if not the most relevant social media platform in existence today. And most of it has not come from original ingenuity, it has come from copying the successful features that Snap has pioneered. Such features include geofilters and the new hit product and advertising format Stories. Here is a chart comparing Snapchats user base against Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories:(source: BTIG)This chart does not include Snapchat's user decline reported in Q3, or the growth of the Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories in Q3.Instagram has now surpassed 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs), with many calling Instagram the next Facebook. And while there is some value in Snapchat's products to advertisers, they have made clear that Instagram will be the primary platform for advertiser targeting amongst millennials and teens. When advertisers look for a play on younger consumers, they are most likely going to target Instagram over Snapchat, as Instagram has better targeting, an extremely active user base, significant growth in that user base, and may be the most relevant platform in social media today.All of that comes at Snapchat's expense though. When Snapchat pours hundreds of millions of dollars per year into R&D, and create products that are hits with users, Instagram copies these features, and doesn't have to waste money on R&D for products they can simply copy. And because Snapchat didn't protect their intellectual property with patents, there is nothing holding Instagram back from doing so. With Stories as an example, some of the clones are more popular than the originals.Another reason that Instagram appears to be taking users from Snapchat is because some people are seeing their friends leave Snapchat, or at least spend less time on the app, leading these users to leave for Instagram. As people's friends begin to use Snapchat less, they will leave for Instagram, which could create a continuation of the current declining user trend.The bottom line is, Instagram continues to outperform Snapchat, and until Snapchat can create a defining moat around its platform and its users, Instagram will continue taking users away from Snapchat.While this narrative has died off significantly since Snap's stock crash, some optimists have called Snapchat the next Facebook, theorizing that any of Snapchat's troubles are similar to those of Facebook in the immediate time frame since its IPO. While this theory ran amok after its IPO, it has since cooled. But even then, some believe whole-heartedly that Snap at $6 is like Facebook at $20. I completely disagree.First of all, while Facebook did report slowing user growth, they never once reported a decline in the user base. Snapchat's user base has not only declined, but it has declined two quarters in a row, with the general expectation being that Snap's user base will decline again for a third straight quarter.Second of all, some like to point to Snapchat's redesign and Android problems being similar to Facebook problems getting their mobile platform to gain traction. With Facebook, the problem had a quick solution, only taking a couple quarters to fix. With Snapchat, the platform has changed a lot of its features back to its old self, but users still are not coming back. With Android, Snapchat has been working for many quarters now to refresh the Android version of the app, with struggles being abundant.And finally, Facebook seemed to begin recovery about four quarters into its history as a public company, with user growth and monetization both getting back on track. Snap is a year and a half in, and the narrative seems to deteriorate by the day.(source: Mashable)One mistake that CEO Evan Spiegel has admitted to, was Snap's reluctance to swiftly move into Android, focusing entirely on iOS for the first many years of Snapchat's existence. And when Snapchat was released to Android, the system was buggy and flawed many times, with easily noticeable problems that annoyed many Android users.But now that Snapchat's iOS leaning user base is beginning to slowly leave the app, Snapchat will rely on Android to bring back growth to its platform. It has been a grueling process, taking many quarters to fix a quite broken Android. And with employee turnover increasing as well as potential shareholder pressure, Snap will rely on an Android redo to offset the bleeding of its core iOS user base. Evan Spiegel said that Snap is aiming to decrease bandwidth consumption, a key factor that has made Snap such an intense and somewhat inefficient app on Android for so long.When Android inevitably rolls out though, Snap should see user growth tailwinds, specifically in Snap's ""rest-of-world"" (ROW) segment, where Android is the dominant mobile operating segment.The bottom line is, when a redesigned Android inevitably launches, Snap's DAU trajectory will grow, at least in the short-term, temporarily assuaging the concerns of analysts and short-sellers.A key issue that Snap is facing and will continue to face in the future has to do with ad inventory on the platform. Right now, Snap users spend 30 minutes per day on the app, but log into the app 25 times per day, meaning Snap users are spending 72 seconds per session on the Snap app. This suggests these users are in the chat section of the app. While Chat is sticky, Snap's ad inventory is in their Discover section, a section that many say is crowded with useless content that users don't consume. If this content is not being viewed, than advertiser views and ROI will come under pressure. This could exist as a future headwind for monetization.Snap has lost 5 million users since reaching its 191 million user peak in Q1. Despite that, Snap showed 43% Y/Y revenue growth in Q3, and ARPU growth of 37% Y/Y, versus Q2 Y/Y ARPU growth of 33%. ARPU growth actually accelerated in Q3, despite lower engagement rates and increased regulatory scrutiny on social media in Europe.(source: Snap Q3 Slides)Snap may evolve into a Twitter-esque story, where the growth of the company is not reliant on user growth, as much as monetization of the user base. As a matter of fact, a key reason Twitter's stock plunged a few quarters after its IPO, as user growth dramatically slowed to a snail's crawl. Twitter had then been dead money for a couple years, until they rejuvenated their growth with increased advertisement products and a data licensing side to the business model. Twitter's growth has since returned, with the stock having a phenomenal run moving from as low as $14 to as high as $47. But Twitter's user growth has not only stalled, but turned negative.This may end up being the story with Snap, growing revenue by increasing ARPU as the user base shrinks. This monetization was able to increase, even in the face of significant headwinds like user growth (or lack there of). Over the next few quarters, I believe Wall Street's opinion of Snap will shift from Snap's ability to stop user loss, to being able to accelerate ARPU growth. As Snap increases its ARPU, a drop in DAUs will not meaningfully affect its revenue growth trajectory.Snap continues to grow its ARPU at staggering rates, with a near triple in Q3 ARPU in the ROW segment, and a near double in Europe. Core North America grew at 20%, a strong acceleration from Q2's 12%.Snap is expanding its monetization runways, with advertisement offerings in Stories and in sponsored filters. Here is an example of a sponsored filter for a movie made a while back called ""Alien Covenant"":(source: AdEspresso)Both Facebook and Snap have invested aggressively to excite advertisers about Stories ad offerings, which has caused Facebook to disrupt their old Newsfeed based model in favor of a Stories advertising model, something that has caused Facebook's revenue growth to sag recently.Snap has also partnered with Amazon, creating a visual product search feature that allows Snap users to view a product with the Snap camera, and after it is scanned, the user has the option to link into Amazon and purchase that product.(source: TechCrunch)This could be just the beginning of Snap's progress into making eCommerce part of the company's future.While we don't know the exact financial details of this partnership, what we know about Snap and Amazon partnering is that Snap is making social commerce a priority in it's future, a move that will most likely boost monetization. The real question is, will this product be the next Stories for Snap, or the next Snapcash, a product that was known for being a flop? If Snapchatters are as active with the camera as Snap says, then maybe this commerce partnership has a chance at becoming something really strong for Snap.Finally, Snap is making a move into the original content space, bringing ""Snap Originals"" to Snapchat. CEO Evan Spiegel has said that he admires Netflix, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that Snap has brought original content to it's platform. This is a small portion of Snapchat's platform right now, and probably won't replace streaming services like Netflix, but then again, there is a chance that investments in original content will boost engagement on the Snapchat platform, and bring in more advertising dollars.First and foremost, Snap's CEO Evan Spiegel when asked about being sold to a larger company said that they were not going to sell, and would stay and independent company. That being said, there has been massive speculation that Snap would sell to larger companies, and soon.There is some logic behind this. As Snap continues to burn more cash and lose more users, while 40% of employees report they are ready to leave the company, management may want to sell Snap to someone larger than them. Snap has a lot of things going against it, and it is an extremely lucrative target. While Snapchat's user base is shrinking, to have almost 200 million daily users is an extremely strong number that many large companies would like. To be clear, buying Snap's stock just because it is a lucrative takeover target is foolish, but being a takeover target helps. Specifically, I believe Amazon has the highest probability of purchasing Snap.(source: AdWeek)First of all, Snap's current market capitalization is $8.8 billion. Assuming Amazon offers an arbitrary 25% takeover premium, they would be offering Snap $11 billion for the company, something that is more than doable for Amazon as they have ~$30 billion in total cash. And if Amazon was to buy Snap with stock, it would be a ~1% dilution on Amazon's shareholders, an almost negligible impact. In return however, Amazon could dramatically grow the reach of the advertising business beyond just consumer goods on Amazon with a platform that has a staggering 186 million users. The closest thing Amazon has to a social platform is Twitch, but Twitch seems to be more niche to gaming, at least right now. Purchasing Snap would allow Amazon to vastly expand its internet advertising business.While this is all speculation at this point, Snap has been an acquisition target in the past, with both Facebook and Google making bids in the past few years. Snap however, has never accepted any of these bids, and as I said earlier Evan Spiegel reaffirmed that he has no intent on selling Snap.Amazon has also made large acquisitions in the past, so a Snap acquisition wouldn't be out of the ordinary for Amazon. As I mentioned above, Amazon has a partnership with Snap for visual product search within Snapchat. In addition, a couple of executives have left Amazon and gone to Snap, most notably Snap's CFO Tim Stone, a former finance VP at Amazon. He was noted for the integration of Whole Foods into Amazon, a massive M&A deal that truly branched out Amazon's operations into the brick-and-mortar business. And now, he and a couple other Amazon executives are at Amazon.The bottom line is, there is a good chance Amazon buys Snap.I myself am extremely skeptical of Snap, and was short Snap's stock for many months using put options and made a solid return on this puts. But at this valuation, I have since exited my short position, and am reassessing the stock at its current levels. But there are many others that are heavily short Snap, with short sellers making up 25.3% of the total float and five days to cover. If Snap reports a turnaround in user growth, or even less user bleed then expected, the Snap shares could take off, forcing a lot of this 25.3% to cover out of their short positions. Even worse, if indeed a takeover bid comes in, a massive majority of these short-sellers will be forced to buy the stock providing support. If Snap reports a quarter like Q4 of last year, then we could expect a similar reaction, similarly exacerbated by the sheer scale of the short selling community.SNAP data by YChartsBasically, having a massive amount of short sellers in Snap could truly exaggerate any positive fundamental surprise that Snap delivers, a massive plus for the stock.To value Snap, I'm using a discounted cash flow model that goes out ten years to FY2028. Here are my business estimates for Snap going out to 2028.I'm using a WACC of 13%, the same WACC that Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju uses for valuing Snap, and a terminal growth rate of 3%.Snap's stock has fallen dramatically since my last article on the company, being cut in half. Risks remain present with the Snap business model, but the valuation is looking compelling. And while I'm not presently long or short the stock, a further beating, especially below $6 warrants a buying opportunity. If the stock has a massive surge like that in February, I may open a new short position in the stock. Right now I'm on the sidelines, waiting patiently for drastic volatility that will eventually either tank the stock or bring the stock much higher."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to the SA PRO archive. Click here to find out more »Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has been sinking of late. The ship is indeed on fire. DAUs are on the decline, and while the unit metrics such as ARPU and Cost PU are going in the right direction, the company still burnt $160 million this quarter (slide 6 of the company presentation). And if at “peak DAU” (191 million in Q1-2018 as shown on slide 9), SNAP still burns cash, then it is just not sustainable, or it will take a while to fix this broken business model; assuming more ARPU juice likely implies more advertisement, the 15-25 year olds that make its core user base will flee (similar to what happened with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)). So, while “fixing the business model” is a possibility, SNAP has only 9 quarters to do so, because at the rate of $160 million cash burn per quarter, it will be insolvent before December 2020. SNAP is soon running out of time. Shorting SNAP seems very sensible at this stage.While this situation calls for a short, short-sellers beware... too much blood in the water and many sharks appear and fight for the prey. Now, let's look at how much each DAU brings in gross margin before fixed costs. That figure is indeed positive, and had real value. As per its 10-Q, revenues and cost of revenues were respectively $297.7 million and $197.6 million for Q3 2018. If we divide by 186 million users/DAUs, this implies $1.6 and $1.06 per DAU for the period. This is 54c of gross margin per DAU. This 54c (and growing) of GM per user should be very appealing to many potential buyers. Therefore, a fight for a strategic asset may ensue and your short gets “TSLA squeezed” by buyout news (with real financing secured this time). So the question is: 1) who could buy out SNAP, and 2) at what price? Based on that target price, you can short comfortably and cover when you get closer to the target buyout price. We therefore need to (attempt to) define that cover price…Let’s assume that a suitor for SNAP would be able to swallow R&D and SG&A completely (let’s be as aggressive as possible to allow enough cushion for our cover price). That leaves the 186 million users generating the 54c of GM per user, i.e., $100 million, and that is the cash flow today of SNAP for a buyer. Now, this has been increasing significantly as in Q3-17 it was $0. Let’s assume therefore that the current $1.6 ARPU can increase to $1.8 while the Cost PU declines to $1 (it is easier to increase price than cut costs I guess). That leaves 80c per user. Multiply by 186 million (we assume again aggressively they can maintain the user base stable going forward) that’s $150 million of GM or normative income (and we’re large). Now multiply this by the relevant income multiple to get to your buyout value. That multiple differs based on who looks at it though…Well, FB proposed $3 billion in 2013, but it was refused by Evan Spiegel. He did well (at the time) as SNAP IPOed at $24 billion 4 years later and peaked at $31 billion. And now it’s worth $8 billion. So Spiegel would probably file for bankruptcy rather than concede victory and sell on the cheap to his arch rival. Moreover, FB doesn’t really need SNAP anymore given Instagram/WhatsApp/Facebook Messenger corner the user base already pretty well; and probably they would face anti-trust concerns – although, in social media, it would likely be a first, but Mark Zuckerberg may want to avoid more publicity and avoid dealing with the government if he can, his time in Congress earlier this year is probably not part of his best memories…Now Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Could be a good fit operationally as SNAP and TWTR user bases are quite different (SNAP = teenagers, TWTR = grown-up such as… um... Donald Trump, you see it’s a very very different base indeed!). TWTR trades at 24x PE, therefore applying it to the 150 million normative income = $3.6 billion. Let’s round it to $4 billion, this is a 50% downside on the current $8 billion valuation for SNAP. Cover price in that case is $4 per share. But wait…Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also an obvious candidate. However, they just shut down Google+. Now, not sure this meant they just want out of social media completely or if they just capitulated and reckoned that their own-bred platform was just not great at all and they called it a day. Therefore, buying out a successful venture (at the right price) may make sense for them. GOOGL trades at 47x PE. Therefore, valuing our $150 million at 47x = $7.1 billion. This is a 12% discount to the current valuation. Cover price = $5.6.You also have Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (and others). But while MSFT acquired LinkedIn, if they did have an interest in SNAP, their 44x PE values our $150 million at $6.6 billion, below the higher threshold of GOOG. Meanwhile, I think AMZN has just other stuff to do really and they're focused on the cloud, video and B&M retail these days.While this list of potential suitors is far from being exhaustive, this gives a little idea of who could pay what for the SNAP user base when it comes up for sale (as it is indeed more WHEN than IF at that stage, especially if a recession hits and ARPU falls in line with the decreasing advertising budgets). It looks like the best buyer (from maximization of value perspective for SNAP) is GOOGL which could pay up to $7.1 billion on the crude assumptions we made. That results in a share price of $5.6. As is often the case in a short trade, there is always a risk that some crazy platform may come and overpay for the user base (Chinese buyer with too much cash?). I believe that we have set up a comfortable cushion by 1) setting up the limit at $150 million of cash flow vs. $100 million today, 2) assuming full absorption of costs below GM, and 3) applying a full 44x multiple on it. Therefore, I am short SNAP until it reaches $5.6, at which point I will cover or offer my shares to GOOGL!"
4230312,103511,2018-12-27T04:14:26-05:00,"Snapchat's daily active users continue to decline as Facebook and Instagram seemingly have integrated the ""Stories"" feature effectively into their platforms.On the plus side, Snap has posted significantly improving financials with guided-for further improvements and a goal of profitability in 2019.However, even if the company continues to increase user monetization and stems losses, it seems to be fighting a losing battle due to weakness in its user base.The company's many attempts to restructure its platform have not changed the app's actual functionality or draw significantly, as the downward trend in DAU has shown.Even if Snap attains profitability some day, it is hard to imagine it as an over $6 billion company.","Snap's (SNAP) recent decline seems a justified forewarning, as the company has continued to struggle to differentiate itself from major competitors and consequently experienced major user growth and activity troubles.Snap is increasing its user monetization and enterprise-wide financials. However, unless it does so at an extraordinarily rapid rate, it seems hard to imagine the company achieving its hoped-for profitability in 2019, let alone justify its current valuation, as it will be reduced to a small, niche user market with monetization rates far below that of other Internet and social media service companies.Snap stock price has recently declined significantly as the broader equity markets have begun sinking since October. But the bulk of the decline came over the course of the summer, while domestic equity markets were still hot, as the company began posting user growth stagnation and decline. The stock now is down about 65% for the year.SNAP data by YChartsQ1 2018 was Snapchat's peak in terms of user growth, as it posted a historic high of 191 million daily active users. However, Q2 2018 saw DAU drop to 188 million with decreases in every reported region. The recent Q3 2018 report saw continued decline in this metric, as total DAU sank to 186 million, the North America and Europe regions saw further decreases, and ""Rest of World"" saw stagnation.(Source: Statista)(Source: Q3 2018 Snapchat Earnings Press Release)On the bright side, the company seems to have been able to increase revenues and average revenue per user quite significantly. Its losses have been stemmed too, to a milder but still significant degree. Nonetheless, despite that relative improvement compared to past quarters, Snap still lost $1.064 billion YTD on revenue of just $790 million.(Source: Q3 2018 Snapchat Earnings Press Release)Essentially, Snap faces the combination of slightly improving monetization and financials with a stagnant and declining user base. Because of this I believe the company remains a poor investment proposition in the long run because it simply has not been able to find, and likely can't, a distinctive niche that allows it to be a serious competitor to rival platforms.The fact is that the entire service Snapchat offers is essentially just another feature on Facebook (FB) and Instagram. Though, Facebook and Instagram benefit from being connected to a far larger ecosystem of services and activities that undoubtedly has been a big hurdle to Snapchat's attempted growth.In looking over Snapchat's recently touted Q3 2018 community engagement achievements, which range from some original content programming to some features that include shopping, it doesn't seem like these have been able to stem the tide of declining user activity nor distinguish the platform enough. That remains the heart of the company's problem at the moment.Snapchat's core service is inherently an ephemeral activity rather than building a profile or network as with standard social media. Indeed, the company itself has said it is not social media, and studies and polls have shown Snapchat users hesitate to engage in serious concentrated activity on the platform, avoiding celebrities or in-depth activities, beyond the momentary ""Snaps"" the platform is seemingly about. These very low-engagement activities have proven difficult to monetize, and given all the ways and how hard the company has tried over the years, this likely will not see much improvement.One hope for user activity is that Snapchat appears to be extremely popular among teenagers in the United States. Though that does not necessarily secure its future in and of itself, as teenagers do not seem to be a high-money target market and may well age out of the platform once they do become more revenue-heavy users.The company has quite positive Q4 2018 guidance with between $355 million and $380 million in revenue and an expected EBITDA loss of only between $75 million and $100 million, all major year-on-year improvements. However, unless Snap not only finds a way to reverse its declining user base but actually grow, it seems unlikely to find long-term sustainability.As I've explained, I think that is a relatively impossible task due to how major other social media behemoths have essentially tailored in so well the company's core product into their own systems in ways that make them much more attractive, putting a major blockade on Snapchat's growth. Even Instagram's ""Stories"" feature, not counting Facebook's own ""Stories"" feature, sees double the daily use as the entirety of Snapchat back during Snapchat's prime earlier this year.Therefore, Snap, currently at about $6.7 billion in market capitalization, seems grossly overvalued for a company that may barely squeeze out some profits next year. If current growth trends continue on their most optimistic trajectory and the company, for example, achieves around $1.5 in revenue in 2019 and maybe $50-100 million in earnings, then based on 1.291 billion shares outstanding, that would mean EPS of $0.04-0.08.Based on Snap's current stock price of $5.42, that's a P/E ratio of between 67 and 135. While many high-growth social media companies can justify such a P/E ratio, Snap has been around since 2011 and does not seem likely to experience high growth based on the aforementioned user activity and competitor problems. If the company were to have a more normal mature Internet services P/E ratio of about 30, that means a stock price of between $1.2 to $2.4 a share.I am not totally sure it will hit those deep levels, as there will likely still be many Snapchat believers giving the stock a premium, but I still believe that means even if the company does go profitable next year, its total earnings haul may be either restrained or still take years to appreciate into its price. All that assumes it finds some still-unlikely way to compete against bigger competitors and reverse its user activity decline.I believe that Snap's improving financials are a major positive development for the company. But it doesn't solve the company's fundamental long-term issue of stagnant user activity growth or even inertia, as larger platforms like Facebook and Instagram have built essentially their own ""Snapchat"" into their social media services.The company may still keep on treading along, appealing to a niche market and perhaps increasing user monetization to a moderate degree, and may eventually even attain profitability. However, as I've explained, even under the best of circumstances, the company may still struggle to justify its current price from an earnings standpoint."
4212772,22445,2018-10-19T12:53:15-04:00,"Snap has almost reached my price target of $6.40 a share, as I write back in May.However the fundamentals of the business continue to deteriorate, and now user growth is the biggest problem the company faces.My new price target is now $5.48 per share.","On my last article on Snap (SNAP) back in May (please consider: Snap: New Price Target Of $6.40 Per Share), I had lowered my price target for SNAP shares to $6.40 a share, after my previous $7.40 price target back in August of 2017. Yes the market has been in a tailspin for several weeks now, however please note Snap shares have been on a downward trend even longer. In any case, the question is, now that Snap shares have reached my price target, are they worth buying?First of all let's start by comparing Snap to Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) on a revenue basis. As a reminder, when a company is not profitable, I use the Price/Sales ratio on a comparative basis to try to come to some conclusion.SNAP PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe above chart is the forward Price/Sale ratio. As you can see from the chart above, for the very first time Snap is trading at a similar PS ratio as FB and TWTR. Or in other words, for the very first time its valuation has come down to planet Earth.However this is not the only metric I look at. In the case of Snap, there are many other things to consider when trying to come to some valuation conclusion.sourceAs was the case with Facebook and Twitter in the past, another valuation metric was user growth. And as the recent data from the company's Q2'18 results shows (link below the chart), user engagement growth was negative Q/Q. And while many will say this is because of the redesign of Snap's app, I beg to differ. Snap's user growth has been shrinking ever since the company went public, it's not a new issue. The market has been aware for a very long time now that user growth is diminishing. What I think shocked many investors recently is negative growth. And to be honest, even I didn't expect it would happen so soon.So if we see negative user growth in the upcoming quarter once again then we probably have to come to the conclusion that the user growth for Snap's platform has reached its limit for the time being. And the problem with stagnant user growth is, that there is a limit to your revenue growth in the absence of user growth. Simply because, there is a limit to how much money you could squeeze from your users.So if one compares the valuation of Facebook to Snap on a Price/Sales ratio and profitability basis, you will come to the conclusion that Snap is a much more expensive stock than Facebook. And if investors decide to be in the social space, is there no reason that I can see to buy Snap vs Facebook.When looking at analyst estimates, the current consensus calls for Snap's revenue to be about $1.15B for 2018, and $1.56B for 2019, growing by 40% and 35% respectively. However please note that back in May analysts were estimating 2018 revenue to come in at $1.33B, so estimates have come.Also note that back in August of 2017, 2018 revenue estimates were even higher at $1.86B. So in other words estimates have come down a lot, and I would not be surprised if revenue estimates come down once again. However today I am feeling generous, so I will take analysts at face value and take into consideration that Snap's revenue will grow by 35% in 2019. In theory I am be willing to pay 1X revenue for each 10% of growth. In the case of Snap, that would be 3.5X revenue plus cash on hand. This of course would be for a profitable company which Snap is not, but like I said today I am feeling generous. So assuming Snap does $1.56B in revenue for 2019, I would be willing to pay $5.46B (3X 2019 revenue of $1.56B) plus cash and equivalents of $1.57B, or for a grand total of $7B. And if we do the math and divide by the total number of shares (1.277 billion), then the fair value for Snap shares might be around $5.48 per share.Please note I am not taking into account that:Because if I start adding haircuts for each of the above issues, then the fair value figure (according to my book), will come down substantially.Snap was a bubble stock ever since its IPO (please consider: Snap: A Bubble Is Born). I never understood why investors were willing to pay the multiples they paid back then. Nevertheless I have been right all along in saying its stock price will be in the single digits soon, primarily on valuation concerns (all my Snap articles here).Today however one has to consider that Snap's user growth might have plateaued, and revenue growth might stagnate in the next several quarters also.And if both are confirmed, not only will investors who bought the stock at much higher levels never see their money again, but I am also afraid that the stock will go much lower even than the figure I came up with in this article (which as I said is generous)."
4213746,104783,2018-10-24T08:29:15-04:00,"Snapchat is expected to release earnings results for the fiscal Q3 on the 25th October.Snapchat's share price has been extremely volatile on and beyond the last three earnings dates, which might keep investors at bay from executing trading strategies.A long straddle is the ideal options strategy to exploit volatility surrounding Snapchat earnings. This enables investors to profit from Snapchat while risking a pre-determined investment amount.","Throughout the recent past, earnings results have had a major short term impact on share prices of not all but many stocks and the trend is continuing this season as well. For an example, Netflix shares rose more than 15% after its Q3 results were issued.Snapchat (NASDAQ:SNAP) is expected to release earnings results for the fiscal Q3 on the 25th of October, after the market close. Going by historical numbers, a price movement of significant magnitude could follow earnings. Investors should be keen to participate in such a trading opportunity but many traders/investors opt out of engaging in these kinds of opportunities in the belief that a quantifiable trading strategy cannot be formed based on earnings results.If history is to be trusted, predicting the price movement of a stock upon the release of earnings results would be nearly impossible. Although a thorough understanding of a company might provide an analyst with an edge to beat the market, there is always a surprise element that is attached to the earnings call in which the management discusses future outlook of a company. On the contrary, the focus should be set on executing a long straddle using options which enables investors to participate in uncapped growth while limiting the downside potential to a known amount. An initial screening should be conducted to figure out whether a company has been known to exhibit high volatility after reporting earnings figures. Snapchat possesses all the prerequisites to execute a long straddle.Snapchat surpassed analysts’ expectations in the last three instances in which they reported quarterly earnings figures, but the stock price movements that followed earnings were not necessarily in line with reported earnings. This is understandable as investors pay close attention to earnings estimates provided by the company management. More often than not, stock price movements that follow earnings results are fueled by earnings guidelines for the upcoming quarter rather than reported earnings for the past period.SNAP – Quarterly earnings reporting historyBased on above data, I have compiled the below summary that depicts the price movement of SNAP within the first two trading days upon the issuance of quarterly financial results.The above table illustrates how SNAP has traded with significant volatility upon the issuance of earnings results in the last three instances. While this volatility might be keeping many investors at bay, this presents a formidable opportunity for other investors who are on the lookout for volatility spiking events to execute long straddles.Since SNAP would be releasing their financial results after the market close on 25th, a call option and a put option on SNAP should be bought on the 25th October. In order to exploit this opportunity, investors should chose an option that is trading at the money.SNAP option chain(Source – NASDAQ)In a hypothetical scenario in which SNAP closes at $7 on the 25th, investors should chose the circled options chain in red.The next step of this analysis is to project profit or loss of this trading strategy at several price points up and down the hypothetical share market price on the 25th.For calculation purposes, option prices are held constant at the current rates even though it would be slightly different on the 25th.DisclosuresInvestors should have a general understanding of options to execute this strategy. Theta, the time value decay of options would be detrimental to this trading strategy since the strategy involves buying options in the expectation that either one of these options would appreciate in value. Put options will appreciate in value if SNAP plummets after the earnings results release and call options will appreciate in value if SNAP rises sharply after the earnings release.In addition, investors should be aware that the breakeven point of this strategy is high since the share price fall or rise should compensate for option premiums paid for both put and call options to breakeven.Furthermore, if SNAP remains in level with the strike price of options after the earnings results are released, investors would most probably lose bulk of their investments. Therefore, one should only invest an amount he or she would be comfortable with. Having said that, empirical evidence indicate that share price of Snapchat would indeed be volatile when earnings results are released.Corporate earnings are a major driver of stock prices but in most instances, analysts and investors alike fail to utilize the volatility that surrounds earnings dates in a meaningful way. One possible reason for this is the general assumption that volatility will hurt investment portfolios. On the contrary, there are investment strategies an investor could execute to play volatility and profit from the same. A long straddle is one such strategy involving options that enable investors to exploit volatility by risking a pre-determined investment amount. Despite inherent risks attached with options, a long straddle is one of the safest options trading strategies if executed properly by identifying events that would lead to high volatile times in the share market price of a listed company.Snapchat ticks every box and presents a quantifiable trading opportunity for any investor who is familiar with trading options and is willing to risk a pre-determined amount to achieve a healthy return within a very short time period."
4214675,24849,2018-10-25T19:49:50-04:00,User base declines for second straight quarter.Headline beats overshadowed by mixed guidance.Balance sheet still getting worse.,"After the bell on Thursday, shares of camera company Snap (SNAP) initially jumped when the company reported top and bottom line beats with its Q3 results. Unfortunately, as the quarter was further digested, shares took a tumble as seen in the chart below, just as they did after the Q2 report, falling to a new post-IPO low. While some progress was made during Q3, things aren't where they need to be just yet.(Source: cnbc.com)Revenues of $297.7 million smashed street estimates for $283.2 million, although I should note that weak guidance a few months ago sent street expectations down about $7 million between reports. The non-GAAP loss of $0.12 per share also beat estimates by two cents, as the company narrowed its net loss and negative Adjusted EBITDA figure.This time around, guidance was a bit better, although the midpoint of the company's forecast for revenues of $355 million to $380 million was still below the street midpoint of $371 million. The good news is the negative Adjusted EBITDA number is also expected to improve, but Q4 is the company's highest revenue quarter of the year. We'll see what happens in Q1 2019 when the top line falls due to seasonality.Unfortunately, the biggest problem here is that the company cannot get its user base growing. As you can see in the graphic below, this was the second straight quarter where daily active users declined. For a company with less than 200 million users, there should be plenty of growth, as a name like Facebook (FB) has no problem growing with more than 2.2 billion users.(Source: Snap Q3 investor slides)Snap will only be facing even higher base numbers for the next couple of quarters, so unless things improve, we may see a decline in the year over year user base number very soon. The big problem here is if users are declining, what are advertisers to do? I know that many have criticized Facebook over privacy and other concerns, but it still is the best place for advertisers to be.While Snap did improve its bottom line and other financial metrics a bit, the company again burned through a bit of cash, this time $159 million. Cash and marketable securities finished the period at just over $1.41 billion, compared to just under $2.30 billion a year earlier. Large cash burn was one of my biggest concerns when the company went public, and those who have followed my recommendations on this name have done quite well. The number of shares outstanding has also risen by 9.4% in the last five quarters.Currently in the after-hours session, Snap shares are trading at $6.40, which is below the lowest point they've ever traded at during market hours. I warned that hitting single digits was only the beginning, and things have deteriorated quite a bit since. At this point, outside of some other company or firm thinking a buyout makes sense, I don't see why shares should rise until this company can not only get its user base growing again, but do so without burning tons of cash that will require a massive capital infusion. If you want to be in this space on the long side, Facebook remains my preference at this point, because the social media giant offers more short term growth potential at a reasonable valuation and has a rock solid balance sheet.Author’s additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.

4215462,102870,2018-10-29T12:44:38-04:00,"Snap just can't get a break.Despite delivering a largely positive earnings report, Snap's shares got pummeled Friday, to the tune of nearly 20% intraday.The relentless selling has brought the stock down by about 80% since Snap's post-IPO high, and the company is trading at just 5 time sales now.Also, Snap's profitability is improving, the company is burning through less cash, revenues and EPS both surpassed estimates, and the company could return to DAU growth next quarter.The worst may be behind Snap, and the risk reward dynamic seems to be skewed to the upside now.","Source: fool.comSnap’s (SNAP) shares continued to get pummeled last week following the company's “mixed” earnings report. Snap beat both top and bottom line estimates, while daily active users DAUs declined QoQ as expected. Revenue per user RPU also came in higher than expected and the company guided as projected on revenues, but that did not prevent the stock from trading to new all-time lows.Snap - Since IPOSource: StockCharts.comSnap dropped to as low as $5.77 on heavy volume Friday. The stock cratered by nearly 20% intraday, before reversing sharply, but still closed 10% lower on the session. Snap is now down by roughly 80% since a post-IPO high of nearly $30.The good news is that the worst may be behind Snap. The company is continuously improving its profitability, reporting better than expected earnings, burning through less cash, and may see a rebound in DAU growth next quarter. Therefore, the stock may finally find a bottom at or around this level.For the most part, Snap’s earnings were quite positive. The company’s revenues expanded much faster than anticipated, the company beat on EPS, is seeing higher RPU, and is burning much less cash. In other words, Snap’s profitability is improving substantially, and more rapidly than anticipated by the analyst community.You certainly would not tell this by the price action, but Snap has now beat its last four quarters on EPS delivery by an average of about 18% per quarter. This indicates that the company is improving its profitability much faster than anticipated and is likely to continue to surprise higher going forward. The one sore spot is the second sequential drop in DAUs. Since Q1 Snap has lost about 5 million or roughly about 2.6% of its daily users. This is not an encouraging development, yet the decline was as expected this quarter, and the phenomenon may be transient in nature. Just because Snap’s users have declined marginally over two quarters does not mean this is the beginning of a lasting trend or the demise of Snap.Snap's Daily Active UsersSource: Statista.comSnap has faced redesign issues as well as problems due to new EU social media regulations and other factors. However, none of this implies that Snap’s user base will continue to decline long term. In fact, I believe the trend is temporary, and user growth may return as early as next quarter. In the meantime, Snap’s shares have been beaten down to incredibly low levels.Snap is a relatively new company, and it's still in the very early stages of its growth, development, and monetization cycle. Therefore, the company cannot be valued on an earnings basis. However, we can get a sense for the company’s value if we look at Snap’s valuation relative to its revenues and revenue growth rate.Snap is currently trading at roughly 5 times 2019 projected revenues, and the company’s revenue growth rate is expected to be 34% next year. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), a much more mature social networking company is trading at over seven times next year’s sales, and has an expected revenue growth rate of just 13% next year. Even Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), essentially the “value stock” of social networking names, is currently trading at over six times forward earnings.Another factor to consider is that Snap is still in the very early stages of its monetization process. The company is growing RPU rapidly, as this quarter’s $1.60 figure came in 37% higher than one year ago. Yet, this is still relatively low, and Snap should grow these figures substantially going forward. For instance Twitter’s RPU is about $7.80 this year, and Facebook’s is about $6 worldwide, almost $9 in Europe, and a staggering $26 in the U.S. and Canada.Incidentally, the vast majority of Snap’s users are in the U.S., Canada, and in the EU, the most profitable regions for social networking advertisers. So, the company’s RPU has a lot of room to expand going forward, and the company could see substantial revenue and earnings increases despite a temporary slowdown in overall user growth.One of the primary reasons why Snap seems undervalued here is its incredible popularity amongst teens, and young people in general. In fact, Snap is the most popular social networking platform among young people in the U.S., beating out both Facebook and Instagram.Statistics indicate that 46% of U.S. teenagers prefer Snap as their social networking platform of choice, vs just 6% for Twitter and Facebook, and 32% for Instagram.Social Network Preference Amongst Teens in the U.S.Source: Statista.comSnap’s young user base can be viewed as the early adopters of the platform and could become loyal lifetime users of Snap’s platform. As more young people come on line Snap’s user base is likely to grow substantially over the years rather than decline. This market dynamic alone is suggesting that Snap may be undervalued right now.Snap currently has 20% of its float sold short, which is quite high. This indicates that despite the 80% decline many market participants still expect to make money on the short side. However, market participants may be overly bearish on Snap, and any relatively positive developments could cause shares to rise substantially from current levels. This move could be exacerbated by the need to cover a significant amount of short positions. Moreover, the short squeeze could turn epic if a takeover bid comes in.There are a lot of tech companies with an enormous amount of cash on their books. Moreover, many tech titans including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and others could use a growth injection. If Snap can demonstrate that it can begin to produce DAU growth again, the company may become a coveted takeover target for anyone interested in entering the social networking space.Source: TechCrunch.com - A Google takeover is strictly speculation on my part, but one can't ignore the lack of success Google has endured in social networking thus far. A mega cap company could easily offer a bid of around $15 billion to take Snap over, which would instantly provide the enterprise with a foothold in the lucrative social networking space. Despite the lackluster growth of recent quarters Snap has a huge number of active users, almost 200 million. Additionally, Snap has some of the most engaging users in the industry, a dynamic that potentially equates to an enormous amount of ad revenue. A $15 billion bid represents almost a 100% premium to Snap’s current market value.I have never owned Snap because I mostly viewed the company as an unpredictable, wildly overvalued IPO. However, an 80% decline, substantial improvements in profitability, as well as other factors are starting to suggest that there's some value in Snap after all.Profitability is improving faster than expected, revenue growth is very robust, cash flow is getting better, and Snap is now trading at just 5 times next year’s sales. Additionally, Snap has about 20% of its float sold short, which creates the potential for a substantial short squeeze going forward. Also, the company could become an attractive takeover target in the near future, especially if Snap can demonstrate that it can return to user growth.Post-IPO when the company was trading at 30 times sales and was valued at almost $35 billion, risk reward was clearly skewed to the downside. However, now that the company is worth $8 billion, and is trading at 5 times sales, the risk reward dynamic has shifted. Snap could surprise market participants going forward, and the stock is likely to be trading much higher one year from now.Thank you for taking the time to read my article.

4213083,31441,2018-10-22T08:01:41-04:00,SNAP reports Q3 earnings Thursday.I expect stagnant growth in DAUs and more cash burn.Sell SNAP.,"Rihanna. Source: Spilled NewsSnapchat (SNAP) reports Q3 earnings Thursday. Analysts expect revenue of $283.52 and EPS of -$0.14. The revenue estimate implies 22% growth Y/Y and a 3% decline sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items.Snapchat's 188 million daily active users (""DAUs"") imply the company definitely has something the public wants. The questions remain, ""Can it go from developing a cool app to creating a sustainable business model?"" Snapchat's CEO Evan Spiegel tried to answer that question several months ago when he revamped the site to separate (1) photos and videos generated by friends from (2) content from publishers and influencers. The goal was to unlock additional growth.In March, Snapchat ran an incendiary ad that made reference to pop star Rihanna. She took to Facebook's (FB) Instagram to complain about the ad and voice her grievances with Snapchat. It created a public relations nightmare for the company, and SNAP's market capitalization has fallen by over $12 billion since. That may have been the first sign the site revamp - meant to amplify engagement and goose growth - may have gone awry.The second sign may have been reflected in Q2 2018 DAUs. They grew 9% Y/Y, but fell 2% sequentially due to lower frequency of use among Snapchat's user base. In a leaked memo earlier this month, Spiegel admitted the company rushed the redesign, and may not have given itself enough time to test it. If the company experiences a sequential decline in DAUs again this quarter it could be difficult to regain traction, and the stock could tumble.Since going public in early 2017, Snapchat has grown its revenue and hemorrhaged cash. One would have thought that as the company gained critical mass it would have been able to stop burning cash. That has not been the case.The company's average revenue per user (""ARPU"") less of cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU) was $0.38 in Q2 2018 - hardly enough to cover R&D and SG&A expense. Its revenue base simply cannot support its cost structure.In Q2 2018, the company's cash flow from operations were -$199 million, a slight improvement from -$210 million a year earlier. Over the past 12 months, cash flow from operations was -$569 million. Given cash and securities of nearly $1.6 billion Snapchat cannot continue to burn cash at its current pace. A MoffettNathanson analyst said SNAP is quickly running out of cash and may need a capital raise next year. I anticipate more cash burn in Q3 and potentially a promise by Spiegel to cut costs. Will the market believe him?SNAP has an equity market capitalization of $8.6 billion and trades at over 8x run-rate revenue (Q2 2018 revenue annualized). SNAP is worth nearly $9 billion because that is the value someone assigned to it. Some speculate whether Amazon (AMZN) could acquire Snapchat - such speculation may be propping up the stock. Why would Amazon acquire Snapchat at nearly $9 billion if it could get it much cheaper in the future? SNAP is down over 50% Y/Y. Amid cash burn, stagnant DAU growth and competition from Instagram and WhatsApp the stock could fall further.Over the next few weeks, investors will likely begin to strongly estimate Snapchat's intrinsic value. I believe that intrinsic value is much less than SNAP's current share price. Sell SNAP."
4225253,103073,2018-11-28T20:31:25-05:00,"A year later and Snap has burned through almost $1 billion in cash, and the cash burn rate continues to be upwards of $100 million per quarter.Snapchat's DAU is slowing, but if the company manages to monetize its existing user base, that shouldn't matter too much.In fact, for comparison purposes, if Snap manages to get average revenue per user of $6.18 (Facebook's average revenue per user), it could be worth roughly double the current share price.However, a closer inspection reveals this to be highly unrealistic. Snapchat is behind on multiple scorecards and is unlikely to come out on top.It remains debatable whether Snap is a convincing short (always wary of shorting tech unicorns), but I definitely can't realistically rationalize a long position.","Snap (SNAP) has burned through close to $1 billion in the past 12 months. While there’s $1.4 billion left, at this pace, liquidity will run thin within a year or so. Still, Snap continues to improve its average revenue per user (ARPU) and has the potential to really hit it out of the park, if Facebook (FB) is a meaningful benchmark. Unfortunately, there’s plenty of reason to doubt this, so Snap continues to be a Hold.I have considered Snapchat as Facebook's R&D lab ever since it was apparent how incredibly successful (in terms of user growth) the company’s app was and how much potential it has. Right after Snap IPO’d, the company never interested me. There was nothing proprietary about its most successful product (Snapchat Stories), Facebook was openly copying Stories and, most importantly, Facebook was having a lot of success doing so.Additionally, the openness with which Facebook did so was concerning to me. I interpreted it as Facebook being extremely confident that it could copy Stories without any legal ramifications. As is evident by the lack of lawsuits, that assessment was correct. Now, a year after the IPO, the company’s problems are beginning to mount. User growth is slowing (now 5% YoY); in fact, users (in terms of DAU) on the platform declined by 1% this quarter.(Source: Snap Inc. 2018 Q3 Results - Earnings Call Slides, Seeking Alpha)At the time of the IPO, I noticed that, from a bullish point of view, while Snap was burning through millions of cash and had a bad business model, it still had plenty of cash. Additionally, since the company managed to IPO for close to $40 billion, I wasn’t convinced that the market would agree with my bearish thesis, which was essentially that Facebook would outcompete Snap by outspending it. In other words, I decided to just stick to the sidelines on this one, as I saw no forcing catalyst on the horizon.So, what’s changed? Well, the best way to explain my current interest in Snap is: A year later, a billion later. Snap has burned through almost a billion dollars ($884 million) in the last 12 months and has $1.4 billion left. This seems like plenty of liquidity, except when we consider its cash burn rate of roughly $150-250 million per quarter.Of course, the company can scale down its operations, but that’s pretty much admitting that the growth outlook is gone, which is essentially the only reason the shares are receiving a premium. The shares still trade at a heavy premium, even after dropping to around $6 from the nearly $30 IPO. Some simple metrics like a P/S of 7x and a negative net income will illustrate that. Furthermore, Snap’s leadership continues to be unimpressive. Especially if you consider that the current leadership was not the source of Snapchat’s most successful feature.Reggie Brown invented Snapchat, at least according to multiple reports. The idea of disappearing photos, which is what made Snapchat so popular in the first place, was allegedly Reggie’s idea. Especially in the early days, what would Snapchat be if it didn’t feature disappearing photos? The answer is a photo messaging app. If that’s all it was, then it would have competed with WhatsApp and even Facebook Messenger, which is quite frankly impossible as a start-up with one founder that can code, one who admittedly doesn’t do a whole lot (Reggie) and one who works on design.So, as a photo messaging app, Snapchat would have never gotten off the ground. The fact that Reggie was paid $158 million in a settlement deal might serve to corroborate Reggie’s allegations that the idea of disappearing photos was his. If so, Spiegel and Bobby are no visionaries nor innovators. The man who invented the best feature about Snapchat is gone, and that feature has been so successfully copied by Facebook, that it no longer provides an edge for Snapchat.In other words, Snapchat is now a one-trick pony without the pony (Reggie) and without the exclusivity of the trick. The other inventions like Spectacles continue to fail. The company wrote off $40 million on the first version and ordered significantly fewer of the second version (35,000). Now, it’s releasing a new higher-priced version and producing 24,000 of those. Evidently, the company is convinced that the idea could work. However, it’s very curious why it would think a more expensive version of a poorly selling item would be successful. Time will tell, of course, but the logic seems dubious.Even though Snap is trading at a heavy premium right now, there is still hope for it. The company has yet to monetize users to their fullest extent. So, even if Snap is no longer significantly growing users, it can still significantly grow the value per user. For example, Facebook sports an ARPU of $6.18. Unfortunately, Facebook is not exactly comparable to Snapchat in terms of the ad channel or ad funnel. Facebook can place ads in your timeline, next to your timeline and, most recently, in your videos. Snapchat can currently only do so in-between Snaps. Of course, calculating Snapchat’s potential ARPU becomes very complicated.Questions that are, at the moment, quite impossible to answer need to be addressed before such calculations can be made. For example, what is the size of Snap’s ad funnel vis-a-vis that of Facebook, and how much can the company grow its ad funnel? Still, let’s for a moment suppose that Snap can eventually earn $6.18 per user - if the company doesn’t grow users, it would mean a revenue per year of $4.1 billion. Assuming a similar profit margin as Facebook, the company would earn about $1.5 billion on an annual basis, and with a P/E of 10x, the shares would be worth at least close to double the current price per share of $6.Unfortunately, it’s highly unrealistic that such a drastic improvement is made within one year's time. Facebook, which is essentially trying to do the same thing with Instagram Stories, has stated that getting pricing parity is a process that is going to take years:Snap has about a year's worth of cash left, and while I’m sure that the company will be able to secure additional funding, whether through debt or equity, both methods will hurt the share price. Still, the company has much to prove before it can convince me or the market that it has the potential to execute like Facebook. Not only because to me there’s a clear difference in the quality of leadership, but also because the Snapchat app doesn’t seem to have as big of an ad funnel as Facebook does.More importantly, Snap does not have an infrastructure or a system that is comparable with Facebook. Facebook has combined millions of relatively precise data points on users with which it has created its algorithms. Facebook knows which users are likely to buy a specific product. Snap has a far tougher time collecting specific data like this because it can’t ""read"" a photo to see what an individual likes to do or likes to wear. In the meantime, time’s ticking.So, while for Facebook it might be a process of years, it might be a multiple of that for Snap. The more you look into it, the more you come to the conclusion that Snap is just so far behind Facebook.Snap is burning close to $1 billion a year, and while its ARPU has improved, there’s still significant improvement left before the company can stop its $150-250 million cash burn. Additionally, I have no faith in the company's leadership. Essentially, Snapchat has one more year before things get really tight. The potential seems to be (potentially) there given that Facebook has significant higher ARPU than Snap, signaling that Snap has a tremendous amount of room to grow.However, a closer look reveals that Snap is behind on multiple scorecards: leadership, advertisement infrastructure, advertisement (Algorithm) system, experience, and war chest. For now, while the story has become much more interesting than a year ago, I remain patient and wait on the sidelines. To be sure, while not yet a high-conviction short, there seems to be very little that would incentivize a long position."
4215254,31441,2018-10-28T14:49:48-04:00,"SNAP fell over 10% after reporting another sequential decline in DAUs.
        Cash burn was $159MM.
        Continual cash burn could call into question SNAP's ability to survive.
        Sell SNAP.","Source: VarietySnapchat (SNAP) reported Q3 revenue of $298 million and eps of -$0.12. The company beat on revenue and earnings, yet the market was disappointed. SNAP sold off by 10%. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.Heading into the quarter Snapchat had 188 million daily active users (""DAUs""), likely large enough to interest advertisers looking to reach millennials. The problem was that DAUs were down 2% from Q1 2018. The company recently revamped the app to separate friends' photos and videos from content delivered by influencers. In a leaked memo CEO Evan Spiegel admitted the rushed re-design may have been off putting to several users. Snapchat's Q3 DAUs were 186 million - a loss of another 2 million users. The company intimated the attrition was primarily among Android users.Management also intimated DAUs would fall again in Q4. The question remains, ""Will advertisers abandon Snapchat due to lack of DAU growth?"" Over 85% of the company's advertising revenue is derived via self-service, allowing Snapchat to scale its sales efforts and reach smaller advertisers:This implies Snapchat could spur additional advertising revenue with its current DAU pool. It could also potentially grow ad revenue by reaching smaller advertisers without incrementally increasing SG&A costs. The company's infrastructure has been built out. Now it needs to deliver new advertisers. This sounds easier said than done.The company also asserted that brands like Warner Brothers and Chik-fil-A had used its format and were pleased with the results. If Snapchat can offer e-commerce customers higher engagement rates vis-a-vis competitors, then does DAU growth matter as much? Twitter's (TWTR) user growth has been stagnant, yet its user engagement has been stellar. User engagement has allow Twitter to grow revenue Y/Y and fend off threats from Facebook (FB). It could potentially spur advertisers and ad revenue for Snapchat despite a diminution in DAUs.Heading into the quarter Snapchat had been burning cash like a drunken sailor. Despite 43% Y/Y revenue growth this quarter the company had free cash flow of -$159 million. It was better than the $220 million cash burn in the year earlier period, yet still alarming. If the company cannot generate positive cash flow with nearly $300 million in quarterly revenue then when can it? Growth in average revenue per user (""ARPU"") was up 37% Y/Y, while average cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU"") fell 10%. However, the company's revenue less cost of sales simply is not robust enough to cover other operating costs.R&D and SG&A costs fell 8% Y/Y, yet Snapchat's EBITDA was still -$298 million. Q3 2018 (1) ARPU of $1.60 less (2) CoRPU of $.1.06 left (3) $0.54 per user to cover R&D and SG&A expenses. Its EBITDA of -$1.60 per user implies the company needs to rapidly increase revenue or cut costs.Management is currently looking to reduce the amount of bandwidth the service uses; this could potentially drive down Snapchat's cost of revenue. Its cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting its products.If the company can deliver a similar user experience with less bandwidth (and less costs) it could be a game-changer. It could be key to Snapchat becoming cash flow positive at its current DAU level. Snapchat company currently has $1.4 billion in cash and securities. If it continues to burn over $100 million per quarter then its liquidity could come under scrutiny by the second half of 2019.SNAP has an $8 billion market capitalization, but how much is the stock actually worth? The stock is less than half its $17 IPO price, so it appears cheap. Given its unproven business model maybe SNAP never should have traded at $17 to begin with. The company loses money; traditional valuation metrics like multiple of earnings or multiple of EBITDA do not apply. Some have speculated Snapchat could be acquired by Google (GOOG) or Apple (AAPL), which likely explains its valuation amid consistent cash burn.SNAP is down over 50% Y/Y. Sans a buyout, I believe SNAP will trade in line with broader financial markets, which also appear headed lower.Snapchat's continual cash burn could call into question the company's ability to survive. Sell SNAP."

        One thing is for certain, short interest is quite high, but paradoxically, Snap could become a takeover target.
        Ultimately, whether Snap is still overvalued or not depends on the return of the company's user growth.","Source: GaryVaynerchuck.comThere is no way around it, Snap’s (SNAP) meltdown has been epic. The struggling social media platform’s stock price has collapsed by about 78% from a post IPO high of nearly $30, to a low of just $6.46 in recent days. Snap’s market cap has cratered from over $30 billion, to under $9 billion, and many investors are still wondering if the company is overvalued.Source: StockCharts.comSo, is Snap destined to continue to deteriorate? Could the stock crumble to an even lower level from here? Or could this be a significant opportunity to own Snap at a severely discounted share price?Let’s address the elephant in the room, the primary reason why Snap’s share price is now firmly in the mid-single digits, Snap’s declining user base. There is only one thing worse for a social networking company than a slowdown in user growth, and that is a declining user base. Unfortunately, due to a sloppy redesign of its app, this is exactly where Snap finds itself.Snap’s worldwide active daily users declined for the first time ever from 191 million to 188 million in the latest quarter. Naturally, all eyes are now on next quarter’s numbers which are scheduled to be released on October 25th. This may be a make or break quarter for Snap, and the company needs to demonstrate that one quarter does not make a trend by reporting expanding user base numbers later this month.Source: Statista.comThe silver lining is that Snap did a redesign of its redesign that received a warmer reception from users. However, the jury is still out on whether it will be sufficient to drive active user growth going forward.Perhaps one of the most impressive factors regarding Snap is its extremely strong and loyal user base amongst young people. About 78% of all young Americans age 18-24 use Snap regularly, and a majority, about 71% use it multiple times each day. Additionally, 71% of all Snap users are under 34 years of age. Another interesting statistic is that 70% of all Snap users are female. People under the age of 25 use Snap for 40 minutes each day on average, which is more than Instagram for the same demographic.Teens also love Snap. We can see that at 35% Snap is by far the most often visited social networking platform by teens in the U.S. We can see that Snap is America's favorite platform to consume and create content on amongst young people. Overall Snap appears to be the social networking platform of choice for young people. Naturally, this does not excuse the recent slide in daily users. However, it does suggest that the latest hiccup in growth may be a transitory phenomenon. Young users are sticky, early adopters that could become loyal long-term users of the platform which implies that the long-term growth picture may be healthier than current numbers suggest.Understandably, the most important factor for a relatively young company like Snap is the expansion of its user base. But revenues, monetization, and earnings are also relevant factors that should not be overlooked.You wouldn’t tell it by looking at the company’s stock price but Snap has done a relatively good job surpassing revenue and EPS targets in recent quarters. For instance, Snap has surpassed EPS estimates in all three of its latest quarters by an average of about 17.4%.Source: Nasdaq.com - The trend of beating EPS estimates could continue, and coupled with a return to user growth should benefit the stock price substantially. Last quarter Snap beat EPS estimates by delivering a loss of 14 cents vs an expected loss of 17 cents. Moreover, the company delivered $262 million in revenues vs estimates of just $250 million. ARPU also rose to $1.40 vs estimates of $1.30.So, despite the miss in user growth the company’s earnings beat estimates on many other key metrics. If the company can illustrate to investors that the company can return to user growth, its stock could explode much higher due to improvements in revenues and earnings.Another factor to consider if you are thinking about trading this stock long or short is the potential for a buyout. Facebook (FB) is a dominant social networking force in the U.S., and worldwide. Facebook has also demonstrated that this business can be massively profitable, and the company is now one of the most powerful enterprises in the world.There are a lot of tech giants that could easily afford to put in a bid for Snap. The company is now trading at a market cap of about $9 billion. Moreover, due to the company’s cash position Snap’s EV is only about $7 billion right now. This is incredibly cheap for a company with nearly 200 million active daily users.Several companies including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), and others could potentially dish out $15 billion or so to own a legitimate competitor to Facebook’s Instagram. In the right hands and with the right management Snap could be an extremely valuable, and substantially profitable business in time.A $15 billion bid would equate to about a 66% premium relative to where the company is trading at now. Also, $15 billion is not a great deal of capital for numerous large tech companies that may want to gain a foothold in the lucrative social networking space. I believe that if Snap can illustrate a return to user growth this quarter, the chance for a buy out bid of $15 - $20 billion increases substantially. But right now, Snap has a lot of short interest, which is understandable given the stock’s recent trajectory that has brought shares lower and lower. As of late September, about 141 million shares were sold short. This is approximately 15% of total shares worth close to $1.5 billion, making Snap one of the biggest shorts out of any company.Should a potential takeover company with an all-important earnings report coming up in a few weeks be shorted here? In my view, no. I would not short Snap, and besides, most of the easy money has already been made shorting the company. Risk reward is skewed to the upside here and Snap is an extremely dangerous short right now.The bottom line is that despite the company’s share price meltdown Snap could still evolve into a highly valuable enterprise. A lot is riding on the company’s ability to return to user growth this quarter. My estimate is that the company will report a positive growth quarter, and will announce about 190 million active daily users, which should reflect positively on Snap’s shares.A return to growth could also trigger a short squeeze in Snap’s shares, which could propel the stock substantially higher. Additionally, prospects for a buyout remain at these depressed levels regardless of what occurs on the earnings announcement.Snap remains a relatively risky investment, and there is no guarantee that the company will return to growth this quarter, or will ever return to growth for that matter. Nevertheless, chances for improved growth in the future are substantial, and the risk reward dynamic is now tilted to the upside in my view.Ultimately, whether Snap is still overvalued depends on the company's user growth or lack thereof. If the company's active users continue to slide or the user base plateaus then indeed Snap is still overvalued. However, if growth returns this quarter, even at a modest rate then the company is likely close to fair value right now. Additionally, if growth reaccelerates in the near future then the stock could be perceived as being undervalued here.

4210502,31441,2018-10-08T14:05:16-04:00,"A leaked memo from SNAP's CEO revealed SNAP may have rushed its redesign and wants to be profitable by full-year 2019.The redesign may have frustrated members of the Snapchat community. It could take time to win these members back.Becoming profitable by 2019 may not be realistic given the loss of traction in DAUs and competition from Instagram and WhatsApp.In the short term, I envision more cash burn and stagnant growth in DAUs.SNAP remains a sell.","Snapchat co-founders Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel at the NYSE. Source: Hollywood ReporterSnapchat (SNAP) has dominated the financial news cycle. The stock hit a 52-week low last week and is off over 50% Y/Y. Investors seem to question the growth rates of certain social media companies and their valuations. A leaked memo from Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel outlined new strategic goals. Below I will parse through key points of the memo and what they potentially mean for investors.My Interpretation:In Q4 2017 (around the time the redesign was in process), Snapchat had over 180 million daily active users (""DAUs"") that were growing by double digits. The size and growth of its DAUs were impressive. However, if it's not broke, then why fix it? I always felt that in separating the ""social"" from the ""media,"" Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel risked upsetting the company's user base if the change did not go well. Now Spiegel is admitting the company moved too quickly with the redesign and did not give itself enough time to test it ""with a smaller percentage of the community.""My interpretation is that the company could have sought feedback from a small sample size of users and responded to that feedback prior to springing the full changes on its 180 million user base. This sounds like a big mistake that could have potentially been avoided with the proper planning. If the company compromised its core product value by hampering users' communication speed and making it difficult for them to find the right people to talk to, then it may not be an easy fix.In Q2, Snapchat's DAUs fell 2% from lower frequency of use due to the disruption of the redesign. Winning back lost DAUs could take a few quarters, if at all. A point of contention for SNAP bulls is that DAUs appear to have plateaued. If they fall again in Q3, then the stock could tumble and it may be difficult to win back investors until the company actually delivers double-digit growth in DAUs again.My Interpretation:Speed may be a differentiating factor for Snapchat's management team, but Facebook's (FB) Instagram has incorporated some of the features Snapchat sees as a competitive advantage. Snapchat needs to take its concept from a cool toy to a tool that helps people market their businesses, grow their brands, and make money. Social media is a powerful tool for celebrities to interact directly with fans. Media outlets can also get news on celebrities without contacting them directly or going through publicist. If media outlets want to know what a certain celebrity feels about the stock market, politics, or even Snapchat's new redesign, they can retrieve information from that celebrity's social media page.In this gig economy, influencers and potential influencers want to make money. To do so they need to constantly sell and market. For instance, I run a quarterly speaker series about the U.S. economy. I recently spoke to some college students about the best way to get the word out about the event. I told them I was on Twitter (TWTR), Facebook, and YouTube. They were incredulous that I was not on Instagram and demanded that I join. The discussion practically turned into a public relations forum for the wonders of Instagram. They did not mention Snapchat once. I was cranky about having to manage another social media account, but I joined Instagram within a week of that conversation.Most of the viral videos - from new dance crazes or a celebrity rant - I am aware of are happening on Instagram. Artists, celebrities, and content creators are getting exposure and actually making money from these platforms. The term ""Stunting for the gram"" - doing the most for exposure on Instagram - has become part of urban vernacular.Source: David Trainer SNAP Seeking Alpha Article September 19, 2018It is no wonder that Snapchat is losing the battle for new users to Instagram. While Snapchat's user base appears to have plateaued, the user bases of Instagram and WhatsApp have taken off. Spiegel can blame part of the recent decline in DAUs on the redesign, but it is difficult to ignore the rapid growth of these other two platforms.The company says it is working on a design for Discover, which shows content from professional media companies and celebrities. It had better hurry up because Instagram seems to be the new platform for celebrities to share pictures, videos, and connect with fans and influencers. There has to be a reason for users to stay engaged with Snapchat. The next step for Snapchat is to connect influencers and content creators with celebrities and help these content creators make money.My Interpretation:Full-year profitability by 2019 sounds like happy talk at this point. In Q2 2018, the company had revenue of $262 million and cost of revenue of $192 million. Revenue less cost of revenue was about $71 million, not nearly enough to cover the $428 million Snapchat spent on R&D and SG&A. The company would need to substantially bring these costs down in order to meet the $71 million it generates after taking into account for cost of sales. SG&A was about $225 million. The company could potentially reduce these costs if it got celebrities and content creators to promote the platform more. R&D of $203 million could be more difficult to control since Snapchat appears to constantly innovate and try new features.The company's average revenue per user (""ARPU"") of $1.40 was up 33% Y/Y, while cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU"") of $1.02 rose only 16%. The net amount of $0.38 was not nearly enough to cover R&D and SG&A which were a combined (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) $2.16 per user. It would be an understatement to say the company must rapidly increase DAUs or ARPU. It could be difficult to grow DAUs in the face of competition from Instagram and WhatsApp. Older users generate higher revenue per user; however, until they can make money from Snapchat, I do not see them switching from other social media platforms.Spiegel's memo and his admission to the challenges facing Snapchat come as the company just reached a 52-week low and is well off its IPO price. SNAP has a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. What it is actually worth is anybody's guess. I do not believe the business model actually works and the company has not provided any evidence to the contrary.Snapchat does not make money and it is hemorrhaging cash; the company has burned over $550 million in cash over the past year. Even if Snapchat stopped the decline in DAUs and grew ARPU, there is no guarantee it would actually turn a profit or justify its $10 billion market capitalization.Over next few quarters, I envision a further decline in DAUs and more cash burn for SNAP. The stock will likely fall further while management attempts to prove the business model works. SNAP remains a sell."
4209525,103338,2018-10-03T02:04:55-04:00,,"Originally published September 28, 2018Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were sold this week. They just don't know it yet.If every morning the four largest retailers - Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), CVS - met, and their sole focus was putting #5, Target (NYSE:TGT), out of business, then Target would go out of business. This is happening to Snap, the #5, as the four biggest apps - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger - have their cannons squared on the ""camera"" company.Instagram created an exact clone of Snapchat three years ago. Within three months, Stories had nearly as many users as Snapchat. Since that time Snap has seen its user growth drop to single digits; Instagram Stories' growth rate per quarter averages to 33%. Snap has also provided the blueprint for Instagram's march to becoming one of the most popular messaging apps in the world behind WhatsApp, Messenger, and WeChat. Instagram now has twice Snap's user base.Evan is William Wallace, and Facebook Inc are the British. It's fun to root for Mr. Wallace, but we've been to this movie. Snap is now on a wooden slab where it will be emasculated, disemboweled, drawn, and quartered. This is a good example of why monopolies suck and the DOJ should move in on Facebook. Snap is/was a great firm that lit up the startup scene, providing wind at the back of the SoCal VC community and the entrepreneurship programs at USC and (the vastly superior) UCLA. Instead, office subleases in Venice are about to get much less expensive. However, the good news is homes in Palo Alto will continue to skyrocket in value. #yay.The ""American technology and camera company"" can take some solace in that, similar to the movie starring the immensely talented, and raging anti-Semite, Mel Gibson, the empire is ill. There is something very unhealthy brewing at Facebook Inc. For the first time I'm considering selling my stock in the social network. Facebook now feels like the information-age KGB, minus the charm.The KGB has a code, and its agents love their country. Facebook is run by people who appear to have no code or anything resembling honor - no loyalty to country or each other, and no unifying principle (other than let's lie and get much, much richer). It feels as if the finger-pointing is just getting underway at the social network. The latest? Great research from Penn professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson showing our election was flipped by Russia using Facebook. Hey, everyone, lean in.The customer data on Snap has gone from bad to worse. Evan is the next Tom from Myspace, if Tom married a supermodel and was dreamier. If Evan was smart enough to come up with Snap he's smart enough to know he's the walking dead, and that every day the value of his firm declines. So, what to do? Simple, sell. Only Snap is a terrible investment and a nightmare for investors, as the firm is controlled, via two-class stock, by a 28-year-old who is already a billionaire, so he is a terrible fiduciary for shareholders, as he will not sell to the highest bidder. There are only two relevant criteria for who will acquire Snap:1. It can't be Facebook. After his advances were rebuffed, Zuck has taken Evan behind the gym every day for the last 24 months and kicked the sh** out of him.2. Who Evan would work for.So, who are the buyers? It comes down to a pretty small number of candidates, as even when Snap goes below $5/share (within six months), the acquirer needs to show up with an $8-10B bag of cash (the value of News Corp) in exchange for a firm whose user base declined last quarter and is hemorrhaging money. However, they are still the platform among a cohort of hard-to-reach teens who are stupid - spend all their money on stupid sh** (high margin).So, my money is on Disney (NYSE:DIS) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The Seattle firm is the frontrunner, as they just announced a deal with Snap where a Snap filter can ID via visual search an item and take you to the product page on Amazon. The Great White Rhino has been social commerce, and Snap needs to do something… anything. However, like any deal involving one guy who's in charge, this firm will trade for ""soft"" reasons.Snap's CFO came from Amazon, where he was VP of finance. The CEO and his top finance people become twins who can communicate nonverbally as they go to war together every 12 weeks, into a battle called the earnings call. This means Tim Stone can call Jeff Bezos at home on his cell and, if they want, short-circuit the awkward dating that is M&A and determine if there is a deal to be done.The other potential suitor is Disney, as they have the balance sheet, are arguably one of two firms that have been able to scale creativity (the other is HBO), and Robert Iger is someone any young man can learn (a lot) from. As they launch their DisneyFlix product, Snap could be an interesting point of distribution to grab a larger teen audience.USA: 1Elon: 0I'm already getting a ton of sh** for tweeting the above. The robot army that is @tesla fanboys is coming for @profgalloway this morning, as they can't understand why anybody would root for the SEC, vs. Edison.Yes. You can.At UCLA, most of my friends were Jews from the San Fernando Valley. One of the things I love about NYC is I've forged friendships with people from different backgrounds. My closest friend at Stern is a premier scholar in machine learning from India whose father was an officer in the Indian army. Two other close friends are from Brazil and El Salvador. Something all three have given me is an appreciation for one of the pillars of our success as a nation: the rule of law. In these three countries there is a moving part called corruption that can hit you like an invisible bus after years of hard work.When Elon Musk committed blatant market manipulation (""funding secured"") for the sole purpose of scratching his id, he waved his middle finger in the face of our system. The excuses we make for ""innovators"" are unhealthy and un-American. Many are drafting off the perversion of having a criminal gang in the White House. But the US, more than a nation of innovators, is a nation of laws. We benefit, every day, from the notion that justice is blind. The Edison of our generation (and he is a genius) stuck his chin out and dared us to hit him. The SEC found its voice and complied.Our Edison will be, at a minimum, banned from being officer or director of a public company. Narcissism, a weak board, lack of impulse control, idolatry of innovators, and the SEC finding its voice will thrust Tesla into the arms of another, as the stock will decline (further), and the firm, which has real assets, will be acquired.In addition, the auto industry is a competitive, low-margin business, and is about to catch up to Tesla. The Germans are coming for rocket man, and they are angry. Just as I wouldn't want to be a German SaaS company squared in the sights of US tech firms, Tesla has poked the Bär and stirred some of the best-run firms in business from their electric slumber. Check out the new Audi electric SUV.To validate the thesis there is no adult supervision, Tesla decided to send board member and brother of Elon, Kimball, on a charm tour - CNBC, etc. I was on earlier in the day, wearing a hoodie. I looked like an aging skateboarder, couldn't answer simple questions from the crisp-minded Melissa Lee (impressive woman), and hated myself for it. But I felt better after seeing Kimball on CNBC, sporting a cowboy hat, who looked and sounded plain stupid. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are the most likely suitors, as the car is a platform of sorts, and one can see Apple employing their high-margin luxury brand, vertical distribution, and artisan strategy on Tesla.Conversely, Google could also use the (car) platform as a means of jumping ahead on self-driving and serving up ads/info/media while in/on this platform. It says something bad about our economy when any industry digresses to iOS or Android. The valuation prohibits another auto firm from acquiring Tesla, as the markets assign a tech, vs. auto, valuation to the firm. Tesla shareholders (note: I do not have a long or short position in TSLA) are also about to start hating @elonmusk.Youth, hubris, monopoly power, and narcissism will take two great firms off the market as the NASDAQ continues to shrink, moving us closer to a hunger-games economy with four religions (Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google), 3 million lords, and 350 million serfs."
4208928,31441,2018-09-28T14:54:39-04:00,"SNAP revamped its platform, but is its business model viable?Will improved user engagement lead to higher ad revenue?Over the past year cash burn has exceeded $550MM.SNAP is burning cash like a drunken sailor. Sell the stock.","Snapchat CEO Evan SpiegelA few months ago Citron Research started coverage of Snap (SNAP) with a $17 price target. The stock shot up in the mid-single-digits on the news. I found the story rather odd since Citron was known as a short seller. The firm cited SNAP's compelling valuation relative to other social media platforms, and that the short thesis had likely run its course. I assumed Citron was either trying to change sentiment on Snapchat or put the company in play.So far a suitor has not materialized. Apparently, investors also have come to their senses. Over the past year SNAP is off by about 40%. Its underlying fundamentals suggest the stock could fall further.Since its initial public offering Snapchat has garnered quarterly revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars, yet the company has consistently hemorrhaged cash. Its Q2 2018 revenue of $262 million was up 44% Y/Y. Daily active users (""DAUs"") of 188 million rose 9%, while average revenue per user (""ARPU"") rose 33%. Growth in ARPU outstripped the 16% rise in cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU""). This would imply the company is benefiting from scale.However, its revenue less cost of revenue is still not enough to cover R&D and sales and marketing expenses. Its R&D and SG&A expenses fell Y/Y by double digits. However, by my estimation, Snapchat had EBITDA of -335 million, up from -436 million in the year earlier period.Cash flow from operations was -$199 million in Q2, up from -$210 million in the year-earlier period. Over the past four quarters the company has reported cash flow from operations of -$569 million. That's an improvement over full-year 2017's cash flow from operations of -$735 million, but still alarming. At the end of Q2 2018 Snapchat had cash and marketable securities of nearly $1.6 billion, down from $2 billion at year-end 2017. That figure will likely dwindle further after Q3 results are reported. How much cash burn can SNAP bulls continue to stomach?I think Snapchat's model of allowing exploding videos is unique and value added. The question remains, ""can you monetize it."" Twitter (TWTR) faced this dilemma shortly after it went public, and appears to have turned the corner. BlackBerry (BB) is still trying to monetize its cryptography security technology. In my opinion, BlackBerry has not proven it has the necessary scale to succeed at it. At the end of the day, just because Snapchat's exploding videos are a great idea does not mean the company should be publicly traded.To spur ad dollars Snapchat increased the number of companies that could market products on its platform. CEO Evan Spiegel revamped the site to separate [i] photos and videos generated by users' friends from [ii] content delivered from content creators and influencers. The company recently partnered with Amazon (AMZN) to allow users to shop directly from Snapchat without leaving the app. My interpretation is that the growth in daily active users (""DAUs"") or user engagement is not robust enough to drive revenue high enough to make money. Snapchat is fighting hard to monetize its site, but will users find the presence of ads from Amazon and/or other brands off putting? If so, this could dampen user engagement.The jury is still out on whether past changes to the site have been effective. There are signs that user engagement is up, however DAUs fell sequentially last quarter:At some point Snapchat must prove it can make money. Given its cost structure the bar appears to be rather high. In Q2 2018 its ARPU and CoRPU were $1.40 and $1.02, respectively. That created $0.38 per user to cover R&D and SG&A expenses.Snapchat's R&D and SG&A were a combined $2.16 per user, yielding EBITDA per user of -$1.78. To become EBITDA positive Snapchat must rapidly grow its revenue base, increase ad rates, increase user engagement or cut costs.Recent changes to the platform were designed to spark user engagement and ultimately ad revenue. We should know more next quarter whether the changes have been effective. At its current cash burn rate Snapchat may not have many more quarters to figure it out.Snapchat is burning cash like a drunken sailor. SNAP is down more than 40% Y/Y and will likely fall further. SNAP remains a sell."
4211638,22227,2018-10-15T10:35:48-04:00,It’s been a year to forget or remember for CEO of Snapchat Evan Spiegel.The first catastrophic move out of many was the botched redesign of the interface and functionality.Snapchat has offered no meaningful innovation to combat the terrorizing force of Instagram.,"To the dismay of tech shares, the tech industry doesn’t operate in a bubble.The broader landscape is experiencing a dose of volatility triggered by the ratcheting up in interest rates.There’s not much tech can do to change the narrative.The back and forth political saber-rattling isn’t helping either.Tech is experiencing a swift rotation out of hyper-growth names such as Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) with investors taking profits on these names that have gone up in a straight line this year.This does not mean you should fling these stocks into tech heaven yet.The hardest hit names will be the marginal tech firms in the marginal tech spaces headed by dreadful management.This narrow criterion conveniently perfectly fits one company I have written about extensively.Enter Snapchat (SNAP).It’s been a year to forget or remember - depending on how you look at it for CEO of Snapchat Evan Spiegel.Snapchat was one of my first recommendations of The Mad Hedge Technology Letter when I told readers to run for the hills.To read my story on Snapchat, please click here.At that time, the stock was trading at a luxurious $19.Lionizing this shoddy company would be a stretch as shares have parachuted down to the $6.60 level.The latest word is that Snapchat is burning money fast.The cash crunch will quickly force them to raise some capital and this is just one of the many litanies of spectacular misfortunes that have beset this Venice, California social media starlet.The first catastrophic move out of many was the botched redesign alienating the core base who were dazed and confused by the new interface and functionality.Social media works poorly when you can’t find your friends on it.Spiegel admitted the redesign was “rushed” and it behooves me to let readers know that the redesign was the worst redesign I have ever seen in my life as I tested it out in my office.Snapchat quickly restored the previous interface calming their shrinking core audience.The self-inflicted wound was deep, and earnings reflected the quicksand Snapchat quickly found itself in.Snapchat announced that global daily active users (DAUs) shrank from 191 million to 188 million.A company at this early stage in the growth cycle should be reeling in the users non-stop.This is far from a mature company and if executed properly the company should have the ability to cast their net far and wide scooping up new users left and right.Let’s remember that Instagram, the Facebook (FB) owned direct competitor, is growing their user base parabolically.Simply put, Snapchat has had no answer to Instagram’s rapid rise to fame, and that was the center of my thesis to turn my back to this rapidly deteriorating company.Snapchat has offered no meaningful innovation to combat the terrorizing force of Instagram.The dearth of innovation has caused the average time spent on the platform to dip from 33 minutes to 31 minutes per session.Instagram has stretched the lead on Snapchat. In fact, it was Instagram that cleverly borrowed Snapchat’s best features and integrated them into their platform.Sentiment has turned rotten as the stock sold off when Spiegel announced that he wants the company to turn profitable in 2019.Investors don’t believe this one iota.Snapchat is expected to burn through $1.5 billion in 2019, and Spiegel’s pipedream of scratching out a profit is implausible.Snapchat is not executing on the digital ad front.It was a year and a half ago when consensus believed Snapchat was able to churn out revenue of $540 million this quarter, but it looks more likely that Snapchat is set for revenue of just a shade over $280 million.The severe underperformance is due to a lack of advertisers causing the eventual price of digital ads to fetch a lower price in an auction-based model.Stinging as it might be, the lower costs of ads is also caused by the average age group of Snapchat’s core base.Snapchatters are usually teenagers and have low purchasing power.Targeting an older user base would improve margins significantly.However, the conundrum is that the core user base might jump ship like they did to Facebook and shifted over to Facebook-owned Instagram.Snap doesn’t have a Facebook posing an acute problem that could likely backfire.General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union made the issue of securing personal data a national issue.Facebook poured fuel on the fire when they disclosed several breaches clobbering their share price.Mark Zuckerberg’s company is still reeling from the series of mishaps.Ironically, Facebook debuted a smart speaker with prime access to user’s home when trust is at its lowest ebb around Facebook’s data collection practices.Investors really need to ask themselves if Facebook’s management has any common sense at all.Any decent company would have halted this project and I expect it to be a complete disaster.Part of Snapchat’s turnaround strategy involves releasing scripted shows as short as five minutes long.Entering into the original content wars is a tough sell. The competition is becoming fiercer and this move hardly will differentiate itself from ad buyers who already avoid Snapchat. In fact, it smells of desperation.Snapchat has seen a brutal brain drain with management leaving in droves.They have voted with their feet.Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan was the latest to announce his upcoming departure.Others to jettison are the VP of product, VP of sales, VP of engineering, and its general counsel.The high turnover rate will make it more complicated to execute a drastic reversal of fortune.The only silver lining is if Zuckerberg manages to screw up Instagram after forcing the creators out with his behind-the-scenes meddling, giving a glimmer of hope to Snapchat.A stellar performance from the execution team along with a Facebook mess of Instagram could resuscitate the user base if users start to flee Instagram in droves.There aren’t many alternatives unless a user is inclined to quit social media.Snapchat badly needs to build up its user base or else digital ad buyers will stay away.I am still bearish on this stock and it would take a small miracle to spruce up the share price again."
4206979,104376,2018-09-18T14:30:43-04:00,Snap has fallen massively out of flavour with Wall Street. A decline in the number of daily active users and the company’s growth rate has killed the stock.Snap still has a highly scalable business model which operates in a growing industry; there is massive potential.I agree with management’s focus on developing a great product and creating the highest quality ecosystem. Financials will come with time if the business thrives.,"Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has been crushed by investors who have seen the company’s platform lose some traction among millennials. As opposed to the company's fast paced growth in previous years, this quarter saw somewhat of a pullback with a couple of million users leaving the platform. Snap has been plagued by negativity and investors who have identified Snap’s valuation as being too high, and the stock has been crushed.Figure 1: Snap’s stock has been pretty much all downhill since the company’s IPOSnap’s management has not exactly helped the cause, as Evan Spiegal received a massive stock compensation bonus following the firm’s IPO while investors got crushed. This did not exactly go well on the street.Snap has also continued to lose massive amounts of money, there is no debating that. The company actually has very high infrastructure costs which means that Snap books very significant losses every time a new user is added. The reason that investors were so concerned about the fact that the company’s user base did not grow significantly is because long term, the business will need to scale significantly if the company is going to achieve profitability.Investors are also growing increasingly impatient with Snap’s ability to bring in revenue and monetize the platform. Wall Street analysts have slashed their forward estimates and downgraded Snap. Revenue per user, for example, still stands at less than $3 in the United States.Figure 2: Snap’s high infrastructure costs mean that the company needs to monetize users after a short time to avoid taking even more significant losses.Figure 3: The average revenue per user is low, but this can grow over timeHowever, if you compare the monetization efforts of Snap versus Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the company is still in its infancy stages. Investors are viewing this as a negative, but I see opportunity. The company earned just $2.75 per user in the United States, compared to Facebook which earned a whopping $25.91 per user. If Snap is able to grow the business over a period of time, there is no reason that they couldn’t significantly capitalize on the monetization opportunity that lies ahead. Take a read of what management had to say on the conference call about the advertising model and the cost of advertising on the platform:This is the kind of thinking that I find encouraging when looking for long-term investments. Personally, I believe that if Snap is able to grow and retain their user base and advertising is cheaper on the platform than Facebook, I see no reason as to why the company will not become profitable in the future. Think about it: marketers are focused on earning the highest returns on their investment and reaching their target audiences. If Snap can meet the needs of advertisers at a cheaper price than Facebook, companies will come across in droves.I find it fascinating that advertising revenues have increased so sharply, while pricing is actually down more than 90% due to programmatic advertising. This demonstrates that Snap will easily be able to generate interest from advertisers if the price is right. Yes, this transition has hurt revenue growth over the short term, but it may well prove to be a long-term catalyst. If the company could execute on this plan over time and generate numbers like Facebook, they would be generating annual revenue that approaches 8 billion dollars and profits in the billions of dollars.Figure 3: Facebook generates 10x more revenue per average user than SnapchatAdvertising is by no means a zero sum game. Yes, Snapchat directly competes with Facebook and Instagram; however, there is room for multiple players in the social media space.Let us address the pullback in daily average users. The majority of the exodus took place as a result of the Snapchat redesign, which did not exactly go according to plan. The redesign resulted in heavy criticism from influencers such as Kylie Jenner. Given how severe the whiplash from the redesign was, I feel that Snapchat actually held up rather well. Users still continue to spend more than 30 minutes a day on the platform and it is encouraging to me that Evan Spiegal and his team are taking steps to make the platform more user friendly, even if it did not succeed right away.Snap’s success or failure in business will not ultimately be determined by the company’s short-term monetization strategy. What will determine whether or not the company is successful is the business' long-term ability to retain their users’ attention and compete successfully for the attention span of the future generations. Again, I love the fact that Evan Spiegal is focused on making a great product. If Snapchat is going to compete against Facebook, this is exactly what is required. So far, Snapchat has been successful in keeping their users engaged, with the average user spending more time on the platform than any other social media platform, even Instagram.I don’t believe in valuing early stage companies on this year’s earnings or the price to earnings ratio, especially if they have massive potential. To me, the correct way to value a company like Snap is to realistically project out the company’s earnings over a market cycle and discount to the present. If you believe in the future of Snap, I don’t believe that there is any reason to throw the stock out.The redesign and a drop in users seems like a minor setback on the road to successful monetization. The business still has massive growth opportunities going forward. Personally, I won’t buy Snap at these levels, because I believe there are cheaper stocks in the market and feel Snap falls a bit out of my circle of competence. For investors who understand social media, though, and have faith in the company’s ability to execute over the long run, I believe shares are on the cheaper side. The fact that Wall Street is so negative on the firm gives me even more conviction that now might be a good time to load up."

First-day investors quickly lost up to half of their investment, and shareholders haven't fared any better since then, with Snap closing at an all-time low on Sept. 10. Meanwhile, its closest competitor Twitter (TWTR), while hardly an even ride, has gained more than 90% since Snap's IPO. Even at these low prices, I'm more tempted to short Snap rather than purchase shares.Snap's user base has been showing signs of plateauing for several quarters. Rather than an aberration, Snap's Q2/18 user decline looks like the continuation of a trend as Snap's user growth continues to slow - and may have now reversed.I see Snap's North American ARPU as a bellwether for overseas ARPU and that North American ARPU growth is rapidly slowing. Snap needs to halt - or reverse - that deceleration to become profitable, and there isn't much of a sign they're doing that.(Enterprise value via YCharts; users are DAU for FB and SNAP, MAU for TWTR and SPOT, and subscribers for NFLX)Despite that, I do not plan to short Snap. Snap has been the recipient of a few buyout offers and is priced cheaply per user relative to peers. That low per-user price may be very attractive to potential bidders who are likely to believe that they can lower Snap's costs, grow Snap's user base, and turn Snap's teenage users into more revenue. To date, however, Evan Spiegel has not wanted to relinquish control of Snap.I will remain on the sidelines.(*Operating costs one year ago are dominated by one-time stock compensation costs from Snap's IPO.)Snap is operating more efficiently today than in the past with more revenue/user and lower operating costs/user. Despite that, the company is still some distance from achieving profitability, even on an adjusted EBITDA basis.Over the past four quarters, Snap has generated revenue of $5.31/user, based on their quarterly ARPU. However, Snap has incurred $4.26/user in gross costs and $9.53/user in operating costs. Snap is making improvements in operating costs: Operating costs/user are down 18% from Q2/17 as leverage increases and Snap cuts costs.However, Snap's largest problems are a lack of user growth and rapid deceleration of North American ARPU growth.(All figures and tables are based on company filings)In Q2/18, Snap saw its first sequential decline in daily active users (""DAUs""). Users declined 2% sequentially (191M to 188M), although they are still up 8% y/y (173M to 188M). This decline is broadly in line with deceleration of growth since the 2014-2016 high-growth era. Since then, growth dropped to single digits sequentially and has trended downward from there.Further, management does not sound optimistic for a quick turnaround in Q3:DAU decline was uniform across all three of Snap's geographic regions. It was the first sequential decline in any of Snap's regions. Snap must reverse this trend - it will be very difficult to provide value to shareholders with ~190M users.While user growth has halted - at least for now - Snap is monetizing users better than ever. Trailing ARPU (average revenue per user) has risen every quarter since 2015. Most recently, trailing ARPU rose 38% (y/y) with growth of 20% in North America, 103% in Europe, and 258% in the rest of the world.In my view, Snap's North American ARPU is their second most important number, after daily active users. Snap divides their revenue into three geographies - North America, Europe, and the rest of the world (""ROW""). Of these three, North America has the highest ARPU ($9.23 trailing compared to $2.33 and $2.40, respectively).While North America includes only a minority of users - 80 million out of 188 million (43%) - it's the most mature market from a monetization perspective. If its growth is slowing and reaching a natural ceiling (wherein it would then only rise with the rate of advertising spending/year), this will provide us with guidance on a possible ARPU ceiling for other regions as well, once they are more developed. As Facebook (FB) said on their July earnings call:Back in my July article on Facebook, ""Facebook Is A Bargain: Target Price Of $240/Share,"" I used this statement to estimate potential Facebook revenue in less-mature regions based on GDP/capita in those regions compared to that in the United States and Canada.Similar logic would also apply to Snap - North America ARPU may be a leading indicator of what eventual ARPU in less-mature regions might look like, scaled based on GDP/capita and other factors. Thus, the higher North American ARPU grow, the higher the likely future ceiling for other regions grows as well.(Trailing ARPU by region, with North American values highlighted)As illustrated, North American ARPU is still growing at a brisk 20%/year, on a trailing basis. However, ARPU growth is rapidly decelerating - that 20% growth was 54% growth six months ago and 181% growth one year ago. No one expected that 180% growth would last forever, but it will be vital that Snap's growth doesn't decelerate further.As noted above, ARPU growth is much faster in the Europe and ROW segments - trailing y/y growth in each is 103% and 258%, respectively. But both segments are, in my view, likely to reach a natural ceiling proportionate to North American ARPU, given the structural similarities of the business across regions.In a perfect world, Snap would - much like Roku (ROKU), as described in my article ""Roku: Riding The Wave Of The OTT Revolution"" - have a growing user base and growing ARPU.Snap needs ARPU growth to increase their gross margins, and a growing user base will enable Snap to increase their operating leverage to bring down operating expenses/user. Last quarter, Snap spent $3.30/user between gross and operating costs. North American ARPU - the best region - was only $2.21/user, while Europe and ROW were $0.66 and $0.96, respectively.The situation isn't incurable. Perhaps Snap's redesign was pushing users away and Snap will return to user growth in Q3 and beyond, after having reverted to a better app. Snap is still a top 10 free app in the App Store and top 15 in the Play Store.Further, Snap's 20% trailing ARPU growth in North America is still a very brisk growth rate. If Snap can maintain that level of ARPU growth, North American users will bring in more revenue than they cost ($3.30/user) by Q4/19. And that could happen even faster if Snap resumes user growth, allowing operating expenses to be spread out among more users.The bull case for Snap is that users were turned off by the botched redesign and those users will return - and new users will join - now that the design has been improved. Further, 20% ARPU growth in North America - and 102% and 238% in Europe and ROW - are brisk growth rates. If those rates continue - or accelerate - Snap might be profitable in North America on a per user basis in two years or less. That could come even sooner if Snap is able to continue cutting operating costs (down ~10% y/y).Additionally, there's always the chance that Snap will be bought out by a larger company. Snap has reportedly turned down a $3 billion offer from Facebook and a $30 billion offer from Google (GOOG) (GOOGL). Both of those companies - and others - could acquire Snap now, although that may be difficult given Evan Spiegel's reluctance to relinquish control.(Snap Investor Presentation, Q2/18)The bear case for Snap is straight forward. User numbers may have plateaued, and even if they haven't, growth is relatively slow. North American ARPU growth - a bellwether for ARPU generally - is rapidly decelerating. At the current pace of deceleration, ARPU could be growing in single digits (or less) within a couple quarters. Both trends are deeply troubling in a company that's not close to profitability - in Q2/18, Snap brought in $1.40/user and had an operating loss of $1.90/user. Snap needs to more than double revenue/user - or deeply cut costs/user - to get close to profitability and sustainability.And investors are rightly questioning just how likely that is - Snap's free cash flow appears to be worsening rather than improving, despite ARPU growth.To model Snap's future just a bit, I have considered three scenarios - a base scenario, an optimistic scenario, and a more pessimistic scenario.In all three scenarios, I model that Snap's operating costs increase at 5%/year and that Snap's gross costs per user increase at 2.9%/year (the ~risk-free rate).I further model that non-NA ARPU asymptotically approaches a scaled proportion of North America ARPU: Closing 9% of the gap per year (based on European ARPU growth over the past year), and approaching ~48% of North America ARPU (based on the GDP/capita of Europe, as defined, compared to North America). Basically, this means that outside North America ARPU continues to increase at a pace determined by North American ARPU.Base Scenario: Suppose that Snap reverts the user declines of Q2/18, and user growth continues at the average increases from the four quarters before that - ~3% sequentially in North America and Europe and ~5% sequentially in the rest of the world. Further suppose that North American trailing ARPU continues to grow at 20% y/y and that European and ROW ARPU asymptotically approach a scaled proportion of North American ARPU (closing 9% of the gap per year, and approaching ~48% of North America ARPU - based on the GDP/capita of Europe, as defined, compared to North America).(Author, editable model available to subscribers of The Growth Operation)In this scenario, Snap is not profitable until 2021 and will end 2023 with ~412 million daily active users. Snap's first operating profit would occur in Q4/20, and the company would lose ~$2.4 billion in operating income prior to consistently being profitable.Given Snap's current cash and marketable security balance of ~$1.6 billion and their $156 million in share-based compensation last quarter, it is probable that Snap could afford this without having to raise additional capital.Optimistic Scenario: Suppose that Snap's user growth, in each of three regions, reverts to average levels from 2016-2017, including the high-growth first half of 2016. This means sequential user growth of ~7% in North America and Europe and ~9% in the rest of the world. Further suppose that Snap's North American trailing ARPU growth accelerates back up to Q1/18 levels (~33%) over the next four quarters and continues at that extremely quick rate indefinitely.In this optimistic scenario, Snap achieves profitability in 2021 and ends 2023 with 946 million daily active users (with an 849 million average for the year). Snap's first quarter of profitability would be Q4/20 again, and Snap would lose ~$2 billion in operating profits prior to achieving consistent profitability. As in the base scenario, Snap can withstand these losses given their cash position and their share-based compensation structure.Pessimistic Scenario: Suppose Snap's user growth continues its trailing four quarters averages - ~2% sequentially in North America and Europe and ~3% sequentially in the rest of the world. Further suppose that Snap's North American trailing ARPU growth slows from 20% down to 4% over the next two years, and then remains at 4% thereafter.In this pessimistic scenario, Snap's losses narrow but the company has yet to make an annual EBIT profit by 2023 and does not make a quarterly operating profit until Q4/21. Snap would end 2023 with 292 daily active users, and would face operating losses of ~$4.8 billion by Q2/23 (with 2H/23 generating an operating profit). Even with Snap's stock-based compensation, Snap would likely need to raise capital in this scenario before it could attain profitability.All three scenarios assume increasing operating costs and gross costs per use, though. It's possible that Snap could make one of both of those assumptions incorrect and significantly improve their chances of survival. If Snap can effectively cut costs, it would significantly improve their financial position.Snap's situation is troubling, and its stock performance reflects those troubles. User growth is stalling out while revenue per user - in the bellwether North American region - is flattening.Of my three scenarios, I would lean toward some combination of the base scenario and the pessimistic scenario. I do not foresee Snap returning to its growth days of 2016-17 without major changes to the software, which would risk alienating their base once again. Further, Snap's current 20% ARPU growth in North America is dropping quickly - it appears unwise to expect that growth to continue at 20% when it has dropped so quickly. ARPU growth overseas is brisker, but it's likely just making up ground to North America and is unlikely to catch or pass North America.(Source)However, I'm not ready to open a short position in Snap just yet.The Snap story lacks a clear catalyst, and if user growth resumes in Q3, stock prices could gain back some lost ground. Further, Snap could - at any time, really - be the recipient of a buyout offer from a large tech company like Google or Facebook. Those companies may not appreciate Snap's loss per user, but Snap still has ~190 daily active users and is the most popular social media network among teens. New ownership also is likely to foster a belief they could cut Snap's costs, monetize the platform more effectively, and better-grow Snap's user base.With any of those changes, Snap could be a very attractive purchase.For now, I will remain on the sidelines."
4205711,69905,2018-09-12T07:12:44-04:00,"There is no situation where Snap is trading at a bargain valuation.Its top line growth is starting to slow.At the same time, its costs continue to climb.","Back in July of last year, I wrote an article about Snap (SNAP) titled, This Is Not An Investment, It Is A Speculation. Just over a year later, and its share price is down by more than 40%. Today, I still argue that Snap is still not cheap enough. Here is why. Snap released its Q2 2018 results back in August. With the benefit of hindsight, investors have not taken particularly well to this set of results, as its shares have tumbled more than 20% in the past month. What is particularly interesting, is that Snap's revenue continues to plough ahead and was up 44% to $262 million. Are investors now saying that this bull market is losing steam? This is very interesting because numerous companies, in the tech space in particular, such as Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), have managed to remain in favor with investors simply on the back of posting solid revenue growth, regardless of profitability. In fact, we can see that Snap succeeded in posting strong top and bottom line beats. However, realistically, once growth investors saw the number of daily active users come down sequentially from 191 million in Q1 2018 to 188 million in Q2 2018, Snap, a company which was unprofitable but widely regarded as a growth stock, all of a sudden witnessed a shift in perception take place, and now investors are solely focusing in on its lack of profitability and free cash flow burn.Is it reasonable to assume that Snap's management should be paid? That management compensation is an actual cost of running Snap's business? Assuming readers answered this in the affirmative, then, we should consider Snap's management stock-based compensation as a real cost, rather than a non-cash cost which can be safely ignored. In more detail, Q2 2018 saw Snap's stock-based compensation reach $156 million. While management's compensation is down roughly 36% compared with the same period a year ago, Snap's shares are down even more. Consequently, I recommend that readers include Snap's stock-based compensation as a cash cost, which needs to be netted out of free cash flow. For instance, for Q2 2018, Snap's adjusted free cash flow would approximate $390 million, rather than the reported $234 million. Note, I have not included Snap's use of cash for purchases of intangible assets, which amounts to $2.5 million when calculating Snap's free cash flow - although many tech companies, such as Amazon, do include these uses of cash when calculating their free cash flow, typically accounting for this cash use under capex. Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comI have chosen the above peer group given that they all have strong exposure to advertising revenues. However, realistically, these peers are significantly more established, with more financial resources, and thus make for vastly less risky investments. On the other hand, part of the appeal of seeking out a high growth stock such as Snap, is that it should perform as a high growth company. However, Snap's midpoint forward guidance of 33% YoY growth is not supportive of its present valuation of a $12 billion market cap.Remember, Snap finished FY 2017 with triple-digit revenue growth. Thus, for a company as young as Snap to see its pace of revenue slow down so dramatically, should give its shareholders ample reason to turn cautious. Finally, when questions surrounding Snap's profitability come up on the call, CFO Stone responded by saying that...This final sentence is Wall Street's lingo for 'we know we are not profitable today, and realistically, we have no plans to turn profitable any time soon'.Investing is never easy, at the best of times - given that the best minds all over the world are constantly sieving for the best ideas. However, in light of Snap's Q2 2018 results and guidance, investors have numerous better investment opportunities, which are materially less risky than Snap.Note: The only favor I ask is that you click the ""Follow"" button so I can grow my Seeking Alpha friendships and our Deep Value network.Disclaimer: Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions."
4207171,24157,2018-09-19T11:53:26-04:00,"In early 2017, as Snap prepped for its IPO, CEO Evan Spiegel received fawning profiles in the pages of prominent papers.Fast forward to September 2018, with mounting losses, slowing growth, and a stock that has fallen more than 50% from its IPO price.Few people still view Spiegel as Snap’s greatest asset. Instead, he’s presented as a liability.","In early 2017, as Snap, Inc. (SNAP) prepped for its IPO, CEO Evan Spiegel received fawning profiles in the pages of prominent papers like the LA Times and the New York Times. These profiles painted a portrait of Spiegel as an enigmatic genius, the latest in a line of tech visionaries that would revolutionize the world. The New York Times profile even quoted Google chairman Eric Schmidt as calling him ""the next Gates or Zuckerberg."" We were skeptical.Fast forward to September 2018, with mounting losses, slowing growth, and a stock that has fallen more than 50% from its IPO price, few people still view Spiegel as Snap's greatest asset. Instead, he's presented as a liability, the brains behind failed ventures such as the ill-fated redesign of the app and the money losing Spectacles. However, with no mechanism to hold Spiegel accountable for his missteps, Snap's investors can only watch the company's ongoing struggles with frustration. A recent Bloomberg Businessweek article summed up this exasperation, asking ""What Is Snapchat Doing?""What Snapchat is doing, the article reveals, is trying to mold Spiegel into a competent CEO. Through management coaching and feedback from employees, Spiegel is trying to put the mistakes of his past behind him and become a more open and communicative leader. He has a long way to go, as this paragraph from the aforementioned Bloomberg piece reveals:In a normal company, a CEO that oversaw a 50% decline in the stock price and punished employees for missing nonexistent goals wouldn't receive management training, he'd receive a pink slip. Snap is not a normal company though. Its dual-class share structure means public shareholders have no say in corporate governance while Spiegel and co-founder Robert Murphy control 96% of the voting rights in the company.The lack of shareholder rights was made abundantly clear at the company's latest ""shareholder meeting,"" which lasted only three minutes and consisted only of a recorded message from the company's lawyer. The lawyer reminded investors that executives hold 96% of the voting rights and a more traditional meeting was unnecessary. A new board member was also announced via this recording.One would think that Spiegel, who has acknowledged the problems his lack of communication has caused, would want to take advantage of the opportunity to outline the company's goals and strategies to investors. Instead, the only message this ""meeting"" communicated to investors was ""We don't care about you.""Investors tolerated this unfavorable share class structure at first when they thought that Spiegel might be the next Zuckerberg. The similarities where there on the surface: both were college dropouts that founded massively popular social media companies and took them public while still in their twenties.However, Zuckerberg has demonstrated competence in ways Spiegel has not. Facebook generates billions in profits, has navigated through multiple re-designs, has a successful management structure. Moreover, Zuckerberg has attracted talented leaders and been able to surround himself with competent people like COO Sheryl Sandberg. Spiegel, on the other hand, has alienated his fellow executives and led to constant C-Suite turnover, most recently with the departure of Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan.Facebook was already a highly profitable company at its IPO, with a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 21%. It continues to grow revenues and users faster than SNAP. Snapchat loses hundreds of millions of dollars a year and has seen its growth slow to a halt as all its best features are co-opted by non-other than Facebook.Snap's daily active users reached 188 million in 2Q18 (+8% year-over-year (YoY). For comparison, Facebook's daily active users reached 1.47 billion (+11% YoY). More alarming is the speed at which Facebook's copycat competition is growing, and surpassing, Snap in DAU's. Per Figure 1, Instagram Stories, launched in August 2016, reached 400 million DAUs in 2Q18 (+60 YoY). WhatsApp Status, a Snapchat lookalike launched in February 2017, reached 450 million DAUs in May 2018 (+157% YoY). Lastly, Facebook Stories, another Snapchat clone that exists directly within the Facebook app launched in March 2017 and already has 150 million DAUs (no YoY comparison available).Figure 1: Snap's DAUs Dwarfed by Competition from FacebookSources: New Constructs, LLC, company filings, and company announcementsFigure 1 proves both the success of Spiegel's initial vision for Snapchat and the failure of Spiegel as an executive to implement that vision. Disappearing stories are wildly popular with users, but it's Facebook, not Snapchat, that is capitalizing on this new feature.User base aside, Snap's heavy reliance on advertising dollars (97% of 2017 revenue, up from 96% of 2016 revenue) pits it against some of the largest media/internet firms in the market. Specifically, Snap faces direct competition from Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR), and more. For comparison sake, we included GoPro (GPRO), as Snap claims to be a camera company (despite its failed attempt to make a camera). Per Figure 2, Snap's trailing twelve months (TTM) gross margin ranks well below its main competitors and is closer to a hardware company like GoPro rather than a social media company.Figure 2: Snap's Margin Lags All CompetitionSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsDespite trading 61% below the price its IPO opened at ($24/share), SNAP is still vastly overvalued. SNAP's valuation indicates that a significant amount of noise traders[1] are still propping the stock up, as the expectations baked into its current stock price imply that SNAP will grow into a platform that rivals Facebook's margins and market share.Comparisons to Facebook make sense on the surface, since both compete for user engagement and must find ways to monetize users. However, these firms have vastly different economics, even when going back to Facebook in its infancy.First, when Facebook went public in 2012, it's after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) was $1.1 billion and the company achieved a 21% NOPAT margin whereas Snap's NOPAT in 2016 was -$498 million with a -123% margin. Facebook has continued to grow its revenue, user base, and improve margins.Second, when Facebook first entered the market, it did not have to unseat a large, firmly established and highly profitable incumbent. To become the next Facebook, Snap would need to take huge chunks of market share from Facebook, a feat it has proven unable to accomplish to date, while also drastically improving its margins. So, what does it all mean? How much lower could Snap fall as the noise turns negative and the fundamentals are exposed?To justify its valuation of ~$9/share, Snap must immediately achieve a NOPAT margin of 25% and grow revenue by 40% compounded annually for the next six years - both numbers are comparable to Facebook's results in its first few years after its IPO. The high expectations embedded in the stock price even after its 60% drop shows just how irrational the market was at its IPO. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.As discussed above, Snap does not really live up to the Facebook comparison. Twitter (TWTR) is probably a better comp, although even Twitter has an advantage over Snap due to the differentiation of its service. If SNAP can only achieve a 5.5% NOPAT margin (slightly below TWTR) and grow revenue by 40% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth just $5/share today - a 46% downside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.Snap is far from the only recent IPO to prevent public shareholders from having any say in the company. Domo (DOMO), Dropbox (DBX), and GreenSky (GSKY) have all recently gone public with dual-class share structures that concentrate voting power in the hands of founders. As we predicted, all three stocks are down since their first day of trading.Hopefully the failure of these IPO's will convince investors to avoid future dual-class offerings. The success of Facebook and Alphabet led investors to believe that concentrating power in the hands of a visionary founder is a good idea, but most founders are not Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, or Larry Page.Bondholders would never give a company money without some form of collateral or liquidation rights. Preferred stockholders get preferred access to cash flows.

This isn't a stock to buy on dips other than for a quick dead-cat bounce. My previous target of $7 is lowered to $5 for a market valuation of roughly $7 billion.Image Source: Snap websiteThe problem with Snap is that the social messaging company faces no end to competition from the Instagram division of Facebook (FB). Even the recent privacy issues and Senate hearings haven't provided much of a reprieve on the pressure to Snapchat usage.As well, the company has often failed to transfer the business from a communications platform to a content consumption platform. The app redesign to start the year was designed to push users more into content consumption than sales ads and that move failed miserably.The last bastion of Snapchat dominance is in the 12- to 17-year old crowd. eMarketer predicts that Snapchat will maintain the lead in the category over Instagram, but the company isn't gaining any ground in this key demographic.Snap lost 3 million DAUs in the last quarter and the eMarketer report doesn't provide any hope that Snapchat will regain lost users. If anything, the risk is that the younger crowd officially moves over to Instagram or another platform.The reason for a $5 price target is that even analysts haven't come to grips with the dramatic revenue cuts in the last 18 months or so. This table from BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield shows the drastic revenue cuts for 2019 where the analyst had originally forecast $4.9 billion in revenues and the estimate has now been cut to only $1.6 billion. In the span of about 18 months, the revenue estimate was cut by an incredible 67%.Source: BTIG ResearchThe numbers show that BTIG is generally inline with consensus analyst estimates now. One has to realize though that these estimates still suggest revenue growth approaching 40% in 2019.How Snap accelerates revenue growth in 2019 and maintains 38% growth in 2020 isn't exactly logical. The average analyst forecast is for Q4 revenue growth to dip to only 30%.My thesis for the $5 target is that analysts are far too bullish on a platform that has limited user growth. These analysts will need to again and again slash revenue estimates.With their grips on users in general and the key young demographic up for a battle, the ongoing large losses and massive cash flow burn is very troubling. The company has no moat to battle a tech giant like Facebook with a cash balance of $42.3 billion at the end of June.The problem all along with Snap is that the company was unable to produce a business around the communications platform. All of the revenues coming through the front door flow right out of the back door via excessive costs.Snap ended June with a net cash balance of $1.57 billion. The company is burning about $200 million per quarter at the current runrate. The question remains whether leverage will be generated in the existing business model where the company needs to invest in product development to out innovate Facebook while the social networking giant ultimately just steals the best new features without requiring all of the costs.The ultimate issue with Snap is on the expense side of the equation. Not only are infrastructure costs far too high at $0.72 per user and growing, but operating expenses remain off the chart.Snap has finally shown some discipline in the last few quarters with operating expenses trending down. The costs are still substantial at nearly 100% of revenues that reached $262 million last quarter.Source: Snap Q2'18 presentationWithout any big shift in gross margins, Snap has to add about $200 million in additional revenues without adding additional operating expenses. Such a scenario isn't practical so the question is the level of leverage that's possible. At about 50% leverage on additional revenues, the company would need to grow revenues at about $400 million in order to reduce operating losses and cash used in operations to the breakeven levels.The task appears daunting for Snap to reach quarterly revenues of more than $650 million with questionable user growth. Absolutely no reason exists to expect Snap to outperform industry players like Facebook and Twitter (TWTR). For this reason, no reason exists for Snap to trade at an EV/S multiple of 10x and some 25% higher than the peer multiples.Note that this number isn't even accurate in the case of Snap. With 1.5 billion shares outstanding, Snap has a market value of roughly $15 billion. Based on the cash balance, the EV is roughly $13.4 billion. At a revenue estimate of $1.15 billion, the EV/S multiple is actually closer to 11.7x.The key investor takeaway is that the stock valuation is absurd. Even a 5x multiple is aggressive for a company with a long path to profits facing relentless competition from a tech giant. Using that multiple and rounding up, Snap has no reason for a price target above $5.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

Non-GAAP metrics are a red flag for investors because they often mask the true economics of the business as is the case with Snap. Snap’s adjusted EBITDA can only minimize, not eliminate (on paper), the true extent of its losses. Over the last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA is -$750 million, even as GAAP losses improved to -$1.6 billion (from $-3.4 billion), per Figure 4. GAAP losses only improved due to the outsized stock compensation expense in 2017 resulting from Snap’s IPO.Figure 4: After Adjustments, Adjusted EBITDA is Still NegativeSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsSnap’s adjusted EBITDA was -$720 million in 2017, compared to -$3.4 billion GAAP net income, and -$3.7 billion economic earnings. The largest item removed from adjusted EBITDA was stock-based compensation expense. Snap removed $2.6 billion (320% of 2017 revenue) in stock-based compensation expense last year.Snap’s co-founders hold all voting power in the company.Snap’s latest ""shareholder meeting"" lasted only three minutes and consisted only of a recorded message from the company’s lawyer. The lawyer reminded investors that executives hold 96% of the voting rights and a more traditional meeting was unnecessary. A new board member also was announced via this recording.Perhaps, if management cared more about creating shareholder value, it would spend time informing shareholders of their plans to make money at some point.Despite trading 48% below the price its IPO opened at ($24/share), SNAP is still vastly overvalued. SNAP’s valuation indicates that a significant amount of noise traders[1] are still propping the stock up, as the expectations baked into its current stock price imply that SNAP will grow into a platform that rivals Facebook’s margins and market share.Comparisons to Facebook make sense on the surface, since both compete for user engagement and must find ways to monetize users. Furthermore, the firms compete directly in the “photo-capture” aspects (with Facebook’s many Snapchat clones) of mobile applications and social media. However, these firms have vastly different economics, even when going back to Facebook in its infancy.First, when Facebook went public in 2012, its NOPAT was $1.1 billion and the company achieved a 21% NOPAT margin whereas Snap’s NOPAT in 2016 was -$498 million with a -123% margin. Facebook has continued to grow its revenue, user base, and improve margins.Second, when Facebook first entered the market, it did not have to unseat a large, firmly established and highly profitable incumbent. To become the next Facebook, Snap would need to take huge chunks of market share from Facebook, a feat it has proven unable to accomplish to date, while also drastically improving its margins. So, what does it all mean? How much lower could Snap fall as the noise turns negative and the fundamentals are exposed? Below, we model multiple scenarios for future cash flow performance baked into Snap’s current valuation.Just as it was at the time of its IPO, it remains hard to make a straight-faced argument for Snap at this valuation… if you care about fundamentals. For those that do care about fundamentals, it's wise to stay away from Snap.The disconnect between fundamentals and valuation is a perfect sign of the rising influence of noise traders in the market. These traders make investment decisions based on narratives, momentum, or stories and have no regard for fundamentals. Noise trading can be successful over the short term, but it usually ends very poorly over the long term.While Snap was once buoyed by positive user growth, soaring revenue, and “promise” of future results, those trends have diminished. When the noise shifts toward the negative, the drop in this stock could be precipitous.This article originally published on August 13, 2018.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.[1] Shiller, Robert J., et al. “Stock Prices and Social Dynamics.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 1984, no. 2, 1984, pp. 457–510.

However, the market is disappointed with the sequential decline in the number of its daily active users.For the second quarter of the year, Snap's revenues grew 44% to $262 million, beating the analyst estimate of $250.4 million. The company ended the quarter with a net loss of $353 million, down 20% from net loss of $443 million a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted net loss per share was $0.14 versus analyst estimate of loss of $0.17 per share.Among other metrics, daily active users (DAU) were 188 million, up 8% from 173 million a year ago and down 2% from 191 million a quarter ago. The market was looking for 192 million DAU for the quarter. Snap's average quarterly revenues per user (ARPU) increased 34% to $1.40 compared with $1.05 a year ago and beating the market's forecast of $1.30.Snap also issued its first revenue guidance. For the third quarter, it expects revenue between $265 million and $290 million or a growth between 27% and 39%. Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be between $(185) million and $(160) million compared to $(179) million in Q3 2017.During the quarter, Snap introduced Group Video Chat that allows video chat with up to 16 friends at one time.Snap also introduced Lens Explorer that makes it easy to discover and unlock Lenses built by Snapchat users around the world. Since the launch of Lens Studio in late 2017, creators have submitted over 100,000 unique Lenses that have been viewed by Snapchat users over 3.5 billion times.It also ventured into augmented reality with Snappables, new Lenses for sharing augmented reality experiences with one or many friends. Users can control Snappables using touch, motion, and facial expressions.Snap has also released a new version of Spectacles, which has a smaller profile and is water resistant. Users can record videos with improved audio as well as press and hold to take a photo. Snaps captured transfer to Snapchat in HD up to 4 times faster than the original version of Spectacles.Snap has also introduced Snap Kit to help developers build products powered by features of Snapchat. It has partnered with companies such as Pandora (NYSE:P) and Tinder so that Snapchat features can be shared within each of their platforms and on Snapchat.Snap has also made Snap Pixel available to all advertisers, regardless of size. Snap Pixel helps advertisers measure the cross-device impact of their campaigns. After its global release in Q2 2018, it has measured 70 million purchase events.Snap has also launched three new initiatives for campaign planning and analysis. Audience Insights help advertisers understand characteristics about Snap's audience, Advanced Location Targeting for better targeting with location and point + radius features, and Delivery Insights to understand campaign performance.Snap also launched two new initiatives to help content creators monetize via its programmatic marketplace. It brought Commercials, a non-skippable 6-second Snap Ad that appears in Discover Shows, to Ads Manager. It also launched its Private Marketplace, which is an invite-only tool within Ads Manager that publishers can use to allow specific advertisers to target their content.Analysts believe that the declining user numbers are due to the poorly received app redesign that separates personal messages of friends and family from those of celebrities and commercial accounts. It also changes the sorting of the Stories feed to focus on profiles most interacted with. Analysts believe that this change to Stories feed was in contrast to with Snap's image as a real-time platform.While the app redesign was a move to attract more users in the face of rising competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap still hasn't got it right.Its stock is trading at $11.89 with a market capitalization of $15.2 billion. It had listed at $17 in March last year. The stock is close to its 52-week low of $10.5 it hit in May this year. It hit a 52-week high of $21.22 in February this year. Before listing, Snap had raised $2.65 billion in its last funding round in May 2016 that valued it at $20 billion."

During their first day of trading (March 2nd 2017), shares rose as high as $26.05 and fell as low as $23.50 before closing at $24.48 a share, a 44% rise.More than 200M shares - the entire size of the IPO - changed hands during the first day of trading, accounting for circa 10% of the total volume of trading on the NYSE that day.Basically, this was the so-called swan- (or snap-) song for the Cygnus olor (aka ""mute swan""). Last week the stock traded as low as $9.62 (9/6/2018), a 67.32% drop since touching $29.44 on the second day of trading (3/3/2017)SNAP data by YChartsInterestingly, though accidentally, on the very date (9/6/2018) when SNAP reached an all-time low, Twitter (TWTR) closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since September 2017.Last Friday, the stock traded as low as $ 29.82, down 37.6% from its high of $47.79 (6/15/2018)TWTR data by YChartsIt seems like social media networks are having rough times and there are plenty of reasons for this downtrend:Nonetheless, it's important to note that there are three main differences between TWTR and SNAP.On March 1st 2017, the Snapchat's IPO, Twitter market cap was $11B while Snapchat market cap was $28B. Today, however, Twitter market cap is over $23B while Snapchat market cap is lower than $13BSNAP Market Cap data by YChartsOver the past year, TWTR is already making money (positive EPS) while SNAP still seems far from reaching a break-even pointTWTR EPS Basic (Quarterly) data by YChartsWhile the short interest of TWTR (as % of float) remains stable in the single-digit, that of SNAP has tripled and even now - after the stock lost 2/3 of its value - remains above 20%TWTR Short Interest data by YChartsBottom line: Two social media networks that deal with similar problem and one mighty big brother (Facebook).

4199616,76115,2018-08-15T21:08:59-04:00,"A key highlight from Snap's Q2 earnings was its loss of users in all regions.
        This is unique compared to other social media, not inline.
        A decline in users is expected to continue into Q3.
        This creates a flawed valuation when using the ARPU metric as it's designed to express growth using two growing inputs.","A main aspect of Snap's (SNAP) recent earnings report was user growth and it not, well, growing. With less daily active users (DAUs) worldwide than last quarter, Snap is clearly showing signs its ability to attract and keep users is weak. Considering there are nearly 4.2B internet users on the planet, this puts Snap at only a 4.5% penetration of this population. Compare this to Facebook's daily active user penetration (FB) of 35%, Instagram's of 16.6%, and Twitter's (TWTR) of 6.2%.You might then say Snap has the largest potential out of all of them.And you'd be right ... except ......user growth has now turned negative, indicating weakness in the ability to attract new users and keep users it already has - putting serious doubt in this potential.The difference between Snap, Facebook, and Twitter is not just the growth of users, or lack thereof, but the regions in which users grew and users declined.What I found stunning in the wake of earnings was the consideration to put all of the above named social media apps in one basket and say the story is the same. A news post on Seeking Alpha suggested Snap ""saw user growth decline, in line with other social media companies facing user dips this quarter.""This couldn't be further from the truth.In fact, not only did Facebook and Instagram see overall users grow but the regions in which they lost users was limited. Snap on the other hand lost users in every region.(Source: Snap's Q2 10-Q)As the above charts show, user growth in North America, Europe, and Rest of World all declined by 1M users. One would expect North American and European users to decline - which would have been inline with other social media - but losing users in emerging markets outside of developed regions is an indication user decline is deeper than status quo.Compare this to Facebook's user loss being contained to Europe while it grew users in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World by 17M and 8M, respectively.(Source: Facebook's Q2 2018 Earnings Slides)Now you might say this loss for Snap is transient in nature or a bump in the road, but there are expectations for user declines to continue in Q3 as well. In fact, Morgan Stanley expects users to decline to 183M during the current quarter. Not only would this be a loss of DAUs for two straight quarters but an acceleration of this daily user decline.But why is user growth or user loss so important? Because ARPU (average revenue per user) is important and ARPU only is meaningful if revenue and active users are increasing.A lower denominator - a bad business sign in this equation - and a stagnant or growing numerator shows an increase in ARPU but misleads investors into thinking the company is doing well or becoming more profitable because the quotient increases. The reliance on ARPU is dangerous without taking both the top and bottom numbers into secluded consideration. Going back to Morgan Stanley's estimates, we can combine it with Snap's guidance and see how ARPU increases more significantly than if DAUs were where they ""should be"" in the low 190's.But first, where has ARPU gone in the last several quarters; essentially following social media seasonality - which is fine.However, if DAUs in Q2 actually had increased to analysts' estimates of 192M, ARPU would have been $1.36 - or 29.5% growth. Looking ahead, with Q3's guidance and Morgan Stanley's user estimates, ARPU will be $1.52 - good for 30% growth. But if user growth was on a trajectory most had expected, users would have reached 195M by Q3 and ARPU would have been $1.42, or only 21% growth.This exercise may be somewhat misleading since typically more users means higher revenues due to the ability to show ads to more people. However, even keeping pace with higher revenues and higher users fails to prove better than the reality of guidance and a declining DAU count. For example, using $290M for Q3 instead of $277M along with 195M users instead of 183M only yields $1.48 in ARPU, short of the $1.52 which likely will be issued three months from now.This exercise shows ARPU by itself is not a valuable metric without looking at the numbers beneath. When one of the input numbers begins to reverse and head in the other direction (read: decline), ARPU gets skewed to show higher growth than the business actually produces.Snap's user loss isn't just detrimental to the health of the business and the ability to attract advertisers, but it's also detrimental to the valuation given to the company based on metrics such as ARPU. This metric is only useful for companies who have growth on both the numerator and the denominator. Reducing the denominator has deceptive consequences and leads investors down a path which not only undermines the meaning of ARPU but also the valuation of the stock.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Snap and other tech companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4204550,24849,2018-09-06T13:15:07-04:00,Shares finally fall below $10 a share.New spectacles aren't going to help.Capital raise to be even more painful.,"It seemed like it was just a matter of time. More than a year ago, I presented the idea that camera company Snap (SNAP) could see its shares fall into the single digits. While it may have taken longer than initially expected, the time is here now as shares lost $10 on Thursday morning. Unfortunately for investors, the worst may not be over anytime soon.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)The latest leg down has come as part of a recent technology sector selloff. Yesterday, social media giants Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) declined as leaders from the two companies testified in front of Congress, sparking a debate over the future of this space. The declines have continued today, with the NASDAQ down more than 1% for the second straight session, and Snap has lost $10 as a result.I think part of the reason why Snap isn't doing well has to do with investors increasingly questioning the long term plan. As you can see in the image below, the company has released a second version of its Spectacles product, and the first wasn't exactly a blockbuster. As seen on page 41 of the 10-K filing for last year, Snap recorded a nearly $40 million charge related to excess inventory and purchase commitments related to its Spectacles.(Source: Snap via Verge article, seen here)This recent drop in the stock has come since the company's Q2 earnings report. While the initial headlines looked positive, a breakdown of the results send the stock crashing from its post release high of $14.90. Guidance was below street expectations, which has sent analysts rushing to cut their forecasts yet again. When 2018 started, the average street forecast called for $1.30 billion in revenues this year, but that number is now just $1.15 billion.One of Snap's biggest problems since going public is that it hasn't been able to continue strong growth of its user base. As you can see in the graphic below, the number of daily active users actually declined sequentially in Q2 2018, and the year over year growth rate has plummeted from 65% to 8% in the past two years. With Snap adding 14 million users in the back half of last year, the comparison periods only become harder moving forward.(Source: Snap Q2 2018 10-Q filing, seen here)The other major problem is that the company's financial situation is much worse than that of Facebook and Twitter. While the two social media giants have strong balance sheets and are delivering GAAP profits, Snap is a big money loser and is burning through cash at an alarming rate. It is only a matter of time before a capital raise is needed. Unfortunately with the stock dropping and interest rates rising, a debt or equity deal will be much more painful for investors than it would have been even just a few months ago.Snap shares cracked $10 for the first time on Thursday, and I don't think investors should believe the decline is over. Tech names like this are facing increasing scrutiny and investors are bailing, and Snap is in a much worse place than Twitter or Facebook. It remains to be seen if the second version of Spectacles can gain any traction, but I doubt they will make a big impact on the company's struggling financials. As we move further towards a capital raise thanks to large losses and cash burn, it would not surprise me to see this stock fall further."
4198318,102870,2018-08-12T17:01:58-04:00,"With 15% of its float sold short valued at about $1.35 billion, Snap has become a notable battle ground stock.So, why is Snap this heavily shorted? Well, there are quite a few reasons why many investors believe Snap is overvalued.But despite the high short interest Snap remains an incredibly dangerous stock to short.Snap's earnings show that the company is becoming more profitable, and its achieving its profitability goals faster than many analysts had anticipated.Snap's recent slowdown and sequential decline in DAUs could turn out to be a transitory phenomenon, and user growth should return going forward.","Source: TechCrunch.comSnap Inc. (SNAP) has only been trading as a public company for roughly 18-months, but in this short time the company has become quite a battleground stock for bulls and bears. In fact, roughly 15% of the company’s float is sold short right now, a position equivalent to about $1.35 billion.So, why is Snap this heavily shorted? Well, there is the projected 2018 13.5X sales valuation, the redesign debacle, the decline in user growth, and various other factors why many investors believe Snap is overvalued.Snap 1-Year Chart Source: StockCharts.com - It's been a rocky ride, but Snap is essentially flat over the past 52-weeks. It's not all bad news. Snap’s recent earnings show that the company is becoming more profitable. Additionally, there is compelling evidence that suggests the recent slowdown and slight decline in user growth may be transitory in nature. Also, several elements imply that despite Snap’s relatively rich valuation the company is a very dangerous short. Ultimately, investors may be surprised by Snap’s profitability potential, user growth will likely return, and the company’s stock should go substantially higher from here.One of the first elements that jumps out is that Snap beat substantially on revenues, despite the lower than expected number of DAUs. Additionally, the company’s ARPU was much higher than expected. As a result, the company is becoming more profitable, delivering a smaller than expected loss for the quarter.How is Snap improving profitability? Snap substantially lowered its overall operating costs and expense over the same period last year while growing revenues at 44.4%, which is rather remarkable. The company’s R&D expenses dropped by 20% YoY, and G&A expenses declined by 6.5%. Moreover, YoY Snap’s H1 2018 loss narrowed substantially over last year, improving by roughly 4.2 X or 320% from H1 2017.Snap's Income Statement Source: SEC.govThe bad news is that the company guided slightly lower on revenues than some analysts expected. This is likely due to the slightly lower than expected user growth. However, Snap tends to surpass earnings estimates much of the time as the company has beat its EPS estimates by an average of roughly 17% the past 3 quarters. Therefore, Snap could easily beat its forward revenue targets, especially if user growth stabilizes and/or resumes its trend higher.Snap's EPS HistorySource: Nasdaq.comAlso, the company guided for higher EBITDA than analysts expected, suggesting that Snap will likely continue to beat EPS targets. Higher ARPU also implies Snap’s profitability will likely continue to surprise higher. Moreover, profitability should increase substantially when Snap’s user base resumes its growth again.There is a lot of noise about Snap’s DAU drop, but the bottom line is that it is not unexpected. Snap’s faulty and unsuccessful redesign launched early this year caused a big stirrup, alienating users and impacting the company’s user growth and revenues. However, since the problems were recognized, the company has taken significant strides to alleviate the redesign issues, and has returned many of the key features back to the way they were before the update.Snap's DAU GrowthSource: Statista.com Therefore, the 1.6% sequential decline in DAUs from last quarter is not the end of the world for Snap. After all, we knew that many users were not happy with the company’s update, we knew that user growth would likely stall or decline temporarily due to the issues, but the important thing is that one quarter does not make a trend. Even if there is a slight sequential decline in DAUs next quarter, it still would not be considered a tragedy growth wise.I will start to become concerned if DAUs continue to decline sequentially for several quarters. For instance, if we continue to see DAUs falter in Q3, and in Q4, then there is likely a deeper, more serious structural problem with Snap’s growth. But until then, this is still likely a transient phenomenon due to the redesign issues from earlier this year. I expect DAU growth to recover and pick back up by the end of this year.However, due to the uncertainty surrounding Snap’s DAUs the stock likely has very limited upside potential between now and the company’s next earnings call, barring any unexpected positive news. Q3 and Q4 results will be instrumental in illustrating the future for Snap’s growth prospects. However, risk is now to the upside in Snap, as expectations are extremely low, estimates have been brought down, and any positive news regarding user growth and/or improved profitability could send the company’s shares surging following next quarter’s earnings announcement.Quite a large portion of Snap’s shares are sold short right now, 110 million shares, worth about $1.35 billion. This represents about 15% of the company’s float. Although Snap appears overvalued from a traditional valuation standpoint it remains an incredibly dangerous stock to short for several reasons.First, it is still an incredibly fast growing business. Despite the likely transitory slowdown in user growth, Snap just clocked in a 44.4% revenues growth quarter. In addition, the company is set to expand full year revenues by over 40% this year, and is expected to do the same next year. Will, the company’s revenue growth slow down due to worsening user growth performance? It’s possible, but at the same time the opposite could turn out to be true as well.Second, with nearly 200 million DAUs Snap is an incredible platform for advertisers, and the company continuously reports better than expected ad related data, and profitability metrics. Reporting an 8% higher than expected ARPU, and growing ad revenues by nearly 50% YoY are not small accomplishments and suggest the company will likely continue to become more profitable due to strong ad revenues, especially once its DAUs start growing again.Third, and probably the single most obvious reason I would not short Snap is because it can become a takeover target at any moment. In fact, the company represents a compelling takeover play for numerous internet and/or media giants aiming to block Facebook’s (FB) near monopoly in social media. Provided that they could find their way around antitrust issues, I could easily see either Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), or another suitor putting in a bid to acquire Snap down the line.The bottom line is that Snap has only been trading as a public company for about 18-months, it is essentially just getting started, but it seems clear that the company has enormous long-term potential. Despite being substantially lower than its post IPO highs Snap’s stock is not likely to stay down for long. The company is becoming increasingly more profitable, and it’s doing it at a more rapid pace than most analysts had anticipated. In addition, the DAU slowdown could prove to be a transient phenomenon due to the company’s temporary redesign folly. Furthermore, Snap deserves to have a permeant takeover premium factored into its stock price. Therefore, and despite having somewhat limited short-term upside potential Snap’s stock is likely to trade significantly higher longer-term.If you enjoyed reading this article, hit the ""Like"" button, and if you'd like insight about my future ideas, press the ""Follow"" link.

4197547,103511,2018-08-10T04:05:08-04:00,"Snapchat's quarter saw increasing revenue and milder losses, but daily active users decline for the first time.
        DAU went from 191 million in Q1 2018 to 188 in Q2 2018, a roughly 1.5% drop but nonetheless worrying as a fundamental metric for the already ailing-platform.
        The elephant in the room remains that Instagram is eating up a lot of Snapchat's potential activity and business, as its stories are similar in many ways.
        Snapchat is having trouble finding a niche that differentiates it from Instagram, as Instagram benefits from its wider integration with the Facebook platform.
        The company needs to achieve scale to begin to be profitable but current trends make that seemingly a distant prospect.","Snapchat (SNAP) recently posted Q2 2018 earnings that were notable both because they showed a somewhat improving revenue and losses situation even amid a worrying drop of about 3 million daily active users.The platform needs increased user activity to achieve the critical mass to then achieve profitability and earnings. However the rapid growth of Instagram and it essentially incorporating ""stories"" as well into it and the wider Facebook system makes it difficult for Snapchat to have a unique draw to the app.I remain pessimistic on the company unless it can find some clear user proposition that makes it perhaps a niche app in comparison to the more broad-based Instagram. While Snapchat is seemingly trying to experiment with significant new designs and functionality, I remain hesitant on if any of it can materialize in something that is special enough to turn the company around.From a financials standpoint, Snapchat's Q2 2018 wasn't too bad. A reduction in quarterly net loss from -$443 million last year to -$353 million is an improvement. Similarly, the $262 million in revenue is a 49% improvement from last year's $181 million. However free cash flow remained steady at $234 million to last year's $228 million and the company still loses more than it actually brings in as revenue. The guidance for Q3 2018 also doesn't show any major signs of life at the moment, with similar revenue growth but a loss that remains unchanged year-on-year.I believe the major issue for Snapchat is user activity, as it is the fundamental driver behind advertising revenue. The company's 188 million DAU in Q2 2018 was a 8% increase year-on-year but was still down about 2% from Q1 2018's 191 million. Snapchat blamed it on the dramatically revamped app it released, which completely changed much of its functionality in ways it believes addresses long-standing complaints with it.However I believe such solutions are mere bandages to the real problem, which is essentially that Snapchat faces major competition that is constantly drawing away user activity from it - and that is Instagram (FB).Indeed, with over a billion monthly active users, an estimated valuation of $100 billion were it a solo company, 400 million daily active users and adding far more monthly active users in 2017 than Snapchat has in total daily active users (Snapchat does not release MAU metrics) Instagram is a force to be reckoned with.Instagram officially launched its stories feature in August 2016, several months before Snapchat's IPO in March 2017. Based on Snapchat's initial earnings we do have a glimpse of Snapchat's daily active user growth prior to its IPO, in which it posted 36% year-on-year daily active user growth in Q1 2017. In Q1 2017 it had 166 million DAUs compared to Q1 2016's 122 million.However since then year-on-year DAU growth has slowed dramatically, undoubtedly with it being no coincidence that Instagram's stories have gained prominence in the meantime.As shown below, once Instagram's stories came out around Q3 to Q4 2016 the average DAU additions dropped dramatically from what seemed to be some momentum in the few quarters prior.(Source: Snapchat Q2 2018 Earnings)Fundamentally it appears Instagram's stories and Snapchat's stories are interchangeable in all widely-used functionality, ranging from their disappearing video nature to additional filters and tagging. However Instagram benefits from its connection to a far wider ecosystem of functions and uses, which specifically include the Instagram app itself with pictures and now the ""IGTV"" longer-form videos as well as the broader Facebook network.(Source: TechCrunch)Indeed, as Snapchat's ""stories"" appear to not be patentable it seems that other competitors have drained Snapchat's distinctiveness that drove its original growth. With no way to appeal to a particular market or separate itself out from the pack, Snapchat's user growth has languished and seems to sow little sign of reversing itself.Even as Snapchat has found some ways to increase its average revenue per user and revamp the app in other ways, it still seems a far way from finding some kind of unique feature or appeal that can secure its user activity growth without disrupting its ""legacy users.""User activity growth remains the essence for most social media and Internet services companies' advertising revenue growth. In Snapchat's case, as it is still in deep-red 'startup' territory for a tech company, it is the key to it ever becoming profitable.This quarter's results provide little hope of a turnaround in my opinion. Snapchat could still find that golden egg but it doesn't seem to have any leads at the moment, and in the meantime Instagram, even with its stories feature being released almost 5 years after Snapchat's release, is eating up potential users in a way that may be very difficult to latch them off.After all, remember that Snapchat's task is now made even more difficult by that it doesn't just have to draw people in to using a stories feature, but needs to also more draw them 'away' from apps like Instagram and Facebook.At $15.8 billion, Snapchat is in my opinion still overvalued given its growth prospects and trajectory. Instagram is worth an estimated $100 billion at the moment and has a high-potential trajectory yet features much more than Snapchat does, as well as far more users.Snapchat's may still find a new market to make itself focused on but doing so may disrupt its remaining users already on the platform and change the company's base significant, as MySpace's post-collapse transition similarly did.And that is the optimistic case - I think the company will have a very difficult time achieving the scale as a solo-company to reach real profitability anytime soon, if ever."
4198580,104686,2018-08-13T13:05:34-04:00,Snapchat currently faces a lot of criticism because of its drop in daily average users (DAU).Company is monetizing the platform at a productive rate.The product keeps customers engaged more than any other social media platform and this is largely overlooked.The board is increasing investment to engage users with the product.Marketers love Snapchat and short-term investors fail to see the bigger picture.,"Snapchat’s (NYSE:SNAP) stock hasn’t had a smooth ride in the past year. The highly controversial redesign, that gained attention when Kylie Jenner infamously tweeted “Sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad,” provoked an army of shorts to knock 40% off the market cap. Since then, the Kardashians have continued to use Snapchat and regularly use it to post pictures of their babies but the stock continues to drop.I don’t need to go further into the negative media coverage of the company - I’m sure you’ve all been keeping up with it. However, all this bad news clouding the stock provides an opportunity for long-term investors to ""buy the dip"" of a great company at a discount relative to peers.When Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO’d there were significant doubts about whether the company would ever be a good investment, citing reasons such as slow user growth, a lack of effort to monetize the fact that users were more satisfied with other products.In 2006, people were even boycotting Facebook and were outraged due to a poor redesign (News Feed).Sound familiar?For example, here's what contributors on Seeking Alpha thought:Source: Seeking AlphaFor those of you who continue to follow Facebook, you know how wrong these people were. As soon as FB stock started to see a return, they brought Sheryl Sandberg in to monetize the platform. In a flash, sentiment transitioned and investors began to see positive news and a scurry of analysts' upgrades.It is important to note that Snapchat has withstood the test of time in a marketplace that is determined by trends and user happiness. But it still remains as so; Snapchat is the most used platform for young adults and teens even through a storm of social media trends and increased competition. Social media may be an overcrowded market, but with 78% of 18-24-year-olds using Snapchat, continued success and growth are imminent.Source: StatisticaThere is a big concern with the short-term drop in DAU in 2Q18, from 191 to 188, and can largely explain the big dip after the Q2 earnings report. Although you see a drop from the previous quarter, there was a 40% increase YoY. People have made grandiose assumptions that this drop in user proves that Snapchat is the next MySpace (falling out of favor as the next big thing comes along). But to base this egregious assumption on one quarter is the epitome of what you call myopic.Source: StatisticaI'll admit it, the redesign wasn't a hit amongst the younger generation. However, the great thing about an early stage tech company and especially companies that come out of Silicon Valley - they are adaptable and always willing to change. Evan Spiegel admitted that the redesign was a bad idea on the last earnings call and he has stated: “We feel that we have now addressed the biggest frustrations we’ve heard and are eager to make more progress on the tremendous opportunity we now have to show more of the right content to the right people.”The reason Facebook never saw a drop in DAU during their poor redesign was simply that users had no other options; when Facebook fixed its issues, growth sustained and more people were coming back to the app. Snapchat's DAU drop comes at a time where there is a new social media app coming out almost every month and like Facebook's troubles, this too will pass.Although the dip in DAU raises concern for investors, the real customers of Snapchat - advertisers and media companies will NEVER stop marketing on the platform because of the high engagement each user has relative to other platforms. To compare Snapchat to other companies using DAU doesn’t fit the playbook because Snapchat isn’t focused on metrics, it's trying to improve the engagement users have with their product.The average time spent on Snapchat per day is 30+ minutes. To compare that to the more popular platforms: the average Facebook user spends 20 minutes per day, the average Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user spends 160 minutes per month (approximately 6 minutes per day). Based on this metric alone, Snapchat is bounds above the competition.The purpose of Snapchat was to mimic human conversation by using disappearing messages and photos to interact with a small number of friends. This largely appeals to Gen Z'ers - people who enjoy sharing real-life moments.Snapchat helps advertisers create interactions with their customers. “Snap ads are mobile, interactive video ads with 5X higher swipe-up rate than the average click-through rate for other comparable social platforms.” This is important because Gen Z'ers tend to have a shorter attention span and ads don't engage them anymore. Growing up with phones and the internet, they see ads everywhere and generally scroll past them.On average, marketers have an average of 8 seconds to reach them before they aren't interested. Also, if Gen-Z consumers help produce or create the message, they’ll be more responsive to it and the best way to do that right now is through Snapchat.For those of you who have never opened Snapchat before, businesses have the following ways to advertise on Snapchat:Source: Mudd3. Lenses: Lenses are the most playful and memorable way to increase awareness, on a massive scale. A lot of these go viral, especially when they are fun, silly and engaging.For once in social media advertising, marketers have the ability to engage users with ads. For example, ""the Gatorade Snap Ads campaign was actually a mini-game within Snapchat. When the user swiped up, they were able to play an 8-bit version of a tennis game that celebrated Serena Williams’ 23rd Grand Slam victory. The average time spent in this ad was over 3 minutes."" Facebook was never able to see numbers like this.Furthermore, the Taco Bell Snapchat Sponsored Lens received over 224 million views. ""Also, Snapchatters tend to play with Sponsored Lenses for an average of 20 seconds. Think about that last sentence for a second. People on Snapchat “play” with ads. On most other platforms, people hate ads. On Snapchat, users play with them.""Source: Business InsiderOther notable customers that have seen quantified success using Snapchat include, HiSmile, BMW, Michael Kors, Buzzfeed, E!. For a comprehensive list, check out more of their success stories.The future of marketing is being able to create ads that keep people engaged. In our opinion, Snapchat is leaps and bound ahead of its comparable competition and has disrupted the marketing industry.To get any engagement on a Facebook or Instagram ad, you have to pay up. For this reason, Facebook's engagement is on a downhill slope and advertisers will be looking for new platforms with a higher ROI.Source: Buffer SocialSnapchat's revenues have been growing at a much faster rate when compared to that of Facebook's. This is an indication that Snap's monetization strategies have been working and signals positive moves forward in ad revenue going forward for the company.Although Snapchat saw a decrease in DAU this quarter, its average revenue per user (ARPU) went up significantly in 2Q18. ARPU was $1.40 in the second quarter of 2018, up from $1.05 a year ago and up from $1.21 in the first quarter of 2018. This shows that it continues to make significant improvements in monetizing their user base.Source: Company 10-QAs investors, we fear the DAU tells a story of a progressively declining user base and are correct in having slight reservations. I for one am not fearful because Snapchat has the future generation backing its cause and a rapidly increasing ARPU. Continuing to monetize the platform is where the real challenge comes into play, and thus far, Snapchat has nothing to worry about.Snapchat has been monetizing since 2015 and has shown significant revenue growth and an ability to attract advertisers. Although it faces direct competition from Instagram, its ability to engage users with advertisements is second to none.All this goes to show that Snapchat can’t be compared to the fate of Myspace. What the company has is truly unique, and advertisers are jumping on the opportunity to promote their brands on the platform. With innovations in the discover page, brands can promote their product and generate a higher ROI when compared to traditional social media platforms. We believe that advertisers are starting to realize the potential of accessing users through this platform and will spend more money on Snapchat advertising compared to that of the company’s comparables.Snapchat provides an enormous amount of value for advertisers and has just been a major victim of negative media attention lately due to the redesign. You don't have to take my word for it either - look at Facebook's stock amidst all the pessimism and what do you see? A direct correlation with the investor sentiment that gave bullish investors the sale of a lifetime. The nerves will continue to run high as the third quarter commences so the next few weeks will not be your best entry point. Wait until the waves settle and make your splash as the bears become quiet because Snapchat (like the future) isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's just getting started."
4198750,104703,2018-08-13T19:18:27-04:00,"Snap's current narrative is grim.The valuation is excessive, and the stock does not look like a buy until it heads below $8.I use DCF to calculate fair value.","Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome MangoTree Analysis as a new contributor.

Click here to find out more »Snap (NYSE:SNAP) recently disclosed its Q2 results, with revenues beating estimates at $262 million compared to targets of roughly $251 million. EPS also beat at -$0.14 compared to estimates of -$0.17. ARPU also came in higher, at $1.40 compared to estimates of $1.30. However, for the first time in Snapchat's history, it lost users. Analysts had expected 192 million DAUs, up from 191 million in Q1. However, Snap announced its total DAU count fell by 3 million, to just 188 million. So, while revenues did beat this quarter, they won't continue to beat if DAUs don't start growing again. This was evident in Snap's revenue guidance, where they guided for $277.5 million in revenue this next quarter compared to targets of $290.1 million. If DAUs don't get back on track, Snap's revenue growth will get cut even further. And right now, the valuation is too high for the volatility of the user base.(Source: Syracuse University)First of all, let's analyze why advertisers might want to advertise on the internet. Advertisers want three things. The first is user growth. The second is accurate targeting. The third is based on the demographics of the target audience. Let's talk about user growth. A key goal for advertisers is to pay premium for a larger target audience. Having more users and higher growth in the platform as a whole can benefit the advertiser, as they can have more reach. Even before the Q2 print, DAU growth was dramatically slowing. Now, DAUs are going negative. The ecosystem is shrinking. A shrinking ecosystem is something that advertisers never want to advertise on. Competitor Instagram, on the other hand, has grown their MAUs by 25% from 800M to 1B since September of last year.(Source: TechCrunch)Though Instagram targets millennials and Snapchat is more towards Generation Z, Instagram and Snapchat are usually thrown in the same basket. As such, the target audience on Instagram is much larger and the growth is only accelerating. Not to mention, Instagram's ability to take any somewhat successful Snapchat feature and making it better on the Instagram platform. Such features include Instagram Stories and Filters. Instagram Stories alone has 440M DAUs, roughly triple the size of Snapchat as a whole. So right now, if advertisers are looking for a youth play, Instagram is the top pick, while Snapchat is the number two pick. In terms of accurate targeting, Snap has made clear that they are not going to target their users by mining their personal data like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) do. The user base may appreciate this, but it will make Snapchat much less economic for advertisers. In advertising, data is the name of the game. The more data you have, the better targeting you have. The better targeting you have, the higher the premium advertisers are willing to pay. Snapchat is significantly lagging the competition in terms of targeting its users for better advertisements. And finally, in terms of the demographics of the audience, Snapchat is definitely the youngest. And eventually, the Snapchat audience will be the most important one in terms of consumption, meaning the Gen-Z will be where advertisers will target. However, right now, Gen-Z just isn't able to spend money on products as they aren't producing much of their own income. As such, advertisers aren't going to get high ROI if the targets don't see the advertisements. So right now, Snapchat is the speculative play if you want to advertise a product.That all being said, Snap is still the only publicly-traded augmented reality pure-play on the market. Snap's geofilters and lenses will allow for a more engaged audience when it comes to advertising, as the ads are much for fun and interactive. Snapchat is trying to push out mini-games on the Snapchat platform in the form of advertisements. For example, in order to advertise a Nike sneaker, there was a mini-game advertisement that allowed to kick a soccer ball into a net with the product on. Though it may seem very simple, the progress Snapchat is making in mini-game advertisements is undeniable. Then there is gaming.(Source: TechCrunch)Snap announced that it is launching its own in-app gaming platform in the fall, mainly using augmented reality related programs. While Snapchat's user base may be less engaged and falling right now, Snap could turn it around with a gaming platform. In the past, CEO Evan Spiegel has stated how much he admires what Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) does in mobile gaming. Now, I'm not saying that gaming on Snapchat will reach the levels that it has reached on Tencent, but it could help reinvigorate user growth and help ARPU growth accelerate. It is a big opportunity for Snapchat, but if it is a flop like Snapcash was, then Snapchat could start to go the route of Myspace. For one thing, Facebook is already in AR gaming. Though it wasn't a hit, they do have Facebook Messenger Live face chat like gaming platforms. Again, these are simple games, but Facebook is invested in AR gaming as well. Facebook has proven that it can take anything that Snapchat does and successfully copy it while hurting the original feature on Snapchat. If gaming on Snapchat does take off, Facebook can copy it into Instagram, and then Snapchat's user growth from gaming will die off again. And even if Snapchat's gaming portion does take off, who is to say that it will be profitable? Right now, Snapchat's cloud bill is massive at well over $600 million per year. These cloud bills will only increase if more users join the platform and augmented reality and gaming takes more than the current amount of server space Snapchat has. The point is that despite the potential for huge revenue and user growth, the long-term view is that Facebook can just copy Snapchat's features and make more popular features on Instagram.Now on to the valuation of the stock. Snap is presently valued at a massive valuation of 13.5X 2018 sales estimates. But if we want to dig deeper into the exact valuation of Snap's stock, then we should use a discounted cash flow model (DCF). For my DCF model, I'll go out ten years and use 13% as the discount factor (WACC). These are my estimates.(Source: my estimates)I am also assuming that the growth plus the discount rate minus the long-term growth rate will equal 0.05. This gets me an enterprise value of $9,950.02 million. To get to the market cap, you have to add the cash of $1,586 million and subtract the debt of $390 million. This gives us a market cap of $10,786.02 million. On 1.295 billion shares, the fair share price is $8.32. Just for the sake of having a round number though I'll call it $8. However, a key weakness with DCF is the extent of accuracy of each and every one of my estimates. A slight change to any one of the estimates can materially change the fair value of the stock. Factors like accounts payable and accounts receivable aren't as easy to predict as say revenue or even EPS. So, if you want a more standard way to value Snap, then just look at the forward P/E on 2028 earnings. Assuming the $1.37/share earnings estimate is correct, let's slap a 30X hyper growth multiple on that. We get a $41.10 share price. If you discount the share price back 13% every year, the 2018 fair value is ~$10. Either way, the stock is tremendously overvalued.Despite having massive quarterly cash burn, Snap has relatively little debt. Currently, they have ~$1,586 million in cash, with just $390 million in debt. If the company wants to embark on a new growth avenue, then it might not even need to dilute shareholders, it could issue private debt through a loan from a bank or issue a multi-year term maturity bond. The company could make a big push now into augmented reality since their almost non-debt balance sheet can pick up a new debt load, allowing growth to accelerate again.(Source: Snap Q2 Earnings Slides)One decent risk to my bear thesis, however, is a buyout. A few years ago, Facebook looked to buy Snap for $3 billion. CEO Evan Spiegel rejected. There were also rumors that Google looked to buy Snap for roughly $30 billion, a significant premium to the current share price. And while I'm bearish on Snap's stock, there are plenty of large technology companies out there that don't have a true social media presence that might want in on Snap. And while the multiple is extravagant and the current narrative is grim, some larger tech firms might want in on Snap. The main company that comes to mind is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Recently, two executives have left Amazon for Snap, and in some of Snap's code, it showed that the company was doing integrated search with Amazon. That code has since been removed. Despite that, Amazon has no true social media presence. Sure, they own Twitch, but Twitch is a niche market product mainly for live-streaming of video games. But Snap has a much larger user base, and eventually as my model shows, Snap could be profitable. Amazon also does like to help grow its business via M&A, with recent PillPack takeover coming to mind. I wouldn't bet on Amazon buying out Snap, as the partnership between the two that was indicated in Snap's code is no longer existent, but I could see how a big fish wouldn't mind buying smaller Snap.All in all though Snap isn't a value play, at least not yet. The stock seems overvalued above $8, and I would caution investors away from investing long in it. Obviously, I'm not a financial advisor, and this is just my opinion. But right now, Snap is overvalued. If you are a speculator, then maybe Snap's management can pull a rabbit out of their hat and turn the company around. But don't bet on it."
4196246,67855,2018-08-08T03:54:32-04:00,"DAUs grew 8% year over year but dropped by 3 million from Q1.
        Declining DAUs can be attributed to the app redesign, but regaining momentum is difficult for a social media platform.
        Poor revenue guidance reflects declining DAUs and the fact that the management will have to choose between monetization and user retention.
        With revenue growth possibly slowing to the high 20s, I don't think the stock deserves to trade at 14x sales.","Snap (SNAP) beat on top and bottom line on Tuesday and investors reacted favorably initially. However, the numbers that I’m seeing are quite concerning.As a stock priced for growth (negative earnings, 14x P/S), the company must continue to deliver on all fronts. Unfortunately for the bulls, the company posted its first ever quarterly decline in DAUs and Q3’s revenue guidance pointed to meaningful revenue growth deceleration.Source: slashgear.comSnap grew DAUs by 8% year over year from 173 million to 188 million, however, this represented a 2% sequential decline from 191 million in Q1.As I mentioned in my Twitter (TWTR) article, DAUs are extremely important for social media companies as they represent heavy users who are highly engaged with the app, and are thus the main revenue generators. The fact that the company is losing steam in DAU growth at just 188 million is troubling. For comparison, Instagram Stories, which is just a single function of the overall app, achieved 400 million DAUs in June.Snap’s sequential decline can be explained by the controversial app redesign that drew heavy criticism from users. While some may view this as a one-time occurrence, this won’t be the first time that major redesigns completely destroyed a social media platform.Declining DAUs also implies that revenue growth will have to come from better monetization and that usually entails more user disruption (i.e. more ads), which may decrease engagement even further. In addition, user attrition snowballs very quickly. Just like how the network effect allows users to mushroom over a short period of time, the reverse is also true. Three million users stopped being DAUs because they are no longer (as) active on the platform, which will in turn cause their friends to be less active as well.I’m sure some of you are familiar with the following chart:Source: businessinsider.comWe can see that towards the end of Myspace, the company lost 10% of its user base in just one month. If Snap isn’t careful, I could see it following the same trajectory.The revenue guidance of $265 million to $290 million for Q3 implies a growth rate between 27% to 39%, which is a big step down from this quarter’s 44%. The midpoint of the guidance is also meaningfully below the analyst consensus of $290 million.I think the poor revenue outlook goes hand in hand with the aforementioned DAU decline. When users flee from the platform, not only does the company start to lose revenue right off the bat, the management also faces the difficult decision of prioritizing monetization (i.e. more ads) or user retention. This fine balancing act makes revenue growth more difficult.Considering that the value of the stock hinges on revenue growth, and now that growth is slowing down to the 30s and possibly the 20s, does the company still deserve to trade at 14x revenue? Based on current analyst estimates, revenue in 2019 is supposed to grow 45% over 2018’s estimate to $1.68 billion. Given the poor guidance, achieving this original estimate will likely be out of the question. Unless something changes in the near-term, I believe that a re-rating to a lower multiple is the likely outcome. For reference, Twitter is trading at just 8.5x 2018’s revenue estimate despite achieving double digit DAU growth last quarter.The market was initially positive on the earnings surprise, but based on the numbers, I believe that Snap will be having a lot of trouble in the coming quarters. Negative DAU growth is concerning given that Snap’s DAU is not even half of the DAU of a single function on Instagram. If DAU growth is not turned around soon, Snap could become another Myspace as user attrition will accelerate.On the financial side, Q3 revenue guidance was poor as well. I believe that this reflects the challenges that the company will face in the coming quarters given the DAU decline. I expect estimates to be revised downward and for the stock to be re-rated to a lower multiple accordingly."
4196138,92586,2018-08-07T21:57:11-04:00,"Snap's 2Q18 results seem to have sparked investor optimism at first glance, but I do not share the same enthusiasm.Even if ARPU and opex management looked decent, I am discouraged by the first ever sequential drop in daily active users.I continue to see Snap as a speculative stock to avoid, favoring an investment in peer Facebook instead.","This Tuesday, after the closing bell, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) delivered results that seem to have pleased the Street.With the stock up 5% in after-hours trading as I type this sentence, I gather that traders and investors must have been happy with revenues of $262.3 million that topped consensus by a healthy $11 million (the company's second top-line beat ever). Adjusted net loss of 14 cents looked better than consensus by three cents, on the surface suggesting that scale and cost management have helped the Californian company close the gap to breakeven by an inch or two.I hate to be that guy, skeptical amid the initial bullish reaction - but I do not share the same level of enthusiasm this evening. I believe Snap's results pointed at more of the same in regard to sluggish user growth, depressed margins and sizable cash burn that have yet to impress me.Let's unpack the numbers a bit.(Image Credit: Variety)Starting with the good, I was impressed to see blended ARPU of $1.40 top last year's number by a healthy 33%. As a reminder, I believe Snap can only be a sustainably profitable social media company if it can make significant improvements in monetization, and the early signs look mildly encouraging. The per-unit revenue improvement might have been facilitated by recent tweaks in app design, including the separation of friends’ and creators' Stories, that might have allowed the company to increase ad opportunities for media partners. The transition to programmatic auction, which was presented last quarter as a positive for advertiser ROI, might have also played a role.See ARPU trend below, including the projected path to $3.00 by the end of 2020 that I believe would be needed to justify an investment in SNAP. The dark-colored bars are reported numbers.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reports)But on the user side, I was disappointed to witness the first ever sequential drop in DAU (daily active users) to 188 million. The gap to consensus and to my own (more aggressive) estimate on this metric reached a sizable 5 million and 8 million, respectively. Disapproving of CEO Evan Spiegel's belief that ""bigger isn't better"", which suggests that the company's ""network may stay relatively small and intimate"", I believe Snap has to push user growth as aggressively as possible in order to create the scale that it needs to justify the rich $16.7 billion in the company's current market value.See the DAU trend below, along with my 2020 best-case projection of 322 million users that is looking more stale and unrealistic by the quarter.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reports)Operating cost was another item of importance that I had highlighted in my earnings preview. On that front, I believe Snap did a decent job at keeping opex under control, with a 16% YOY increase on an ex-SBC basis (versus 37% last quarter) helping to translate some of the revenue momentum into reduced op losses. Still, cash burn of nearly $200 million on a CFOA basis looked pretty scary for a company whose revenues have yet to reach the $300 million mark. Cash and equivalents now stand at $1.57 billion, versus more than $2 billion in the beginning of the year and $3.2 billion as of the date of Snap's first earnings release as a public company.Given the results of the most recent quarter, I cannot confidently say what will happen to SNAP tomorrow or in the next few weeks. History suggests that this stock is very sensitive to mood swings and could move wildly based on factors like short-covering and early morning sell-side analysis. But there was not much in the company's earnings report to change my mind and convince me that buying shares at current levels might make sense as a long-term strategy.I continue to see SNAP as a speculative stock to avoid, and believe a bet on peer Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) following recent weakness in its stock price is a much more reasonable play in the social media space."
4196110,22148,2018-08-07T20:33:17-04:00,Snap reported mixed Q2 results and Q3 guidance.The DAU slowdown wasn't a surprise and remains a prime reason Snap isn't a long-term stock to own.The free cash flow burn over $200 million each quarter will eventually sink the stock.Strong resistance remains around $14.,"My previous research highlighted the key resistance for Snap (SNAP) around $14. Despite a bearish thesis due to the lack of a business model, the stock offered the potential to make a run at $20. The Q2 results still don't support owning the stock long term.The big headline is that daily average users (DAUs) dipped to 188 million. The numbers slipped from Q1 levels by three million DAUs and hardly topped levels back in December.Source: Snap Q2'18 presentationNo doubt exists that the Snapchat redesign caused the DAU slowdown and the company is likely to return to some growth in future quarters. The problem though is that all of the financials are in horrible shape not allowing the company the time to improve the app.A prime example being revenue growth that, while still strong at 44%, YoY growth dipped from 54% in the prior quarter. The guidance shows a continuation of the negative trend with revenue guidance of 39% at the high end and down at only 27% at the low end of revenues actually dipping sequentially to $260 million.Analysts forecasted revenues at the high end so guidance suggests a potential big cut to Q3 estimates. The expectations for 40% growth next year have to be cut.Remember that Snap is making this Q3 prediction as the quarter is nearly halfway over. The suggestion in the prepared remarks is that risk is to the downside as DAUs are likely to remain weak during the quarter.The upgraded DAU numbers for stories still suggest that Instagram and all of the Facebook (FB) properties remain a huge problem. This handy chart from TechCrunch tells all the story an investor needs to know that Snapchat isn't going to suddenly return to wild growth that justifies the current valuation.Source: TechCrunchSnap continues to innovate via items like Group Video Chat, Snappables, and a new version of Spectacles, amongst other items. These developments would typically make the stock more appealing, but all of these improvements in the quarter did nothing to user growth or improve cash burn.For Q2, Snap saw free cash flow hit negative $234 million. The amount actually dipped $5 million from the prior Q2.Source: Snap Q2'18 presentationSure, the amount was elevated due to some one-time expenses for the corporate office move, but again, Snap isn't in a position to spend on expensive office digs. Important operating cash flows were down $11 million from last year to negative $199 million, but again, the amount nearly equals the revenue rate.The comments from the management team regarding cash flows continue to question whether CEO Evan Spiegel really has a grasp on running the business. This statement in the prepared remarks regarding cash burn remains far off track for a rational statement:These statements do not jive with the second worst free cash flow number since going public. Cash balances are down to only $1.57 billion from over $2.04 billion at the end of 2017.The cash balance will easily dip below $1.0 billion early next year, leaving Snap in the position of needing to raise funds to compete with large tech giants. Facebook is basically using the R&D department of Snap to maintain and grow a cash flow machine that will generate billions each year providing more ammunition to sink future costly developments at Snap.The key investor takeaway is that Snap remains a strong short candidate, if the stock trades below $14 on this Q2 report. With 1.5 billion shares outstanding, the social messaging company has a market value over $20 billion with no actual business model in sight. Losing DAUs while burning over $200 million in cash each quarter is a recipe for disaster. My only warning to shorts is that a break of $14 sets up a rally that is entirely possible based on irrational bulls that will side with the massive opportunity, if only Facebook didn't exist."
4196133,24849,2018-08-07T21:44:08-04:00,Company beat on top and bottom lines.Guidance was terrible and subscribers declined sequentially.Still major cash flow problems here.,"After the bell on Tuesday, camera maker Snap (SNAP) saw its shares initially rise as the company reported a top and bottom line beat. Of course, it's not hard to beat when estimates are cut so much. Additionally, a deeper dive into the report shows a different story, which likely means that shares will continue lower over the long run. We may already be seeing that as after-hours trading saw shares turn negative as I finished typing up this piece.(Source: cnbc.com)Snap came in with Q2 revenues of $262 million, which handily beat estimates for $251 million. However, we must keep in mind that after last quarter's disaster, the Street cut their average estimate by more than $41 million. On the bottom line, the 14 cent non-GAAP loss was better than expected by three cents, but of course two of those three cents came from in between quarter estimate cuts.While the company beat estimates for Q2, it also gave weak guidance for Q3 in what appears to be its first major guidance issuance. Revenues are forecast to come in a range of $265 million to $290 million, while the Street going into this report was at $290.1 million. Management is also guiding to another large negative EBITDA quarter, even if it shows slight improvement over last year's period.Here's the biggest problem: user growth. The company actually reported a sequential decline from 191 million daily users (""DAUs"") to 188 million. Six quarters ago, the year-over-year increase in DAUs was 48%, and now it is just 8%. For a company that needs more and more users, just a 1 million increase in the first half of the year is quite troubling.With the company continuing to report massive GAAP losses, it continues to burn through a tremendous amount of cash, as seen below. Free cash flow in the period was a negative $234 million, worse than Q2 2017, which annualizes out to almost $1 billion. I previously asked if a capital raise was coming soon, and at this rate, we likely will be seeing one in the next year because the cash amount will be at a troubling level.(Source: Snap earnings slides, seen here)Personally, I would continue to favor Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) at this point, especially after both names fell after their respective reports. Both of the social media giants have much better balance sheets and are showing some semblance of profitability. Snap has neither of those, which will make it harder to grow and attract users over time. At this point, I like the valuations of Facebook and Twitter better, and I'll have more on that angle in the coming weeks as we get the updated analyst estimates after this report.After beating on the top and bottom lines, Snap shares surged as high as $14.90 in after-hours trading. However, they had fallen into negative territory by 5:15 PM. Guidance for Q3 called for revenues well below Street estimates, and let's not forget that Q2 was only a beat due to massive estimate cuts. The company continues to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and burn through plenty of cash, and daily active users actually declined sequentially. It would not surprise me if shares move lower still as this report is further digested."
4186403,22148,2018-07-10T13:08:32-04:00,The market is clinging to any news as a reason to turn bullish on Snap possibly pushing the stock up to $20.Recent initiatives offer false hope for a stock already trading at nearly 17x 2018 revenue estimates of $1.17 billion.The long-term case remains that Snap isn't worth $10 billion now as Instagram continues stealing users.,"Despite a very negative view on the shares of Snap (SNAP), the stock could actually rally to $20. My previous research suggested the jump to $12 on the Citron Research bull call was a time to exit the stock, but the momentum remains too strong regardless of the reality. Image Source: Snapchat websiteThe market likes round numbers and $20 was the previous high where the rally failed in February. Otherwise, a rally makes no sense with Snap failing to hold a jump to $14 on Monday following the bullish slant regarding a search tie-in with Amazon (AMZN) and other partners. At $20, the stock has a market cap of $29 billion based on 1.457 billion fully diluted shares. Again, my theory isn't that Snap should rally this high, but a rally through the strong resistance at $14 would lead to a likely test of $20 again. Another reminder that a stock does what it wants, not what it should. A big reason the stock has gained momentum are items related to false hope. First, Citron Research turned bullish on Snap placing a $17 price target on the stock due to the market being too short rather than tangible bullish signs from the business. Second, the market was excited at the signs of a gaming platform set to launch in the fall. Third, the supposed product search link to Amazon. Neither news piece is ultimately that bullish. Facebook (FB) had a gaming platform that is virtually dead now and a search tie-in with Amazon again evades the question of how Snap is going to get the teenage heavy platform to engage in product searches that actually lead to valuable purchases. The only interesting idea is Yellow that creates a launchpad for creative minds on Snapchat. Snap is using the platform in an attempt to create media companies that will further boost usage on the site. The only catch is that Yellow requires an application and interview process pushing the launch out into September placing any user boost more into Q4 and likely 2019.All of these plans don't really solve the user issue and the cash flow problem. Instagram Stories recently reported 400 million users that double the amount for Snapchat and show the majority of the growth focused on Instagram. The company still has to solve how Instagram isn't going to continue eating its lunch and steal all of their future user growth. Cowen analyst John Blackledge sees a 7% YoY decline in minutes a day on the platform while Needham slashed the revenue target for the quarter by 15%. Either way one cuts the numbers, Snap appears on the verge of missing quarterly analyst estimates again. The company has only beat revenue estimates in 1 of the 5 quarters since going public prior to the Q1'17 report. Revenues will likely jump from the $182 million last Q2, but the estimates suggests Snap actually reports a larger loss this year. A similar pattern is emerging next quarter as revenues surge 40%, but the loss is still positioned to grow. SNAP Revenue Estimates for Current Quarter data by YChartsThe problem with a gaming platform and some of these other initiatives is that they scream of additional costs with little to no rhyme and reason. Snap saw free cash flow dip by $268 million last quarter and these initiatives appear to keep the social messaging company on the path to continue burning a ton of cash each quarter. Until Snap changes the equation on free cash flow were quarterly cash burn tops $200 million, the stock shouldn't be anywhere near $20. The company only had a cash balance of $1.8 billion at the end of March placing the balance around $1.6 billion now. A few more quarters of these cash burn rates will really start placing Snap in a position of needing to raise more funds. Source: Snap Q1'18 presentation The key investor takeaway is that the market remains irrationally positive on Snap regardless of the actual numbers. A lot of false hope could actually push the stock up to $20 assuming resistance at $14 is broken.Regardless, the thesis remains that Snap isn't a long-term investment due to mounting cash flow problems. The stock still has no reason to trade above a market valuation of $10 billion and a price of $7."
4185964,102870,2018-07-08T17:48:53-04:00,"Snap's stock has endured a rough ride since the high days of its IPO.A questionable redesign caused significant dissatisfaction from Snap's users, which has lead to a slowdown in user growth.However, the social networking platform remains enormously popular, especially amongst young people, and has taken significant steps to correct its redesign missteps.In addition, the company's rollout of its V2 glasses could turn out to be a surprise hit with consumers and should lead to higher revenues for the company.Snap has enormous potential to grow its user base substantially and is one of the fiercest competitors Facebook has left, which make it extremely rare and valuable.","Source: Fortune.comSnap Inc. (SNAP) has had a rough ride ever since the company went public in 2017. After a massive 44% spike during its first day of trading, Snap’s stock continued higher to about $29, for a total gain of roughly 70% from its IPO price of just $17. However, it’s been all downhill from there, as Snap’s shares declined by around 60% over the next 6 months, and Snap’s rollercoaster ride continues to this day, as the company’s shares remain more than 20% below Snap’s $17 IPO price.Source: StockCharts.comSo, what is about Snap? Is it just an overhyped company destined to stagnate, lose popularity, and drift lower? Or is it a company likely to overcome its current obstacles, and head substantially higher?Snap is not the only social networking company to decline post its IPO debut. Some people may not remember this, but Facebook’s (FB) stock essentially crashed by more than 50% post IPO, from $38 to just $18. And despite taking over a year for Facebook to get back to its IPO price the company went on to appreciate by more than 1,000% since then. I am not saying that Snap is necessarily the next Facebook, but what is clear is that investors can overreact to initial setbacks, which is what could be occurring in Snap now.A questionable redesign of Snap’s app caused a temporary uproar amongst Snapchat’s user base, which resulted in somewhat weaker growth in recent months. Snap’s stock cratered by almost 20%, after the last quarterly results disappointed Wall Street analysts. The company’s EPS came in at a 17-cent loss, as expected. However, revenues came in light by about 6%, and DAUs disappointed by about 1.6%, coming in at just 191 million vs an expected 194.2 million.Source: Statista.comClearly, redesign issues continued to plague the company throughout the last quarter. However, these problems are likely transient in nature, as Snap has taken comprehensive steps to solve the dissatisfaction associated with its app’s revamp. Another important element to consider is that Snap’s advertising revenue hit $229 million in the quarter, a 60% YoY increase.One of the elements that makes Snap so attractive going forward is its massive millennial user base. Amongst 12-17 year olds Snap has a staggering 83.4% penetration rate in the U.S. And amongst 18-24 year olds, Snap has a reported penetration rate of 78.6% in the U.S. These are very high figures and clearly indicate that Snap is extremely popular amongst young people.Source: eMarketer.comYoung people who use the app now can be viewed as the early adopters and are likely to become sticky long term users of the platform. In addition, due to Snaps enormous popularity amongst younger generations future generations of are also likely to adopt the service. A similar trend can be observed in Europe and in other areas where Snap is popular.Source: SocialMediaToday.comIt’s also important to consider that Snap is a relatively new company, and with fewer that 200 million DAUs worldwide (compared to Facebook’s 1.45 billion), Snap’s growth could continue for many years going forward.It’s no secret that Snap’s first generation Spectacles were a flop, as the company lost about $40 million on the unsuccessful venture. The Spectacles were clownish, didn’t have great video quality, came in a bulky case, were not always easy to sync, and at $129 just did not represent great value to consumers. Moreover, there were other issues with the rollout process, marketing, and other aspects, which illustrated Snap’s inexperience with rolling out and selling hardware. Therefore, the company sold very few Spectacles, only about 220,000 pairs.Source: Tom'sGuide.comHowever, the second generation of Snap’s glasses V2 could be a lot different. They are water resistant, come in a more compact case, can take pictures, not only video, take video in HD, are much easier to sync with the app, and actually come in a much more suitable design mass numbers of consumers may want to wear. The V2s could turn out to be a major success for Snap, and the company could experience a significant revenue boost going forward.Snap’s revenue growth has been phenomenal. The company’s revenues skyrocketed by almost 600% YoY in 2016, in 2017 revenues jumped by over 100% YoY, and this year’s growth is projected to be around 42%. Snap is expected to hit $1.17 billion in revenues this year, and is estimated to hit sales of $1.7 billion in 2019, with higher end forecasts pointing to revenues of around $2 billion next year. In fact, if Snap corrects its redesign issues and has a relatively robust showing with the V2s, revenues should come in towards the upper end of the range.$2 billion in revenues suggests Snap is trading around 8.5 times forward sales, and this is with a revenue growth rate of around 50%. This is compared to Twitter’s (TWTR) 11 times next year’s sales valuation, with around a 13% revenue growth rate in 2019. Also, Facebook is trading at about 8 times 2019 revenues with a projected growth rate of 27.5%. However, Snap is the company with significantly higher growth potential, and once the company’s setbacks get alleviated the company will very likely get rewarded with a higher multiple.Snap’s robust growth is likely to continue going forward, as the company’s revenue per user continues to rise, the company’s user base continues to increase, and the company’s penetration rate is relatively low, especially outside the U.S.Source: Snap 10KIt’s a bit early to talk about profitability as Snap is still in the hyper growth stage of its business cycle, and profits are not likely to materialize until 2020 or later. However, it is likely that Snap will be able to monetize its business quite well in the future. Snap has a unique platform that captures significant engagement time from users, second only to Facebook. Another key element to consider is that Snap appears to be by far the favorite social networking platform amongst teens, which implies it has immense growth potential.In addition, Snap is essentially one of the only successful competitors Facebook has left, and there is no reason why its global user base can’t grow to a billion or more over the next 5-10 years. This doesn’t only provide Snap with significant profitability potential due to the lucrative ad dollars the company is beginning to attract, but this also makes Snap a primary takeover target.Snap has nearly 200 million daily users, has more than 300 million monthly users, gets over 30 minutes spent by the average daily user, reaches 41% of the U.S.’s 18-34 population every day, and this company is still very young. Many of the current tech giants would love to have an instrument like Snap that can essentially challenge or disrupt Facebook’s near monopoly in social networking. How much is that worth? In my view, a lot more than $17 billion, which is Snap’s current valuation.Snap’s stock has gotten punished in recent months due to the company’s questionable redesign of its app that lead to user dissatisfaction and lackluster user growth in the last quarter. However, the company has taken significant measures to correct its redesign issues, which implies recent setbacks may turn out to be transient in nature. In addition, Snap saw 60% YoY ad revenue growth in the last quarter, and is likely to continue growing users and revenues at a substantial pace going forward.Moreover, Snap is extraordinarily popular amongst teens and young users, which reinforces the idea that the company has significant momentum and substantial growth potential. Furthermore, the V2 Spectacles are far superior to their predecessors and may turn out to be a hit for Snap, which should bring in substantial revenue for the company. Also, Snap is one of the fiercest competitors Facebook has left, which could potentially make it a takeover target. Overall, Snap has enormous revenue growth and earnings potential, which should enable the company’s stock to go substantially higher over the next several years.If you enjoyed reading this article, hit the ""Like"" button, and if you'd like insight about some of my future ideas, press the ""Follow"" link.

4187269,103480,2018-07-14T14:25:26-04:00,"Snap shares have been buoyed in recent weeks as the company is rumored to make a pivot into gaming.While gaming is a new niche that could retain some users, it can't fully reverse the deceleration in Snap's DAU growth.The last time Snap pivoted into a new area, Spectacles, it cost the company millions in unsold inventory as well as public shame over that fact.Snap is still battling the effects of a terrible Q1, in which user growth and revenues missed Wall Street targets.","Over the course of this year, most of the major social media names have been hit with some sort of scandal. Facebook (FB), of course, endured the Cambridge Analytica outbreak in mid-March that accused it of improperly sharing user data with third parties. While the stock has recovered to new all-time highs in the past few weeks, it is still dealing with the aftermath. And just last week, Twitter (TWTR) endured a crisis of its own, though somewhat smaller, when it revealed that it had millions of fake accounts on its platform. Shares at one point lost as much as 10% on the news before recovering ground.The one name that has stayed mercifully out of the spotlight in the past few months is Snap (SNAP), perhaps the most embattled of the social media giants. Following a major correction on early May due to a horrendous Q1 earnings report, Snap has quietly fought its way back to the $13 handle. Recall that Snap went public last year at a price of $17, so it's still about 20% off from those levels.SNAP data by YChartsWhat has renewed investors' interest in Snap in the past few weeks has been the rumor that Snap is launching a gaming platform. Mobile games are obviously a lucrative business, generating hundreds of billions in revenue annually. In fact, Pokemon Go alone is estimated to gross $2 million in daily revenue (roughly $700 million a year) and has generated $1.8 billion in cumulative revenues since its launch. If Snap were able to generate a big hit like this on its own platform and take a cut of the developer revenues, it would clearly provide a big revenue windfall and diversify Snap's business away from the advertisers it has depended on. As we know from last quarter, Snap has said it has had strained relations with advertisers due to the redesign of its main chat platform - so it needs a backstop in case ad growth slows down.In my view, however, gaming is unlikely to be the panacea that can stop Snap's irreversible user growth deceleration. The company remains richly valued against its top-line revenue estimates and is likely to experience another slide after Q2 earnings. With all the focus lately on longer-term projects like the app redesign and gaming, it's unlikely that Snap will have reversed its ad revenue and user growth shortfalls in Q2. The recent Snap recovery will be short-lived.Gaming is not the first time Snap attempted to deviate away from its core Snapchat app. The company is attempting to do more than just Snapchat (as evidenced by its self-definition as a ""camera company"" in its S-1 filing) and grow into an internet conglomerate, much like Facebook which has its hooks in hardware and AI in addition to its flagship social media site.As such, Snap's Spectacles were all the rage when they were first released last year. The $130 sunglasses could do one thing and one thing only - take pictures and upload them to Snapchat. Yet, crowds flocked in droves to Spectacle vending machines, which were designed to be vanishing ""pop-up shops"" just like the vanishing messages in the Snapchat app.Yet, as the excitement dissipated, sales momentum for Spectacles evaporated as customers realized they were overpriced, unattractive shades made of plastic. The company was left with 300,000 unsold units and a loss of $40 million on the venture. $40 million, of course, is a drop in the bucket for a company like Snap which had a cash burn of -$268 million in 1Q18 alone - the biggest cost to the company, in my opinion, is the public shame that comes with admitting these accessories did not sell well.Gaming is no Spectacles. A pivot into gaming and inviting developers to become part of a new Snapchat gaming interface is clearly more of a sensible transition than Spectacles. But it would be foolish to think that the entry into gaming doesn't come with the same risks. Should games fail to pan out, and if Snapchat's first batch of games are met with frigid reviews on the internet, it could be facing much more than a mere $40 million in losses.This much larger gaming effort isn't the first time Snap has expressed interest in gaming. In April, Snap launched an in-house selfie-taking game called Snappables, in which users use facial expressions to score points in head-to-head matches against friends. It's unclear how popular Snap's games are with its user community, but Snap has long had its eye on the gamer community, releasing a blog post on its advertiser website extolling how prevalent gamers are within Snap's user base:Figure 1. Snap infographic for gaming advertisersSource: Snap.comIn my view, however, gaming is not a natural fit for Snapchat. Users tend to spend only fleeting moments on Snapchat to check their message and send five-second Snaps back - they don't devote nearly as much time to mindless scrolling that Facebook users do. Adding games is clearly a bid to try to get DAUs to spend more time within the app, but with so much of Snap's user base already geared toward a quick in-and-out experience with the app, it's unclear how successful Snap's gaming efforts will be.While bulls have momentarily taken hold with high hopes for Snap's gaming platform, it will be more difficult to avoid the pressing question of revenue and user growth shortfalls as Snap's Q2 earnings loom around the corner (expected in early August). Recall that Snap's results last quarter, shown in the table below, sent Wall Street into a flurry of downgrades that sliced 20% of Snap's market value away:Figure 2. Snap 1Q18 highlightsSource: Snap investor relationsWhile Snap still grew revenues 54% y/y to $230.7 million, expectations widely missed Wall Street consensus of $243.6 million (+63% y/y). It's also a far cry from the 100%-plus growth that Snap reported in its first few earnings quarters after going public; 54% is the slowest growth rate Snap has reported in its lifetime as a public company, and it's unlikely to get much better.In addition, DAUs saw sluggish 15% y/y growth and just 2% sequential growth from 4Q17. Snap DAUs now number just 191 million, less than half of Instagram Stories' 400 million DAUs.That's not to mention that Snap has one of the scariest burn rates in the entire technology industry - if Snap's Q1 free cash flow holds, it will burn north of $1 billion this year, against a current cash balance of just $1.8 billion. If Snap's investments into gaming further deepen these losses, the company could be forced to raise a dilutive secondary offering at a time when its shares are still depressed and unlikely to raise much capital.Until we see an improvement in Snap's core business - that is, double-digit DAU growth as well as continued improvement in per-user revenue rates (achieved through an increase in advertiser rates, and unlikely to happen when advertisers are nervous ahead of the Snap redesign), there is no justification for Snap's recent ~20% rally. The company's miserable track record for earnings results will probably have it back in the low $10 range after it reports Q2 results in August. Stay cautious on this company."
4180141,24960,2018-06-07T13:56:48-04:00,Snap has the lowest market value per user compared to Facebook and Twitter.Google reportedly interested in acquiring Snap for $30 billion.Snap is worth around $20 per share.,"Snap (SNAP) jumped 6% in a day after Citron Research released a positive note on the company, stating that it should be worth $17 per share and could become an acquisition target. Snap's stock price has been fluctuating widely since its IPO in 2017, with a high of nearly $25.5 and a low of $10.6. At $13 per share, it is cheap.Most of the social media companies take many years before turning profitable. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has turned profit for the first time in 2009 while Twitter (TWTR) has turned quarterly profit for the first time after 12 years of operation. Snap, on the other hand, still generated losses for the past 7 years. However, the value of social media companies lies in the value of users. The higher the number of sticky users, the higher value the company is.Let's look at the market value per user of each social media company in the table that I calculated myself. To calculate the daily active users (DAUs), I use the DAU-to-MAU ratio of 48% for Twitter as it only discloses Monthly Active Users (MAUs).Source: Daily Active User number from SEC filings and Market Capitalization from Google FinanceLooking at this table, we clearly see Snap has the lowest market value per user, only $82, while Facebook has the highest market value per user, $387, 5 times higher than Snap. Despite having more users than Twitter, Snap's market capitalization is only half of Twitter's.In 2016, there was insider news stating that Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is interested in acquiring Snap for $30 billion. Google's initial offer was said to be discussed before Snap raised its series F round. In the series F round, Google's capital arm, CapitalG, participated in with Snap's valuation of $20 billion. Indeed, acquiring Snap could give Google a lot of advantage to get into an established and growing social network. Snap and Google's YouTube can cooperate to secure video content and offer bundle deals to boost ad revenue in both platforms. As series F occurred on May 2016, when Snap had around 148 million daily active users, a $20 billion valuation means a $135 market value per user.Each app is famous and dominant for each generation. Facebook was a social network of choice in 2013, and Instagram was popular in 2014 and 2015. Since 2016, Snapchat has taken the reins. Piper Jaffray conducted the survey of 6,000 teenagers to discuss their favorite social platform. The results? 45% favor Snapchat, 26% favor Instagram, while only 8% and 9% favor Facebook and Twitter, respectively.Source: StatistaSnapchat is really an app for the millennials. It is very favorable for the company as millennial population is growing quite rapidly. According to Goldman Sachs, millennials are the largest generation in the U.S. history, even larger than baby boomers.Snap has just gone through the redesign to better suit users' demand. Before the redesign, Stories were sorted in a way that users who post most frequently (so-called professional content creators) were at the top of the list. The result is the users' close friends, who often do not post frequently, were buried below creators. Thus, it makes Snap less personal to users. After the redesign, Snap separates friends from creators, making users find Stories from close friends. Users now can search for Stories based on the depth of relationships. In addition, a new feature is built for creators called Discovery section. This section allows Snap to invest in products and monetization for its creators.Evan Spiegel, Snap's CEO, commented that the company keeps the leading position in mobile content and augmented reality. There were 81 million people who watched its coverage in Discover in 9 different languages. In the U.S. alone, there were around 10 million people tuning in daily for the Games. For the augmented reality platform, more than 200 of the lenses created by users were viewed more than 1 million times in just a few months since it was first launched. Advertisers can include the button which directs users to a long-form video or an app while users are playing with the lens in camera.Moreover, Snap focuses on developing tools for advertisers to grow online sales. It created self-serve tools, launching Reach and Frequency in its self-service platform, partnering with multinational conglomerates, including Unilever (UL), Procter & Gamble (PG), Google, and Microsoft (MSFT). It also uses Nielsen's Total Ad Ratings to measure the effectiveness of Snap's reach compared to TV programs. As a result, the company said that Snapchat campaigns could deliver 8% incremental reach on top of TV campaigns for the same brand set, with the spending of only 1/25th of what should have been spent on TV programs.Snap is also a very high tech company, owning a lot of patents including machine-driven content curation, internet protocol-based intrusion detection, content delivery network for ephemeral objects, personalized UI, etc. The company is also developing augmented reality, emotion recognition, video calls with payments, and facial recognition & privacy protection. With the ongoing new technology developments, we could expect Snapchat can bring more value to users with its new technology applications in the app, increasing ARPU, and in turn growing the market value per user in the future.Snap has a growing performance in user operating statistics, much better than Facebook and Twitter. ARPU (average revenue per user) was $1.53 in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 46% year-over-year growth compared to $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2018, ARPU was $1.21, a year-over-year growth of 34%. The quarterly ARPU growth of Snap is higher than Facebook at 31%. Twitter's quarterly ARPU is the worst among the three, with only 2% growth in international markets. Twitter's U.S. quarterly ARPU actually declined, due to the decrease in average cost per ad engagement.In 2017, Snap has burned nearly $820 million, or $68.3 million per month. In the first quarter of 2018, the cash burn was $238.3 million, or $89.5 million per month. However, the financial position of the company only allows for it to burn for nearly two years. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, Snap has $1.82 billion in cash and marketable securities. Thus, the cash runway is more than 20 months.As CFO Drew Vollero said:It means there is no clear timeline for Snap to break even. So investors might expect there would be more share issuance if the company does not reach break-even point in around 20 months, diluting current shareholders. That is one of the main reasons for the negative momentum in Snap's stock in the past several months.Investors can get in Snap today at a cheaper valuation than when Google's CapitalG invested in the company. A $20 billion valuation of series F means $135 value per user. Dated back to 2013, when Snapchat had 16.5 million daily active users, Facebook tried to acquire it for $3 billion, valuing the company's user at $181 per user. Using the similar valuation per user in Snap's series F funding, the company should be worth $25.8 billion, or $20.5 per share. In the future, when Snap keeps innovating new technological applications for its users, it will continue to grow ARPU, the number of daily active users, and revenue. However, with the nature of a technology company, Snap might experience great volatility in its stock price in the short run. In the long run, it will keep increasing value with more users and higher ARPU."
4179265,24849,2018-06-04T13:35:33-04:00,"Company continues to burn through plenty of cash.Mixed shelf filing standard, but what type of raise?Would cash injection put floor under shares?","Ever since camera company Snap (SNAP) went public more than a year ago, I've been on the record worrying about the company's cash burn. With massive losses and growth acquisitions further weakening the balance sheet, it only seemed like a matter of time before Snap hit the markets again for funding. We appear to be getting closer to that point, but it remains to be seen how the company will actually accomplish this.Snap went public in early 2017, bringing in a large chunk of cash. At the end of Q1 2017, seen in the 10-Q filing, cash and short-term investments were nearly $3.25 billion in total. The company has lost hundreds of millions of dollars since, resulting in this ugly cash burn chart seen in the company's Q1 2018 earnings report.(Source: Snap earnings slides)The company also spent around $370 million in cash on acquisitions in the final three quarters of 2017, further changing the balance sheet. If we look at the most recent 10-Q filing for the end of March 2018, cash and short-term investments were down to $1.82 billion. With no end in sight for losses or cash burn, that number could easily be under $1 billion by the end of this year without a capital raise.The other item to look at is the outstanding share count, and I'm talking about the company's common stock Class A, which contains no voting rights. As you can see in the chart below, the number of these shares outstanding has risen more than 87% since the end of 2016. This is due to a combination of the IPO, share-based compensation, conversion of Class B shares, etc.(Source: Snap quarterly and annual filings, seen here)In early May, Snap filed a mixed shelf registration to inform investors it would be raising funds at some point. This is a common thing for companies to do and tells investors how the company plans on achieving its goal. In this filing, management mentioned four items: Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants.One way to raise funds would be to sell shares of common stock, Class A. The company would sell a stake, the speculation of a recent news piece, although Class A shares would not contain any voting rights. This would further increase the amount of dilution investors have faced, likely sending the outstanding share count over 1 billion in the coming quarters. An example would be a sale of 50 million shares at $10.00, bringing in $500 million before expenses.A second way would be preferred stock, likely one that features a dividend and can be converted to common stock. This would give an investor an income stream in the short term and would also allow the purchaser to reap the benefits if the common stock does well. This also would be rated ahead of the common stock in terms of ownership standing. An example here would be selling 50 million shares at $10, with a 4% dividend, convertible to common at $10 per share (1:1 conversion ratio). This would bring in $500 million before expenses while costing Snap $20 million in annual dividend payments. To avoid cash interest expenses, the company could potentially make the dividend payable in stock.Snap also could tap the debt markets, although going the normal route would likely be too expensive. With the 10-Year US Treasury being at nearly 3.00% currently, and seeing another struggling name like Tesla's (TSLA) 8-year bonds yielding more than 7.00% currently, Snap would likely incur a high interest rate on regular debt. For instance, here, the company would borrow $500 million before expenses, perhaps over 10 years with an 8% coupon.More likely, if Snap were to go the debt route, it would be a convertible debt offering that's like the preferred stock route. Here, the interest rate would be much lower-than-normal debt, but bond holders could convert to common stock at a fixed initial conversion price (that usually is subject to change upon certain events). For example, here, we'll go with $500 million in 10-year notes, with a coupon of 1.50%, that can be converted at $10 per share.The final item that Snap mentioned was warrants. This would give an investor a chance to buy a number of shares at a fixed price. I don't think Snap would do this as its only way of raising capital, more likely, it would do it in combination with one of the other items. For instance, if Snap were to go the preferred stock route, it also could throw in warrants for the investor or investors to purchase another, say, 25 million shares at $10 each, which, if executed in the future, would bring in another quarter billion dollars.It appears we are getting much closer to a capital raise from Snap as the company continues to burn through lots of cash. At this point, it's just a matter of when, how much, and via what methods? Today, I examined the current situation and looked at how the company could raise half a billion dollars as an example. I think we could see a short-term bottom in the stock after funds are raised, potentially after a fall on dilution or interest concerns.However, a long-term bottom won't be in place until the company can show that it can consistently grow its user base, while also getting closer to the breakeven point and being free cash flow positive. That's why shares remain close to their all-time lows, as seen in the chart below, despite the recent rally. What are your thoughts on a capital raise (when, amount, type) for Snap? I look forward to your comments below.(Source: Yahoo Finance)"
4184770,103174,2018-06-29T13:05:58-04:00,"Recent reports of potential expansion into gaming could be a game changer for the stock.Redesign efforts have been challenging, but the company should get it right in due time.Snapchat remains a valuable platform and could still be an attractive acquisition candidate.","Despite an attention-grabbing IPO last year, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has failed to impress investors in the ensuing year and a half and is now down about 20% from its IPO price. As most are likely familiar, Snap is the parent company of Snapchat, proprietor of one of the world's biggest messaging and video platforms, with 191mm daily active users globally and 81mm daily active users in the U.S. Snapchat is popular among teenagers and young adults, a heavily sought-after marketing demographic. Snapchat is best known for its disappearing messages which has proved both a blessing and a curse - disappearing messages encourage users to share more intimate content given they don't have to worry about it being there forever, but they also make it much harder to monetize the platform given Snap cannot make use of the data for the most part.The major driver behind why Snap stock has failed to perform is growth in daily active users has stalled out substantially; in the most recent quarter, Snapchat added only 4mm users sequentially from 4Q17. If the bull case for Snap was that it was still early innings and that they could get to 500mm+ users similar to what Facebook accomplished, that story has failed to materialize thus far. Additionally, a challenge posed by Snapchat's video focus is this is much more data-intensive than say a text messaging focused platform like WhatsApp, which means Snapchat has to spend materially more on server costs - Snap has a deal with Google Cloud that requires Snap to spend at least $400mm annually with Google Cloud - this is very substantial considering Snap's annualized revenue based on 1Q18 is ~$922mm.Evan Spiegel (Snap's founder, CEO, and controlling shareholder) is in many ways a very polarizing figure - some think he is a visionary with a keen sense of consumer tastes (especially millennials and younger generations), while others think he lucked into his current role and is not skilled enough to be running a multi-billion-dollar public company in the tech space. While I think he certainly was not fully prepared to be in his current position, he seems to have learned a lot and matured a lot since the company went public. Additionally, the fact that Evan Spiegel forewent a potential sale to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) several years ago indicates he is motivated by more than just money and wants Snap to succeed in the long-run. I would encourage anyone interested in this stock to watch the commencement address he gave at USC where he discusses his decision not to sell the company: Evan Spiegel Commencement USC.Spiegel has also gotten an unfair reputation due to leaked emails that he sent to his fraternity brothers when he was in college; while the emails are nothing to be proud of, they don't seem too far off the norm in most fraternity houses across the country (not saying that's good or bad, just saying his emails don't seem out of the ordinary based on my personal experience). Further, many of those emails are almost a decade old, so I think it is unfair to judge Evan Spiegel's ability to lead Snap today based on emails he sent in jest a decade ago. His more recent interviews demonstrate a strong awareness of the market he is in and much more maturity in my opinion: Evan Spiegel June 2018 CNBC Interview.Another recent snafu which has put pressure on Snap stock was the recent redesign effort of Snapchat which went poorly in basically all respects: Techcrunch Article Snapchat Redesign. The company, in an effort to evolve the platform, make it more monetizable, and make it easier to learn for potential new users, angered many existing users. The redesign even angered some popular celebrity users, including Kylie Jenner who tweeted about it sending the stock down 5 percent in one trading session: Kylie Jenner Snapchat USA Today Article.While the redesign effort has been a disappointment thus far, the one silver lining is that the company is focused on iterating until it gets it right and makes the platform better and easier to use - innovative designs require taking risk and unfortunately, risk sometimes doesn't work out. I think the company will ultimately figure it out and get it right, but it might take some time to do so.In the last week, there have been several interesting media reports that Snap is looking to add gaming functionality to Snapchat, similar to what WeChat has.""Per The Information, Snap will from this fall allow third-party developers to make games for playing within Snapchat. One gaming publisher is apparently already signed up.""In the last few months, one thing that has become apparent is the enthusiasm with which the market is treating gaming in all shapes and forms - mobile, e-sports, live-streaming of gaming (e.g., Huya and Yuya), etc. Given Snapchat's strong platform and relatively entrenched user base, I think there is a tremendous opportunity for Snap to extend its platform into gaming and live-streaming. Snap's stock has barely moved in reaction to these reports, despite what could be a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.Valuing a company like Snap at its current stage in its lifecycle is challenging to do precisely given the wide band of potential outcomes; in many ways Snapchat is a public venture capital investment - it should be sized appropriately and with the knowledge that it is riskier in nature than later-stage businesses with proven business models and moats. Snap is currently trading at a substantial discount to many of its more mature social peers (valued on a TEV/DAU basis and taking into account potential ARPU expansion) - this is due to two main factors: 1) Snapchat has less scale than many of these players 2) Snapchat has not monetized its platform as well thus far, as shown by its substantially lower ARPU than its peers. If Snapchat can demonstrate some progress with the app redesign, re-accelerate growth in users, start to close the ARPU gap, and make some inroads in the gaming front, the valuation should appreciate substantially.I think it's reasonable that if some or all of the above play out, Snap stock could trade at the levels seen in the period after its IPO in the mid-twenty-dollar range; it's also worth noting that ~14% of the float is sold short, so any positive developments could be magnified by the current bearish sentiment.Note: If you enjoy my analysis, please go ahead and click follow to get updates on future articles (click the orange button next to my name at the top)."
4179339,22148,2018-06-04T20:55:26-04:00,Citron Research turned bullish on Snap with a $17 price target.The stock has an expensive P/S multiple and questions regarding revenue targets.Cash flow burn remains a major issue with dilution likely.The gap close at $14 would provide another great short opportunity.,"Snap (SNAP) has seen a nice rally the last couple of days as traders turn more bullish on the stock that had dipped to $10.50. The fundamental story that backs my $7 call hasn't changed and if anything, the dangers exist that the social messaging site might need to raise cash and dilute existing shareholders.Source: MakeMeReachCitron Research slapped a $17 target on Snap using this prime quote for no longer staying short the stock:Based on the chart, the stock has been a wonderful short since a few days after going public. The stock quickly surged to nearly $30 and now still trades near the all-time lows at $10.50 and has a very interesting gap-up to $14.The news flow has been incredibly negative and one can't disagree that the short interest is high over 100 million shares, but the negative catalysts still don't appear baked into the stock valuation. One doesn't really need to get much past the P/S multiple to realize that the stock has major issues at even $12, much less up at $17.Snap trades at nearly 13x forward sales estimates while peers like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) are down slightly below 10x.SNAP PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe worst part of the scenario is that the multiples don't accurately factor in the diluted share count and the revenue estimates remain far too high. Looking out at 2021, revenue estimates are dangerous with Snap continuing to miss quarterly numbers. Remember that Twitter saw revenue turn negative before a turnaround took place.For 2019, Wall Street revenue estimates range from $1.4 billion to $2.0 billion. The higher estimates clearly show that some analysts have not updated numbers.SNAP Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe diluted share count is actually 1.457 billion. At $12, Snap has a market cap of $17.5 billion. At the Citron Research target of $17, the stock is worth $24.8 billion. Financial websites list the market valuation at around $15.0 billion due to a basic share count of 1.27 billion shares since Snap reports quarterly losses.The stock trades at 14.7x '18 revenue estimates at the current stock price and 14.4x '19 revenue estimates, if the stock hit $17. Snap has made no case that substantial revenue growth is going to exist through 2021 and the above revenue estimates appear too high.Snap ended last quarter with $1.8 billion in cash after burning $268 million in Q1. The combination of burning $232 million of cash from operations and spending another $36 million on capital expenditures is not a good equation.The annual free cash flow burn on a trailing basis continues to rise as Snap isn't getting anywhere closer to solving the issue. The company only has about two years of cash at the current annual burn rate.SNAP Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsThe Information thinks Snap might sell a stake for cash to Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) that already holds a position or to any number of tech giants. It wouldn't take much for the social messaging service to raise $1 billion in cash to fund operations, but one has to question the price that a tech giant is going to be willing to pay.A price closer to $7 is far more likely than $17. A tech giant willing to pay up for an ownership position might actually make a bullish signal, but no one should expect this outcome.Snap would be lucky to sell the shares for $10 which would require a 100 million share dilution. Along with the RSU grants to the new CFO, the company would have close to 1.6 billion shares outstanding. If the company generated 2021 revenues of $2.5 billion (up 200% from 2017) and had a $1 billion cash balance following a cash raise after burning all $1.8 billion by 2020, the stock would trade at an EV/S multiple of 7.3x. Hardly cheap considering the need for large revenue growth each year while prime competitor Facebook uses the service as R&D.The key investor takeaway is that the SnapChat app redesign was done to better push users into brand content to grow advertiser dollars. Until the company figures out a way to advertise to the teenage user base in a financially responsible manner, the stock remains a short opportunity. Snap has limited value due to the massive cash burn each and every day SnapChat is open for teenagers to message one another.Snap could easily rally to $17 as some analysts and research firms turn more bullish, but the underlying investment theme has not changed. Any rally is a time to exit a stock that remains far from cash flow positive while trading at a premium valuation. Snap likely rallies to $14 where the stock closes the gap from the start of May and becomes another solid short.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4195524,92586,2018-08-06T20:34:28-04:00,"Snap Inc. will try to break the spell in social media this Tuesday and hopefully deliver encouraging 2Q18 results.
        But absent abnormally solid numbers, I don't think investors will give the underdog a vote of confidence after such a risk-off week in the sector.
        For most long-term, fundamentals-based investors, I still believe SNAP is a stock to avoid.","Third is a charm, they say.After social media leaders gave their shareholders a scare in the past couple of weeks, with Twiter (TWTR) reporting sharp drops in MAU (monthly active users) and Facebook (FB) delivering expectations for decreased revenue growth and shrinking margins, it is time for Snap Inc. (SNAP) to try its hand at impressing investors. Second quarter earnings report is scheduled to come out this Tuesday, after the closing bell. I, historically much less excited about the prospects of the Venice-based company, wonder if Snap will instead be the next shoe to drop. I suspect investors are unlikely to give the underdog a vote of confidence after such a risk-off week in the sector, absent an abnormally strong earnings report.Image creditFirst, let me start with a quick review of the expectations. The Street currently projects 2Q18 revenues to come in at $251.2 million, for an all-time low YOY growth rate of 38.3%. If I assume that DAU (daily active users) increases sequentially by 3% to 196.7 million, which seems consistent with recent trends and about half the average rate that I believe Snap needs to produce through the end of 2020, ARPU (average revenue per user) would need to increase by only seven cents sequentially for top-line expectations to be met. Snap's monetization efforts have produced very spotty results in the past several quarters, but in general I believe the bar to be set relatively low for 2Q18. That's good news for SNAP holders.Below is my best case projection on 2020 DAU and ARPU which, if delivered, I believe would help Snap generate $1.00 in annual non-GAAP EPS within the next 24-36 months and possibly justify an investment in the stock. Dark-colored bars are reported numbers.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsOn earnings estimates, loss per share of 17 cents, if achieved, would land very close to last quarter's and last year's number. It is hard to project whether Snap will deliver below- or above-consensus results, since the company's margins tend to fluctuate quite a bit. But I believe it will be very important for investors to monitor Snap's performance on the cost side.In 4Q17, when the company delivered possibly the best set of operational results in its history as a public company, it failed to contain cost of revenues and opex, resulting in an FCF outflow of nearly $200 million on revenues of only $286 million. While I understand that profitability is likely not Snap's number one priority at the moment, setting a positive margin trend and easing the cash burn could serve as boost to investor sentiment and share price.Fundamentally, I continue to view SNAP as about the most speculative play in the internet and social media space, one that I don't believe carries the upside potential necessary to justify the sizable risks. Sure, another round of unexpectedly strong numbers could send shares soaring higher -- remember that SNAP was up an impressive 48% on the day following its 2017 year-end earnings report. But as I pointed out back then, about half the spike seems to have been driven by sell-side upgrades and price target bumps in the morning. I just don't see the same level of confidence about social media stocks following Facebook's and Twitter's signaling of tougher days ahead in the space.Source: E-TradeFor short-term players who can't resist the casino-like aspect of the stock market, I would encourage them to consider making bets with puts and calls (see at-the-money options chain above) that, in a worst-case scenario, would limit the trading losses. For most long-term, fundamentals-based investors, I still believe SNAP is a stock to avoid, and continue to see more ""responsible"" upside potential in names like FB."
4175857,24849,2018-05-21T11:20:08-04:00,Shares traded down to new lows after earnings.Is Monday's upgrade really a turning point?How does this fall compare to peers?,"As seen in the chart below, it has not been a good few weeks for shares of Snap (SNAP). The company has seen its stock fall after an earnings report seemed to indicate that previous progress was a one-time event. With shares recently hitting new lows, but not yet in the single digits, it is fair to ask if we've seen the bottom.(Source: Seeking Alpha Snap quote page)On Monday morning, shares were up more than 3% in early trading after the company received an upgrade from MoffettNathanson, from Sell to Neutral. The analyst believed that the worst may be over for the company, and that recent cuts to growth estimates may be priced in. The firm's price target was raised from $7 to $9, but that still represents considerable downside from the $10.91 shares currently go for. I'd question a neutral rating when you are calling for that much downside in any stock.It was almost a year ago when I asked if Snap could see single digits, and after the most recent earnings report we almost got there. User growth disappointed yet again, fueling a massive revenue miss. The company again lost almost $2 on the operating line for every dollar of revenue, helping to spark another major cash burn.Snap is likely to raise capital at some point in the next year or two, whether it be through debt, equity, or a combination of both. Given the surge in interest rates recently, it wouldn't surprise me to see a low rate convertible offering, that way the company doesn't have to pay too much in interest, and investors would benefit if shares rebound. Don't forget that dilution continues to pile on, with Class A shares outstanding at almost 945 million as of April 27th, up from 682 million just a year earlier.To wonder about a bottom, it's interesting to look at peers Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR). Facebook went public at $38, and then fell to an all-time low of $17.58 before eventually turning. Twitter went public at $26, before surging to an all-time high of $74.73 and then falling to the low double digits. With Snap's situation appearing to mirror Twitter's more than Facebook, a similar fall from Snap's all-time high would put shares under $6.00.While Snap received an upgrade on Monday, there are still multiple analysts who see this stock falling into the single digits. As a result, it would seem to imply that the bottom is not here yet, despite some thinking that the worst is over. As the company continues to lose hundreds of millions and burn through cash, a major capital raise will eventually be needed. Should we get another dead cat bounce in the coming weeks, investors will likely be presented with another opportunity to short."

The social messaging stock did not disappoint with a disastrous Q1 report that places our previous $7 price target as now highly optimistic.Source: Spectacles.com The redesign of the mobile app got horrible views as highlighted in my previous research. Not surprising, the Q1 results continued to show a weakness in DAUs (daily active users). The sequential growth dipped to only 4 million users, but the scary part is the comment that DAUs were lower in March, though still above Q4 levels. Otherwise, Snap is now facing losing DAUs on a monthly basis.When investors via the DAUs based on the reality that limited growth has occurred since Q3'16, the investment story turns highly bearish. Recode questioned the process to redesign Snapchat again and highlighted how DAU growth has struggled for quarters now.Source: RecodeThe bad part of the Snapchat redesign was the intent to place a higher focus on professional content. The content is needed to drive advertising revenue for a service generally designed for users to send private messages that aren't as easily monetized. If anybody has a data privacy issue, it is Snap with the service built around the concept of disappearing messages.The company continues to optimize the redesign, but one shouldn't even approach the stock at mark value of $20.0 billion before the report. Even a nearly 20% loss places the market cap at close to $15 billion with 1.457 billion shares on a fully diluted basis.The problem is that Snap actually still trades at a premium valuation considering revenues won't top much above $1 billion this year. At $7, Snap would still top a $10 billion market cap.In the public markets, the only way to run negative cash flows is to produce significant revenue growth and convince the market that the growth will eventually improve the cash flow position. Snap isn't generating the DAU growth that convinces anybody that operations will improve much beyond the current levels.Not a huge problem if the social messaging site was generating massive cash flows. The reality is that Snap is far away from turning cash flow positive that the process is starting to appear hopeless.Snap has huge locked-in hosting costs that clearly aren't turning more efficient with the added users. Q1 costs actually grew to $0.73 per DAU, up from $0.70 sequentially despite higher user totals.Without any leverage in costs of revenues, a minor dip in operating expenses did nothing for improving cash flows. In fact, Q1 free cash flow dipped to negative $268 million. Snap reported an incredible decline beyond the previous cash burn rates despite commentary contradicting this chart.Source: Snap Q1'18 presentationAverage revenue per user is only $1.21 and far below the other social companies. Snap would have some hope if users were still growing at a decent clip. The stock is an avoid and even a short until the Snapchat app regains momentum. One can't make the case for the stock at just about any price with quarterly cash burn rates far in excess of $200 million and DAUs potentially turning negative.With the company bringing back the Spectacles after writing off $40 million in excess inventory and barely reducing operating expenses following headline grabbing layoffs, the situation isn't ripe for a turnaround. The disconnect with actual costs controls appears wide with another push into hardware when cash flows are this negative.The key investor takeaway is that Snap has to fundamentally show that a redesign of the app returns the social messaging site to user growth. In addition, the company must show more cost controls. Only then would the business story turn more positive.Snap is a clear short to below our now optimistic $7 price target. After all, the stock trades at nearly 13x '18 sales estimates that do nothing to remove the massive negative cash flows. A combination of a user base stalling while the company is in a bad financial position is where shorting makes sense because the investment story is absolutely broken."

4169549,22445,2018-05-03T17:41:51-04:00,"Snap had a horrible quarter, and there is still no sight of profitability.The biggest problem for the stock is that its valuation is still stretched on a comparative basis.My new price target for Snap shares is lowered to $6.4.","Long-time readers know I have been negative in Snap (SNAP) ever since it was first listed. Before even exploring the business model, my beef was with the valuation. Simply put, Snap was a bubble since it was first listed.As evidence, please note the chart below that depicts the Price/Sales ratio of Snap, Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB):SNAP PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsWhen Snap first got listed, it had a valuation of over 40X revenue. Granted revenue was growing by leaps and bounds then, but as I said in previous articles, no stock can sustain such a valuation no matter how fast it grows (in my book). And, as history showed, Snap shares have trended lower since then.While one can debate the business model of Snap, what is not debatable is that the company continues to lose money, and there is no light at the end of the tunnel, as to when it will break even.Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the quarter was horrible.The company recorded $133M in stock-based compensation for the quarter.SNAP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThe actual number of shares is 1.257B, according to the latest 10-Q filing. I assume YCharts will be updated in several days.Please note that shareholders have been diluted by about 9% over the past 12 months or so while losses have been piling up.What was very interesting is that, for the first time ever, revenue was lower Q/Q to the tune of 19%. The company said ""primarily due to seasonality and our redesign"".While the company might be right, and the redesign was the culprit, the question is how do we know that revenue will not be lower next quarter also? The answer is we don't.At the same time, just about every other metric on the expense side was up.There was simply nothing in this report that was bullish. Something else that I have had a beef with for a very long time are active users.Daily Active Users grew to 191M from 166M Y/Y, or 15%, and about 2% sequentially. I'm sorry folks. These metrics are simply too low to justify Snap trading at 15X revenue. There are tons of companies out there growing at about 15% per year, and they trade nowhere where Snap trades.Simply put - and everything bad in this report aside - this is still an extremely expensive stock, for no reason I can comprehend.Analysts think Snap will do about $1.33B in revenue in 2018. While I am sure this figure will come down a little in the future, that is down from the $1.86B in revenue they were modeling back in August of 2017 (Please consider Why Snap Is Not Worth More Than $7.4 Per Share).Facebook trades at about 8X revenue. However, please note FB is a very profitable company, the leader is its class, and with profitability still growing double-digit Y/Y.The question is, why would I want to pay anything more than 4-6X revenue, even assuming I believed in the Snap story (which I do not). Furthermore, why would I want to pay more for Snap, given that the 2 major shareholders can do whatever they want, and shareholders literally have no say? The answer is, there is no reason.In my mind, Snap is not even worth 6X revenue. But let's say that's about what I would pay, assuming I believed in the long-term viability of the company.Currently, analysts are forecasting $1.33B in revenue for 2018. If we multiply that by 6, we get about $8B. And, if we divide that by the current outstanding share count of 1.257B shares, the number comes out to $6.4 per share.Believe it or not, even at these prices, I am being generous. Nevertheless, I will leave the benefit of the doubt to the market, since everyone is so fixated on paying pie in the sky multiples, for companies that lose tons of money.Snap had a horrible quarter, and I still do not see any profitability light at the end of the tunnel.The lower sequential revenue is a very bad sign. If repeated, I think it might be the end of the company, and the stock could fall in the low-single digits.Any way I look at it, I find no reason to pay for Snap's current valuation (market cap), given where Facebook and Twitter trade for. In a nutshell, Snap is still trading at a bubblicious valuation, even if we assume it was profitable (which it is not).As such, my price target for Snap share is $6.4 per share, and even that is probably generous."
4168354,24849,2018-05-02T01:27:09-04:00,Company badly misses revenue estimates.Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow worsen.User base not really growing.,"After the bell on Tuesday, shares of camera company Snap (SNAP) plunged more than $2 a share, putting their all-time lows in play, after the company reported its first quarter earnings. For those that thought the name was back in business after the stock soared just a few months ago at the Q4 report, the situation obviously has not gotten any better.Revenues for the period came in at $230.7 million, missing Street estimates by nearly $13 million. While this did represent 54% growth over the prior year period, the Street was expecting much more after Q4's large beat. Part of the miss was likely driven by a miss on daily active user growth. Snap reported DAUs of 191 million, falling short of expectations by about 3 million. This represents just 2% growth sequentially.Unfortunately, the revenue miss wasn't even the worst part of the report. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $218 million, which was an increase of 16% over the prior year period, and the worst quarterly reported number since the name went public. It's also down considerably from the $158 million loss reported in Q4, as seen in the chart below.(Source: Snap earnings slides)One of my biggest concerns with Snap has been the company's cash situation. Part of the reason for going public was that high cash burn required a capital infusion, and we're likely to see another raise coming in the next year or two. For Q1 2018, the company reported negative free cash flow of $268 million, nearly $100 million worse than the prior year period. This was also the worst free cash flow quarter since going public by nearly $40 million. While the company still had over $1.8 billion in cash at quarter's end, it cannot continue to burn through money like this indefinitely.Snap just doesn't operate a viable business in my opinion. The company had an operating loss of $392.5 million in the period, which means they lost $1.70 for every dollar of revenue generated. Management doesn't see profits coming anytime soon, which isn't the end of the world, but the problem here is a lack of improvement. Even on a non-GAAP basis, the company's net loss jumped by nearly $30 million over the prior year period, more than 15.4%.The other major problem here is valuation. Even with a 15% fall in the after-hours session, Snap goes for more than 11.3 times projected 2018 revenues. Why should investors pay that when Twitter (TWTR) goes for a little more than 8 times and Facebook (FB) goes for about 9 times? Both Twitter and Facebook are actually profitable and produce solid cash flow, allowing for more investments in their future. Facebook is also buying back shares, while Snap is heavily diluting investors by the quarter. Snap's weighted average diluted share count was 1.27 billion for Q1 2018, compared to 955 million a year earlier.As you can see in the chart below, shares of Snap are plunging in the after-hours session. Now below $12 again, they are just 50 cents from their public trading lows. At times last year I was discussing the possibility of shares going to the single digits, and I'm sure we'll see some analyst comments in the coming days that echo that notion.(Source: cnbc.com)In the end, investors might want to bail on Snap while they still can. The company announced another big revenue miss, showing that Q4 2017's progress was likely a one-time event. With the company reporting its worst adjusted EBITDA and negative free cash flow numbers since going public, shares are tumbling and could see new lows shortly."
4176048,103511,2018-05-22T01:52:03-04:00,"Since its IPO just a little over a year ago in March 2017, Snapchat stock is down over 56.2%.The company is unprofitable and increasing its losses, vastly overvalued at $13.46 billion even after its decline, and faces volatile user activity, all when it should be hitting it stride.Snapchat's business model is mismatched for its revenue stream from advertising as clearly its financial trajectory is demonstrating, though it might be sustainable as a segment of a larger platform.The company could likely hold out a long while but likely faces continued decline and stagnation, with only a small chance of independent revival.I believe the company's fate will eventually be an acquisition for perhaps $1 billion to $5 billion, where it will find sustainability as part of a larger tech ecosystem.","Snapchat (SNAP) is, in my opinion, one of the biggest multi-billion dollar tech flops on the market right now. The company is facing declining user activity at a time when it should be seeing a massive boom and faces an inherent mismatch between its revenue model and the nature of its temporary video platform.With such a bad initial growth stage to the platform, it is very unlikely it can ever gain the critical mass to see the growth that currently justifies its $13 billion valuation, even down from its IPO valuation and price.At Tech Investment Insights I rate the company a ""Risk"", meaning it features a low-reward high-risk investment profile. Undoubtedly investors since its IPO in early March last year have experienced this firsthand, as the stock has collapsed dramatically since then.SNAP data by YChartsInstagram was sold to Facebook (FB) in 2012 for $1 billion. I believe that Snapchat's likely fate is that once it has dwindled so far as to reach the $1 billion to $5 billion mark, it may be bought by a company, such as Facebook, Google (GOOG), or Apple (AAPL), that aims to integrate its brand and platform into a larger mass.Until then, I believe investors are just in for more pain.Snapchat was founded a long time ago for modern Internet services and social media companies, all the way back in 2011. Currently it has roughly 300 million monthly active users and about 190 million daily active users.The company makes money from a combination of primarily advertising as well as filter sales. Its Q1 2018 earnings released earlier this month showed slowing user growth and revenue, with guidance for future revenue growth by Snapchat even more pessimistic.(Source: Recode)(Source: Recode)The company posted a EBITDA loss of $217.867 million in Q1 2018, a significantly steeper loss than it $158.922 million in Q4 2017, $178.901 million in Q3 2017, $193.990 million in Q2 2017, and $188.243 million in Q1 2017. Its year 2017 EBITDA already was a deeper loss, at $720.056 million, than 2016's $459.243 million.With cash of $1.821 billion still, the company has enough to keep it liquid for roughly another 8 quarters before it certainly has to raise more capital, assuming no more steepening losses. Nonetheless, the key fundamental remains whether it can ever find profitability.Tech companies, particularly social media and Internet services ones driven by user activity, follow a pretty clear cycle for success. This is usually characterized by massive initial growth that then tapers down but remains consistent, as losses begin to shrink and profitability begins to emerge.It seems like Snapchat is reaching now soon its 7th birthday as a company and has a relatively significant user base, but is not experiencing the perhaps slightly-leveled but still vigorous user growth that it should still be seeing.Furthermore, and more importantly, the company's business model is not showing any signs of reaching profitability anytime soon. While Snapchat's reluctance to user data targeting or to provide advertiser-friendly metrics and analytics may be contributory to its sluggish advertiser interest, my theory is that the company's business model is simply flawed at this stage.We've seen with companies like Twitter (TWTR) how they are able to pull themselves from the ashes and even achieve profitability and renewed user growth after a time of stagnation. Snapchat certainly has that very possibility, particularly as it also is attempting a Twitter-like shift to focusing on public figures with its recent redesign rollout that separates celebrity stories for those of your friends.(Figure: Twitter Back In Worse Days)Yet Twitter also began showing signs of slowing decline that looks quite different from Snapchat's deepening losses. Snapchat's trajectory at the moment seems more likely than not like that of Zynga (ZNGA), which also began its collapse and stagnation of the past few years amid lack of shrinking losses, let alone profitability, and volatile user metrics.ZNGA data by YChartsThe problem for Snapchat, in my opinion, remains that it can truly function effectively as a solo platform. The platform's declining user growth and shaky user activity are mere symptoms of this, with its reliance on ads clearly unsustainable after years of deepening losses and what seems like just continued losses in the future.I maintain that Snapchat's likely fate will be that of Instagram, which is to be swallowed up by a much larger Internet services and social media company. When it is acquired, it will likely become a sustainable segment due to benefiting off of the user activity overflow from the connected ecosystem it has joined and not necessarily have to be self-sustaining in terms of revenue.Snapchat's likely buyout price remains in the $1 billion to $5 billion range in my opinion, with perhaps a price of $3 billion eventually. It remains to be seen what company will be the one that swoops in, as it could be foreseeable that Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), or many other Internet giants could find Snapchat an attractive addition at the right price.Until it reaches that right price however, it seems like the company simply is on a slow continued fall.(Source: Snapchat)"
4167427,31441,2018-04-30T05:15:59-04:00,"SNAP reports quarterly earnings Tuesday.The company revamped its platform, but is it working?Has user engagement improved and does it translate into higher ad dollars?SNAP burned through over $800MM in 2017. How much will it burn this quarter?Sell SNAP.","Snapchat CEO Evan SpiegelSnapchat (SNAP) reports Q1 earnings Tuesday. Analysts expect revenue of $243.55 million and eps of -$0.17. The revenue estimate implies over 60% growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items:Snapchat is has a very interesting platform that appears to serve a real need. The company's exploding videos help users prevent people from seeing their videos other than the person the video was intended for. Snapchat's 187 million daily active users (""DAUs"") implies it definitely has something the public wants. The hurdle most social media platforms encounter is the ability to go from a neat idea to actually monetizing the platform. To generate more advertising dollars Snapchat increased the number of companies marketing products on its platform.The company also revamped the site to separate (1) photos and videos generated by friends from (2) content from publishers and influencers:Management now needs to update investors on how the new roll out is working. Has time spent on the platform increased? Are users more engaged with the the ads and how does that translate into higher advertising dollars, if at all?The future of the company is dependent upon Snapchat growing its revenue base. In Q4 2017, the company's average revenue per user (""ARPU"") and cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU"") were $1.53 and $1.00 respectively. That created $0.53 per user to cover other costs like R&D and SG&A. The rub is that R&D and SG&A were a combined $2.36 per user, creating EBITDA per user of -$1.83.To turn EBITDA positive the company must grow its user base, increase ad rates, increase user engagement or cut costs. If the new roll out has amplified user engagement and can potentially increase ARPU then that would be something that could get me excited about the stock.Since going public just over a year ago Snapchat has grown its revenue, but is is hemorrhaging cash. Its Q4 2017 revenue of $286 million was up 72% Y/Y. DAUs of 187 million rose 18%, while growth in ARPU only grew 6%. While the company has been expanding its net revenue per user, it has also expanded its infrastructure to sell more ads. Q4 2017 R&D and SG&A expenses more than double compared to the year earlier period. In turn, its -$1.83 per user has been a drain on cash flow. Q4 2017 EBITDA was -159 million versus -$342 million in Q4 2016.Free cash flow for Q4 2017 was -$197 million, and -$819 million for full-year 2017. The company raised $1.2 billion of preferred stock in 2016 and another $2.7 billion in common stock in 2017. At year-end, its cash and securities were just over $2.0 billion. The question remains, ""Who much cash with Snapchat burn this quarter?""Snapchat seems like a neat idea. Until the company can choose it can effectively monetize its social media platform SNAP is a sell."
4166500,39161,2018-04-26T15:47:47-04:00,"The fear of users leaving Snapchat is overdone. Snapchat’s engaged network of camera messaging users is very sticky – and of comparable size to Facebook in the largest ad markets.Snap transitioned ~90% of its Snap Ad business to a self-serve ad platform in 2017. Prices dropped 70% YoY (which have now stabilized), masking a 575% growth in ad impressions.Discover, Snapchat’s premium content product, has higher ad prices and inventory than Stories. Comments by management and Discover Publishers indicate increased usage post-redesign.Better monetization of Snap Shows and the new Discover Feed ads could contribute $3B in annualized revenue within a few years, falling to the bottom line and increasing Snap’s margins.Snap is positioning Snapchat as a cross-device Augmented Reality ecosystem for both consumers and developers, a market that could reach $90B as soon as 2022.","Back in December, I wrote about how the Snapchat redesign would affect the stock. After beating Q4 '17 earnings expectations, Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) stock has pulled back considerably as over 1.25 million users and multiple celebrities spoke out against the redesign. Stepping back and looking at big picture, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) saw similar backlash when it first introduced the news feed in 2006, a product that brought in nearly $40 billion in revenue between Facebook and Instagram in 2017. User's main concern was that it was too hard to see stories from friends, which the newest Snapchat beta seems to address.The most outspoken against the redesign - teens - have continued to show their loyalty to the app. The spring 2018 edition of Piper Jaffray's bi-annual Taking Stock with Teens survey reported that Snapchat was the favorite social media platform of 45% of teens in the US, down only 2% from 47% in the fall 2017 survey despite the flurry of backlash following the February redesign. It seems few of those users left, as 83% of respondents used the app, versus 82% in the survey six months prior.The decrease in Snapchat usage post-redesign seems to be relatively mild. A note from Stifel mentioned that Snap's total audience size (roughly equates to MAU's or Monthly Active Users) in the US, Canada, and the UK decreased 0.1%, 1.1%, and 1.1%, respectively, between January and February. The chart below shows a similar story from ComScore data, which also showed an uptick in March.Losing users is nothing new for Snap. Its user base has declined multiple times in the last four years, and Snapchat's US MAU's actually declined 20% between May and September of 2014. Snap reports quarterly DAU's (Daily Active Users) as an average over the entire quarter, different than competitors who report as of the last month in the quarter. Taking into account the large jump in MAU's in December, Snap's Q1 average US MAU's appear to be approximately 5 million higher than Q4. Even at a 50% rate, US DAU's increasing 2.5 million match Stifel's projected global Q1 user growth.Early metrics for the redesign appear favorable for publishers and show how Snap has lessened its reliance on the sort of influencers that have spoken out against the redesign. When testing the new design before rolling out to all US users, Snap saw a 40% increase in users watching Publisher stories in the new Discover Feed. For all the anecdotal evidence that Discover views are plummeting post-redesign, there's cases like NBC, which recently said that its twice-daily Snapchat Show, Stay Tuned, is on pace to reach 37-38 million unique viewers in March, up 12-15% from 33 million in February and an estimated 28 million in January (up 32-35%). NBC disclosed more than half of those viewers watched the show at least three times in the past week as of March 14th, a number NBC says is also increasing. Self reportedly just saw its best month ever on Snapchat, with a 14% increase in daily viewers over January and 10 million unique visitors in February, up from a historical average of 8 million. And Teen Vogue recently reported a 525% increase in unique viewers March.A common misconception is that Snapchat's business has no barriers to entry - anyone can create a camera-based app with disappearing messages! That's true, and Facebook did - four times (Poke, Slingshot, Bolt, and now Direct). An overlooked aspect of Snapchat that keeps users coming back despite heavy competition is its ""Snap Streaks"" feature; a unique form of social currency that displays how many consecutive days a user has messaged each friend. Another is Memories, which allows users to bypass their phones camera roll and privately save their photos directly to their Snapchat account. It could be argued that many users treat Snapchat Memories as a secondary, or even primary camera roll, as Snap recently disclosed that each day, more than one-third of active Snapchat users swipe into the Memories feature and tens of millions more users are saving Snaps to their Memories. Snapchat also allows users to create stickers from a snap, saved to their account to be used again forever.The true power in Snapchat's messaging network is not in saving content, however - it is in creating and sending it. Since Instagram Stories was launched in August of 2016, the number of Snaps (a picture or video message) created per day increased from 2.5B in Q3 '16 to 3.5B in Q3 '17, a 40% year-over-year increase.Source3.5 billion per day is 1.27 trillion per year, greater than the estimated 1.2 trillion digital photos to be taken in 2017 in the entire world, excluding Snapchat. So much content is created on Snapchat because it is a private messaging network. There is no pressure for user's content to receive a certain number of likes or comments, and there is no history - a user is not defined by their profile, and their snaps represent their true, current self. The only form of social currency on Snapchat - streaks - shows users consecutive days they have sent snaps back and forth between friends, building a sense of connection and friendship while using Snapchat's camera.The high frequency of content creation is very important, especially when it comes to messaging, as each message pushes a notification that pulls another user into the Snapchat ecosystem. This pulling mechanism gets stronger as more users create and send each other content on the platform - a much different dynamic than simply uploading to a story or posting to a news feed, which remains the primary use cases of Snapchat's oft cited rivals Facebook and Instagram. Not only are Facebook's longstanding issues that have recently came to light much more serious, continuing to get worse, and more damaging for employee morale than Snap's (not to mention US consumers are trusting and using Facebook less), but investors must also realize that Facebook and Snap have very different business models.Facebook's failed Snapchat clones all had great functionality, but they lacked what Snapchat had - a network of messaging users. Facebook's Stories features have had slightly more success that its messaging clones, with Instagram Stories, WhatsApp, and Messenger Day having 300 million, 300 million, and 70 million daily users of the Stories features, respectively. However, Facebook has given zero geographical breakdown of where these users are located. And Facebook has an abundance of users in small advertising markets (more later), such as WhatsApp's reported 200 million MAU's in India, which appears to make up the majority of WhatsApp Stories users, most of which are uploading images from their camera roll and not using the in-app camera.In addition to not providing a geographical breakdown of Stories users, Facebook also gives no indication on how many users are actually creating versus simply viewing the stories of celebrities, influencers, brands, etc. Snap discloses over 60% of DAUs (112 million) create with its camera every day. Instagram has disclosed that 95 million photos and videos were uploaded per day as recently as June of 2016.An often overlooked aspect to Facebook's business model is that it has always struggled to make money from users consuming content. Instant Articles failed to catch on as more than half of its partners have abandoned the feature. Facebook recently introduced pre-roll ads to Watch, its YouTube competitor, but it has historically struggled to get pre-roll ads to perform well in a feed (it doesn't help that most users just hate pre-roll ads in general).On Facebook's struggles with monetizing content with pre-roll video ads, Zuckerberg himself said: ""We don't need to do pre-roll because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed"". Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has also stated something similar: Facebook is not a media company. Instagram's decision to clone Stories also reportedly came from Zuckerberg himself. It was initially resisted by Instagram's management team, further suggesting that Instagram's in-app camera is truly less of a strategic priority than its feed.Facebook has always struggled to monetize content because its business model never incentivized it to value good, quality content. Facebook and Snapchat have historically reported similar numbers of ""video views"" on their platforms; however. a stark difference between the two is that video views on Snapchat have always been deliberate, whereas the majority of videos played on Facebook are watched while scrolling. Facebook generates nearly all of its revenue from users scrolling through the news feeds on Facebook and Instagram, via sponsored ads and page owners boosting their posts in the feed. Interacting with content in the feed does provide data to Facebook's algorithm, but that has historically been the extent of Facebook's relationship with content. Theoretically, Facebook actually does not want users to spend time actually consuming content, as it means less time training the algorithm and scrolling the feed and viewing ads. This system has worked very well historically thanks to a combination of rising ad prices (or CPMs - cost per thousand views. A CPM of $10 is $0.01 per view), and increased ad impressions due to a higher frequency of ads and more time spent scrolling.Contrary to Facebook, Snap's business model incentivizes users to actually view content, not just scroll. Since Snap has always shared revenue with publishers, it incentivized both Snap and its content partners to create quality, engaging content. And by opening directly to the camera, Snap also has a built-in advantage in AR, which is experienced in a camera, not a feed. Understanding the fundamental difference in business models helps investors realize how completely different the two companies are.The media has heralded Facebook's ""success"" in stories. However, the graphic below taken from Snap's S-1 illustrates the strength of Snapchat's unique content strategy: the Live Stories and Publisher Stories that are unique to Snapchat's Discover section serve a much higher ad load than user submitted stories. Ultimately, the value that Stories has over a feed is the ability to create video ad inventory out of every piece of content. Considering that as ads are not shown after every user story, and user stories may be up to 10 minutes long, Snapchat's unique publisher content is much more monetizable than user submitted stories (and higher value than Messenger's sponsored text messages). And it's no coincidence. From the beginning, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel viewed advertising as a product, not a necessary evil.Time spent on smartphones is very fragmented, and Discover's bite-sized, full screen, exclusive, premium made-for-mobile vertical content is more suited for mobile than traditional long-form content. Big brand advertisers have always preferred premium content, and Discover helped solve a supply chain problem for digital advertisers that still exists three years later. Advertisers, publishers, and users love Snap Ads because both Snap and publishers are incentivized for users to view content, the ads are full-screen, two thirds of users view ads with sound, and they are not obtrusive to users like a typical mid-roll ad, as the ""tap to skip"" model Snapchat pioneered gives users control of the viewing experience. This leads to a much more engaging ad than ""viewing while scrolling a news feed"". Many times, the Snap Ads blend in with the content, as seen with the ad at 0:14 here. Professional media companies are also bound by contracts and stickier than social media influencers - a lesson Vine learned the hard way (and Instagram and YouTube will learn eventually.(Source)Stories has recently become a popular product outside of Snapchat, and it is inevitable Facebook eventually places ads within long influencer stories and tweaks the Facebook and Instagram news feeds to go video-first, looking similar to Snapchat's new Discover Feed (amid similar levels of user backlash). But Facebook and Instagram are still at their cores designed around a feed model that was optimized for text on desktop. And while Facebook has no debt on its balance sheet, its users have extreme behavioral debt to the feed, something that Facebook has been unable to repay when it comes to building a business around the camera or full screen video ads.The efforts and design of Facebook Watch, its dedicated video tab launched in August of 2017, tell us that a mobile-only platform that actually competes with Discover is not its goal - It wants to eventually get into consumers TV sets. Early reports, however, show users prefer scrolling the feed over the Watch tab. CBS tested the audience of Facebook's Watch section by not promoting the shows within the news feed, and the audience ""was in the hundreds or single-digit thousands of views - it was literally nothing"".Watch monetization also appears to be terrible for publishers. Per Digiday, publishers in Watch see CPMs as low as $0.15 to $0.75 when considering that very few viewers stick through the mid-roll ads. On March 1st, Digiday reported CPMs on ads in Snapchat Shows appear be in the $6-10 range when booked through Snap (with a 50/50 revenue share), and $15-20 for sales booked by publishers (of which Facebook has historically not allowed) with a 70/30 share. All-in, the $3-14 CPMs received by publishers are nearly twenty times higher on Snapchat, with even higher monetization when considering the frequency of ads and completion rate in Discover content compared to Watch.Snap has many other competitors in the vertical news and content space: AMP Stories by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (off to a slow start), Twitter Moments (NYSE:TWTR), Flipboard, and Sip by Product Hunt to name a few. And the goal for all these companies is simple: create digital video ad inventory in a way that can effectively target users at scale. Ultimately, Discover does well because of its large, relevant, and engaged audience in the US and Europe, and because it prioritized monetization and profitability for its media partners from the very beginning (similar to China's Toutiao). Snapchat may be slowly evolving into a content destination, but Snapchat is ultimately a messaging app, and it will look to play off that strength to continue evolving in to new lines of business.Snapchat leveraged its network of users messaging with the camera to gradually position itself in content. Its first evolution away from messaging, Stories, was successful because adding to your story was frictionless; it took minimal effort if you were already snapping your friends. Stories was an important first step for Snap, because as Stories gained in popularity, it slowly trained users to head to Snapchat to sit back and passively consume content.Snapchat then ""laddered up"" from stories to create Live Stories. Snap hired editors and used location-based technology to curate user submitted snaps into a custom story, which gave viewers a wide range of authentic perspectives on what was going on around the world in real-time. These were novel at first, and have slowly increased in number and applicability over time to include sporting events, concerts, political debates/election coverage, breaking news, and holidays or day-long events like Christmas, Halloween, and the last day of school. Recently, Snapchat featured numerous Live Stories for the 2018 Winter Olympics. As this article highlights, ""Snapchat is getting plenty of behind-the-scenes video from Olympic athletes at no cost, as many of them use the platform to communicate with friends and fans."" This is crucial to remember when other content providers spends billions on content every year.Source: Netflix spends more on content than anyone else on the internet - and many TV networks, tooSnapchat now creates Live Stories for nearly every breaking news event - and its approach of using raw footage directly from the scene of events (after being screened by Snap's editors) has helped keep it clear of the fake news problem that has put Facebook, Google, and Twitter under the pressure of US and EU lawmakers.Snap recently allowed Stories to be shared outside of the app and embedded within web pages (just as Twitter did with tweets) and launched a web version of the Snap Map in February. Snap also partnered with Tegna (NYSE:TGNA), which owns local TV stations in 39 networks, to use Snapchat content in its TV broadcasts. ""Winning"" in the breaking news business is nearly impossible in the age of the internet, with nearly every citizen having access to a camera and the ability to broadcast to the world. Large platforms have become essential to sharing news, and Snapchat's control of the camera of the developed world allows it to participate in users breaking a story, as it has raw location and metadata related to the 3.5 billion snaps taken every day.From Live Stories, Snap laddered into Discover, which offers premium content published by over 80+ media companies. This transition worked well as, Snap leveraged behaviors that users learned from passively consuming Stories to get them watching Discover. If Snap would have introduced Discover before Stories, it may not have caught on - not only with users, but also with both advertisers and publishers.This switch to passive viewing was important for Snap, as passive viewers are much more conductive to being shown and retaining ads, and Discover content has a much higher ad load than stories. It was also very important because it gave Snapchat stickiness beyond just messaging: If Snap could get users to open the app to specifically watch content, it would give Snapchat a similar pull that watching Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or traditional TV has when you're bored. And even with few friends on the app, Discover made sure there was always something to be watched.Snap has been experimenting with adding smaller publishers to Discover, something that will inevitably accelerate soon. And while it is hard to find screenshots of the publisher platform, I would assume the tool is similar to Snap's Ad Manager - meaning there are immediate synergies between new features added on both the content and advertising sides. The quality of content put out from the smaller publishers like the Syracuse and Wisconsin school newspapers has increased over the last few months to a level similar to the larger publishers, giving clues that Snap's editing platform is fairly sophisticated, yet easy enough for a small college newspaper to use efficiently.Still, not every user is using Discover. Some may highlight the subpar quality of the content and that Snapchat evidently lost some users because of the redesign. But this Pew Research Center study from August of 2017 shows that 29% of Snapchat users get news from the app (which doubled year-over-year), and 21% of all 18-29 year olds in the US now get their news from Snapchat. If you explore the younger range of the 18-29 year old demographic, or the 13-17 year olds, Snapchat captures significant market share in key younger demographics. This study was also before the redesign, which appears to have increased Discover usage.One very unique aspect of Snapchat's Discover feature at launch was that it matched the ephemeral nature of Snapchat and traditional TV. This went against everything that digital media has come to represent - always available, on-demand content that lasts forever. This short-lived, fleeting nature brought the scarcity model of traditional TV to mobile, helping Snapchat land partnerships with nearly every major US TV network and sporting league. Each brought not only their own content and expertise, but many also introduced their own advertising partners to Snapchat [More info on TV network deals: A&E Networks, BBC, CBS, Discover, Disney (ESPN), Fox, NBC, MGM, Scripps, TBS, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB), and Vice (NYSEARCA:VICE)].The struggles of traditional TV are no secret. US consumers continue to cancel cable subscription at an accelerating pace. AdAge reports recent Nielsen measures show there are only two scripted series averaging more than 3 million live, same-day adult viewers aged 18 to 49. Additionally, ""nearly 40% of the 78 scripted shows that have aired since the season began are delivering fractional ratings. Put another way, they reach less than 1% of the demo most coveted by TV advertisers.""Source: REDEF OriginalsThe pain is most likely temporary, as legacy TV networks will eventually develop their own apps for distribution in the transition away from cable. During this time of transition (and probably thereafter), Snapchat has a comparable, if not greater, reach than legacy TV. At the 2017 Edinburgh TV Festival, Snap's Head of Content Nick Bell, said ""some of our hit shows will reach 50 million people per episode in a 24 hour period"".The graphic below details the estimated reach of a few Snap Shows in January of 2018. As referenced above, NBC's Stay Tune's monthly reach has increased to 37-38 million after the February redesign. Stay Tuned averages 2.5 million viewers per twice-daily episode; and ESPN's Sports Center twice-daily episodes reach 1.8 million to 2 million views per episode (75% of which are between the ages of 13 and 24), often reaching a larger audience than the 6pm version of SportsCenter on linear TV.Source: Snapchat is enlisting more publishers to make video shows - DigidayCharts with a few more Snap Show and Live Stories viewership numbers can be seen below.Source: Here's why Snapchat is a valuable partner for TV networksYou could argue it is easier to get someone to watch a four minute show on Snapchat than a live 30 minute broadcast on traditional TV. According to Travis Howe, ESPN SVP of Digital Ad Product and Sales Strategy,Since Snap launched Discover, it has been extremely valuable for its partners. According to this study from Nielsen, a presence on Snapchat boosts its Discover partner's viewership on traditional TV, the web, and mobile.The partnerships have benefitted Snap as well: Many of Snap's Discover partners brought over new advertising relationships that would not have otherwise tried Snap's ad products. The professional content also minimizes influencer risk, and users will come back to watch their favorite Shows that are contractually obligated to be shown in the app. Snap also has nearly zero marketing cost for its content as its partners are financially incentivized to drive traffic from outside the app.Beyond reaching a large audience, Snapchat provides advertisers something they do not get on traditional TV - targeting. While Snapchat does not have the same granular targeting capabilities as Facebook, it has quietly beefed up its targeting and measurement capabilities within the past year and a half, borrowing many features from Facebook. These include behavioral targeting, targeting users who previously interacted with an advertiser in the app, Audience Match and Lookalikes, linking offline purchases to Snap Ads, and its unique Snap to Store product (acquiring Placed in June of 2017), which measures if Snap Ads incentivized a user to visit the advertisers physical store. It has over 450 pre-defined targeting audiences, as well as recently expanded location targeting options.It seems unlikely Snap will ever be able to create the sort of user data profiles like Facebook that would allow an advertiser to specifically target ""Republican cat owners with diabetes"" or even ""interest in illegal firearms""; but if an advertiser can target new parents in Chicago, as this marketer does here, it gives a pretty good idea of what sort of products that user may be interested in - and for traditional big brand advertisers on the AdAge Top 100, who spent over $267 billion in 2016, it is superior to ""someone who may be in the room, and may or may not be paying attention to the TV, while this commercial is airing on ESPN"".Snap's approach to content also gives it control over the targeting inputs. On any given day, Discover includes content ranging from food and cooking, political or cultural events, nearly every major professional sport, fashion and beauty, comedy, video gaming, auto racing and cars, etc. Snap can develop new Discover content to create custom audiences based on specific interests.And this data created through Snap's content business is not just for ad targeting - Snap reportedly studies and shares detailed data on how content is viewed with Discover partners, aiding in the production of future content. And in the time it takes a user to create one data point watching a traditional 30 minute TV episode, Snap gathers 10 from its three minute episodes.Due to the short length and relatively low production quality of Snap Shows, Snap's content costs are also theoretically very low compared to traditional TV networks, ranging from $6k to $45k per episode. Meanwhile, traditional long-form content with high production values cost anywhere from $1 to $10 million per episode, with everyone from Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), YouTube, Facebook, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), among others, all bidding up content prices competing in the new world of streaming libraries that can generate revenue over extremely long periods of time. Paying as little as $6k per episode, Snap can afford risky bets on Shows that do not pay off. At that cost, Snap could theoretically fund 1,667 episodes at the same price as the traditional $10M long-form episode.Amazon, which just disclosed Prime Video had a US audience of about 26 million, just committed to spending $1B to develop a five season Lord of the Rings series. Facebook has joined the party too, paying a range of $550-750k per episode for Watch content. Facebook recently bought the rights to LaVar Ball's, ""Ball in the Family"", for roughly $30-40k per minute. Early Watch results, however, seem to be poor, with views plummeting after the first episodes.Ultimately, just like how consumers watch many different channels within a cable package, consumers will subscribe to, and watch content from, multiple providers. The shorter, cheaper, and more varied the content is, the more valuable it will become for content distribution platforms that sell targeted ads. Snap seems to have a structural advantage due to the way it built its low cost content business.Beyond the increased publisher views brought on by the redesign, Snap Shows have almost immediate upside. Snap originally booked Snap Show ads at fixed pricing, ranging from $0.02 per impression with a 50/50 revenue share with the publisher, to up front sponsorships like Match.com did with Hungry Hearts. Per Digiday, Snap was slow to book fixed-rate deals in its Shows until at least the end of October, with three of the six Snap Shows featured on Oct 20th 2017 showing zero ads; making it no coincidence Snap missed revenue projections its first three quarters as a public company.Due to the slow start, revenue from Snap Shows was relatively muted in 2017. Digiday reported Snap began filling un-booked Snap Shows ad slots with its self-serve programmatic platform mid-way through Q4, which was also its first quarterly revenue beat as a public company. CPMs on Snap Sold inventory are reportedly in the $6-10 CPM range, while Partner Sold comes in around $15-20. All told, recent programmatic ads are selling for about half the rate of fixed pricing - but much better than showing no ads at all - and at nearly zero marginal cost as the content would have been viewed regardless.Using a conservative $5 CPM for every single Snap Show, assuming Snap has a 50% revenue share on every show, and the typical three ads per show, Snap would make just under one cent per view ($0.0075). Assuming an average of 6 million views per show (based on some of the numbers above), on 5 shows per day (on about 80 shows series per year), projects annualized revenue of $82 million at $225k per day.I personally think these estimates are too conservative, as there is a lot of upside in Snap Shows from 1) increasing CPMs, 2) increasing the views on each show, 3) optimizing the mix of ads in each show, 4) increasing the number of shows per day, 5) licensing content for a fixed cost and keeping all revenue, 6) product/sponsored placement within shows, and 7) even distributing Shows or content IP on other platforms.Snap has stated on nearly every conference call since going public that advertisers adopted its self-serve ad platform quicker than expected, which depressed CPMs by nearly 70% YoY in Q4 to the $6-10 range. Prices will increase as more advertisers realize the high ROI of Snap Ads at current prices and enter the auction. Advertisers are also more likely to sponsor entire seasons (at higher or fixed prices) after Snap has proven consistent viewership and starts rolling out second and third seasons in 2018. Snap is also beginning to allow Discover partners to run branded ads that blend in with their content, which hints at more fixed pricing. As traditional TV networks reduce ad load in live programming to compete with uninterrupted online streaming, it also is likely CPMs for live broadcasts rise, making Snap Ads look more affordable comparatively.Increasing the number of views on each show is also low hanging fruit, as the new Discover Feed allows Snap to source literally any piece of content (not just Shows, but publisher or influencer stories as well). Before the redesign, episodes disappeared from Discover after 48 hours, and only some could be found by crafty users using Snap Search. Now, Shows can be sourced in the Feed weeks or months after release. If a user watches an episode of the Food Network's Chopped show, Snap can populate the feed with other episodes in the series. It can also put a user's favorite show at the top of the feed - something that was less likely to grab users' attention when stories from friends took priority over Publishers in the old Discover design. Snap also has the option to broadcast shows globally, or even on other platforms (web, mobile, theaters, streaming, etc.), significantly boosting the reach and amortizing the cost per show over a higher revenue base.Snap could also increase the number of ads per show. Snap appears to be testing ad placement between each auto-advance in Discover content, squeezing in an additional ad on each view (which may have no revenue share). Snap could continue experimenting with length and ad mix in Shows, inserting additional non-intrusive tap-to-skip ads.Snap can also increase the frequency of new episodes. Comments by management early in 2017 mentioned three shows per day, a number that has since moved up to five. If Snap Shows continue to see success, there is no reason to stop at five - especially when they are so inexpensive at $6-45k per episode.Assuming that CPMs on Snap Shows eventually reach $20 (in line with the low-end of traditional TV and high-end of digital video), Snap is able to improve average ad mix to four per show, all Snap Show revenue is still impacted by the 50% revenue share, average viewers per episode double to 12 million, and new episodes per day bumps up to 10, Snap would generate approximately $1.75 billion in annualized Snap Show revenue. At about $4.8 million per day, Snap shows become a 90% gross margin business (not considering hosting costs) if assuming all 10 daily episodes cost near the high end of $45k each.Showing investors the next steps in its content business beyond Snap Shows, Snap partnered with NBC to live stream Olympics coverage from within Snapchat. Snap has existing partnerships in place with nearly every traditional TV network, professional sports organization, and its 60-80 media partners on Discover to expand this considerably. Eventually, all these partners (and perhaps select influencers) could launch their own live ""channel"" within Discover. Twitter's live streaming strategy is starting to bear fruit, for both itself and its advertising partners. Could Snap do the same?Live TV on Snapchat also gets interesting when you consider Snap's Crowd Surf feature launched in the fall of 2017, which uses acoustic fingerprinting technology to link together snaps submitted by different users into one concurrent stream that allows users to jump to different views. Snap could eventually take Spectacles footage and combine multiple angles together to create a seamless live stream of nearly any event. Snap also invested a small amount in autonomous drone startup Skydio, which could mean they are thinking more in terms of third person footage.Thinking about the Discover Feed in a few years when it its live offerings are fully built out, it truly becomes TV for Gen Z. Spiegel has said numerous times that the purpose of Discover was to provide users content while waiting for their friends to reply to a message. Just like consumers used to channel surf back in the day, or now browse Netflix, Snapchat has become a content destination to kill time.Snap currently does not have ad products for ""Live TV"", but its entire non-AR ad business is based around full-screen video ads. Ads are currently limited to 10 seconds, but Snap could introduce non-skippable, longer-form ads into its self-serve ad manager if it goes the way of live TV. Snap may also forgo doing the advertising internally, and partners could just pay Snap to broadcast their own stream that they then monetize themselves.There is also the possibility for Snap to eventually create a programmatic digital ad platform for its media partners to plug in to their own streaming apps, similar to Google's DoubeClick for digital publishers. Disney's (NYSE:DIS) contract with FreeWheel actually expires soon, and among both Google (which powers CBS All Access app) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), there is speculation that Disney may work with a smaller player to avoid working with Google or Comcast.Snap acquired MetaMarkets in 2017, which offered live inventory discovery and bid monitoring, gave clients an API to import data into other apps, and aggregated ad metrics over numerous ad platforms. This acquisition tells us Snap may be looking to incorporate multiple third party programmatic campaigns, from numerous advertising exchanges, into its own ad manager. This would not put it in competition with FreeWheel, but more so a tool for advertisers and content partners to better measure and coordinate their entire ad campaigns across multiple platforms.A network like NBC has the capital to create a wide enough variety of content to create targeted user profiles (and has its own product in Comcast's FreeWheel), however a targeting option like ""goes to the beach"" is hard for even Comcast to deduct based on streaming activity that is generally done on WiFi. Some of the smaller Discover partners or more niche TV networks would benefit from being able to tap in to Snap's massive user profiles on nearly one hundred million Americans, either in their own app or within Snapchat's Live TV offering. Snap benefits from these partnerships as well, as new types of content within Snapchat or on its partners services provide additional viewer data that can be used in both targeting and future content creation.On Black Friday, Snap announced its newest ad product, Promoted Stories. Thinking about this new ad format in the context of the new Discover Feed, it fits into Snap's advertising offerings similar to a native news feed ad on Facebook or Instagram, a product that brought in nearly $40 billion in revenue between Facebook and Instagram in 2017.Source: Author's screenshot of the new Snapchat redesign showing a Sponsored Story appearing in the Discover Feed when first swiping to the feed (left) and after scrolling down (right).At launch, Marketing Land reported Sponsored Stories would sell at fixed rate, single-day countrywide takeovers, with metrics on impressions in the feed, how many users tapped on the story, how many watched until the end, and the effective cost of those metrics based on the price. And AdAge reported that they are expected to evolve into a targeted ad product served through Snap's self-serve platform based on impressions. Not only does this give Snap a product that digital marketers are extremely familiar with due to Facebook's success, it also creates an opportunity for advertisers to recycle the videos created for Sponsored Stories as Snap Ads within Discover content.The new Discover Feed also changes the game for Snap Shows and Publisher Stories. In Snapchat's old Discover design, posts from friends and influencers were featured much more prominently than Snap Shows or Publisher stories. The new Discover Feed seems to put more emphasis on Shows and Publisher Stories - two products that are much more profitable for Snap than stories from friends and influencers. If Snap figures out that a user likes a particular Snap Show, it can serve them subsequent episodes in the season; essentially allowing users to binge watch Snap Shows as they could on Netflix. Snapchat will be able to provide users an endless stream of content, whether it was created one hour ago or one week ago. Discover now auto-plays to the next item (prior it returned to the Discover section), occasionally inserting ads in between each auto play. Content in Discover is also now shown vertically, not crammed in horizontal bars underneath friend's stories as it was in the old design. The Feed also sources stories from influencers that users do not follow, helping them grow their audience - a common complaint of Snapchat, and a reason influencers embraced Instagram Stories.Thinking about the Discover Feed from a financial perspective, we can start with assuming the 38 million daily Discover viewers as of the summer of 2017 as leaked per the Daily Beast, see one ad feed impression per day. At a conservative $3 CPM, it's an additional $42 million in annual revenue. Playing around with the numbers, assuming the 38 million users increases by the 40% Snap saw in early tests of the redesign, or assuming the Discover feed sees CPMs similar to Facebook's news feed, revenue could be $1.4 billion or more in a few years. And the revenue may entirely fall to the bottom line, as there is a very low marginal hosting cost in putting an ad in the Discover section that users have already been scrolling through since 2015. Screenshots have recently surfaced of Snapchat testing old versions of the Discover section, but the point remains that feed revenue stands to be a significant revenue driver going forward.Beyond having a unique advertising product, Snap has a large, exclusive reach that is being criminally under appreciated. This App Annie report I have referred to in past articles still holds true: Snapchat reaches an exclusive audience within the United States that cannot be reached on other platforms on any given day. And 79% of users are older than 18, debunking the narrative that Snapchat is only useful for reaching teens.Source: Snapchat and the Power of Putting Data in Context for Marketers & AdvertisersThe consensus seems to be that Snap has no scale. However in August of 2017, MarketingLand compared the total reach of Facebook, Instagram's Feed, Instagram Stories, and Snapchat (excluding users who use only messaging) as reported in each company's Ad Manager. As shown the charts below and the article linked above, Snapchat actually reaches a larger audience than Facebook's properties in a few key demographics.Snapchat Stories actually reaches a larger audience than Instagram Stories in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and France. When looking at the 13-17 year old demographic specifically, Snapchat completely dwarfs the above markets, including Germany.Source: How Facebook's, Instagram's and Snapchat's audience size estimates compare - Marketing LandFacebook and Instagram's huge lead in users comes from very small advertising markets and from the 35+ demographic in the large ones; an important demographic, but ones who are usually late adopters of new trends, and now starting to move to Snapchat. Instagram also added features in early 2016 that lets users easily switch between multiple accounts, contributing to Instagram's higher user count, yet fewer unique Stories users than Snapchat. Facebook has nearly 700 employees on its internal PR team (plus hundreds working at external PR firms), no doubt a key to its success in distracting advertisers and investors from looking at the details.Comparing the numbers in the charts above with the (dated, but still relevant) tables below, it becomes clear: Most advertising is done in markets where Snapchat has a similar reach to Facebook. Zenly, which Snap acquired in the summer of 2017, appears to be fairly popular in three other important and emerging ad markets: Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia. Source: eMarketerAs shown in the image below, Facebook has incredible reach - however, most of that reach comes in very small advertising markets. India (280M), Indonesia (140M), Brazil (130M), Mexico (85M), the Philippines (69M), Vietnam (59M), Thailand (52M), and Turkey (52M) make up 41% of Facebook's 2,129M MAUs as of March 2018; however those nine markets were only projected to bring in roughly $6.4B of mobile ad spending in 2018, giving Facebook an upper ARPU range of $7.38 on 41% of its user base if it captures 100% mobile advertising market share.Source: Data shows you didn't #DeleteFacebook, so make sure to change these settingsIn the five large markets Snap reaches a similar audience to Instagram - the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and France - mobile ad spend is estimated at $83.4 billion in 2018, 100 times greater than Snap's 2017 global revenue. Despite Snap's audience in these five markets being nearly 10% the size of the large Facebook markets mentioned above, the total ad spend is nearly 10x higher.Beyond just messaging and pulling each other into the app, Snap's engaged network of users also use the camera to experience Augmented Reality. The AR market is expected to reach $85-90 billion as soon as 2022, with a case to be made it eventually exceeds $1 trillion. Over 95% of that $85-90 billion is expected to come from areas Snap already generates revenue: eCommerce, Hardware, Advertising, Apps/Games, and Location-Based spend. While it is uncertain exactly how AR will evolve over the next few decades, one thing is certain: It must be experienced through the camera.One of the largest, quickest industries to benefit from the camera will be advertising. Lowe's cites $60B ""sitting on the sidelines because customers can't envision products in their home and don't pull the trigger on buying"". Forrester estimates only 5% of marketers are using AR now, with 17% planning to use it in 2018 (340% YoY growth), with AR expected to be much more relevant to marketers than VR for the next three years.A study by the Boston Consulting Group (commissioned by Snap) highlights some early success in AR advertising. Multiple campaigns for consumer goods companies delivered an average 10% increase in sales with a 3.1x return on ad spend, with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) notably seeing a 10.5x return and significant lift in foot traffic. At current prices, returns appear to fall in-line with other ad mediums. Snap is currently transitioning sponsored lenses from fixed pricing to its self-serve auction platform. Just as CPMs on Snap Ads declined dramatically in the auction, Snap may be able to do the same with AR advertising - significantly lowering prices to increase returns for advertisers and make it harder for competitors to profitably scale their own AR advertising platforms.Source: Average Return on Advertising Spending (ROAS)* and Incremental Sales for US CPG Ad Campaigns, by Media, 2004-2015 - eMarketerThe BCG study reports numerous barriers to increasing AR spend, the largest being a lack of scale. BCG estimates that more than 80 million people in the US, or roughly one-third of all smartphone users, engage with AR at least monthly. Per the report, Snapchat reports 70 million monthly AR users in the US, which would be approximately 87.5% of US AR market share (may be a little high). Snap also has said that half of the entire 13-34 year-old US population plays with AR on Snapchat per week. Globally, a recent Deloitte study projects 300 million consumers will create AR content monthly, and Snap says 70% of its 187 million users (131 million) play with Lenses each month - smaller global market share at 43.7%, but certainly above 50% if you exclude the tens of millions of AR users in China where Snapchat is banned. Certain AR-based apps may rack up fast downloads, however, it is unlikely another camera-based platform becomes a daily habit in the same way that Snapchat has, giving it a significant advantage.Source: Augmented Reality: Is the Camera the Next Big Thing in Advertising?Snapchat may have less reach than Facebook's news feed; however AR is experienced with the camera, not in a feed, and Facebook shares very few statistics on how much its in-app cameras are used. Hidden in this recent article, Facebook disclosed to Forbes that more than 1 million users ""created video clips"" with the Facebook Game of Thrones lens that ran back in August of 2017. Back in August, Variety reported that more than 45 million users ""viewed or posted"" the Game of Thrones Night King lens that ran on Snapchat during the same time frame. The two day lens campaign for Paddington Bear on Facebook was ""used over 26k times"" - merely 5% of the lowest daily sponsored lens usage reported in the leaked Snapchat data between May-September '17 (Source: page 20).The second largest barrier to AR advertising is a lack of clarity on ROI. Snap says users are engaged with AR ads for 20 seconds on average - an entirely different dynamic from TV ads, where viewers often change the channel or look away from the screen at their phones. Among the many different targeting features mentioned earlier, Snap just recently introduced a ""Shop Now"" feature to its AR lenses, a very direct way to measure ROI on Snap's AR ad products.Camera advertising also brings back the importance of creativity to advertising, which has slowly fallen to the wayside in the age of hyper targeting (which is at risk of being regulated away). With a lack of solid digital ad options, advertisers put up with Facebook news feed video ads, which auto-play without sound and are actually encouraged by Facebook to have captions - essentially the same as a banner ad from the 90s.Other concerns relate to lack of expertise and worries about cost. As I wrote about in December, Snap's Lens Studio democratizes the AR creation process. It lets anyone from creative professionals to middle school students create AR lenses, and establishes Snapchat as the largest AR distribution platform.Currently, advertisers are looking for reach, impressions, engagement, and brand awareness, areas Snapchat's AR ads appear to be beating the competition according to marketers. Engagement will remain important in two years, with purchase intent and incremental sales key as well - which Snap has invested in via in-app commerce and offline store attribution.Source: Augmented Reality: Is the Camera the Next Big Thing in Advertising?Looking beyond the advertising that will drive AR revenue growth in the short-term, the end state of AR is contextual computing - data that is overlaid on a 1:1 digital map of the physical world, often referred to as the AR Cloud. This will ultimately be done via cameras in smart glasses that eventually replace smartphones. The AR Cloud will create and reference trillions of digital data points across the entire the physical world, potentially indexing the real world similar to how Google search indexes the web. Reaching this point may be over a decade away, and getting there will be a slow, gradual process. Numerous things are holding it back, primarily fitting the tech into fashionable, affordable, and functional smart glasses.When it comes to Snap's long-term AR strategy, expect it to draw parallels to its ladder into content. Snap has already leveraged its network of messaging users to introduce Face Filters, 3D World Lenses, and most recently, Context Cards and the Snap Map (all pieces of the puzzle). Due to the complexities of having a digital replica of the entire planet that accurately matches the physical world down to the millimeter, any platform that is able to create a base of both users and developers before releasing AR-enabled smart glasses will have a huge advantage. Apple used the original iPod to build a base of users and train them to download music from iTunes before the launch of the iPhone, which evolved into a cross-platform App Store that now serves numerous Apple products.Stepping back, Snap Lenses are essentially the AR equivalent of mobile apps. And Snap's Lens Studio, Snap Codes, and Context Cards are tools for developers to begin creating experiences on Snap's AR ecosystem. Snap will eventually allow developers to monetize their lenses, which will most likely work cross-platform whenever AR-enabled Spectacles launch. Judging by the 131k members in the Snap Lenses subreddit, Snap appears to have generated massive interest in the developer community, most likely due to its scale in distributing AR to consumers.Gaming will be a big business in AR, especially as consumers increasingly prefer the sort of non-linear, open world gaming experience (Pokemon Go, PUBG, Fortnite, etc) that will work well in AR. Apple's ARKit has shown the potential of AR gaming apps; and Snap's Lens Studio will eventually provide the tools for developers to build complex games within Snapchat Lenses. Snap's mid-2017 acquisition of PlayCanvas, an HTML5 game engine ran entirely in the cloud that allows multiple users to edit at once, indicates Snap is serious about AR/VR gaming. Snap has been running game-based ads and lens games for years now - recently launching a global Easter Egg Hunt via the Snap Map (a hidden asset worthy of its own discussion). On April 25th, Snap introduced Snappables - AR games played with your face that will be a permanent feature in camera home screen. Other forms of in-app gaming will come next, followed by multiplayer, perhaps laddering from Snap's new 16 person group video chat feature. Bitmoji, the #1 most downloaded iOS app of 2017 (and another hidden asset worthy of its own discussion), hints at capabilities for developers and users to quickly personalize AR characters. This gives Snap an existing tool to quickly grow in not only AR gaming, but nearly any sort of customized AR, and eventually VR, experience.Content will eventually be shown in AR, which has been the most difficult piece of AR/VR to solve. Snap has spent years developing its content business, with the recent launch of 3D Bitmoji lenses giving us an idea of the direction Snap is going. Audio and music will eventually blend with AR, and Snap has incorporated music in both face filters and 3D world lenses. AR has use cases in special effects at events and concerts as well, giving Snap opportunities to eventually incorporate distribution of AR-enabled Spectacles at events with its various media partners.AR has endless commercial purposes too. Snapchat currently has poor conversion metrics (see below) - something that its recent commerce initiatives are looking to improve on. Snap has been testing an in-app Snap Store, and will likely ladder existing user behaviors to move further into the space. Snap is building e-commerce functionality within both Discover and Lenses. McDonald's is rolling out Snap Codes for menu items on trays in France, and Bareburger is using a combination of Snap Codes and Snap Lenses to create restaurant menus that are based entirely in AR, while providing significant cost savings. And Nike recently partnered with Snap for an exclusive launch of the Air Jordan III. Combining Snap's ability to refer traffic at Facebook-scale with the fact that Gen Z, the heaviest Snapchat users, contribute to $830 billion in US retail sales annually and convert twice as much on mobile as other demographics, Snap seems to be positioned well to compete in e-commerce.Source: 4 Key Facts You Should Know Before Allocating Ad Spend - Heap | Mobile and Web AnalyticsThe concept we know as Search will also be important in AR. 50% of searches are done locally with some of those done on the spot. Being able to hold your camera up and get contextual information will certainly save users a lot of time - and improve conversions for advertisers if done correctly.All of these opportunities in AR revolve around the camera - which is why hardware, or smart glasses, appears to be the most competitive in the space. The use cases for smart glasses will be limited at first, most likely revolving around sharing first person content - exactly what Spectacles do now, but will eventually include all things highlighted above. Partnerships with nearly every major US sports league gives us a hint of how Spectacles may also play in to Snap's live streaming feature - the ability to view multiple angles of live, in-game first person footage from players on the ice.Snap is positioning Snapchat as a mobile/wearable cross-platform product, which will allow Snap to eventually roll-out AR-enabled Spectacles with existing use cases to its network of messaging users. Even if Spectacles never take off, Snap could license its camera operating system to other companies, even auto manufacturers, a similar approach Google took with Android on mobile. Snap partnered with Royal Caribbean to make a Spectacles-powered underwater scuba mask, so they are certainly exploring the idea.Using Facebook's North American ARPU of $82.4 as a benchmark, Snap's content-heavy monetization strategy appears to have significant room to expand its NA ARPU of $8.7 by over 9x.As I have lain out above, Snap could bring in as much as $1.7B and $1.4B in Show and Feed revenue, respectively, over the next few years. Considering Snap's competitive positioning in AR, it also seems likely Snap wins significant share of the projected $85-90 billion AR market by 2022 - which is not being reflected in the consensus sub-50% revenue growth estimates in 2020 and beyond. Assuming only a 10% share of the AR market ($8.5 billion) and a conservative 25% revenue growth on its current business (which, mind you, increased ad impressions 575% in 2017), Snap could bring in over $13.5 billion in revenue by 2022. This is not really considering the specific impact of Snap's eventual Live TV offering, or Bitmoji, the #1 most downloaded iOS app in 2017, and no considerations are being made for the Snap Map, which is quickly becoming a messaging home screen combined with Yelp and Google Maps (considered one of Google's most under-monetized assets according to Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak).At the 75% 5-year revenue CAGR to hit $13.5 billion by 2022, Snap trades at a P/S/G of 0.29, a 63% discount to Facebook's 0.46 based on consensus analyst estimates and a generous 25% 5-year revenue growth rate. AR is likely to still be growing at a rapid rate by 2022, and if it truly does become a trillion dollar market, Snap could be trading a very significant discount to intrinsic value.As Snap grows, it is unlikely to be valued solely on revenue. A recent leaked internal memo stated Spiegel had a goal for Snap to be profitable in 2018. The market seemed to shrug it off, or at the least to be done through cost cuts, as Snap recently cut 10% of its engineering staff in February and 100 from its 400 person advertising team at the end of March. What the market seemed to overlook was that Snap implemented a performance evaluation program in 2017, previously having no system for culling underperformers. At the time of writing, Snap had 127 jobs posted on its jobs page, 52 of them in engineering - hardly an indication of drastic cost cutting.Hidden beneath disappointing top-line numbers, Snap increased Snap Ad impressions by 575% in 2017, and 90% in Q4 alone. This massive increase in impressions was offset by declining CPMs, down 70% YoY in Q4 '17. This occurred due to Snap channeling 90% of Snap Ad revenue through its programmatic self-serve auction platform, from $0 in Q3 '16. The self-serve platform serves as a base for Snap to scale revenue quickly on nearly every future product (AR lenses, Bitmoji advertising, programmatic live TV, and the Snap Map, to name a few), with less friction for customers, and at higher margins than manually placing ad-buys with human sales reps. It also explains Snap laying off some of its advertising team, along with ex-VP of Sales Jeff Lucas.In Q4, Snap disclosed that over half its revenue was generated outside the AdAge Top 100 advertisers, who spent a combined $267 billion in 2016. Representing less than 0.2% of their budget share, it's not too farfetched to think Snap has considerable room to grow revenue as the largest marketers look to diversify their digital advertising away from Facebook and Google. Even assuming all $13.5 billion in 2022 revenue comes from big brands, that only represents 5% of their ad budgets.CPMs for Snap's AR carousel ads are currently priced around $8-20 (with Snap Ads as low as $2.50 in some cases), which compares to premium digital ad prices on Facebook, Google and other digital properties ($2-6 for display, and $12-20 for video), and traditional TV at anywhere from $14 to $80. The recent Ads.txt study also revealed that online video inventory may be overstated by up to 50 times - with a crackdown potentially boosting CPMs across the industry.Snap's CPMs can only fall so far before marketers notice. Their primary concern with Snap has been its lack of targeting and measurement capabilities, but Snap has invested significantly in targeting (as explained earlier) and first and third party measurement solutions, including its Pixel tracking tool. In Q4, management stated that one in three Pixel beta partners spent their first dollar on the platform after adopting the pixel, and that contested auctions see ~40% higher CPMs. The 3x increase in usage of the Pixel over the course of Q1 '18 appears to indicate more advertisers are joining the auction, contesting and raising CPMs.Source: Snap Pixel Usage StatisticsAs Snap's CPMs stabilize in-line with other digital ad units, revenue in the short term will be driven by increased ad impressions in Discover, the new Feed, filling empty ad units in Snap Shows, and AR lens carousel ads. These combined with live TV and impression-based ads on the Snap Map and Bitmoji (article to follow later) will drive medium-term growth, and the economic value created by building out an AR ecosystem will drive long-term growth over the next few decades.Snap may also continue relying on impression growth to boost supply and drop CPMs, putting pressure on rivals. Facebook's management team has repeatedly stated they will rely on rising CPMs for revenue growth (hard to increase impressions when users spend less time in the app). Facebook's CPMs were up 175% YoY (14%, 24%, 35%, and 43% by quarter), with ad load increasing 80% YoY, but decreasing sequentially every quarter (32%, 19%, 10%, and 4%).Much has been said about Snap's lack of profitability; however on the Q3 call, CFO Drew Vollero stated that gross margins in the US were over 50 percent. When adjusting for non-cash and non-recurring expenses, its reported gross margins have also improved in 11 of the last 12 quarters. A central pillar to the Snap bear case is that it won't be able to grow revenue faster than COGS due to its hosting commitments with Google and Amazon. In Q4 however, Snap increased revenue $77M QoQ, posting 87% contribution margins on its hosting costs, showing that Snap has very low marginal cost on new ad revenue. Snap also said during its roadshow that it expects its cloud hosting costs to actually decline as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google compete on cost. Google Cloud recently launched a data center in Mumbai, which should also help lower hosting costs related to Snap's historically more expensive international user base.The majority of Snap's operating costs are related to employee salaries and stock-based compensation, and management has repeatedly stated they expect hiring to slow going forward. Much of the areas Snap is adding revenue in 2018 - Snap Shows, Discover Feed ads, and AR lenses - are already being used by users, yet have been un-monetized. Considering the new self-serve ad platform that requires minimal additional internal support, Snap should have very low marginal costs and most revenue may fall to the bottom line as the business scales in 2018.Looking forward at our prior estimated $13.5 billion in 2022 revenue, at a 20% free cash flow margin (Facebook posted 43% in 2017), free cash flow comes in at $2.7 billion. Discounted back to today at a conservative 20% discount rate, Snap's 16.5x multiple still trades at a ~62% discount to FB's 26.5x.Even using relatively conservative assumptions, Snap currently trades at a significant discount to Facebook. Snap's business is evolving into a combination of old school television and new school tech. A mix of messaging, content, advertising, software, and hardware in a way that combines select pieces of WeChat, Viacom, Google, and Apple. Time will tell if Snap truly becomes a major player in these spaces, but it appears to be positioning itself to do just that. The transition to a self-serve ad platform that dampened revenue growth in 2017 appears to be in the past, which will serve as a foundation for Snap to grow the business from a position of strength going forward."
4166856,102101,2018-04-27T10:52:45-04:00,Snap continues to draw advertisers with innovative AR solutions.The recent introduction of Shoppable AR can add up to $100 million in ad revenue in 2018.I rate Snap a BUY with a strong potential for a 10% upside to a market cap of $20.10 billion.,"Snap’s (SNAP) digital assets are at least a generation above its competitors. The recent introduction of lens studio and Shoppable AR has the potential to add up to $100 million in revenue as early as FY'2018. This article explores the case to be more bullish on Snap's latest innovation.Snap was arguably justified when it started pricing its digital assets at a premium. The only reason we have seen a reduction in CPM for some assets is to reduce pressure from investors to grow market share which makes sense when you think about building a business for sustainability.In the recent past, Snap has been churning out innovative ideas, products, and solutions. Advertisers might begin to rethink the way they allocate their marketing spend. Initially, Snap hasn’t been able to convince a lot of brands, due to its high pricing, lack of self-service platform and focus on limited marketing objectives.Guess what?? All those handicaps are quickly becoming a thing of the past. Snap’s ads are now as competitive as Facebook’s (FB). Also, Snap has partnered with a number of measurement and analytics companies to help brands drive more return on their marketing spend. The reason you should be more bullish is the introduction of more digital assets and solutions to drive more performance driven campaigns for advertisers.It all started with the launch of the lens studio, a solution which makes it easier for brands to build custom lenses to target over 70 million Snapchat users who use the digital asset. The reason I’m excited about this is that Snap’s advertising solutions play in terrains where they meet zero competition from other advertisers. Like the Google Search ads, which are native to Google, Snap ads are native to Snap’s platform, and they are unique in their feel and design.While brands are beginning to worry about the effectiveness of their banner ads due to negative developments such as the installation of ad blockers, banner blindness, and data collection issues, the opposite can be said about Snap’s digital ad assets. The level of engagement seen in these ads will ensure that they continue to herald the shift from static and dynamic banner ads to AR-driven digital media ads.By expanding its augmented reality lenses to solve more business objectives like App installs & Online Shopping, Snap is opening up more revenue generating opportunities for itself. This was dubbed ‘Shoppable AR,’ as reported on CNBC a week ago. The market barely responded to the huge potential of this announcement. I see a lot of value that has been overlooked in the potential way this product can disrupt the status quo.Let’s start with how Shoppable AR works. Shoppable AR is a type of Snap lens that gives advertisers and/or their target audience the ability to:The third feature is where I see potential to generate huge value; hence I would be expanding on it.The app install marketing objective has been missing on Snap’s advertising platform since inception, given that it’s one of the fastest growing segments of the mobile advertising market.Source: Business InsiderThe US had a 25% market share of the worldwide app install market in 2015. This put the overall market size in 2015 at $18 billion (assuming advertising spend by media buyers is approx. equal to advertising revenue to media solution providers). When this forecast was made, Snap wasn’t even on the radar.This means that the trio of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), Facebook & Twitter (TWTR) have been raking in billions in ad dollar by providing brands with the option to target users to download mobile apps in the top play stores.Exhibit 1: Potential revenue contributionWith Snap’s entry into the app install space, there is a need to understand how value will be generated. Assuming the US continues to contribute between 25%-30% of the overall market size, the overall market's ad revenue can be valued at approx. $22 billion, with Google & Facebook as majority. This is supported by the robust growth of the app economy over the past ten years, strongly assisted by the growth of the smartphone market and the number of hours people stay glued to their smartphones.Source: Business InsiderIn the best case, Snap can rake in up to $220 million in additional market revenue from app install ads in 2018 with a 1% market share. This low market share projection is due to Snap's relatively limited monthly active users (< 200million vs FB at 2 billion). Also, given that a quarter (1Q'18) is already spent and that 2Q’18 is already underway, a 1% market share in 2018 might be too optimistic. Instead, I’ll be pegging my bullish projection for 2018 at $100 million (0.5% market share) after factoring the different price points.Exhibit 2: 2018 revenue estimate from Shoppable ARSnap will be selling the new AR lens at $100/day. This means Snap will have to attract up to 5,000 advertisers for a minimum duration of 200days to rake in $100million in 2018. This doesn't factor in the direct access option which is priced at $40,000/day for a more targeted audience.Raking in $100million is not hard to achieve, though it will come at a reasonable cost. Already, brands like Adidas, Clairol and STX entertainment are set to use the feature. Given Nike's (NKE) earlier success with an initial test in February, I don't see new brands failing to achieve their set goals after trying the feature. Exhibit 3: Potential share price contributionThe successful launch of Shoppable AR to advertisers can add up to 8% to Snap’s current share price of ($14.55/share) if Snap can rake in an additional $100 from mobile app install ads. In the worst case scenario, significant revenue generation could be delayed until next year. However, we can’t rule out Snap’s grand entry into this space and the potential cash flow it can generate from it.I assign Snap a buy with a (5-10%) upside from its current value within a minimum six months duration from now."
4163714,102101,2018-04-18T09:08:13-04:00,"Barclays reiterated important bullish views ignored by shortsellers.Slowly but steadily, Snap will climb up again.Why you can't bet against the future of digital marketing.","Recently, Barclays announced the possibility of a significant revenue upside for Snap (SNAP) in Q1'18. The note caught my attention because it echoes some of the bullish points I've been hammering over the years, the disregard of which led to the squeeze of some short-sellers who thought I've been peddling fiction after the last earnings report.According to its research note:Though my thesis was more about the negative sentiment which suppressed Snap's valuation in the low teens share range. In Barclay's scenario, they are forecasting the possibility of significant upside into the $21/share trading point.This is not far-fetched, and I will explain my reasons for supporting this thesis.Source: eMarketerEven if Snap isn't as great as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for targeting mobile and desktop web users, the fact that advertisers are rotating their marketing spend from traditional to digital marketing channels is a good one for Snap. Bears keep overlooking this simple fact. And, with every passing day, this theory only gets more convincing as more people around the world join the smartphone revolution. With ~200 million people on its platform, a significant portion coming from developed countries where consumers have enormous purchasing power, it's hard to rule out Snap as a key contender for the future cash flow that will be generated from digital marketing.The rollout of the self-serve platform made life easier for its partners and advertisers. This was better explained by Brittany Richter, VP, and head of social at Dentsu Aegis' iProspect:Source: SnapSince the rollout of the self-serve platform, advertisers have seen a significant decrease in ad rate. The CPM rate for buying ad impressions now runs between $3 and $8 when Digiday surveyed media buyers in November last year. This has made Snap's pricing as cheap as Facebook's, and with a more defined teenage audience, advertisers hoping for drone-precision targeting will not hesitate to rotate more budget to Snap.While the major downside has been the short-term negative impact on revenue due to pricing dilution, it has no doubt helped Snap gain more market share amongst digital advertisers. By the time these advertisers get comfortable buying ad inventory on Snap, competition in the ad auction for premium ad slots will cause a 180 reversal in CPM rates.The recent layoff of an additional 100 advertising employees after the initial cut that took place in January is hard to interpret as value creating. While some analysts have argued in favor of this decision, I strongly believe that Snap needs all the talent it will take to build a competitive ad engine. Cutting its workforce by 250 creative minds might be good for the short-term financial posture of the company; it's not necessarily clear if Snap won't end up regretting this action. By the next earnings season, meeting its operating and profit margins goals won't be hard as its aggressively reducing spend after numerous media backlash about the rate at which the company is hemorrhaging cash.Snap currently makes about a dollar and fifty cents from each user per quarter. Compared to Facebook's $6.18, it is clear that for Snap, the best is yet to come. By the time advertisers get a firmer grip of the potentials inherent in the platform, it won't be hard for Snap to double its ARPU assuming DAU peaks at 200 million (worst case scenario). In the scenario in which DAU continues to grow, we should expect Snap to hit or even surpass the $1 billion annual revenue mark this year.Exhibit 1: Revenue forecast in millions assuming DAU doesn't break out of the single-digit y/y growthThe revenue forecast above highlights the potential for Snap to surpass expectations. Averaging its Q4'17 ARPU in 2018 assuming a mid-single digit DAU growth ensures the company scales the $1 billion revenue mark. The point of the chart is to show the potential to grow revenue assuming DAU growth stagnates in the single-digit range while the CPM rate takes a positive turn due to competition for ad slots as Snap adds more advertisers.The sensitivity to ARPU growth is real, and this potential can mostly be unlocked by fostering competition for ad slots. This is inevitable, given the app redesign completion and the introduction of the self-serve platform.SNAP data by YChartsIt is clear that management is focused on bringing down cost while ramping revenue. And, this can only mean one thing, a significant dilution of Snap's current valuation ratios. This would create more bargain opportunities as the revenue numbers for 2018 roll in.I believe Snap is headed in the right direction, and the $21/share price target is not far-fetched. Using the diluted shares outstanding of 1.42 million, this will fetch a market cap of $29.82 billion. Given that ARPU growth was approx 30% from the previous quarter, if we assume a 20% growth this year, a mid-single digit growth in DAU will give a forward P/S ratio of 20.8 ( FY 2018 rev @ $1.43 billion). Remember we were right around that mark before the usual negative sentiment assisted by cries from Kylie Jenner and Rihanna sent the stock crashing."
4159626,25831,2018-03-28T13:42:50-04:00,Snap could well benefit from Facebook's data sharing problems as users flee and look for new social media platforms.Snap showed real progress in revenue growth in the fourth quarter and that momentum could carry into the new year.Like most newer tech companies Snap has a solid balance sheet due to being able to raise lots of cash by issuing equity shares to investors.,"Snap (SNAP), better known as Snapchat, will probably see an increase in users who simply want to keep in touch with family and friends by sharing photos and thoughts in light of the public relations fiasco by Facebook (FB). The Facebook data story is front and center in the news and it looks like Congress may launch public inquiries which will keep the story in the news for some-time. The most recent report is that Mark Zuckerberg himself will testify in front of Congress.The New York Times is reporting that the hashtag #DeleteFacebook ""appeared more than 10,000 times in a two hour period"" on Twitter (TWTR) after it was initially launched. No matter what one's personal viewpoint on the controversy is, the fact is many people are very upset and are deleting their Facebook accounts. Those who are regular users of Facebook will most likely seek an alternative. Hence Snapchat's chance to gain more traffic.Just like many young tech companies launched with lots of fan-fair Snap has a solid balance sheet with lots of cash. Here is a look at their cash versus debt situation:Snap has more than 5 times the amount in cash than it has in total liabilities. However, $2 billion in cash is not in and of itself a reason to purchase a company with a $20 billion market-cap. Growth potential is what drives the valuation of up and coming tech companies.Snap has been delivering on growing its revenue. It may not have hit all of Wall Street's anticipated benchmarks, but the company has been growing rapidly. Here is a look at the income statement for the last three years:As can be seen above revenue has grown rapidly in the last three years. Spending has also grown rapidly. It should be noted that in 2017 Snap rewarded its employees with stock and stock options worth $2.6 billion based on achieving pre-determined goals with the launch of its IPO in early 2017. Those expenses were non-cash and non-recurring and won't impact 2018's financial performance. They were spread across both the research and development line and the general and administrative expenses line. The better measure is to look at Adjusted EBITDA. That still showed an increase in cash losses in 2017.There are reasons to believe the company may move toward actual profitability soon based on the growth momentum the company has and the new opportunity to pilfer former Facebook users. Let's take a look at the growth metrics in both users and in revenue per user. Below is a look at a chart of total daily users for Snapchat:An active daily user is the number of accounts that log onto Snapchat in a single day. So since not everyone is a daily user the company actually had more than 187 million global subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2017. Here is a look at the global distribution of Snapchat's users:As can be seen above the company still has room to grow its number of subscribers in North America and Europe. It especially has room to grow its number of daily users in the Rest of the World. Consider that Facebook had more than 2 billion global users in the fourth quarter of 2017. With only a fraction of the number of users compares to Facebook, Snap has the chance to gain significant market-share.An underappreciated opportunity for Snap revenue growth lies in the statistic of quarterly revenue per daily user. The charts below is what really caught my eye:Notice how revenue per user has grown 50% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. What's exciting from an investment perspective is the global distribution of that revenue:Snap revenue per user grew by 28% in North America from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. But it grew by 136% in Europe over the same time period. And it grew by 207% in the Rest of the World. The potential for rapid growth seems to be much greater when the numbers are broken down by region than when they are all lumped together on the top line. North American growth of 28% is good, but not spectacular. Rest of the World growth of 207% is eye-popping. Especially since that is where most of the growth remains. Less than 1% of the Rest of the World are active daily users on Snapchat. And Rest of the World revenues per user are only 1/5 of what they are in North America. I recommend investors do their own due diligence on Snap and consider adding it to a highly diversified aggressive portfolio."

BB wants to monetize its patent portfolio and Snapchat could be its next victim.Snapchat's business model is still unproven. It has limited capital and incurred cash burn of over $800MM last year.Will a BB lawsuit end Snapchat? Sell SNAP.,"Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel. Source: Financial TimesAccording to Bloomberg, BlackBerry (BB) is suing Snapchat (SNAP) for allegedly using its patented messaging technology in its Snapchat app:The lawsuit comes at a difficult time for Snapchat. The company has been public for a few quarters now, and the honeymoon period is over. The company has an $18 billion market capitalization and now it's time to deliver on its promise.BlackBerry was once synonymous with smartphones. It pioneered smartphones and messaging apps for business people and consumers. BlackBerry handsets lost market share to smartphones from Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple (AAPL). As BlackBerry's handset use dwindled so did use of BlackBerry messenger. It appears BlackBerry is claiming the technology used to create BlackBerry messenger is still relevant and is being used by the likes of Facebook (FB) and Snapchat.BlackBerry claimed Facebook subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram infringed on patents for the Blackberry messaging app. It cited infringement of certain security features, user interface and functionality enhancing features. Currently BlackBerry's handset revenue is practically nil. In its most recent quarter, it generated $212 million of revenue from core software and securities businesses which represented over 90% of total revenue. It is monetizing its best-in-class securities features with third-party institutions, governments and within connected cars. It now wants to monetize its portfolio of over 5,000 patents.I thought BlackBerry CEO John Chen was on a fishing expedition until BlackBerry won a $940 million arbitration award from Qualcomm (QCOM); the award shored up BlackBerry's balance sheet and helped changed the narrative around its stock. When it comes to patent infringement allegations, BlackBerry has made a believer out of me.Qualcomm has cash of over $30 billion; given its liquidity and cash flow, a $940 million payout to BlackBerry is immaterial. Facebook has over $40 billion of cash on hand. In my opinion, a billion dollar payout to BlackBerry would be immaterial; however, it could hurt the value of WhatsApp since messaging is core to its business model. Snapchat, on the other hand, only has $2 billion of cash and equivalents. A sizeable pay to BlackBerry would put a dent in its liquidity.Snapchat is also hemorrhaging cash. For full-year 2017, the company experienced cash burn of over $800 million. Burning cash is not unusual for start-ups. At its current cash burn rate, it could burn through 40% of its remaining liquidity this year. The company raised $2.7 billion in capital last year. Would investors be willing to pony up more capital if Snapchat had a legal payout pursuant to BlackBerry's infringement claims?Asking for more money could be challenging given that Snapchat is having difficulty monetizing its video sharing platform. The concept of exploding video is an excellent one, but can the company earn money from it? In Q4 2017, Snapchat's revenue of $286 million delivered impressive growth of 72% Y/Y. However, operating expenses grew over 90% Y/Y and its EBITDA was -$342 million, down from -$159 million in the year earlier period. Even if operating expenses were flat, the company would still have suffered an EBITDA loss.That's a long-winded way of saying it is uncertain whether the company's business model even works. Its daily average users (""DAUs"") of 187 million are sizeable, and growing at double digits. Either Snapchat needs to get its average revenue per user (""ARPU"") up or its cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU"") down.In Q4 2017, ARPU less CoRPU was around $0.53. Other operating costs (R&D, SG&A) averaged a combined $2.36 per user. Its EBITDA loss per user was over $1.80. The company can attempt to grow out of its loss position. More users would generate more revenue, and costs. If Snapchat was able to amplify user engagement it could potentially negotiate better ad rates, and increase revenue without incurring more costs. This is a dilemma faced by several other social media sites.With quantitative easing coming to an end, this may be as good as it gets for the U.S. economy. This may also be a peak environment for online ad rates. If the economy stagnates, then advertisers may have to negotiate lower rates or reduce the number of sites they advertise with. Neither scenario would be good for Snapchat. If it cannot make money in a peak online ad environment, then how can it make money if online advertising stagnates?Snapchat needs all of its $2 billion in capital to fund future losses pursuant to its evolving business model. It can ill-afford a BlackBerry lawsuit. Sell SNAP."
4156503,87566,2018-03-14T18:52:14-04:00,"Snap has had an interesting month, and with shares in the company trading at levels not seen since June 2017.Breaking even, much less profitability, is a hugely ambitious target for Spiegel to have set, especially since the firm lost $720 million in 2017.Short-term successes, a market buoyed by the optimism generated by Twitter finally generating a profit and hungry to see its rival Snap do just the same.","By Oisin Breen, ResearchSnap (NYSE:SNAP) has had an interesting month, and with shares in the company trading at levels not seen since June 2017, when its stock was very much on the way down, and 35% off its post-IPO peak, cautious optimism seems to be slowly creeping its way onto the market, however the firm's deep momentum, and its changeable reputation, may yet again prove the old adage what goes up, must come down.Recently, a company-wide note sent by Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has put the firm back in the news. Spiegel told staff that breaking even is this year's goal. Yet whether Spiegel can address the significant challenges his firm faces over the long term, investors willing to expose themselves to risk might find opportunity in the Venice, California-based company's stock.Does the five-year share price for Snap indicate a potential longer-term rally or is it just a phantom?An investor considering increasing their exposure to the social media market might think they could do worse than an investment in Snap, after all the firm's share price is rising, its financials are improving, and its CEO is bullish, however the firm's history and three negative indicators suggest that the long-term outlook for Snap is very likely gloomy.That said, as the sentiment behind Snap continues to climb, the opportunity may exist to make a speculative profit from Snap as it tries to regain mid-February levels in the low $20 range, from its current level close to $18. In the longer term, however, it would seem prudent to either hold-fire on Snap, or to consider shorting the stock if it comes close to testing the $17 and $18 marks, the most recent points of resistance.Breaking even, much less profitability, is a hugely ambitious target for Spiegel to have set, especially since the firm lost $720 million in 2017, and analysts have forecast losses of up to $912 million this year.Snap's losses have climbed steadily. In 2016 the firm lost $293 million, and in 2017 this figure rose to $459 million. In percentage terms this means that in each of the past two years Snap's losses have increased by 57%. Should analysts' 2018 expectations hold, the rate of increase will fall to 27%.Snap's yearly income figures show few grounds for optimism:Source: WSJPerhaps Spiegel wants to take a page out of Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) play-book, and cut costs in the pursuit of profitability - Snap recently dismissed over twenty HR staff and 120 engineers, indicating the firm's current headcount of around to 3,000 is to be a near-term peak.Yet, regardless of whether savings can be made on the staffing-side, Snap has increased its spend per user, raised R&D expenditure, and appears to believe that ""expanding into new markets"" is an achievable goal, as against a marketing statement for a firm that many believe has already reached its zenith.Operating cash flow for snap falls year over year:Source: WSJA proverb more often associated with gravity than the stock market might seem a strange fit with a social media firm, and some stocks in the sector have defied it seemingly indefinitely -- take a bow Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- but despite Snap's upbeat February earnings call that has buoyed the market for SNAP shares, it's hard to see the kind of real lift behind Snap that could take it into Orbit. Don't forget this is a company whose reputation relies so much on the celebrity ""influencers"" that back it that a tweet critical of the platform's redesign from reality TV-star Kylie Jenner was able to send Snap's share price tumbling 8%.In the firm's favor are the following facts: Q4 revenues grew 72% year-over-year, a figure which was 19% higher than the Reuters consensus, daily active users (DAU) grew by 18% in the last quarter to 187 million, and average revenue per user rose to $1.53 in Q4, up 46%. Even the firm's earnings impressed, with EPS coming in at -$0.13, three cents above expectations, while top-line sales of $286 million beat expectations by 13%. Snap is growing, maximizing its income streams, and outperforming forecasts.Quarterly income statements show slowing losses:Source: WSJUnfortunately for Snap, its present growth tells only one part of the story. In 2017 the firm recorded a net loss of $3.4 billion, including stock-based compensation expenses. Filter these expenses out and losses still stand at a hefty $845 million. Revenue costs climbed 5%, and costs overall equaled 200% of revenue for the year 2017. Snap's user growth is also slowing down, which is something often overlooked considering DAU climbs of 5% quarter over quarter and 18% year over year. In fact, a quarter by quarter analysis of Snap's growth reveals that DAU growth is well on the way to plateauing and that the 100% DAU growth of 2014, or even the 50% growth of 2015, are best consigned to history.Snap's user growth is plateauing:Source: Investor PlaceThe longer-term momentum for SNAP might be toward greater cost-efficiency as the firm cuts costs and improves its capacity to sweat its only real asset, its users, but there are limits to how much you can squeeze a group as fickle and variable as Snap's key 18-24-year-old user-base. Vulnerable to debt and financial pressures, this market is also far less likely to develop a sticky relationship with what still amounts to a souped-up messaging platform.Short-term successes, a market buoyed by the optimism generated by Twitter finally generating a profit and hungry to see its rival Snap do just the same, and the kind of hope that is endemic in the latter stages of a bull market all play a part in Snap's climb from 2018 lows of $13.56 to highs of $20.42 a share. As is often the case with Snap, however, the momentum behind it feels like a case of the emperor's new clothes.Snap's one-month share price shows ""influencer""-sparked plunge, but also hints at an uptick: Source: BloombergAlongside the fact that the momentum that currently drives Snap's shares up may well run out of steam as skeptical voices grow bolder, Snap faces an existential crisis. If the firm relies solely on the youngest age groups, it has little ability to protect itself from tastes that will invariably change, yet if it pursues an older market, Snap risks losing its cachet with its key user base, and has to take on platforms that are already strongly entrenched in their respective age markets, like Facebook and Twitter.Right now, Snap are pursuing an older user base and taking such a risk. The firm aims to make 25-34 year olds its key demographic in the next three years and anticipates its younger client base will slowly taper off, with over 55s also starting to come on-board.In a developing market, this strategy is all well and good, but Snap's rivals have already adopted the firm's unique characteristics as their own -- see Instagram Stories for example -- and there seems little in Snapchat that would lure people from markets that already have a leader.Given the likelihood that younger users will be unhappy sharing what has until now been their own personal stomping ground with older siblings, adults, and parents, retention among Snap's current core demographic is likely to prove increasingly problematic the more Snap's demographic shifts.The risk here is that Snap will be unable to maintain a sufficient degree of user stability as it tries to shift its demographics away from the youth market, and two factors suggest that maintaining such an equilibrium may prove extremely difficult: critical mass, and preferential attachment.In 2017, Facebook's net income rocketed 56% to $15.9 billion, and the firm achieved this without the support of the youth market. It doesn't need them, and they don't need it until perhaps they find out when they get older that they do. Facebook has hit a critical mass in terms of its size, its profits, and its market penetration.To take on a market-leader with the clout that the California-based company has is a tough ask, to do it when little differentiates you other than your name and your experience seems an insurmountable task, and if you don't think Snap can take on Facebook, and you don't think it can keep its current position in the young-adult market, then it's worth asking what is Snap for? If you can't answer that, then the threat the future poses to the company is crystal clear, it may lack the critical mass to survive a significant shift in its market.The larger nodes attract more connections than the smaller, demonstrating preferential attachment:Source: Science MagazineOne other thing stands in the way of Snap establishing itself as more than just another upstart doomed to fail, the principle of preferential attachment. The physicist Albert-László Barabási, famous for his study in the field of networks coined the term preferential attachment, and loosely put it means that the more connections a single node in a network has -- think a person, a computer, or a brain cell -- the more likely that more connections will be made to it.Bluntly put, if everyone over a certain age uses one platform, and I start making connections with people outside my immediate young-adult peer network, I start to migrate, yet if I already am a user, and have the Facebook average of 338 friends, changing my social network means incurring a heavy loss to my wider social capital. Snap offers current users of Facebook no networking incentive to make the move, while Snap users have all the incentive they need to abandon what may ultimately end up a sinking ship.For a firm that just can't make it rain, and faces risks including heightened uncertainty, a competitive environment, slowing user growth, a lack of social capital, and a fickle user-base, Snap is doing well to grow at all, yet the firm's lack of a track-record, its high costs, and the pressure it is under to ramp up the revenues each user generates, points to the possibility that Snap lacks that certain élan vital to make it a long-term rival for the leaders in the social media space, and even perhaps for it to survive as a going concern.Disclaimer: Spreadbetting, CFD trading and Forex are leveraged.

4168009,99506,2018-05-01T12:12:56-04:00,"Snap will report its Q118 financials after the close today.Snap has learned to communicate more in sync with what investors want to hear during quarterly reports. The company is attempting to pivot its business plan.Snap shares spiked higher after the Q417 report based on the company's discussion of slowing its cash burn and attempting to achieve positive cash flow in the future.Despite Snap's more savvy quarterly communications effort we believe the company's problems are deeply rooted in a failed business model and that the company's chances for long-term success are questionable.Accordingly, we posted that we had covered our short. We anticipate Snap's quarterly report today could spur a round of short covering and buying. We will look to initiate a new short position into any price spike that occurs after today's earnings.","We are long-term bearish on Snap (SNAP) shares. But this is a volatile stock that has proven to be very profitable for traders both long and short. We want to maximize trading profits based upon the opportunities presented by Snap's newest efforts to pivot its business model. The Q417 financial report gave investors hope that Snap had finally acknowledged its rapid cash burn was unsustainable and would be making efforts to rein in spending. The hope is that this will give the company an extended runway in which to grow revenues, innovate new products, or enter into significant partnerships.The company also recently announced its desire to pivot into more direct head-on competition with Facebook (FB) in an effort to take market share in the more profitable older demographic. The combination of Snap's newfound frugality and admission that its original business model was fatally flawed was initially applauded by the market. Please note on the chart below that Snap's shares spiked higher from about $14 to nearly $21 per share on last quarter's announcements. Please also note that the market sold this price spike afterwards all the way back to $14 as concerns about the company's ability to implement its ambitious goals emerged.SNAP data by YChartsSo here we are again on another Snap reporting day for their Q118 results. With such a strong cult-like following and also a high short interest, this stock is notorious for having volatile reactions to its earnings reports. We believe that Snap is learning to communicate more effectively with investors and thereby able to favorably move the price of its own stock, at least in the short term on this earnings report. Accordingly, we posted here in Trader's Idea Flow on 4/16/18 that we had covered our Snap short in anticipation of a possible price spike on the Q118 financial results that will be announced today after the close.However, we believe that the song remains basically the same for this Venice Beach-based company's future fortunes. Snap's previous business model focused primarily upon a younger millennial demographic, which unfortunately for Snap paid little attention to ads on the platform and had limited purchasing power. Outsourcing of key items like server space has caused the company significant expenses for the maintenance of users. And as the most affluent markets have become saturated with social media competitors all vying for the same limited number of daily user minutes, acquisition costs for new users have climbed. Further evidence of the inept management at Snap has been on full display with the widely despised redesign of their platform. Impacting the user experience negatively with a very unpopular redesign had to have been initiated and approved by the top of Snap's management. This means that CEO Spiegel would be directly responsible for another questionable, key business decision at Snap.Of course, Snap's strategy to become a direct competitor of Facebook from day one was never a strong point of the company's business model. Now Snap's new strategy is to compete even more directly with Facebook for a larger share of the older demographic market. Snap has finally realized late in the game that its millennial demographic is not going to result in the very significant levels of revenue growth that Snap requires to achieve any chance of profitability in the near future. With the cash burn of the dwindling IPO capital becoming an increasing concern, the company's financial survival comes into question.The lead editor of Trader's Idea Flow acquired his Series 7 stockbroker's license in 1986. After 35 years in the market, we believe that only in the latter stages of an aging bull market can a highly speculative stock drop a bomb of an earnings report as Snap did in Q417 and still trade higher. Here are the key financials from last quarter in the image below:Any company that posts such horrific results in consecutive quarters can expect dire consequences in the future unless a change, of course, delivers better results. No one should expect the dwindling IPO cash to last long at this rate of cash burn and there is no sign that Snap will reach profitability... perhaps ever. So as a last resort, the company is throwing a Hail Mary pass by pivoting its efforts to grow market share into Facebook's established territory with older users. We don't think that you need a graduate degree from the Wharton School of Business to determine how this new strategy of Snap's is going to work out. Competing directly with Facebook and Instagram in social media was a fatally flawed premise in the business model for Snap from the beginning. Now Snap is doubling down on that kamikaze choice to compete even more directly with Facebook and Instagram in social media by targeting Facebook's core demographic of older users. Markets are questioning the wisdom of this decision by Spiegel with good reason.We believe that market capitalization of $17.1 billion is far too high for a company with Snap's failing business model. The company recently acknowledged its failing model by making a highly questionable attempt to pivot the model directly into head-on competition with the superior company Facebook. Now CEO Spiegel who has never managed any public company previously and launched Snap straight out of his college dorm (actually, Spiegel procured the creative concept of disappearing messages from dorm-mate Reggie Brown) is now making ambitious promises to cut costs drastically while also promising to continue growing revenues. Cutting headcount in R&D, marketing, and all other areas of a company generally portends future problems and not future growth.The most affluent social media markets like North America have been saturated for some time now. Yet Snap magically turns in miraculous DAU growth every single quarter without fail. Either the DAU reporting is not credible or Snap is taking on money-losing users from less affluent markets. We believe that it will be difficult for Snap to cut costs and also sustain revenue growth at anywhere near the Q417 rate of 72% revenue growth. All of the signs ahead for Snap point to increased competition not only from Facebook but from numerous other major tech companies that are all hungry for growth in their acquisition of advertising dollar market share. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are but a few companies competing for Snap's market share of advertising dollars.Now the long-term bear case for Snap is perhaps stronger than ever before. But in the short term, Snap may be attempting to take a page out of Twitter's financial reporting game plan. Several quarters ago, Twitter made a choice to begin cost-cutting measures that have been largely aimed at achieving an improved balance sheet. This financial engineering received high grades from Wall Street, which has appreciated the stock nearly 100% based upon Twitter's efforts to shore up its balance sheet largely through reduced spending. Snap may have noticed.TWTR data by YChartsNow Spiegel and company have begun their own rounds of cost-cutting measures and Wall Street noticed during the last quarterly report from Snap. We believe that Snap will continue with this strategy and communicate on any progress or future efforts to achieve an improved balance sheet on today's Q118 report and conference call. This is the reason why we believe there may be a round of short-covering combined with buying on today's reporting by Snap. But just like last quarter's earnings from Snap were sold off after the initial spike, we believe this negative pattern might repeat itself.Accordingly, we have already covered our short early two weeks prior. And we intend to initiate a new short on SNAP shares if any price spike once again repeats itself for Snap this quarter."
4168769,92586,2018-05-02T16:06:12-04:00,"Following very weak results, I believe Snap has moved decisively into the ""social media loser"" column.My original 2020 DAU, ARPU and op margin milestones seem all but unattainable.I continue to avoid the volatile SNAP, and remain much more optimistic about FB and TWTR over its younger cousin.","The divide between winners and losers in the social media space has deepened. At least this is my opinion after having reviewed Snap (SNAP) 1Q18 earnings released on Tuesday, following the closing bell.Image creditLet me first set the stage with a brief review of the results.Revenues of $230.7 million lagged consensus by an embarrassing $13 million - the second worst miss in Snap's short history as a public entity. In the case of a fast-growing company in the very early stages of its life, operational metrics tend to matter more to many investors than financial performance. But even on this end, DAU (daily active users) reached only 191 million in 1Q18, representing the smallest sequential growth rate as far back as I can trace. Adjusted loss per share of $0.17 met consensus, while GAAP net loss that includes share-based compensation reached a sizable $385.8 million.Back in early 2017, I argued that Snap could produce the results necessary to support its stock price (of $23/share back then) in the long term if the company reached a series of usage, monetization and margin milestones. More specifically, I projected DAU growth of 5% sequentially each quarter through the end of 2020 and ARPU of $3.00 as a baseline set of assumptions for any plausible, bullish investment thesis on SNAP to hold water.But as the charts below illustrate, both metrics seem to have failed to move in the right direction, leaving little hope to shareholders that the original bar that I had set for the company can be achieved within the next couple of years.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsLast quarter, I asked myself whether Snap's efforts to improve user experience - crucial for the long-term viability of the platform - had started to bear fruit, following strong results. But it seems like my own warning that ""one quarter does not make a trend"" jinxed Snap's momentum. I'm a bit more convinced today that Snap's struggles may not have been left behind, and that the strength in 4Q17 could have been a fluke in a series of otherwise weak quarters.In my view, SNAP is a highly speculative play in the social media space that would only make any sense to me in homeopathic doses, if at all, to limit the downside risk to my overall portfolio. In terms of upside potential, I would need to believe that SNAP will double in value within the next 12-24 months in order to accept the meaningful downside exposure. But for the share price to reach the low $20s once again in the foreseeable future, my milestones described above (DAU and ARPU, in addition to op margins of 30%) would need to be reached, which I currently find highly unlikely.Looking at the bigger picture, I don't trust that Snap has the same real-time news appeal that has turned peer Twitter (TWTR) into a likely ""thriver"" in the social media space. And at the core, I believe that Snap was born prematurely as a publicly traded company (i.e. too deep in the red and not yet ready for market scrutiny) and with the ""wrong DNA"" (i.e. management's ""larger is not better"" attitude suggesting failure to understand that scale is crucial for the success of the platform and the company).Source: DM Martins Research, data from company reports and Yahoo FinanceWhen it comes to investing in social media, I continue to think that simple does the trick: Facebook (FB) is currently the undisputed leader and, despite recent concerns over user data mishandling, will likely come out the big winner in the space. The table above compares a few of FB's and SNAP's key metrics, and the appeal of the former over the latter seems pretty obvious to me.For now, I continue to avoid the volatile SNAP, and remain much more optimistic about FB and TWTR over its younger cousin."

Source: stylecasterA few weeks ago, pop star Rihanna and Snapchat (SNAP) made major headlines. Snapchat ran an advertisement for a game called ""Would you rather."" The game poses tough questions to its participants. The choices the Snapchat ad gave were ""Slap Rihanna"" or ""Punch Chris Brown."" Brown pleaded guilty in 2009 to assaulting Rihanna during an argument when they were dating.Rihanna criticized Snapchat on social media for animating something that would intentionally bring shame to domestic violence victims, and making ""a joke of it.""Snapchat removed the ad from its platform and also admitted the advertisement was approved in error:Snap's share price fell by over 5% after Rihanna's criticism went public, wiping out over $800 million of its market value. The criticism has been a public relations nightmare for the company. Rihanna has millions of fans, and I would wager that many of them are avid users of social media, including Snapchat. Secondly, amid the ""Me Too"" movement women are fighting back against violence and harassment. This is the wrong time to make light of it. That said, the Rihanna tete-a-tete is just one of many of Snapchat's problems.When I first heard about Snapchat's exploding videos a few years ago, I thought it was a neat idea. It could save teens the embarrassment of having their videos seen by people other than who they were intended for. Just because something is a neat idea does not necessarily mean it should be a publicly-traded company. Snapchat went public a year ago. Its revenue has grown, but like most start-ups, Snapchat is hemorrhaging cash.In Q4 2017, its revenue of $286 million was up 72% Y/Y. Its daily average users (DAUs) of $187 million rose 18%; growth in average revenue per user (""ARPU"") rose 46% and outstripped 6% growth in cost of revenue per user (""CoRPU""). Snapchat is growing its infrastructure in order to sell more ads and generate new revenue opportunities. Its R&D and SG&A expenses more than doubled versus the year earlier period. EBITDA and cash flow suffered for it. Snapchat generated EBITDA of -$342 million, down from -$159 million in Q4 2016.Free cash flow for Q4 2017 was -$197 million, and -$819 million for full-year 2017. The company raised $1.2 billion of preferred stock in 2016 and another $2.7 billion in common stock in 2017. At year-end, its cash and securities were just over $2.0 billion. At its cash burn rate how long will its liquidity last?Snapchat has an interesting, value-added platform but can it monetize it? Twitter (TWTR) had a similar situation a few years ago. Its platform had tens of millions of active users, but would advertisers pay for it? To generate more ad dollars, Snapchat increased the number of companies that could market their products on its platform. CEO Evan Spiegel recently revamped the site to separate [i] photos and videos generated by users' friends from [ii] content from publishers, creators and influencers.In separating the ""social"" from the ""media,"" Spiegel is taking a big risk. He practically has to in order to increase user engagement and generate more ad dollars. In Q4 2017, the company's ARPU and CoRPU were $1.53 and $1.00 respectively. That created $0.53 per user to cover other costs like R&D and SG&A.Snapchat's R&D and SG&A were a combined $2.36 per user, yielding EBITDA per user of -$1.83. To become EBITDA positive, the company must rapidly grow its user base, increase ad rates, increase user engagement or cut costs.Tasks within its control could be cutting costs or amplifying user engagement. Snapchat recently laid off over 200 employees related to advertising and engineering as it seeks to right-size the business. I believe the next evolution is to amplify user engagement and keep people interacting longer with one another on the site. This could potentially generate higher ad dollars. In my opinion, the more incendiary the content, the more engaged users can be. That is why I believe Snapchat's ad featuring Rihanna and Chris Brown was not an accident, it was likely strategic. I believe Snapchat understands how incendiary and controversial content can spark engagement. Secondly, the public cannot get enough of celebrities and the Internet and social media have given us a closer glimpse into their lives. Certain sites and influencers have practically made a living writing about Chris and Rihanna and other celebrities. When I first heard the story about the Snapchat ad, I suspected the company was in trouble and needed to take risks to amplify user engagement.After examining its financial results, I am practically certain of it. The company cannot cover its operating expenses and needs to take risks. The blowback from purposely posting incendiary content is that the site could become too toxic and push users and potential users away. That appears to be have been the case with Rihanna. I also would not be surprised if Twitter or Facebook (FB) are not also attempting to create their own video sharing platforms to compete with Snapchat. A real threat from another social media giant could cut into Snapchat's ad revenue and amplify its cash burn.The Rihanna tete-a-tete likely implies Snapchat is having trouble financially and needs to amplify user engagement. I do not think the PR debacle will crush Snapchat, but consistent operating losses and cash burn could. Sell SNAP."
4149735,22148,2018-02-22T18:48:03-05:00,"Snap faces a user revolt following a Snapchat app redesign.The lower user rankings risk a reversal of the improved monetization of the social media site.Due to already weak financials, the stock faces elevated risk.A passionate user base is the one saving grace for the stock not hitting a $7 target.","Snap (SNAP) dropped 6% on Thursday as the market is catching on to the elevated risk of a company with massive losses facing a user revolt. The stock is one to absolutely avoid as previous research indicated it's still risky to short due to a passionate user base.Citi (NYSE:C) analysts had already warned investors that the recent app update to Snapchat had very few fans. App review ratings had plunged to 1.3 stars though the stock held up strong with a market cap of nearly $26.5 billion despite revenue estimates for the year at only $1.3 billion. The market tends to forget that Snap has 1.42 billion diluted shares outstanding while most financial websites use the basic share count of 1.25 billion shares. A stock rarely maintains a P/S multiple of 20.The problem with the app redesign that rolled out back in November is that the company beat Q4 results due to a head fake from the initial results. The social media site made the move to focus on the media aspect of the platform in part due to weak financial results. Per the earnings call, the company saw improved engagement with publishers and older users, but Snapchat is frustrating the younger user base in the process:Remember that the issue with the stock is that investors are factoring in years of massive growth to justify the current market cap. The company burned $819 million last year to run the business and started 2018 with $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Analysts forecast the following losses over the next two years and the scary part is that the numbers continue to rise.Without revenue growth that won't occur with a user revolt from the redesign to improve monetization, Snap will face a troubling financial picture. So even with an online petition gaining momentum and the Citi warnings, the death blow appears to be this tweet from Kylie Jenner to her 24.5 million followers on Twitter (TWTR). Now Kylie later came back and said she still loved Snapchat, but her message is clear with the 257,000 likes. People don't like the update and momentum is only growing.Ironically, the use of Twitter to display the frustration with the Snapchat update proves the power of that platform though we'll keep the discussion to Snap in this article.While bad reviews are a clear negative long-term sign, Snapchat hasn't seen any material change in the download rankings. The app has dipped to eight overall in the App Store in the U.S. which over the last 90 days is near the lower end of the rankings, but normal.Source: App AnnieThe app was last updated on February 20, so the rankings after this update are crucial. Some of the January and February updates probably attracted dissatisfied users to check to see if the update fixes the problem. The first sign that Snap is really in trouble would be people choosing to follow Kylie Jenner and not update the app going forward.The risk is that users just migrate to Instagram owned by Facebook (FB) that obtains mostly five-star reviews. So far no indication exists that loyal Snapchat users are shifting to Instagram and the lack of other options provides the social media service with some hope.The key investor takeaway is that analysts forecast Snap to lose over $500 million next year based on strong revenue growth. The revolt on the app redesign built specifically to help monetize the app has clear negative implications for already weak financials. Any clear indications that users are abandoning the platform vs. only complaining would signal that Snap is an actual short.The case for the stock trading around $7 or with a valuation of $10 billion is easier to make with each passing day. Investors who want to short the stock need to be careful as momentum in the stock hasn't been killed yet. Not to mention, people passionate enough to demand change to the platform are likely to stick around hoping for a more user-friendly update."
4158483,103672,2018-03-23T14:05:00-04:00,"Redesign plans have got off to a more than shaky start with Snap losing the trust of millions of users over updates and numerous celebrity complaints about the app.A $40 million loss on spectacles clearly wasn't enough of a wake up call for Spiegel to realize Snap is investing in the wrong areas and failing to diversify revenue streams.The Facebook threat, through Instagram, remains just as prevalent, and the longer Snap goes on making feeble decisions, the more impossible it is competing with Instagram.Intrinsic flaws in their ad structure and app identity remain the crippling factors for Snap and mean that while they are present Snap will continue to disappoint.","Since my initial review of Snap’s (NYSE:SNAP) viability as an investment various events and changes have occurred for the company, some of which could be argued to have put Snap in the strong position many bulls had hoped for it to be. Yet five months on the issues haven’t been resolved nor have they changed, and the fundamental intrinsic flaws within the company still remain just as prevalent as they did before. With every cloud … two more appear.Following on from Snap’s disastrous, yet hardly surprising, Q3 2017 earnings announcement, CEO Evan Spiegel said in the call to investors that they would be working on redesigning the app in order to make it easer to use and understand for users. This announcement, for me, was the first sign of actual introspective thinking from Spiegel and the rest of the Snap board and thus I genuinely thought it would be a step in the right direction for the company.I mentioned previously the need to introduce more permanent aspects to the platform in order to not only attract new users but also retain current ones. Aspects such as a profile page, similar to that of overbearing competitor Instagram, may cause users to begin to view Snap as more than just a fun way to send pictures to friends. At the moment Instagram is social currency for millennials and its importance to them is exactly why they post pictures at certain times to get the most likes or why they make sure they follow less people than follow them. Snapchat isn’t and so a profile type feature, where users can more publicly interact with their friends and followers, would be vital for evolving the platform beyond its simplistic, and frankly exhausted, current form.The redesign process has been far from impressive. The update introduced last month brought about huge amounts of public backlash with users hating the changes that had been made to the app. Spiegel and Co.’s intention was supposedly to better distinguish the social and discovery aspects of the app. They attempted to do this in the social section of the app by grouping together user messages with their friends' stories. Yet the way in which the update was designed means users' most recent messages are pushed far down the message feed and replaced with any story a friend posts, making the new feed both inconvenient and difficult to use.Furthermore the redesign of the discovery section is parallel to this. By joining celebrity accounts and network news shows, users cannot access their favorite content as fluently as before. Instead they have to scroll through various celebrity stories they don’t want or shows they’ve never seen just to find them. Thus Snap’s efforts to make the app easier to use had the complete opposite effect.This was reflected in the public uproar the update caused with users so dissatisfied they petitioned pleading for Snap to revert back to the previous version, which gathered 1.25 million signatures. The steam gathered by the petition and the overall backlash prompted Citi (C) analysts to downgrade Snap and lower their expectations for the stock. They said ""while the recent redesign of Snap's flagship app could produce positive long-term benefits, there is a significant jump in negative app reviews since the redesign was pushed out a few weeks, which could result in a decline in users and user engagement, and could negatively impact financial results."" Clearly a sign firms are paying close attention to consumer feedback when it comes to social media companies like Snap.To only further confirm the failure of the update, one of Snap’s biggest celebrity users, Kylie Jenner, voiced her disapproval of the Snapchat app to her 24.5 million Twitter (TWTR) followers saying she doesn’t even open the app anymore. This first sign of public celebrity disapproval of the app caused Snap’s share price to fall 8% consequentially and highlights the importance of Snap’s biggest stars to the company's reputation and performance. Additionally, as recently as this week music star Rihanna came out publicly on Instagram slating Snap for using an ad on their platform asking users if they would rather ""slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown,"" referring to their domestic violence case in 2009. The subsequent response of uproar sent the share price falling 4% on the day after the singer viewed this as disrespectful personally and disrespectful to domestic violence as a global issue and voiced her distaste for it on social media. Moreover, even before stating her anger she highlighted her preexisting dislike for the app itself, similar to Jenner. Now I can't quite grasp what’s the worst part of the story for Snap here, the PR nightmare, the fact that another huge star with an over 100 million total social media following publicly slated the popularity of their app, or that fact that she posted this all on Instagram, INSTAGRAM! It makes Snap’s situation look almost comical at this point. Spiegel however said no such reversions would be made and the new design was here to stay.Aside from the blatant backlash and Hollywood princesses playing with Wall Street, once again this is an obvious sign of Snap trying to take a step in the right direction yet going about it in the completely wrong way. This was clearly an effort to make the app easier to monetize through distinguishing the discovery section. Yet by trying to replicate the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram feed type feature they’ve in turn taken away the convenience selling point at its core. The former discovery section was easy to navigate and users could find their favorite shows in seconds. Now they have the task of having to scroll through numerous celebrity pages (very much ranging from major to minor) just to find them. And yes there’s the search bar. But the whole point of the news feed is that they don’t have to search for it - it's right there in front of them. Convenience is and will continue to be the most valuable asset for social media companies like Snap.If Snap had instead just separated celebrity stories and news shows into two separate parts of the discovery section the platform would be easy to use and organized just like that. Yet the backlash caused by the update indicates a less than impressive Q1 2018 set of results are likely to be seen. Slowed user growth and especially poor revenue figures look likely as ultimately if users don’t want to go on the discovery section, as its difficult to use, ad exposure will plummet which Snap simply cant afford as ad revenue makes up a considerable amount of their overall revenue (93% in 2017, ad revenue from discovery was $774.1 million while overall revenue was $824.95 million). Moreover, the backlash of the petition and multiple celebrity public slatings make substantial growth for Snap's DAU's look unlikely at best. Another area I've touched upon previously is Snap’s hunt for multiple alternative revenue streams. Again a great idea for a social media company, yet the story wasn’t pleasant in November and it doesn’t looking much rosier now. The release of the supposedly revolutionary ""Snap Spectacles"" last summer was nothing short of catastrophic for the company, with the net return on the product causing a near $40 million loss. Again it’s not at all hard to see why. As I've previously stated the spectacles are a novelty, they don’t solve any issue for the market and while users can take almost professional level resolution pictures using their phones, which they also use for everything else, why would they spend a further $130? Thus the failure of the product was hardly surprising. Yet it seems they are not giving up on spectacles just yet with the company planning on rolling out two new models one at the end of this year and a further model in 2019. The next model will be water resistant and the third will be able to film 3D videos.Once more it seems Spiegel and Co. think they’re changing their approach yet they’re just making the same mistakes in different ways. The latest iPhone model is water resistant so there’s a fundamental reason not to the buy the specs. As for the 2019 model I would think it more than likely that future iPhone models will be able to offer 3D filming before Snap can offer it, based on the financial capabilities and resources available to Apple (AAPL) compared to that of Snap. Thus this is just more investment into a product that ultimately solves no issue nor has any USP (unique selling point) to justify its price.One area that I thought did hold promise, and still believe could be a real area for Snap to shape its future business model around, was the push into original content. Although I still hold that Snap’s nature and demographic prevent them from being able to effectively distribute the sort of TV content typical of networks such as HBO, owned by Time Warner (TWX), Snap’s biggest content partner. Instead development into producing short, 3-5 minute, user demographic tailored shows could work well for them and in turn offer them a niche hold over the content streaming market which tech giants are currently battling to control. However Snap’s first original content show for Time Warner failed to achieve this with the show being cancelled at the end of 2017.The CNN show on the app was unable to gather enough attention from viewers for Time Warner to warrant continuing funding production of it, a pretty poor way for Snap to announce their arrival into the original content market. Snap still have their deal with Time Warner however and the potential access to their various and multiple networks mean they still definitely have the tools at their disposal to find their short segment niche. Additionally, Snap also still has a content deal with Disney (DIS), and personally I believe this could be Snap’s best avenue for a successful run in original content with Disney's ownership of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example, offering an opportunity for Snap to produce shows on their platform which would align with the majority of their audience demographic's interests (12 -17 years old). Yet I still doubt that they have the right people at the helm with the foresight to recognize how best to utilize these assets.(Source: Siecledigital)For many Snap’s most recent quarterly beat was as shocking as it was impressive. I was certainly in that bracket. Following on from their disastrous Q3 results even the slightest of street expectation beats would’ve altered market sentiment to some degree let alone by the extent that Snap did. Yet although at face value impressive and potentially sentiment altering, the causes for their results were hardly groundbreaking. Snap produced a quarterly revenue result of $285.7 million, beating street expectation consensus of $252.8 million by over $30 million, resulting in their quarterly earnings being -13 cents per share instead of the -16 cents unanimously expected by analysts. Now there’s no doubt that a revenue result so far above expectations is a huge achievement for the company, especially when considering that the result was a 72.4% growth YOY, yet the actual reasoning for the dramatic growth in sales is far less miraculous. The DAU (daily active users) growth from the previous quarter of 9 million to 187 million, which also was a street expectation beat of the consensus 184.3 million, predominantly contributed to the revenue growth as ultimately greater user ship correlates to greater revenues for all of Snap's revenue streams on their platform, ad revenue, paid filters, etc.Yet a large extent of the growth also was a result of cyclical aspects. Retail stocks almost without failure always perform well during the holiday period, as you’d expect due to the fact that consumers spend far more on luxury consumables as Christmas gifts. Therefore companies whose primary revenue steam is to market such consumable products for retail companies are likely to also do better due to retail companies producing greater sales and therefore the more agreed social media companies who advertise their products receive in ad revenue.This has been the case previously with Snap as last year their revenue figure for Q4 2016 was $165.68 million, significant growth upon the Q3 result of $128.2 million, which then fell to $149.65 million the following quarter. The logical reasoning for this is that the January - March period is a hangover period for retail stocks and social media companies that advertise for retail companies consequentially. Thus the dramatic surge of revenue in Q4 2017, although impressive, can be characterized as better than expected growth in DAUs and a cyclical common occurrence for companies of Snap’s type and less of a definitive sign of the company turning itself around. As for the user growth, although it was a strong the beat of street expectations, it wasn’t that dramatic, especially when considering analysts were bound to be more conservative following on from the previous consistent quarterly overconfidence in the company.Furthermore as easy as it is to marvel at improved results by Snap it’s just as easy to forget that the only figures worth concentrating when determining Snap’s strength as an investment are that of its competitors. I still hold that Snap cannot become a long-term investment option until they learn how to keep up with overbearing Instagram (Facebook). As previously mentioned anything Snap can do Facebook, through Instagram, can do much better. This is evidently seen through the successful replication by Instagram of Snap’s features such as stories and picture editing tools.Yet the numbers seem to tell the story most clearly. Snap’s most recent ""impressive"" DAU figure looks anything but impressive when you consider that Instagram’s most recently disclosed DAU number was 500 million, which was especially overwhelming when you consider that figure was achieved in Q3 2017. Furthermore Instagram’s 2017 overall revenue figure was an astounding $5.38 billion compared to Snap’s $824.95 million for the year. This is particularly worrying for Snap as it not only shows that Instagram literally years ahead of them but also that they are much more efficient at transferring DAU activity into revenue. Based off these figures, if Snap’s user base was three times its current amount (561 million) and thus closer to Instagram’s 500 million they would still only theoretically be able produce $2.47 billion in annual revenue which would still be dwarfed by the $5.38 billion Instagram boasts.The reason for this frankly gargantuan divergence between the two companies' revenue capabilities is plain and simple and has not changed since I last commented on Snap's advertising structure. As already mentioned ad revenue makes up 93% of Snap’s overall revenue, yet the nature of Snap’s app of ""tap and disappear"" prevents them from being able to achieve significant ad revenues. This is because as soon as an ad pops up on their screens after a story they can instantaneously make it disappear by tapping the screen. Compare this to Instagram where ads are constantly littered over the discover page and through celebrity users’ endorsements. Although users can scroll past such ad exposure it's constantly there in every other picture they see. Companies are now even targeting users with followings as low as in the thousands to promote products for them.Exposure is everything in modern day marketing and Snap’s very nature undermines their ability to do just that - expose customers to ads. It doesn’t help either that Snap’s biggest celebrities, who also market endorsed products through their Snap accounts, are publicly slating the app and favoring Instagram. Again a restructure to the marketing approach would do wonders for their ad revenue potential. But in typical Snap style they make everything so much harder from themselves as even if they were to restructure their ad delivery approach they’ve now created a discovery platform, as of the new update, that users don’t want to use anymore.The story hasn’t changed for Snap. The issues stare them in the face and yet they fail to see them. They make changes and alterations to their model and strategy every quarter and yet every alteration fails to be the right one. By no means is this company without potential. Yet this is certainly a company with limitations and boundaries caused by their flawed as revenue structure, their inability to properly develop their platform and eliminate the overbearing instantaneous nature of it, and most importantly the lack leading foresight to steer them in the right direction. And unfortunately that’s what it comes down to. Spiegel had a great idea and has done very well for himself. But the company is making all the wrong decisions in terms of app redesign, product development, and revenue maximization. And eventually the finger has to be pointed somewhere.He promised a redesign to make the app easier to use. It's now harder to use. He told employees and investors not to worry about the threat Facebook poses, yet Facebook through Instagram has them outclassed, outgunning Snap and seemingly left them out of ideas. And as of recent he supposedly told employees he expects Snap to break even by the end of 2018, the company that has never posted anything positive and is severely struggling to keep costs (predominantly formed of tech costs) under control. Let's not forget also that he took $637 million in bonuses in 2017 while his own company lost $3.48 billion. Perhaps it's time to admit that Spiegel and his team are out of the big leagues. Once again I’ll state I’m convinced Snap has the potential to become profitable and one day maybe compete with Facebook, yet as before I doubted Spiegel’s ability to bring such potential into reality, I am now almost certain of his inability.A current share price of $16.50 is frankly widely overoptimistic. Investors seem to still believe that this stock is ""all the craze"" for millennials and the future for social media stocks. Yet at this stage it couldn’t be further from that. A negative FCF (free cash flow), a blatant susceptibility to PR pressure and a short ratio of all publicly traded shares of over 30% are all stark indicators of an obviously imperfectly priced equity. I expect Snap's Q1 2018 results to be worse than the previous quarter and likely a miss of expectations given the aforementioned variables and previous performance of the stock. Thus I hold my valuation of this stock at around $12 per share. And until indicators of correct and strong leadership decisions or a change of leadership are seen, I would advise investors to stay away from Snap at its current market price."
4150621,103963,2018-02-26T10:07:39-05:00,"Snap Inc. became too focused on their customer(s) and forgot about their consumer(s).
        Snapchat app will have minimal value to potential marketing customers if consumers app interactions continue to decline.
        Recent quarterly results provide an increase in stock price that is unwarranted.","Snap Inc.’s (SNAP) recent quarterly results seem to have provided investors with some optimism, as the price is up about 40% on the news. However, is this newfound optimism warranted? Investors seem to think so, but Snap’s users say otherwise.Snap Inc.'s business model is fairly simple and common in today's world. Similar to other social media and online platforms, they sell advertisement on their app and display them to their users. Initially, a large concern for Snap during their IPO was how the company was going to be able to monetize their platform successfully. They had a small base of advertisers, but far from enough to support the double-digit billion-dollar valuation they were receiving. In an attempt to increase revenues and please shareholders, Snap has turned their focus to redesigning their app to allow for further monetization. In this respect, they have been successful; the platform has become far more advertiser-friendly since the company has gone public. However, this is at a large cost to user’s satisfaction. In their attempt to satisfy customers, they've forgotten about their users.In one respect, Snap has been successful in improving their platform in order to reach a wider customer base. However, in doing so, they are turning away a lot their user base. With a declining user base, potential advertisers will think twice about putting their tight-budget marketing dollars to work on the platform. Advertisements on Snap have a limited track record, making it difficult to determine a company's return on their investment (NYSE:ROI). When there are for more proven advertising opportunities, Snap will find it difficult to compete. Recently the Snap app went through a large transformation that has many users very dissatisfied – for a few different reasons. First, for iOS users specifically, the app updated on its own without the user doing so in the Apple App Store. Usually in order to update an app, the user must agree to download the update in the Apple App Store, and the changes will then be made on the device. However, the most recent update to Snap’s app did it on its own, without authorization, and this has some users very concerned. That’s not the only bad news, Snap’s update took the internet by storm, and not in a good way. Users all over social media have been bashing the new update by posting, “RIP Snapchat 2010 – 2018”, or “The Snapchat update is a bigger mess than that one notebook I’ve been using for all my classes, starting on whatever page I open to and storing all my papers under the front cover,” or “This new Snapchat update is actually so terrible, how do I go back?” It’s safe to say, most users do not like the changes.These remarks may seem rather trivial, but this is how many millennials (Snap's target market) describe their dissatisfaction. As reported by Bloomberg, Snap Inc. lost $1.3 billion in market value from a single tweet. Kylie Jenner tweeted out to her followers that she no longer uses the app, causing a large selloff. She has about 24.5 million followers on Twitter, and many of them responded with very similar comments. This couldn’t come at a much worse time for Snapchat; owner of Instagram, Facebook (FB), is investing heavily in improving Instagram by adding features similar to that of Snapchat. Many millennials have begun using Instagram’s Snapchat-like features, and are actually really enjoying them. According to sources from Snapchat, Instagram, TechCrunch and Statsta, Buffer states that Instagram stories (Snapchat-like features in Instagram app) have 250 million daily active users, compared to 173 million on Snapchat. With the Facebook team and financial resources behind Instagram, Snapchat is in for a tough battle.On the bright side for Snap, social media of this kind is not a zero sum game. Users can, and will, have accounts with both Instagram and Snapchat. Snapchat does not have a distinct competitive advantage. It does have a large user base of millennials. This user base serves as a competitive advantage for both Snap AND Instagram, as Instagram has a large millennial user base as well. This user base provides both platforms with a differentiating factor from other social media platforms. According to BusinessofApps, 83.4% and 78.6% of people in the US between the ages of 12-7 and 18-24, respectively, use Snapchat monthly. Also, according to Omnicore, 71% of all Snapchat users are under 34 years old. Many customers of Snap are intrigued at the marketing opportunity as it provides them a large millennial population. Millennials are notably difficult to market to, but by using Snap as a place for ad campaigns, companies are able to reach millions of them each day. If Snap is able to accept constructive criticism from their users and adjust accordingly, they may be able to retain their user base. However, if they do not make changes to increase the apps user-friendliness, their competitive position could be in serious jeopardy.Qualitatively, the future of their potential competitive advantage is very questionable; they don’t seem to have a distinct plan of action and the changes they are making is turning away users. Their target market is severely limited to a small part of the population that is very hard to market towards, and who generally lacks the financial resources to act on advertisements, both of which could be a deterrent for Snap’s potential customers. The social media landscape can be very lucrative, but is extremely competitive. Snap does not appear to have the ability to defend, or further improve, their small competitive advantage from other online platforms, making it difficult for them to stand out from other successful social media platforms. Quantitatively, the company is even worse off. Revenue has seen strong growth, but they are losing money at an obscene rate; in the first quarter of 2017, they lost over $2.2 billion dollars. In the following six months, they lost just about another billion dollars. Over the past nine months, they have spent over $1.8 billion dollars in sales and administrative costs, with another $1.3 billion going to research and development (presumably to the app updates that are turning away users…). It is not uncommon for startup, and tech related, companies to run at a loss for a period of time, and still be successful – think Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA). Their current financial standing makes it difficult to value this company using any normal valuation metric; negative operating earnings, EBITDA and net income make it impossible to value on an earnings basis. Most surprising, and concerning, Snap is not even operating at a gross profit.An important note is that many investors have done very well investing in high-growth companies like Snap. However, as a strict value investor, these financial metrics are appalling.In general, it is very difficult to value a high-growth tech company with any degree of certainty. That being said, it seems the most reliable valuation tool available to investors in this instance is a Price-to-Sales ratio, or a relative valuation to other social media platforms. Snap is currently trading at a very lofty 25.8x sales multiple - far from a cheap investment. This ratio is in relation to an industry average of just 8.4x sales. If a high-growth tech company was firing on all cylinders, hitting all targets, and had a very successful platform, they might be able to command this multiple. For a company that has a declining and unsatisfied user base in a very competitive market, and a negative gross profit, investing at these valuation levels has a very small probability of success.If you have enjoyed this article, please scroll up to the top of the page and click the ""FOLLOW"" button next to my name.

4149405,94846,2018-02-22T10:49:55-05:00,"Snap’s ‘redesign’ faced intense backlash from its loyalists.Recently, Citi downgraded Snap to a ‘Sell’ rating.But Snap is determined to make a few more changes in the upcoming months.Given the current feedback on the redesign, any investment in Snap should be considered risky.","Snap Inc. (SNAP) kicked off the year with a good start, surging 40% at the beginning of the year. But its app overhaul soon caught up, bringing the stock down by more than 6%. The plunge is a result of the stock sale of $50 million worth of shares by Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegal's on February 14, Citi's downgrade news and the redesign backlash from Snap's loyal userbase.Wrapped under a code name ‘Cheetah,’ Snap unveiled its new redesign on November 29, 2017, via a 60-second video. Snap’s CEO Evan Spiegel explained that the latest version of Snap separated the ‘social’ from the ‘media’, and divided Stories from Discover. He wrote, “We are separating the social from the media, and taking an important step forward towards strengthening our relationships with our friends and our relationships with the media.”In its Q417 earnings report this year, the company had said that Publisher Stories on Discover grew by over 40% in comparison to the old design. In addition, Snap mentioned that the redesign made the application simpler and easier to use, especially for older users.In November last year, Snap Inc. introduced the changes to simplify its existing design for the users but instead made it harder for small advertisers to leave impressions. Though the overhaul was meant to be user and advertiser-friendly, for 1.2 million users it got ‘annoying’ and looked cluttered. TechCrunch reported that Snap’s redesign in the beta countries (U.K, Canada, and Australia) faced severe criticism from the users.Snap angered loyalists (which include millennials and celebrities) took to change.org to ask for the removal of the new Snapchat update. The petition so far has more than one million signatories. The petition reads “Many users have found that it has not made the app easier to use but has, in fact, made many features more difficult.”Snap made an official response to the petition and maintained its stance on the redesign. But also added that it will introduce “tabs in Friends and Discover, which will make it easier to find the Stories” that users want when they want them. Simply put, users will be able to sort things like Stories, Group Chats, and Subscriptions and customize their Snapchat experience.The company has time and again made it clear that it will continue to make adjustments in its products over the next few quarters. But the worrying part is that so far, the changes have not been accepted by many of its users.Snap’s redesign model came a few months after its biggest rival, Facebook (FB) made similar changes. Following the new algorithm shift, Facebook shares tumbled 4% since many investors felt that the change could bring bad news impacting publisher’s traffic. The changes to its news feed also led to a total of approximately 50 million fewer hours spent on Facebook every day.Microblogging platform, Twitter (TWTR) is reportedly working on a video sharing too which may have Snap like features. In an interview with Recode, Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has acknowledged that Twitter’s current experience as ‘confusing’ and praised Snap for being ‘very modern’. In an attempt to make Twitter more appealing to users, Twitter may be following the route of Facebook and Snap. Bloomberg reported that according to the people close to the matter Twitter already has a working demo of the camera-centered product. Following the report, Snap shares had tumbled more than 5%, touching $13.72.Bottom LineThe app redesign by social media platforms have been a departure from what the companies had promised to its users and for Snap, it has surely backfired.Citi recently downgraded Snap’s stock to ‘sell’ with $14 price target. Citi’s Mark May said, “While the recent redesign of its flagship app could produce positive long-term benefits, the significant jump in negative app reviews since the redesign was pushed out a few weeks could result in a decline in users and user engagement, which could negatively impact financial results.” Snap’s shares fell more than 7% following the downgrade.Citi added to its report a chart that showed the one-star rating of 28% in November 2017 jumped to 86% in February 2018, owed largely to the dissatisfaction of the users.In the short run, Snap faces a bumpy ride as the company is deeply scrutinized by its users. In the long run, it faces stiff competition from companies like Facebook and Twitter, as the two also switch gears and divide personal and advertised content.In the past, Snap’s CEO Evan Spiegel has acknowledged that there was a ‘strong likelihood’ that the redesign would be “disruptive to our business in the short term”. “We don’t yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application. We’re willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business,” he had said at the time of Q317 earnings report.But while the company is willing to risk in for long-term benefits, investors need to remain very cautious.With more than a million users (and still counting), the company remains adamant to introduce additional changes and maintains that “the community will enjoy it once they settle in.” But for that to happen users need to remain engaged!"
4144195,50452,2018-02-07T15:12:59-05:00,"Snap reported an earnings beat after the bell on Tuesday, and shares went nuts in the after hours, and pre-market sessions.Despite growing its user base, and revenues, the company still hasn't been able to notably slow its cash burn.This is the bottom line problem with Snap, and it will need to make significant progress before its cash reserves run out.","After a lot of disappointment over the past year, Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) struck a chord with the Street when it closed out its fiscal year 2017 on Tuesday afternoon. With impressive growth on its top line and user metrics, shares have drastically risen after hours. Despite these positive developments, Snap's cash burn has not been even close to remedied, which is the company's largest threat.Shareholders are probably quite happy right now; the Street liked what it saw from Snap's Q4 earnings report Tuesday afternoon. Shares jumped an eye popping 27% in after hours trading, and are mostly holding the momentum with shares up 22% pre-market at the time of this article. What has the market so optimistic?There has been some growth in key metrics for the social media rival to Instagram.Daily active users grew in every region, including North America where rival Facebook (NYSE: FB) (who owns Instagram) saw a decline in DAU in its most recent quarter. Growth is incremental, but has been consistent thus far.The largest improvement Snap made this quarter was in its revenues. Revenues per user made a big jump in every region. Annual revenue is up 104% from last year, and advertising revenues are up 74% year over year. Snap has switched over to an automated system to programmatically sell ads to its advertiser customer base. Snap has started to scale more effectively as well. It saw a huge jump in impression volume so advertising revenues jumped 38% for the quarter while prices fell 25% making Snap more competitive. Finally, Snap was able expand its margins by spreading its costs over the growth it saw. The growth in users, revenue per user, and scaling of its advertising pushed margins up to 36% from 21% last quarter, and only 8% a year ago.Growth is never a bad story; it is the first step for a company seeking profitability. While the key will be for Snap to maintain and build on this momentum, not everything is positive from this quarter.Snap continues to spend. While one could look at it as an investment for growth, the company has not been able to grow without costs across the board increasing with it.Snap has been rapidly expanding its staff, hiring approximately 100 new employees per month. At about 2,400 employees, CEO Evan Spiegel is now planning to ""moderate"" the growth of Snap's staff, which may be a nice way of foreshadowing lay offs. In a vacuum, its reasonable to ascertain that a company might need to spend money to grow. However....Snap's largest issue, is its cash burn. Whether you look at EBITDA, or cash flows, it remains a huge problem. I cannot turn bullish on Snap until this is well on its way to being solved.Snap saw a drastic increase in global users year over year (158M to 187M users), and generated a 104% increase in revenue. Despite this, Snap still lost more money, and burned more cash in this quarter, than it did in Q4 last year.The ultimate challenge for Snap, is that it needs to either outgrow its cash burn - which hasn't happened despite the Street going nuts over this quarter. Or, it needs to reduce its ""input"" and cut costs - but can it grow by doing that?It is too early to know the answer, but Snap doesn't have forever to figure things out. Snap currently has about $2B in cash and equivalents available. In 2017, Snap burned through just over $819M in cash. If Snap fails to substantially improve its cash flow generation, the company will need to raise funds (which could come in the form of issuing stock, diluting shareholder value).Growth is always good, but a company ultimately needs to remain solvent, and eventually turn a profit. Snap's growth has not slowed down its cash burn from a year ago. Until Snap proves that it can monetize its business to an appropriate level that evens out its cash burn, I would use caution when dabbling in shares. With $2B left in cash, Snap's clock is ticking."
4139874,104087,2018-01-24T16:27:45-05:00,"With daily active user growth slowing, average revenue per user must increase in order for Snapchat to be profitable.Snapchat is in a similar position to Facebook after its own IPO, when average revenue per user growth was sluggish.Failure to monetize its user base is dangerous, as it could easily fall to competitors.","There has been growing discontent with Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) after the company revealed in its 2017 Q3 earnings report back in November that growth in its user base was losing steam. The disappointing news included losses that tripled year over year, and only 4.5 million new daily active users (DAU), bringing its total user base to only 178 million DAU (while Instagram boasts over 300 million). CEO Evan Spiegel's response to the earnings report admitted these shortcomings; especially with the $40 million write-down from unsold inventory on its Spectacles, and indicating the need to improve on its advertising, messaging system, and international expansion, Snapchat finds itself in the middle of a major revamp less than a year removed from its IPO.The situation is similar to Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) first year post-IPO. Its own share price struggled amidst slowing user growth and an average revenue per user (ARPU, defined as total revenue divided by monthly active users) that was failing to pick up; but keying in on that ARPU figure is how Facebook managed to drive their share price forward. Using this, I will try and demonstrate how ARPU will make or break Snapchat as well, and the efforts it is currently undertaking to improve its situation.With the case of Facebook, ARPU was a major proponent of driving its share price from the mid $20s range post IPO in 2012 to $78 by the time they release their Q4 earnings of 2014. I've provided the quarterly data below:Source: Facebook Quarterly ReportsThe important thing to notice is that while both year over year (YOY) and quarter over quarter (Q/Q) growth for DAU had been settling, the ARPU had steadily increased along with Facebook's share price. In fact, the correlation between the two is very strong; the graph below gives us a correlation value of 0.9649, with over 93% of the variation explained.Stock prices were taken as the closing price the day Facebook's earnings were revealed to investors. As the data shows, investors are very respondent to the ARPU figure, even if the growth of users begins to slow; even if the profitability is not there yet, ultimately revenue must increase to get into the black.And that is exactly what Facebook did, as quarterly revenue almost tripled between Q3 2012 and Q3 2014 by skillfully targeting ads based on the enormous amount of user information they had. A big part of this was Facebook's successful algorithm that made advertiser's expenditures effective. A 2014 article describing Facebook's rising success notes how it was able to garner the business of big name companies like Ford, McDonald's, Visa, Nike, and many more by providing them with a great return on investment. For example, Starbucks saw a 38% lift from users who saw their ad appear in their news feed, Google Chrome was able to generate 34,000 downloads a week from its Facebook extensions, EA's Battlefield 3 saw a 440% return on its investment in sales, and Groupon used Facebook exclusively to drive email signups and distribute daily deals. The list goes on, but it shows how Facebook was able to give companies a variety of ways to capitalize on their advertising expenditures. Adding to the fact that these were some of the biggest companies out there, it is no wonder that Facebook would be able to significantly grow its revenue by attracting future customers.Facebook also offered companies a array of possibilities to attract potential customers. In addition to sidebar ads and sponsored stories, companies could create pages for their own content, and promote certain post to a select user base of their choosing.Source: Business Management DegreeBefore I look at its ARPU struggles, I wanted to first compare Facebook and Snapchat's DAU growth at the time they both had their IPOs:Source: Snapchat Quarterly ReportsIn the case of Facebook, we can see that thought the YOY DAU growth slowly tapered off in the following quarters, it still provided robust growth that eventually reached almost 900 million users by the end of 2014. But as for Snapchat, there are some red flags; Facebook had over four times the amount of users Snapchat did in the third quarter following their respective IPOs, and Snapchat's DAU growth was declining at a faster rate as well. Snapchat most likely will not reach the immense user base which Facebook has -- but it does not need to reach those levels in order to become a profitable company. In fact, some research analysts like Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group question if the focus on DAU is the right one, saying that ""the last time I checked, this isn't a subscription business...they've done really well retaining their users."" The famous valuation guru and NYU professor Aswath Damodaran even notes that Snapchat could eventually become a serious contender to Facebook despite a smaller user base, if it can effectively monetize its users (best case scenario of $25 billion in revenue by 2027). And Snapchat shows they have a plan to keep growth steady; in addition to redesigns on the app for better ease of use, Snap is also committed towards rebuilding the Android app, of which there have been many issues. This will be very important for international growth, as the markets there will be more Android heavy than the U.S., and could offer significant lines for expansion. Other solutions include integrating algorithmically personalized Stories feed, in addition to adding new content and augmented reality, which should help engagement on the platform with its current users.So while it's no guarantee that Snapchat can continue to push growth, at the very least they have demonstrated a plan for how they will do so, one that I have at least some confidence in.How Snapchat will monetize is a bit more unclear. Back in September, Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley revealed gloomy reports that many companies were unwilling to experiment with Snapchat's ad products when they could find similar methods to reaching the younger generation through the Facebook-owned Instagram. Not only does Facebook have a similar product with things like Instagram stories, but they also have a better ad product that allows companies to target a specific group of users, and gives these companies greater comfort when choosing an advertising platform. Snapchat also has issues scaling its business, as some of its products like ""lenses"" and ""filters"" for promoting events and products are not very valuable for creating brand awareness. Adding the intense competition from Instagram, whose user base has skyrocketed and whose users of Instagram stories outnumber Snapchat's daily active users, and Snapchat is looking at a very unstable advertising base.Source: RecodeBack in the Q3 2017 earnings report, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak noted the ""growing challenges facing SNAP's monetization potential and user opportunity"" as well as the ""structural hurdles to SNAP's core ad unit format... [and] the pending app redesign creates further engagement/execution risk."" He was referring to Spiegel's announcement that they would redesign the app and the social media feed, with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook as inspirations; he believes it will make the app easier to use to increase engagement, and open up ways to monetize the new feed. My guess is that Snapchat will start using a similar advertising platform to Facebook in order to give companies a greater variety of advertising strategies. It also makes sense that Snapchat will continue revenue sharing with partners (which accounted for 9% of revenue in fiscal 2016) in order to build trust with companies in using Snap's advertising platform.Source: Facebook and Snapchat Quarterly ReportsIf we look at Snapchat's ARPU (presented above), there is definitely still time for Snap to turn it around. After all, Facebook's own ARPU didn't reach $2 until almost 2 years after its IPO. I do like the direction of Snapchat, and I like that they're taking a chance with this new social media feed because they do need to find long term sustainability regarding their revenue streams; but this is not the only thing they need. What Snapchat needs to consider is what it wants to be in 10 years; are they going to be a mainstream form of communication with one's close friends and family? Do they want to look into live video and streaming services? Or do they want to go in a totally different direction? Regarding DAU, I would like to see that their user growth is not completely crashing; if they can match the 16% YOY growth from their 3rd quarter earnings report, that would imply an increase of 6 million user to 183 million DAU, which would indicate that growth is still fairly robust (and such growth is definitely within reach).But more importantly, with ARPU I would like to start seeing some gains, especially given the fact that Q4 is usually the highest earnings quarter (because of seasonality). Anything over $1.40 would be quite impressive to me (and would beat Facebook's ARPU one year into its own IPO), but I'm expecting something more between $1.25-$1.30. That figure would still be too hard to tell if Snapchat is going in the right direction, especially since we don't know how long the changes to the app will take before it finally revs up revenue and user engagement (which most likely will be revealed in Q1 2018). And anything less than that number would be a red alarm that they are starting to lose control of its customer base.Hopefully, they also provide us with some long term information as to what Snapchat may eventually become - this will help give us a greater idea on the upside of ARPU growth. Spiegel was more open and informational than previous earnings calls, and it seemed to me that he was more willing to connect with shareholders than in the past to help them understand the situation. Perhaps this time around, he will provide us with more information regarding the changes that Snapchat has undergone, and give shareholders a sense of direction.Snapchat still has major risk and major potential, and for me an investment in Snapchat is ultimately still an investment in Evan Spiegel and his vision, for good or for worse."

Citigroup analysts noted:Citi also presented the following chart, along with a $14 price target:I agree with Citigroup's stance that the stock has run up too much, too early.Snap has been on my watch list for some time, as I try to gain confidence on the company's future, which faces several headwinds.I indicated in Does Snapchat Stand A Chance Against Instagram? that:A Recode article published in September said, ""Instagram is rapidly eating away at Snapchat’s share of new users,"" and included the following eye-opening graph:In the last earnings release, Snap noted that Daily Active Users (""DAU"") increased 8.9 million or 5% sequentially to 187 million, representing the highest net adds since 3Q16. DAUs increased 28.8 million or 18% year-over-year:As the above graph illustrates, the net adds were uniform across the world, but I am not impressed by the year-over-year growth rate. Will Snap ever catch up to Instagram? This remains to be seen.What instead impressed investors in the last earnings release was the jump in quarterly average revenue per user (""ARPU""):This metric, too, improved uniformly across the world, which is positive, but is it repeatable? Against a cash-rich company like Facebook's (FB) Instagram, it's not clear to me at the time that Snap can continue to increase its ARPU, and continue to expand its gross margin:The following data from Nasdaq illustrates institutional ownership in Snap Inc. (SNAP) as of December 31, 2017, the most recent date for which the ownership data is available:Readers should note the following observations:In summary, institutional ownership in Snap remains low and volatile.Snap registered a stellar quarter, in which the company squeezed out more gross profit per user, primarily driven by a jump in ARPU across the world. Instagram, however, is already multiple times larger and can leverage Facebook's existing relationships with advertisers, whereas Snap will have to grow against an advertising behemoth that Facebook is.I continue to stay away from SNAP, and agree with Citigroup's rating.

4146965,76115,2018-02-15T08:30:00-05:00,"Snap beat fourth quarter expectations on beaten down estimates.
        What wasn't factored in was the reaction to the updated app which only began rolling out in full force in the current quarter.
        With a large uproar just now occurring, it could mean the fourth quarter was only a flash in the pan.","Snap's (SNAP) earnings last week amounted to beating beaten down estimates for revenue and user growth. The headline said 'beat' but the bottom line said large cash burn still. But, what's more interesting is the app update which was not rolled out in the fourth quarter, meaning it had not yet affected user growth or user sentiment. And, besides revenue, Snap only has daily active users as a earnings moving metric.The redesign talked about on the company's third quarter conference call was something I called a huge risk because this newly IPO'd company had already found itself in the midst of a turnaround. But initial reactions from advertisers and firms were positive as they believed the update would increase engagement. However, that sentiment was built solely on the expectation it had to do just that.What if that doesn't happen? Well, there's a thought - and one you must seriously consider as an investor looking at Snap.Right now, Snap users are in full outrage and app store reviews of the app have taken a real beating. In the Apple (AAPL) App Store the rating is now below 2 stars (out of 5) and 1 star reviews are a huge majority - close to if not greater than 80%.Before you think I am bias and unwilling to adjust my stance, in my podcast for subscribers two weeks ago I discussed this exact phenomenon. I gave a pass regarding these reviews because the same thing happened when Facebook (FB) separated Messenger from the main Facebook app - there was outrage and negative reviews. But, there is a difference between the two scenarios; Facebook separated already existing functionality into a separate app while Snapchat is redesigning and changing the UI (user interface) of the main app completely. Also the outrage for Facebook was around granting permissions to Messenger more so than moving the app. And, as I can attest, this generation really doesn't think much about granting permissions as long as we get what we're expecting the app to do - in a world of ""accept, accept, accept"" for terms of service agreements, it's not a stretch to understand this.Even still, I'm willing to look past Snap's app reviews because reviews don't seem to matter much once every settles in to the change - which, in Facebook's case, they did.But it's not just app store reviews. Anecdotally, my friends - many of them using Snapchat - have gone out of their way to complain about the change and said they're ready to give it up since it's no longer user friendly.Not user friendly? Wasn't the whole idea of the redesign to be more user friendly so those who are older and in more advanced generations get on and advance the daily active user metric as well as broaden Snap's demographic?But anecdotes are even lower than app store reviews in my opinion so, again, I hold little weight to this as well. My friends will get over it.Right...?I'm starting to wonder about this. As it turns out 40M users had the update as of a few weeks ago, with the remaining 147M users getting it before the end of this quarter. It's clear that's on track as the noise has gotten louder. Which brings me to my main point: One million people have signed a petition requesting Snap to roll back the update.This gets my attention as petitions are no small matter when they reach numbers in the millions. This could continue higher as more users receive the update.Now, as I said above, Facebook made a change to separate an app and got caught up in privacy concerns among users. Snap, however, is committing the software design cardinal sin - breaking the UX (user experience). People get over privacy concerns and nuances they don't prefer as long as the app fulfills their needs and addiction and are thus willing to come to terms. Snap is not dealing with simple privacy issues and it's clear users aren't backing down.What opened my eyes to the issue better and brought about a thought beyond the obvious was these statements within the petition:These features aren't useless to Snap and their desire for advertisers, but do in fact defeat the original purpose - to make users happy. Snap has reached the intersection of happy users versus happy advertisers now. These changes are meant to make advertisers more prominent and to create a magazine style showcase where ads are a prominent segment of the app. But, upsetting users is not how you maintain advertisers - if less people are looking then what are advertisers getting a return on?Snap, you've literally made the generation which was born with a smartphone in their hand believe your updated app is difficult to use - a generation where technology comes easy to them, but somehow this is better for older users?As a potential investment, I would be OK with the changes if they at least kept the UI/UX intact and didn't radically change what made Snapchat a favorite among young people. Now not only is the app harder to use causing young peoples' enthusiasm to drop, but somehow you expect the older demographic to figure it out? It seems Snap has done nothing to further its own goals but in fact go in the opposite direction.My final point is about the timing of this. Fourth quarter earnings did not take this backlash into account as the roll out began occurring in full force in the current quarter. So while user metrics and revenue grew above estimates, what does it mean now that the rubber is meeting the road? The praise by longs seems a bit ahead of itself because true results are still yet to be seen. The current quarter will be a true tell of how the Snap turnaround is playing out. I'm willing to move to a hold if Snap can show a continuation in its user growth at the same pace and that much of this outrage, petitioning, and gnashing of teeth by its users - its core users - are the minority. Right now, though, it appears this resentment is only gaining momentum. Snap is not out of the woods yet and with more executive leadership leaving what seems to be every other week, it makes me wonder if the gnashing of teeth is limited to the users.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Snap, along with other tech and social media companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."

While the bulk of the bearish analysis appears to have been fully baked into the price, the growing TAM (total addressable market) of the digital marketing industry coupled with better execution by management could see the stock take a 180 degrees turn in 2018. Therefore, could its current valuation offer minimal downside versus unlimited upside heading into the full depth of the year?Budget rotation into digital ads favors Snap. The ROI brands are generating from digital ads has seen the valuation of ad giants like Facebook (FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) skyrocket in recent quarters. Emarketer has pegged the worldwide digital ad spend at $228.44billion, a jump of 19% y/y. The US alone will be responsible for $93.75billion with Google and Facebook taking up a huge share of the gains.This means the demand side tailwinds will barely touch Snap's back due to opposing competitive headwinds which are set to alter Snap's momentum.Much has been said about Snap's poor competitive position in a lineup that includes rivals like Google & Facebook.However, as much as bulls want Snap to level and reinvent the digital ad landscape, we need to realize that this uphill task will come at a huge cost.Already, Snap ads have been able to stand out from native ads produced by competitors by virtue of their huge engagement and creative appeal. All that is required to complete the equation is an intelligent ad engine which will help advertisers target users in cost-effective ways.To achieve this, management needs a two-pronged approach: cost-management and innovativeness.On the cost-management side, investors should watch out for moves that will see management building a competitive ad engine with ad rates (CPM, CPC) comparable to those of Google and Facebook.The move to shift media buying to the programmatic side means less human involvement as the programmatic system becomes automated and scalable.Management tried to explain the knock-on effect of this move in the last earnings report:This means that, while 80% of ad impression is being delivered automatically, the ad engine has become cheaper leading to more competitive ad rates i.e. CPM. The only downside is that since revenue = price x volume, while the steady DAU (volume) growth continues to help revenue forecasts, the cheaper/more competitive CPM rate (price) is diluting revenue forecast.While this is going to negatively affect valuation on the short term, management's ability to communicate and navigate around the transition will ensure investors reap the reward of holding on to the cash flows that can be generated in future.Going forward, the cheaper Snap's valuation becomes, the easier it is to justify management's cost-cutting measures towards generating sustainable cash flow.However, we need to see a strong indication that management is indeed keen on having a firmer grip on operational efficiency.Gross and operating margin haven't shown significant improvement over the past year. This can be overlooked if margins are being sacrificed for market share gains. However, market demand hasn't been sufficient to give confidence that this ship will get to its destination.The summary of Snap's app redesign effort towards driving better engagement and user retention bodes well for the future of Snap. The Street, on the other hand, isn't confident in the redesign effort. This drove further price cut into the single-digit territory.Redesigning the entire platform could potentially lead to the creation of a new product whose valuation will require inputs different from the ones analysts are plugging into their excel sheets.Management envisaged skepticism towards the redesign effort when it announced the redesign:The continuous plunge in valuation only corroborates what was initially feared; uncertainty about the product that will emerge from the redesign. Will it be the same old Snap we all know or will the new product be Instagram 2.0?Snap's valuation continues to tank. Analysts keep cutting their price target due to a dearth of near and long-term catalyst to uphold the stock's valuation.Its current valuation relative to more profitable competitors suggests the possibility that the stock might plunge further into the single digit territory if it continues to lose market share. As the chart above indicates, investors are paying more per share for every dollar in revenue to own Snap compared to bigger competitors with more sustainable growth narratives.Given that Snap isn't profitable, it will be hard to make a case for Snap using profitability ratios like EV/EBITDA or EV/FCF.Due to the viral nature of the skepticism that has filled the air as far as Snap's valuation is concerned, there is a big chance the bearish trend will continue sending Snap into the single digit valuation territory.While the overall market bodes well for the future of programmatic marketing, Snap's Phoenix might take longer to rise from the ashes due to the bearish plague of negativity clouding management's innovative forays.I believe we will have a final dip which will present a cheaper buying option for investors."
4137966,24767,2018-01-17T07:28:49-05:00,"80% of Snap Ad impressions are delivered programmatically, up from 0%, one year ago.
        The shift in mix from direct sales to auction negatively affects pricing with a 60% fall in the cost paid per impression during the year.
        Impressions grew 60% quarter-over-quarter and 400% year-over-year.
        The strength of Q4'16 seasonality was hidden by the Olympics’ positive impact on last year’s 3rd quarter.
        Abating mix effects and hidden seasonality strength should lead to a significant beat in Q4'17 revenue.","During the 3rd quarter conference call in November, Snap, Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) CEA Evan Spiegel reflected back on his three 2017 priorities: performance, quality and automation. While performance and quality of the Snapchat application remain important going forward, the automation of ad sales priority drove the key changes in Snap’s primary business last year. Understanding the nuances of this ad automation transition is necessary to forecast total revenue in coming quarters. Before looking at the ad automation transition directly it is useful to recall that growth in revenue and average revenue per user are mainly a function of sales and demand. Because ad load remains low, revenues are not dependent on user growth in the short term. Snap makes the following definitions:Source: Q3'17 Earnings SlidesAdditionally, Snap has three basic ad types: Snap Ads, Filters, and Lenses. The automation of ad sales through a self-serve auction affects the Snap Ads segment. Snap Ads are “the original vertical video ad” and can lead to a web view, app installation or long form video from the advertiser. Analysts estimate that Snap Ads represent about two-thirds of the revenues.Nuances in Transition to AuctionA year ago Snap Ads were sold directly to advertisers through a reserved inventory at rate card prices. Now, over 80% of the overall Snap Ads business comes from auction volume. Spiegel characterized the transition to the auction as follows:As well as the 60% fall in the cost paid per impression during the year, the automation transition is driving a significant rise in the number of Snap Ad impressions sold. Impressions grew 60% quarter-over-quarter and 400% year-over-year. Interestingly, the rise in ad impressions has not impacted user engagement; time spent, frequency of use, and Snap creation are all increasing.According to Snap, the number of advertisers participating in the auctions grew by about five times over the 3rd quarter. The rise of contested auctions positively affects pricing and partially offsets the general trend toward lower prices associated with the transition to auction from direct sales. This past quarter Snap saw auctions with multiple bidders having 40% higher prices than uncontested auctions.The transition to the auction platform allows more advertisers to more easily and more effectively reach Snap’s users. The tools allow advertisers to reach specific business goals such as app installs. And the self-serve nature enables testing and learning at a lower entry price point versus the direct sales system.Forecasting 4th Quarter RevenuesAt writing, Wall Street consensus for Snap’s 4th quarter revenues has fallen to $252 million. After consecutive quarters of revenues misses, including the $25 million shortfall last quarter, expectations are obviously tempered. However, the following reasons point toward a surprise beat this quarter:Source: Q3'17 Earnings SlidesTakeawayIn line with recent quarters’ growth, analysts are calling for a 20% rise in 4th quarter revenues. However, while growth has moderated in recent quarters, the decline can be explained by the nuances of the ad sales automation we discussed above. The combination of these effects abating and somewhat hidden seasonality strength should lead to a significant beat in revenue; my forecast is for $265 million."
4144647,92586,2018-02-08T13:43:29-05:00,"Is SNAP likely to correct back into the teens after finally crossing $20/share again in a dramatic fashion?A few key op metrics have improved drastically since last quarter, but the company continues to be highly unprofitable and cash-consuming.Because shares shot through the roof as fast as they did, trying to capitalize on potential upside now may prove to be a bit too late.","How about a 48% gain in one single day?It must have felt good to hold Snap Inc. (SNAP) shares this Wednesday, following the company's all-round beat released on Tuesday after the closing bell. Even though the stock has done little else than reset back to late May 2017 levels, Snap bulls must be feeling vindicated to some extent.But 4Q17 earnings is already water under the bridge. With the unusual one-day share price move yesterday, I ask myself if the stock's reaction is justified, or whether the price is more likely to correct back into the teens after finally crossing $20/share again in a dramatic fashion.Credit: TechCrunchTo be honest, I have been a Snap skeptic for quite a bit. Yet, this time, I believe I have reasons to be less downbeat on the company.A quick glance at Snap's most recent results suggests that a few key metrics have improved drastically since the last time I set eyes on the company's financials, back in November. But before I talk numbers, let me bring the reader up to speed on my Snap Inc. thesis.Back in March of last year, I established the key criteria that had to be met, in my view, for the social media company to justify a stock price of about $20/share (the price that the stock was trading at back then and, curiously, today as well). The criteria included:Let's see how Snap has performed relative to my minimum requirements.On DAU, sequential growth of 5% this quarter was finally achieved for the first time since 1Q17, following a pitiful third quarter. Strength was observed across all major geographic segments (see graph below). Certainly, one quarter does not make a trend. But this important usage metric has finally shown signs of having a pulse, possibly pointing to improved user experience that is crucial for the long-term viability of the platform, in my view.Source: Company's slidesAlso worth celebrating was ARPU of $1.53 that was up an encouraging 31% sequentially after quarter-on-quarter growth in user monetization had gotten stuck in the low-to-mid teens in recent quarters. Although I foresee ARPU climbing over time, I would be irresponsible to assume that this aggressive level of growth will be the new normal going forward. If the increase persisted at the current YOY pace of 46%, however, my bar of $3.00 in average per-user revenue by 2020 would be easily cleared by nearly a dollar.The good news stops mostly there, however. After plateauing in 3Q17, opex shot back up, this time by 17% sequentially ($261 million compared to $223 million) vs. last quarter's -3% ($223 million compared to $229 million). Cost of revenues also continued to grow sequentially at the same pace, suggesting that profitability may still be a distant hope for the Venice, California-based company.Cash flow improved sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. But, in absolute terms, little can be celebrated about an FCF outflow of nearly $200 million ($197 million, to be precise) for a company that generated only $286 million in revenues in the quarter.Following nearly 50% of appreciation in one day, one must wonder if SNAP is most likely to head to the moon or adjust back down to levels that better reflect the company's still weak earnings and cash flow generating abilities. This question is a tough one to answer with certainty, since short-term behavior tends to be all but unpredictable. But I have a few thoughts that may help readers decide what steps to take next.First, about half of this Wednesday's rush was fueled by upbeat sell-side reports that hit the wires in the morning. The stock was up ""only"" 27% in after-hours trading on Tuesday, with a lot more push coming in pre-trading Wednesday after analysts had weighed in on the results. Even if sell siders might not be notoriously known for accurately predicting results and stock movements consistently, they are usually good at forming opinions and helping to set the mood for a given stock. Therefore, there is a chance that positive sentiment and momentum could return and support shares near current levels.Second, and serving more as a counter-argument, short interest reached all-time high levels as 2017 came to a close. So it is plausible that a good chunk of Wednesday's buying activity might have been fueled by short covering. Once the flash fire is put out, if it hasn't already, bullish momentum could subside and give way to some profit taking.SNAP Short Interest data by YChartsBut looking further down the road, I still support my views that an investment in Snap continues to be highly speculative. To be fair, the results of 4Q17 alone might have been enough to make me sit down and reconsider my cautious stance on the stock.After all, as I mentioned above, Snap has shown the first signs that it might be able deliver on the key criteria that would turn me more bullish on the name: consistent 5% sequential DAU growth, ARPU of $3.00 and op margins of 30% by 2020 (the latter still looking largely unattainable for now). But because shares shot through the roof as fast as they did, trying to capitalize on potential upside now may prove to be a bit too late.As a result, I remain on the sidelines. Short-term traders may find an opportunity to make a quick buck on the up- or downswings, as I believe volatility will likely pick up. But as a long-term investor, I continue to find an investment in SNAP too risky for my taste."
4134500,82146,2017-12-29T18:39:58-05:00,"Snap is still not a buy.However, I'm becoming more intrigued by the company as time goes on because of some of its goals and content deals.One such deal is the one with NBCUniversal.Price action is still not attractive to me, however.Another negative: CNN is not happy with its Snap experiment.","You've got to hand it to Snap (SNAP) management. The company is not intent on letting the bearish sentiment get the best of it. Agree or not, Snapchat is a legitimate platform...for something. What that something is, no one is exactly sure of yet. Snap will continue to experiment with different features and content, and one recent deal has me focusing on the stock yet again (but I'm not ready to buy yet, as I will explain).Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal division has hooked up with Snap to create content for the site. As The Hollywood Reporter explained in October, NBCUniversal will help Snap expand its programming with quality storytelling - at least, quality storytelling as far as a digital platform is concerned (that isn't a critical knock; rather, it is a note on the fact that presumably this isn't the kind of stuff NBC itself shows). Although the article and the comments from various players connected to this deal make it sound like one big press release whose substance is questionable, I have to admit I'm a bit taken by the effort (maybe foolishly so, who knows). Maggie Suniewick, head of NBCUniversal Digital Enterprises, mentioned that she felt there was value to using NBC's expertise in storytelling to find new mythologies that are customized toward the Snap experience...more value than simply showing short segments from already-existing NBC shows. I get that, frankly, and I think it's a useful attitude to have.In addition, two heavyweight brands in the indie scene, Mark Duplass and Jay Duplass, will be on board to create content. That should at the very least imply a welcome minimal level of quality to the enterprise. What I get from this deal as described in the article is that Snap and NBC's digital cousin intend on incubating as many ideas as possible and then throwing as many filmed proofs-of-concept to the wall to see which ones contain some proverbial adhesiveness. For probably not as much money as Netflix (NFLX) typically spends (an understatement, one assumes) Snap will be able to create and then adjust a portfolio of content that can hopefully attract viewers, advertising dollars and potential subscription business models. NBC, however, isn't afraid of throwing money at Snap - as the article reminds us, the company invested half-a-billion bucks in the social network's initial offer to the public.But there's a fly buzzing around in the ointment. Time Warner's (TWX) CNN did not find its content-partnership experience with Snap compelling. As this SA news piece reports, the value-add just wasn't there. One might criticize CNN execs for losing patience so quickly -then again, perhaps they had data too dour to ignore. This apparent failure should not, however, detract from the burgeoning new thesis for Snap - that of a content-platform-in-the-making that will eventually scale. If the company can continue to make strides in this area, then it becomes obvious what the endgame is all about -- catch the consolidation wave and sell out to something bigger. Maybe Comcast, maybe private equity. An established media conglomerate would be better, but money from PE firms is just as valid. This is why it's so hard to buy the stock. One gets the impression that a few content partnerships will lead to an elevated stock price and a quick sale. That would be a great trade if it happens, but there's an opposite side that argues the stock could be in for years of sideways trading. As an example, I can think of DreamWorks Animation during its time as a separate company - CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg never could seem to find a model for that studio that would allow it to scale its movie output to a degree of growth that would outpace the overhead costs. Katzenberg experimented with different revenue streams as well (including the successful AwesomenessTV multichannel network) before finally selling out to Comcast at a price I suspect was only good enough given all the years he spent trying to get out of the Shrek shadow. Before I get too negative, however, let me again consider the content Snap wants to create. There will be more partnerships, more tests of advertising models that I assume will make use of buzzwords like ""integrated"" and ""viral"" and ""contextual marketing."" There will be talk of competition with Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) YouTube and Facebook's (FB) video initiatives. Hopefully Snap will become more aggressive in the new media world where filmed entertainment is concerned. Right now, the company will need new ideas (I don't mean just content ideas) to forge a fresh path of growth. As a stock, it's hard to make a case for a buy thesis. As David Butler described in an article from November, the company is having problems with expanding its user base and generating profits. Also, his article points out that the disparity between top-line growth and income potential is disconcerting. That essentially summarizes the fundamental issue with Snap.The following chart summarizes the price-action issue:Management, in my mind, probably wants out of this situation as soon as possible. Maybe a media entity will come along that will offer a slight premium and consider taking Snap off the market at what could be considered a value. The other side is that the company still has a market cap of $17 billion, and even that might seem like too much money for a model that hasn't been optimized for the public markets (to say the absolute least). The company's ambition should be to eventually move away from its status as a social media stock and to ultimately get closer to being a media entity that wants to create franchise content that can play on other platforms as well as its own. While I will watch the NBC/Snap deal, it doesn't convince me that speculation on the stock is warranted. To conclude this brief revisit of Snap, I will state that the stock is still not a buy for my portfolio. At the same time, I'm not convinced it will never be a buy, as some content catalyst could come along that will make me change my mind. Other opinions are welcome."

As you can see in the chart below, the stock has had a very rough time holding the $15 mark, especially of late, trading below the level at some point for seven trading days in a row. On Thursday, the stock dropped again thanks to an analyst downgrade, and I sold my puts for a nice gain, but I will be looking for another opportunity to play what I see as more downside coming for the name.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Snap hasn't been public for a year yet, but those that have been long the name have felt plenty of pain. Part of that has to do with three big revenue misses at quarterly reports, combined with massive cash burn, all of which I've covered here. As a result, we've seen dramatic cuts in estimates for this year and next, detailed in the chart below.(Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimates page)While the company has cautioned investors that profitability is a long way off, and perhaps may never come, the numbers have been quite shocking. In Q3 2017, for example, the company reported a GAAP loss of more than $443 million on just $208 million in revenues. That means that for every dollar of revenue generated, it cost the company more than $2.13. This isn't a sustainable business model in the long run.At the end of Q3, the company had about $2.3 billion in cash and investments, but that number will come down in Q4 thanks to cash burn as well as more investments in the business, M&A, etc. I've said for many months now that the company should consider a secondary offering while shares continue to sport a near $20 billion valuation, because if management waits too long and shares drop, a raise could be substantially more painful.Of course, if you afraid of dilution in the first place, you shouldn't be in Snap in the first place. At the end of April 2017, Class A shares (which are the ones traded in the market) totaled a little over 682 million. Thanks to share based compensation as well as early holders and insiders converting their Class B shares to Class A, there were more than 863 million Class A shares outstanding at the end of October 2017. With another 125 million Class B shares that could eventually be converted plus hundreds of millions in stock based compensation being paid per year, the Class A share count is headed towards 1 billion quickly.Q4 2017 may be Snap's last chance to prove itself. The bar has come down quite considerably since the Q3 report, with revenue estimates falling to $252.6 million from $308.0 million, and non-GAAP EPS forecasts declining by two cents to $0.16 per share. While that's still nice revenue growth from last year's $165 million plus, you don't really want to see beats fueled by 18% estimate drops in your top line forecast.I don't know many other companies that have had their 2018 top line estimates slashed by more than 30% in the last eight months, but Snap is definitely one of them. Shares have again lost the $15 mark, this time on another analyst downgrade and estimate cuts, which shouldn't be much of a surprise. If the company didn't get its act together as last year came to an end, there likely won't be much hope for the name in 2018."

(SNAP) has had a rough debut year on the public market. From the outset, an immature leadership team seemed unprepared for the rigors of quarterly performance reviews and the unrelenting scrutiny of stock analysts.CEO Evan Spiegel has oscillated between apparent naivete and frustration at having to answer to shareholders and market sentiment. That has been a problem in the face of unrelenting criticism that has emerged since the company’s IPO.Worse still has been the persistent financial underperformance and strategic miscalculations. The result has been a mounting short interest and intensely negative sentiment in the market.Yet some analysts and investors feel the doom and gloom is overdone. Can SNAP snap back from the brink and deliver a turnaround story in 2018? Let’s see if we can find out.SNAP has repeatedly missed on earnings estimates, even as analysts’ predictions became more muted. Q3 2017 was no different, showing stagnant growth and a major overestimation of demand for its Spectacles glasses product.The Spectacles debacle alone cost the company $40 million. User numbers were up just 3% and there was a 60% drop in advertising rates. Overall, it was not a pretty picture.In the wake of the third quarter earnings bloodbath in November, in which shares fell as much as 22% in after-hours trading, SNAP promised a redesign of the app that would increase users and revenues.With short interest so high and the market expecting only more of the same, any positive change could be seen as a comparative win. A well executed strategy of expectations management could see the stock turn around – or at least give it more of a floor from the bottomless pit it has been sliding into of late. Down 35% from its IPO price, some contrarians are starting to see an opportunity. One interesting piece of information that emerged in November was the fact that Chinese investment giant Tencent Holdings had taken a 12% ownership interest in SNAP. The stock Tencent bought has no controlling power, hence it had no need to disclose its stake even to SNAP.Some SNAP watcher saw the move as an opening gambit to gain influence in the company, but absent the voting rights or any statements about collaboration, the move for now seems to simply represent a belief that SNAP is undervalued. It is possible that Tencent anticipates SNAP get bought up by a larger tech player, or perhaps it feels as some analysts, including Barclays, do that SNAP has been beaten down a bit too harshly.But no matter how big the vote of confidence, SNAP has to genuinely deliver in order to stop the bleeding. That now hinges on the redesign plan.The promised redesign does two key things:Can the redesign achieve its promised aims? On the revenue optimization side, the better algorithm should indeed see improved returns. But that is still peanuts to the overarching problem: user growth. Q3 2017 saw just 3% growth quarter-on-quarter. For a tech company relying on a high-growth story, that is extremely bad news. The Discover feature may have some value in onboarding new users, but nothing about the redesign looks sufficiently new and innovative as to meet the mounting shortfall in user growth.Barclays’ latest research report on SNAP made the case that the company can find a way to coexist with the other big player in the photo-sharing social media space, Facebook’s (FB) Instagram. Comparing its potential future relationship with Instagram to the coexistence enjoyed by online travel companies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), Barclays contends that SNAP can have its niche and not face destruction at the hands of Instagram.That appears to be a naïve reading of the marketplace. While there is always competitive pressure in the online travel business – where price arbitrage is possible and monopolistic pricing models largely unstable and unsustainable over the long run – the same is not necessarily the case in the social media sphere.Indeed, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the network effects of the social media ecosystem are sufficiently strong as to crowd out all but the strongest player in the end. Facebook did it to MySpace, and its Instagram seems set on doing the same to Snapchat.And it is already happening: At the start of 2016, Snapchat’s new user enrollment was more than double Instagram’s. By August 2017, that lead had been eroded to nothing, and SNAP’s November earnings report shows the trend only worsening. Instagram already dominates the international market, and SNAP’s Discover feature seems unlikely to change that.Despite being beaten down in 2017 and the continued pile-on of negativity, fundamental problems persist. Competition and anemic revenue growth, in particular, make it difficult to see how SNAP can truly turn things around. While 2018 may not be so savage a disappointment as its debut year on the public market, SNAP still has a lot to prove.With a valuation of about 12 times forward revenue estimates, there is still a long way this stock could fall. It could do better, but investors would be prudent to give it a pass.That burning smell isn’t from a phoenix rising. It’s from a dumpster fire."
4134413,101459,2017-12-29T09:27:52-05:00,"Snap has repeatedly underdelivered in revenue and DAU figures in 2017.To combat current problems, Snap is introducing a few new initiatives.Successful redesign of its app could improve medium-long term revenue.Further transition towards the auction-based advertising platform will create long term revenue possibilities.","Company OverviewSnap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) is a tech and social media company, known for its popular camera application ""Snapchat"". It derives revenue almost entirely through the sale of advertising in the form of snap-sold or partner-sold revenue. Snapchat currently boasts 178 million daily active users (DAUs) and is one of the largest social media platforms in the world.IntroductionSince its high in March, shares of Snap have fallen roughly 35%. As of 12/29/17, the company is trading at $14.85 with a market capitalization of $17.88 billion. It has a 52-week range of 11.28-29.44 and EPS of roughly -$3.17. Snap Inc. saw its fair share of failures in 2017. Its Spectacles product was a flop, user growth is slowing, and short interest remains high. Despite these failures, there is still a window for success in 2018.There is no shortage of reports trashing this stock. The company will certainly be forced to combat a variety of negative forces for the foreseeable future. That said, I'd like to highlight a few key factors that could create positive momentum for Snap. If these things are successfully implemented the company will find success.1.) Successful App RedesignIn prepared remarks for Q3, Snap announced it would completely redesign its app to improve ease of use. As CEO Evan Spiegel noted, users have complained for years about difficulty navigating the app. The hope is that this redesign will help user growth in the medium-long term, in addition to raising ad revenue.What will the Redesign look like?A key aspect of this redesign will be the segmentation of ""Friends"" and ""Discover"" media into two separate pages. Snap's press release suggested this will allow users to separate the ""Social"" from the ""Media"".This means the existing ""Stories"" page will be eliminated and integrated into the new friends page. Software algorithms, similar to what is currently used by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), will prioritize certain content for users. The company claims these algorithms will impact the Discover and Friends section of the app. Snapchat will automatically suggest friends to interact with, reducing time spent scrolling through the app. Similarly, Discover content will be personalized to each user, so that the content might be more relevant - which also means users should be more likely to interact with ads.In addition to this major overhaul, the Android app will be undergoing its own redesign as well. The Android iteration of Snapchat has long been considered inferior to the iPhone's version. This is not due to limitations of the Android, but rather a previous unwillingness to develop a good app for Android. As Gadget Hacks noted in January, the existing app doesn't actually take a picture on the device, but rather takes a screenshot of a video feed. Snapchats taken on Android, therefore, often look blurry and pixelated. This isn't a reflection of an Android's hardware limitations. Snapchat simply hasn't taken the time to develop the app. Since the introduction of Android Lollipop 5.0, an operating system released over three years ago, third-party camera apps have been able to utilize the devices camera. There are few details surrounding Snap's Android update, but expect to see a shift towards better picture quality next year.Outcomes of the redesignTo be successful, the redesign must alleviate the existing slowdown in DAU growth. In the short term, the redesign will likely reduce user growth even further. As many have noted, it will take some time for users to adjust to the new layout. In addition, its quite possible users may ignore content from publishers and advertisers altogether. Now that the social side of the app incorporates stories, messaging and friends onto one page, I'm worried engagement with advertisements may see a hit.However, if successful, Snapchat will see a much needed growth in users. This is something that must happen for an investment in Snap to be warranted. As shown in the figure below, DAU slowed in Q3 slowed with an increase of ~4 million DAU. This fell short of analyst expectations of 8 million.(Source: Snap IR)The redesigned Android app should also help grow DAU and ARPU (average revenue per user) figures. Android phones are responsible for 85% of global smartphone revenue. If Snap can leverage this new app into DAU growth in the Android market, there will be significant revenue growth.If the redesigned app does improve ease of use, it's likely that users will spend more time engaging with the app. This, in turn, will also increase ARPU figures for all platforms, as users will be more likely to engage with publishers and advertisements.2.) Ad Revenue GrowthFirst, we'll address how Snap currently generates revenue. Nearly all revenue is derived through advertising products. These include a variety of mechanisms, but primarily focus on two categories: Snap-Sold and Partner-Sold. Snap-Sold revenue simply refers to advertising that is sold directly to advertisers. It includes Snap Ads and Sponsored Creative Tools. Sponsored creative tools are the Geofilters and Lenses advertisers can purchase to market or promote a particular event or product. The other form of advertising revenue, Partner-Sold revenue, is revenue generated by partners that have content on Snapchat and sell to advertisers. Snap-sold revenue is responsible for 91-93% of all revenue and will therefore be the focus of this discussion.Consistently throughout the year, analysts have downgraded revenue expectations for Snap. Recently eMarketer reduced yearly revenue expectations from $935 million to $774 million. This is a reflection of waning DAU growth and a similar slowdown in ARPU growth.Reports indicate that roughly 50% of ad revenue is generated in the ""Discover"" section of the app. If users do, in fact, ignore the Discover section in the redesigned app this will heavily impact short-term ad revenue. Furthermore, a survey conducted by AdAge found that advertisers still seemed hesitant to allocate funds towards Snapchat advertising. As shown in the figure below, 74% of advertisers and marketers were allocating 0 digital ads on the platform.(Source:eMarketer)Snap must find a way to combat its poor perception among advertisers. Its long-term success is dependent on a few new initiatives in this area.First, slow growth in ad revenue and skepticism from some marketers is likely a negative externality of the company's new advertising structure. In Q1, Snap rolled out a new auction-based approach to selling advertisements. In this setting, marketers bid for ads in an auction, a significant departure from the company's previous reserve-based system. This transition has reduced ad prices a whopping 60% Y-Y. Though this system is attracting more advertisers (80% of advertisers are purchasing ads through this system), this cost reduction is hurting ad revenue. An important thing to note, however, is that ad prices for ""contested auctions (more than one bidder) were on average 40% higher than uncontested auctions. As the company continues to transition towards this auction-based format, it is quite possible that a greater percentage of auctions will be contested, and therefore priced higher.Next, is the potential of new 'Promoted Stories', recently introduced in November. These stories essentially operate in the same way that regular Snapchat stories do, but they allow advertisers to create interactive pictures linking to a certain product or webpage. In December, Barclays noted this program alone could grow revenue $10 million next quarter, and even more in the future. These promoted stories operate on the ""reserved-buy"" system, and thus won't be impacted by the auction-based drop in ad prices.Remember, though marketers remain skeptical of Snap, they must recognize the exposure the platform offers them to the coveted 18-24 demographic. This fact is reinforced in the graph below. Snap's prominence in this regard will keep the company relevant among advertisers seeking to cater to this lucrative age group.(Source: MarketingLand)Whether ad revenue struggles are a temporary blip or a reflection of Snap's business model are still to be seen. Regardless, potential investors should pay close attention to auction prices and ARPU growth in the short term.ConclusionSnap's woes are likely to continue in the near-future. However, if it can successfully implement a few key changes and work to change sentiment among marketers, there is significant potential for growth. To reiterate, these include:1.) Increase in DAU and ARPU growth related to the redesign of its app and the complete overhaul of the Android App2.) An increase in budget allocation by Snap marketers3.) Successful implementation of the auction-based advertising systemDue to short-term headwinds, it would be wise to wait on the sidelines for now. That said, if Snap gets these things right, than this stock could be a great buy in late 2018."
4144473,22148,2018-02-08T08:19:07-05:00,"Snap reported improving revenue and user trends, but investors need to dig further into the financials.The company hasn't figured out a way to reduce cash burn to acceptable levels.The stock trades at a wild multiple of sales with the stock now worth nearly $30 billion.Investors need to be careful following the analyst crowd.","Snap (SNAP) surged nearly 50% the day following Q4 results that beat analyst estimates. The important numbers though showed no significant improvements warranting a sudden positive change of opinion in the stock suggesting that investors need to hit the brakes on this rally. To end 2017, Snap had some encouraging developments from a platform standpoint. The camera company was able to accelerate user growth and juice ARPU leading to numbers that beat analyst estimates. Snap was able to add 9 million DAUs during Q4 for the fastest net additions since Q3 2016 when the company added 10 million users. Redesigning the Snapchat platform last year was a big positive for the company, but a lot of the growth came from focusing on the less profitable Android users. The DAU growth was generally in the range of the last year with Snap adding similar amounts in Q1 and Q2 and never dipping below adding 5 million DAUs in a quarter. The sign is encouraging, but nothing worthy of a huge rally in an already expensive stock. The solid revenue beat in Q4 was another positive, but investors need to keep in mind that the original analyst estimates for 2018 were above $2.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $286 million versus estimates closer to $253 million, but this improvement leaves Snap far beyond original expectations. SNAP Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsSnap has substantially underperformed expectations since becoming a public company. Beating estimates is partly due to analysts pushing numbers too low based on past misses. Improving user metrics and boosting advertising revenue is an important part of the equation in valuing a stock. Ultimately though, what really matters is the ability to generate positive cash flows.Snap has failed miserably in this key category due to absurd costs that soar along with revenue growth. The social networking company hasn't shown any ability to generate positive leverage and Q4 was no exception. Despite beating most analyst revenue estimates by over $30 million and growing revenues by $120 million YoY, Snap actually generated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow metrics that declined from Q4 levels last year. Incredibly, the company continues to burn nearly $200 million in cash per quarter. Source: Snap Q4'17 presentation Snap has about $2.0 billion in cash so the company can afford to continue burning a large amount of cash each quarter, but the goals have to include significantly cutting its cash burn rate. The company had about $3.24 billion on March 31, 2017 after the IPO. As an investor, the biggest fear has to be that the social messaging company burns the remaining cash. The big disappointment is that Snap made an effort during Q4 to reduce hiring by cutting HR employees, yet expenses still surged. As the company started getting hosting cost growth under control, Snap saw operating costs surge from about $175 million last Q4 to $275 million this quarter (ex stock-based comp). Source: Snap Q4'17 presentation One of the most concerning aspects of the earnings release was the prepared remarks where CFO Drew Vollero tried to paint the picture of improving financial metrics. He had this to say about cash:Huh? Snap burned another $200 million in cash last quarter, but the management team apparently thinks this is normal. While analysts were busy buying into the story, the case for a $7 target by Shyam Patil at Susquehanna is one that is easy to make. With 1.42 billion diluted shares outstanding, Snap is worth an incredible $29.5 billion at the closing price of $20.75 on Monday.Compared to the well run and very profitable Facebook (FB), Snap trades at over 2x the P/S ratio. The below chart doesn't appear to even use the diluted share count that pushed the ratio up to over 22x forward sales estimates. SNAP PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAt a more meager 10x sales estimates, Snap would trade for $9. This number even appears aggressive for a company burning that much cash. And don't forget that the company still has to compete with Facebook and Instagram that will adjust to any success that Snap achieves. The key investor takeaway is that Snap improved some key operating metrics, but the important numbers don't provide much hope for the future. Unfortunately, the social networking company hasn't figured out a way to reduce cash burn to acceptable levels. Investors need to pump the brakes on this stock with the only thing preventing an outright short being the momentum in the stock. Snap is really in no different situation when the stock soared over $29 following the IPO and the same outcome could occur now whether rational or not."
4132417,39161,2017-12-17T22:13:22-05:00,"Snap wants to be the go-to camera of consumers around the world – and it appears that Snapchat is for the majority of early adopters the world’s largest markets.Comparing Snap’s Lens Studio with Facebook’s AR Studio, Snap appears to have the early lead.Instagram Direct will prove Facebook’s biggest threat yet, but is it too little, too late?Snap’s Lens Studio and Context Cards provide it with an early group of developers creating on its camera platform.The next major operating system will be built on top of the camera, and Spectacles will be very important to Snap’s long-term strategy.","Despite Snap’s (SNAP) lackluster performance since going public in March of 2017, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently revealed that Snap’s Bitmoji and Snapchat apps were the number one and two most downloaded apps in the US in 2017, respectively. Snap has gotten a lot of flak for calling itself a “camera company” and many investors took this in the literal sense: that Snap wants to sell camera hardware, like Spectacles and drones. While Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has said hardware will eventually become an important part of Snap’s business in the next decade, in simpler terms Snap defined itself as a camera company because it believes that the camera is the next major computing platform (a la PC, the smartphone, etc) and it is setting itself up to be the camera that consumers use to bridge the digital and physical world (more on this later). Based on the iOS download rankings provided by Apple, it looks like Snap is well on its way to doing so.On Snap’s Q3 earnings call, Spiegel stated that Snap’s three priorities for 2018 were user growth, content, and augmented reality. While I touched on how the Snapchat redesign may help spur growth, and will do another write-up on Snaps’ content strategy at a later date, I wanted to give my thoughts on Snap’s augmented reality ambitions.“Augmented reality” (AR) in itself is an ambiguous word. I define AR as any form of digital data or media that is viewed within the context of the real, physical world. Virtual Reality (VR) on the other hand exists in an entirely different, computer generated space. Finally, Mixed Reality (MR) can be thought of as a sort of in-between state of AR and VR. These definitions are often used interchangeably by the media, marketing materials, and management teams on conference calls. When I refer to AR throughout this piece, I am specifically referring to the blend of the physical and digital as defined above.Allison Wood, CEO of Camera IQ (which helps companies build marketing and advertising experiences for smartphone cameras), predicts that “Camera media will be bigger than TV”. This is a bold statement, and most likely not realistic until you realize that AR is entirely experienced through a camera (currently smartphones, and eventually smart glasses). What she refers to as “camera media” is augmented reality.And AR is truly a revolutionary concept. In the words of Matt Miesnieks (great resource for understanding AR, will link to his work below), “through all of history we have consumed visual content through a rectangle (from stone tablets, to cinema, to smartphones, etc.) and AR is the first medium that is completely unbound.”At the same time as being completely unbound and everywhere, AR can be very scarce. Experiences and content can be delivered and targeted unique to each user, and certain events and ads can be tied to specific physical places in the real world – a McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) logo on the field of a baseball game, a one-day-only promotional coupon appears as a collectible AR Pepsi logo in Times Square, etc. All of these lead to content, marketing, and branding opportunities that are completely unimaginable in a non-AR environment.Initially, the most successful apps and experiences in AR will be features tacked on to native mobile apps (think 3D arrows giving you directions in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Maps instead of 2D… or Snapchat lenses). Eventually, technology and consumer adoption of AR will get to a point where entirely new experiences that have not yet been imagined are capable. Watching entire TV shows or music videos collectively as a group at a stadium in AR, exploring old buildings that have been completely re-imagined in AR, or interactive 3D games that play out over a user’s living room are a few potential thoughts that come to mind. This video of “Augmented, Augmented Reality” gives a hint at just one of the many possibilities that will evolve over time.Matt has a nice piece explaining where the true value-add will come in AR, which is in controlling the AR Cloud. It is a relatively easy read in comparison to his overviews of Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore, both of those very informative as well. Matt describes the AR Cloud as such:He predicts that there will be many different versions of the AR Cloud, presumably each company having its own (or perhaps overseeing some sort of open network). While I think it is nearly impossible to actually predict exactly how a concept like the AR Cloud will evolve, I think it is valuable to understand in the context of how it relates to Snap’s AR strategy. Snap wants to own the world’s camera usage, acting as the bridge between the digital and physical world.On Snap’s Q3 ’17 call, Spiegel mentioned that Snap’s Lens Studio product was going to see a wider release, specifically in terms of the community. While writing this piece, Snap officially released its Lens Studio product on December 14th, a slightly stripped down version from the one it uses internally. This 29 second video gives us a brief overview of the product.TechCrunch says it is designed for simplicity, allowing basic 2D image overlays to immersive AR characters. This significantly opens up to door to who can use the product, and opening the Lens Studio up to everyone (not just advertisers) is the same approach Snap took with its popular geofilters product back in 2015. Snap recently stated that more than 95% of geofilters on the platform are community made, and Snap could use a similar strategy with AR as it did with geofilters.Per TechCrunch: “Developers can build static or animated objects, 2D cutouts, windows into other worlds, floating picture frames, and even 3D objects that react when you tap, look at, or approach them.” Based on a tweet from Snap’s Chief Strategy Officer Imran, it seems Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) took advantage of Lens Studio to create its viral Stranger Things 3D World Lens it released on conjunction with the show’s second season. The lens can be seen in action here, which gives us an idea of what is possible in Snap’s Lens Studio. Here is another example of a 3D lens made in the studio, which sort of reminds me of Snapchat’s dancing hot dog from this past summer. This one of a dancing Donald Trump is amusing as well.After a quick moderation process, users are given both a Snapcode and a deeplink to share the lens on other platforms (as well as in the physical world using the Snapcode). Additionally, lenses will be able to be sent to other users over Snap’s internal chat system (basically the same way they are already creating and sharing 3.5 billion snaps per day), essentially giving lenses created by both the community and brands the opportunity to go viral if users share. Lens creators will also see metrics on how often their lens has been used or shared.Aside from being open to the community, this release also marks the first time that advertisers can create 3D world lenses for the front-facing camera without going through Snap’s internal ad team (still required for face lenses, which Snap appears to be withholding as a premium ad unit). Per Digiday, lenses can be created in Snap’s Lens Studio in as little as an hour. Advertisers will also be able to work with Snap’s seven new creative partners to create custom lenses, cutting down the historical six to eight week development period when working with Snap to only a few days (which also required a $300,000 minimum ad spend). Now brands can buy CPM distribution of their Snapchat Lens in the camera app’s carousel for a cost of $8-$20 CPM based on targeting, which is lower than almost all premium video content on all large platforms.Before it was mentioned on the Q3 call, I had a hunch that Snap was working on building out these sort of capabilities. Back in February of 2017, Snap hired longtime Adobe VP David Salesin to lead a new research group at the company. Per the link:I think the current state of Snap’s Lens Studio will continue to evolve, and it will be interesting to see the direction they choose to go with it.A day prior to Snap’s Lens Studio, Facebook (FB) announced its AR Camera Effects Platform and AR Studio were in open beta (more details here), which were first announced at its F8 Conference in April (the same day Snap first announced world lenses). Here is a video highlighting Facebook’s Camera Effects platform (which is essentially a web-based platform on Facebook’s website).Here is a video I was able to find previewing Facebook’s AR Studio product, with another available here. At 0:31 in the second video, the interface where the 3D render is being created looks completely different than the first. Further, in this video of the Stranger Things world lens Netflix ran with Facebook (which I was not able to find any press on), you see the Facebook AR Studio appear at 0:18, going on to show a few other screenshots of an external editing software (that we are maybe supposed to believe is also Facebook’s AR Studio?). If you pause at 0:19, however, you see that the interface is exactly identical to Autodesk’s 3D animation software, Maya (see screenshot here).Based on some of the quick shots of the interface of Snap’s Lens Studio in links above, the two appear similar: you create your 2D/3D art elsewhere (Sketchpad, Maya, Blender, etc) and import into the respective program to port them into the apps.This tweet thread highlights how Snap’s product appears to be much better: “On my initial overview, Lens Studio looks incredible — it blows AR Studio out of the water. Audio, Pairing, Interactivity w/ Events, Snapcode integration, Lighting/Shadows. Best-in-class development ecosystem for the AR era”. Snap also rolled out 11 detailed documentation videos, which will no doubt help jumpstart development on the platform.Much has been said about the battle between Facebook and Snap. My thoughts are summarized in detail in prior writings, but my belief is that Facebook has ultimately run into the problem of no one actually using its in-app camera, which makes developing for Facebook’s camera much less attractive than Snap’s (in addition to Snap’s studio software appearing better at the moment). One of Facebook’s primary competitive advantages is the AI it deploys to curate/target ads in its news feed (it took years to develop, and only took Instagram engineers five weeks to tweak for Instagram when its feed went algorithmic), and I do not see Facebook ever cannibalizing its AI-powered news feeds in Facebook or Instagram to fully embrace the camera (will touch more on Instagram Direct below).I believe that one AR platforms will eventually win out, or at least be much more profitable than the others (how Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) “won” PC’s, Google “won” search, Facebook “won” social, etc). Having great tech will be important, but it seems to have been commoditized with all of the advances in computer vision and machine learning, especially with AR Kit and AR Core being baked into every new smart phone. I believe that Snap still has a sizeable lead when it comes to AR simply due to its massive network of extremely engaged users. Snapchat is also incenting developers to create AR that interacts with the world around them, whereas Facebook appears to be starting with face lenses to get users to actually start using its in-app camera in the first place (same strategy used by Snapchat when it introduced face lenses in the summer 2015). Snapchat’s decision to push world-interacting AR may very well give it a head start in developing a network of usage and engagement with the aforementioned AR Cloud.Below remains a good summary of my thoughts on the network effect of Snapchat’s messaging network:Also supporting my thoughts on Snap’s staying power is Pipar Jaffray’s recent Fall 2017 Taking Stock with Teens report. This bi-annual report showed that Snapchat is now the favorite social media platform of 47% of teens in the US – up from 11% in the Spring of 2015, and up from 24% in the Spring of 2016 (the survey prior to the release of Instagram Stories).Since Snap was first founded in 2011, Facebook has made no shortage of attempts to crush Snapchat. Snap declined a $3 billion buyout offer from Facebook in December of 2012 (was rumored to be higher), and the next day Facebook launched its first Snapchat clone, Poke (shut down in 2014). After being unable to acquire Snap in the fall of 2013, Facebook acquired WhatsApp in February of 2014 for a final price tag of $22 billion (originally $19 billion, adjusted post-close). Facebook also added messaging to Instagram in August of 2013, and recently announced it would be ripping that messaging feature out of Instagram and force users to download a new app called Direct, just like it did with Facebook Messenger (another shot at Snapchat). Facebook launched Slingshot in the summer of 2014 (shut down December of 2015) and Instagram launched Bolt in July of 2015 (never got enough users to take off). This tirade of attacks seemed to finally see some success in August of 2016 when Instagram launched Stories.Why does any of that matter? It shows that competition from Facebook is nothing new. True, Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy are young (it was reportedly Murphy’s idea that they could build a business around the camera). But they have consistently defended Facebook’s attacks. Snapchat actually saw US monthly active users (MAUs) decline by approximately 20% in the summer of 2014 (which Snapchat said was due to a seasonal decline in engagement during the summer in its S-1), so slowing/declining user growth is nothing new. Spiegel and Murphy reportedly bought Sun Tzu’s Art of War for all six of their employees when Snapchat declined Facebook’s buyout offer in 2012, and Snap took on the corporate strategy of attacking Facebook where it was weak. As stated below, Facebook is very effective as a one-to-many communication model, not as a network for close friends. Snapchat on the other hand was able to create the first extremely tight-knit network of interpersonal communication in the smartphone era, as it was an area where Facebook was weak. Snap then leveraged its interpersonal messaging network to build premium content (vs the clickbait popular on Facebook), advertising (full screen, skippable vertical videos that play with sound by default), and now augmented reality networks.Facebook finally found a hit with Stories for the simple reason that influencers (athletes, celebrities, etc.) already had millions of existing followers on the platform and were able to quickly reach every single one with a medium that was familiar to its userbase. Snapchat historically made it very difficult to amass a large following, and has been known for historically not courting celebrities or influencers (which could be changing with Snap’s new Discover Feed that shows users content based on their interests, not on who they are following). Instagram Stories allowed these influencers to quickly blast posts that appeared top of the Instagram news feed, ensuring their post would not be lost within the algorithmic Instagram feed. I have always assumed that a very low % of Instagram users are actually using the camera to create content, and Facebook has been very vague on numbers that show its usage.Snap has told us that approximately 107 million users create on its camera daily (60% of its 178 million Q3 user base), whereas Facebook gives no such numbers. Facebook has disclosed that Instagram Stories, WhatsApp, and Messenger Day have 300 million, 300 million, and 70 million users using these “stories” features on a daily basis, respectively, however it does not give any breakdown of how many users are actually creating stories versus just viewing the stories of celebrities, influencers, or small businesses and brands; or a geographic breakdown of where those users are located. Both these are important. When it comes to creating, each message pushes a notification to multiple users that brings them into the ecosystem (a pulling mechanism that gets more difficult to pull off effectively as users reduce the amount of content they are directly sharing on the platform). On the viewership side, the value of those viewers to advertisers also comes in to play as well. Sure, Snapchat has fewer users around the world, but the charts in this article show the majority of Snap’s user base is located in the largest advertising markets in the world.Facebook recently announced that Instagram was taking its internal messaging featuring, Direct, and ripping it out into its own separate app, which will open to the camera, not a news feed (its most blatant Snapchat clone to date). Ripping messaging out to create an entirely new app is the exact same playbook Facebook executed with its own in-app messaging system, forcing users to download Facebook Messenger back in 2014.I remain highly skeptical that Instagram Direct will actually spur significant usage of Instagram’s in-app camera, at least in comparison to Snapchat. It competes directly against Snap’s competitive advantage, camera-based messaging, an area where Facebook has much less data than Snap. The majority of Instagram messaging is the sharing of news feed posts and/or text messages responding to a story. Ripping this out into an entirely new app and completely changing the core use case of its messaging feature, while a bold move by Facebook (and probably a necessary move at this point to slow down Snapchat’s increasing dominance of the camera), may end up hurting engagement in the core-Instagram app in the long-term if fewer users are sharing and discovering new content over the messaging system. On the other side of this, the animation between Instagram and Direct seems to be seamless (the video also shows us that the user only sent and/or received five messages over Instagram in the 37 weeks prior to downloading Direct, which supports earlier my point).Obviously, Facebook’s goal here is to get a critical mass of users engaging with the camera in at least one of its apps, which will help court more advertisers and developers to generate AR content and advertising on the platform. Most likely, Facebook will eventually allow Direct users to share messages or “stories” to other app’s in Facebook’s portfolio too (similar to how it recently let users post their Instagram Stories to Facebook). But that will probably be more effective at increasing vertical video ad inventory, as you see musicians and celebrities cross-posting their Instagram Stories to Facebook Stories, not necessarily increasing camera usage by a critical mass of every day users.The new camera-first Instagram Direct may very well end up being too little, too late. Snapchat’s camera-centric messaging network has a massive established user base of teenage and young adult users in the developed world, users who are more likely to engage directly with a camera for messaging than an older user. Snapchat has disclosed that over one third of its users interact with Snap’s AR lenses every day, with the average Snapchat user spending over three minutes per day doing so. Three minutes multiplied by 178 million users gives Snap over 534 million total minutes (or 500 million years) of AR playtime per day. That can be used not only for ad inventory, but also provides a rich set of data collection on how users interact with AR. Additionally, it also means that one third of Snapchat users plays with lenses for nine minutes per day - which, again, based on Snapchat’s user demographics, is going to be heavily tilted towards young users in developed advertising markets.Brands and marketers looking to explore opportunities in AR seem to realize how much more reach Snapchat has as well: Marketers say Snapchat blows its competitors away when it comes to AR advertising. Despite this article predating the public release of Snap and Facebook’s respective AR developer tools, advertisers have been using both Snap and Facebook’s AR features for quite some time.For example, HBO ran promotional AR face lenses for Game of Thrones seventh season (Snapchat in mid-July, Facebook in late-August). Over the course of about a week in 16 countries, the “Game of Thrones” lens got over 122 million total impressions, with more than 45 million individual users posting or viewing the sponsored selfies (compared to 224 million views for Taco Bell’s May 2016 Cinco de Mayo campaign, which is the overall record-holder for sponsored Snapchat lenses). According to Snap, the average user played with the Game of Thrones lens for 23 seconds. The average for a sponsored lens on Snapchat is 15 seconds, which in of itself is incredible when you think of trying to get that same audience of 59 million (one third of Snapchat’s 178 million users) to actually watch a video ad in a Facebook or Instagram news feed (that plays without sound by default) for at least 15 seconds. I have not been able to find any sort of metrics for Game of Thrones’ Facebook campaign, but my hunch is that it was used much less than the Snapchat lens.The Game of Thrones Snapchat lens performance was undoubtedly boosted by promotions by the show’s stars Kit Harrington, Sophie Turner and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR); but they promoted the Snapchat filter in the first place due to Snapchat’s unmatched reach within Game of Thrones target audience. This in itself is a testament to Snap’s network effect of early AR adopters, which I believe is further bolstered by Snap’s content agreements with literally every major TV network. These sort of partnerships go beyond just Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). which owns HBO – but includes the likes of A&E Networks, ABC, BBC, CBS (CBS), NBC (SNL, Jimmy Fallon, The Voice), MGM, Scripps Networks, TBS, and Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA), which have all signed agreements to not only produce content, but many of them to also sell ad space within their Snapchat content. This has helped bring their traditional TV advertisers onto Snapchat, and gets them accustomed to using Snap’s ad auction platform.The networks also have a vested interest to use their talents’ social media followings to send their viewers to Snapchat (as seen in the Game of Thrones example above) in order to watch their made-for-mobile, vertical content, essentially creating a flywheel of sorts that continues to create more Snapchat usage. While not a new strategy, the release of the Snap’s new Lens Studio will allow marketing teams to efficiently whip up Snapchat lens campaigns for nearly every movie or TV show, then leverage both Snap’s vertical video ads and the social media followings of the shows talent to quickly distribute the lens to millions of fans.The market seemed to shrug off Snap’s acquisitions of Placed and Zenly in the summer of 2017, however they highlight Snap’s growing ambitions to bridge the digital and physical worlds. Placed seems to relate to Snap’s Snap to Store ad product (lets advertisers measure if an ad caused a user to visit a store and/or make a purchase), and has proprietary tech that measures physical building outlines. Placed’s technology may prove vital to not just Snap’s own internal mapping of the digital/physical worlds, but also generate revenue externally as Snap chose to have Placed run independently and continue to measure location attribution for other advertisers.Zenly is very similar to Snap’s internally developed Snap Map product and was reportedly acquired despite Snap creating the Snap Map internally on its own. In my opinion, this shows that Snap saw the importance of owning location-based media and chose to acquire one of the larger players in the space. Zenly is also used more like a video game than a social network, potentially precluding ways that management may continue to gamify Snapchat in the future. Snap has given zero indication on how Zenly is doing, however looking at the twitter feed of the CEO of Zenly gives you an idea of both how much it is being used (look at how many friends that user has on the map), and also where it is growing growing. His Twitter feed is filled with retweets of photos of young Japanese users with nearly a hundred friends on the map – a large advertising market that Snapchat has had trouble penetrating amidst the sea of Asian messaging apps. Zenly’s artwork is also very eclectic, seeming to put it in a favorable spot to slowly introduce AR concepts to the app’s interface over time.All said, location will be extremely important in AR. There will be many successful concepts that incorporate a user’s immediate environment (like IKEA’s AR app) into an app, but in order to have true staying power, the AR experience will need to be matched with the world (which is what made Pokemon Go so successful). And Snap appears to be setting itself up to be very successful in both AR and location attribution.Facebook saw success in the initial move to mobile as it was able to create a massive inventory of mobile ad inventory by creating a newsfeed rich with interesting content. Advertisers had many way to reach mobile users, but Facebook was able to leverage the way that users interact with content in its news feed to target ads better than anyone had done before. Snap can do the same with content in its own app (and has already been doing so, which I will detail at a future date), as well as capture a unique black box of data using image and audio recognition presented every time a Snapchat user sends a snap.When it comes to AR, advertising can be unlimited (unique targeted lens experiences), while also being very controlled (one advertiser is able to control the digital world associated with a specific location). AR may very well bring back the scarcity model that existed in traditional TV advertising. And Snap is not new at implementing AR engagement and measuring ad attribution.Snap acquired Bitmoji, a “digital avatar” of sorts, in the first half of 2016. Snap rolled out 3D Bitmoj’s back in September and two weeks ago we saw the first sponsored Bitmoji from McDonald’s. As referenced above, Apple reported that Bitmoji was the #1 most downloaded iOS app in the US in 2017. While hard to tell exactly how many consumers have their own Bitmoji character since Snap has not released any user numbers, Bitmoji has been intertwined with Snapchat, and I believe that Bitmoji represents the first “AR Avatar” to really gain a critical mass of users in the developed world. Friendmoji’s (two friends’ Bitmoiji combined in the same image) and Actionmoji (your Bitmoji appears in-app based on your actual activity) both add to Bitmoji’s network effect: the more people that have it, the more useful it becomes for existing and new users. And not specifically related to AR, the Bitmoji app also gives Snap a back-door to collect data in every other messaging app, as Bitmoji can be used within any app with a keyboard (Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc).As a branding tool, a Snapchat AR ad is as immersive as it gets. Snap has many case studies on its website showcasing the success that some of the largest brands in the world (who Snap has historically targeted over SMB’s). This presentation by Snap’s Global Head of Creative Strategy, Jeff Miller, at NY Advertising Week back in September highlights how Snap offers many more creative ad possibilities than Facebook (while not mentioning Snap’s over 300 targeting capabilities). Snap’s AR products are great for large brands because it spurs consumers to “play” with the brand. The presentation linked above shows Jeff playing around in Snapchat with his three year-old daughter (begins at 1:40), in which they try three different lenses. Two of them were ads, and the kid loved each one. This is ultimately the goal of these massive brands (with massive ad budgets): to get consumers to interact with and fall in love with their brand.And by removing the bottleneck of Snap’s in-house design team, it puts Snap (and its advertisers) in a position to quickly scale ad campaigns.Snapcodes are produced for every AR lens and distributed everywhere - digitally on other social media platforms or a brands website, but also in the physical world. Here it's on product packaging (Evian and Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) here), stickers to hand out at company events, on clothing (example from Coach (COH) here), on TV, or even on the doors of businesses. The classic “add us on Facebook” marketing strategy required users to look them up; a Snapcode allows users to bypass the keyboard and immediately access content by simply scanning with the Snapchat camera. And there are supposedly “160 undecillion” possible Snapcodes, so it is unlikely Snap will run out any time soon. In addition to Snapcodes, a “deep link” is provided with each lens created in Snap’s Lens Studio, which can be shared outside Snapchat. This will open Snapchat directly to the lens, and can even be utilized within Snapchat itself by deep linking to lenses in Snap’s vertical video Snap Ad format bought on Snap’s Ad Manager.It is important to remember that Snap is still building out its ad products and showing the market its monetization strategy. As we have seen time and time again, Snap continues to roll out new, innovative products (on both the consumer and advertising side). While developing these is evidently expensive, the costs related to these significant announcements post-IPO have been baked in over the last two years. Snap’s employee count has increased from 330 at the end of Q3 ’15 to 2,995 two years later (per Snap’s Q3 earnings call), an increase of over 800% (The Information also reported that Snap hired more employees in Q1 and Q2 of 2017 than they expected to hire in the entire year). We are just now going to start seeing the beginning of what kind of revenue a fully automated, affordable, made-for-mobile, targeted, augmented reality advertising system truly looks like. This revenue is likely to come at a relatively low marginal cost as employee costs are relatively fixed and Snapchatters are already racking up large hosting expenses doing nearly the same thing. This could give a significant boost to Snap’s margins as it grows revenue.And it is not like Snap’s ad business has not been growing. Snap said on its Q3 ’17 earnings call that ad impressions were up over 400% year-over-year (with ad load still “very low” according to management). The lower than expected Q3 revenue was driven by Snap’s effort to move its ad business to its new progmmatic ad auction. Management said average ad pricing dropped 60% year-over-year, as 80% of Q3 ad sales were delivered progmmatically. The move to a progmmatic auction is very important as it lets everything on the platform be purchased automatically and to target specific users. Originally, all ads were placed manually through its sales reps – which is much slower and less scalable. 2018 will be the first year where every ad product on Snapchat is available on-demand – Snap Ads in Discover, World Lenses, Geofilters, Stickers (good write-up on potential of stickers), the same system that has made Facebook and Google so profitable. Eventually, I predict advertisers will be able to bid on digital/physical space around the world in real-time (similar to geofilters), but that is most likely still a few years away.The aforementioned drop in ad prices also reportedly puts Snap’s CPM’s around $8-20 (and as low as $2.50 in some cases), which compares to premium digital ad prices on Facebook, Google and other digital properties ($2-6 for display, and $12-20 for video). CPM’s on traditional TV can be anywhere from $14 to $80. Snap first set advertisers pricing expectations very high in order to gain traction in its ad business. By lowering prices in-line with other digital ad products, it may help Snap build a near monopoly on camera-based advertising. We saw this play out with geofilters; Snap was the de facto due to controlling the camera usage of anyone who would be receptive to that sort of ad.It will take a significant effort for a competitor to build out a comparable advertising platform on the camera, especially while most likely not being able to charge any sort of premium over Snapchat lenses or other digital ads due to Snap’s scale (same as Google in search and Facebook in social). Facebook and Google are probably in the best position to challenge Snap. But as I stated previously, I do not see Facebook cannibalizing its news feed to truly challenge Snapchat’s dominance of the camera. And Google’s Lens/Pixel integration is impressive, but it lacks the social network to implement it at the same scale as Snapchat, hence why I believe it offered $30B to buy Snap.Tying back in to the AR Cloud and the bridge between the physical and digital world, owning the bridge between these (the camera) will create immense shareholder value. The camera is going continue gaining more significance as smart glasses approach mainstream adoption. While we are obviously still years away from that point, it makes sense to own and build in that space now in order to be in a favorable position for the future.Owning the camera today gives Snap sway to get developers to start adding utility to its camera platform. Not much has been said on Snap’s context cards, but it is a first look at Snap’s attempts to bring outside developers onto Snap’s camera platform. Developers will need scale of users in order to justify building, and so will advertisers. Snap has partnered to bring reviews, (TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Foursquare, Goop), restaurant reservation tools (OpenTable, Bookatable, Resy), and ride hailing (Uber (NYSE:UBER), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT)) to Snapchat. Many other apps, new forms of media, and games will eventually be developed on the camera as well. While Snap has some experience developing camera-based games on its platform, Tencent’s (OTCPK:TCEHY) 12% stakes becomes an interesting component in this regard as they bring in a whole new layer of expertise running MMO’s like League of Legends and King of Glory.While Spectacles very first iteration has been declared a flop, Spiegel described Spectacles as a toy; an experiment in AR/VR. The first iteration of the product highlighted a areas it needed to improve, specifically an instance where the charging case caught on fire and a lack of battery longevity and photo-taking options. While I do not expect Spectacles to drive significant revenue growth in the immediate future, I believe Spectacles will be instrumental in Snap’s long-term strategy.Evan Spiegel is known to be an admirer of Steve Jobs, and I believe Snap will take the same approach to Spectacles that Apple did with the iPod and iPhone. The first few iterations of the iPod only played music. Apple added video capabilities, introduced 3G connectivity, added the iPad, and continued to evolve (and gain a sticky user base) with each product cycle, getting it to the point where it is at today. The iPhone we know today may not have existed if it were not for the iPod.I believe Spectacles will follow a similar path. The first product was basically a video recorder on your face. It was simple, but was also practical in the sense that it looked similar to the sunglasses kids wear to music festivals. Spectacles also solved the problem of having to use at least one hand to record video. The next version of the product is rumored to incorporate augmented reality (which would make sense in light of recent company announcements). Future generations will most likely incorporate data connectivity (currently connects to a users phone via Bluetooth), ability to instantly upload to a Snapchat account (currently a manual process), ability to actually live stream from Spectacles, integration with other external apps, more advanced AR capabilities, eye tracking, etc.This is why Spectacles are important to Snap’s long-term strategy - not how many it sells in Q4 ’17, but over the next decade. The CEO of Pinterest (PINIT) recently said the camera will be the next keyboard. Snap said the same in its S-1. The next major operating system, smart glasses, will be built on the camera, and Snap is in a prime position (and a supposed 15-year product road map) with its massive user base of young, early adopter users in wealthy markets."
4129255,103887,2017-12-03T09:50:16-05:00,"Revenue growth will be lower than expected due to an increasingly saturated user market, unpredictable effects of the app redesign, and weakening ARPU from a switch in pricing mechanism.Potential expansion into Chinese markets is not enough to save Snap, especially since it will face strong competition from local giants.Unless SNAP focuses on cutting costs, it will not see positive profit for years to come. Furthermore, Snap's R&D investments, like Spectacles, may not ever yield positive results or revenue.","Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is a young technology and social media company that has four products: Snapchat, Spectacles, Bitmoji, and Zenly. Since its IPO in March of this year, the company has been struggling as it repeatedly misses earnings expectations and fails to generate positive net income. Despite having four official product lines, Snap only successfully monetizes Snapchat through procuring advertising revenue. With most Snapchat users concentrated in North America and Europe, the firm has had trouble expanding abroad due to censorship and connectivity issues, although Tencent’s (OTCPK:TCEHY) recent acquisition of 12% of shares has generated speculation of a partnership which could help Snap penetrate previously untapped Chinese markets. On another note, the company wrote off $39.9 million of inventory in Q3 2017 related to their Spectacles product line (a supposed complement to the popular Snapchat app), which was considered a massive failure. Leadership has frequently stated intentions to delay monetization of products and focus primarily on driving user engagement, regardless of cost. In fact, R&D and general and administrative expense, potentially related to the development of the Spectacles product (which was predicted to drive user engagement but failed), were 538% and 785% of revenue, respectively, in Q1, 2017.Sources: Q1 10Q, Q2 10Q, Q3 10Q.No explicit explanation of these massive expenses exist in either the 10Q or conference calls, and Snap has displayed no intention of slowing down spending related to “innovation.” Although Snap’s advertising endeavors via Snapchat have proven successful thus far, with results to advertisers outperforming the industry average (according to data in the 10Q), the company has begun transitioning to an auction-based advertising model, which lowers pricing potential. Furthermore, CEO Evan Spiegel recently announced a massive redesign of the app’s user interface, which will separate consumer-to-consumer and consumer-to-advertiser interaction, possibly impacting ARPU negatively. The viability of Snap’s business relies on its ability to grow its daily average users (DAU) globally in order to onboard more advertisers. Its biggest burden to profitability, however, is the massive amount of cost the company incurs. Executives maintain voting control due to the non-voting nature of shares issued in the IPO – and with no intention to cut spending, profit is nowhere in sight. In this analysis, I concentrate on forecasting DAU and ARPU growth, and compare revenues to hosting costs in order to determine if Snap has the potential for profitability. I also forecast Q4 and FY18 EPS, while conducting scenario analyses based on the impact of Snapchat’s planned redesign and potential partnerships.First, I looked at sequential DAU growth, which is essential to generating ad revenue, over the last four quarters.Source: SNAP IPO prospectus.Although Snap cites YoY growth in the triple digits, on a sequential basis DAU growth is ~3.86% on average, with a comparable annual growth of only 16.34% globally (refer to first exhibit above). Markets in both North America and Europe are saturated, while the ROW doesn’t fare much better. Meanwhile, ARPU growth has stalled in the recent quarter, possibly due to a switch to a programmatic auction-based advertising model announced in Q3, which lowers the price Snap is able to charge while potentially attracting a larger volume of smaller advertisers.Sources: SNAP IPO prospectus, my own estimates.Sequential revenue growth outpaces sequential growth of expenses, but only because expense was more than 14x revenue in Q1. Average cost to revenue remains more than 2x throughout the year. After isolating hosting cost to $2.80 per user, hosting makes up about 68% of revenue – indicating a substantial core operating margin of 32%, enough to make a profit if Snap cuts spending on R&D and acquiring companies to develop mysterious new functionalities and products.Despite this, DAU and ARPU growth are both weak and below expectations for a young company, resulting in lower than average revenue growth. I forecast a base-case EPS of $(2.87) for FY17 and $(1.55) for FY18 based on this analysis. Furthermore, Snap’s redesign might negatively affect ARPU if consumers do not choose to deliberately interact with advertisers. If the redesign results in less interaction, I estimate an annual ARPU of $3.81, down from $5.08, leading to an EPS of $(1.75).Sources: Q1 10Q, Q2 10Q, Q3 10Q, Snap IPO prospectus, my own estimates.Finally, I considered the possibility of a partnership with Tencent. If Snapchat is able to penetrate Chinese markets, I estimate an incremental DAU of 30 million, resulting in an EPS of $(1.34) (above). Unless Snap is able to raise ARPU more than 2x or acquire 325 million more DAU, it will not achieve profit unless it cuts costs.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4129760,39161,2017-12-05T12:02:43-05:00,"Combining messaging and stories will further monetize Snapchat’s messaging network.Algorithmic content delivery will allow Snap to place content anywhere within its feed, allowing it to charge brands for premium placement like Facebook.Snapchat’s new Discover feed will help spur international growth, as users do not need to add any friends or follow anyone to discover content, a la Netflix.Snapchat still has an exclusive network of hard to reach consumers in the largest ad markets. This network of users also provides a unique image recognition data set that can be leveraged for ad targeting.Snap continues to invest in its advertising products – and could be working on a third party ad system similar to Google AdSense and Facebook Audience Network.","On November 29, Snap gave the market an early look at the previously announced Snapchat app re-design. A detailed overview of the announced changes is available here, and I will touch on a few of them in detail below.First, I think it is important to discuss Snap’s staying power as a company. Snapchat is a camera-centric messaging app. There is no lack of commentary on how Facebook and its portfolio of apps are crushing Snapchat; however since Instagram Stories was launched in Q3 of 2016, the number of Snaps (aka messages) created per day on Snapchat has increased from 2.5B in Q3 ’16 to 3.5B in Q3 ‘17, an increase of 40% year-over-year. Additionally, if 3.5B snaps per day is extrapolated over 365 days, that 1.27 trillion is greater than the estimated 1.2 trillion digital photos to be taken in 2017 in the entire world, excluding Snapchat.When you consider that Snapchat’s 1.27 trillion Snaps per day captures a small sub-set of the global population (young Millennials and Gen Z in the developed world), it shows that Snapchat has a firm grasp on the camera usage of its users. It also shows how Snapchat’s primary use-case is messaging, and highlights the strength of its competitive advantage – its messaging network of the hardest to reach, and arguably most coveted consumers in the world – which it can leverage in both content and advertising.One of the changes in the “new Snapchat” is that messages and stories from friends will now be shown on the same page to the left of the camera, and the Discover feed (Snap Shows, publisher content, Live Stories, and influencer content) will be to the right (previously, messages were to the left, and all stories/professional publisher content, aka Discover, were combined to the right). There is no doubt that the launch of Instagram Stories pulled some “stories usage” away from Snapchat, however as I stated above, messaging on Snapchat is still as strong as ever.Displaying friends’ stories right beside their messages could end up being a smart move. As users are pulled into Snapchat from getting a message notification from a friend, they may be more likely to watch the story from, not only that friend that sent them a message, but all of their friends, as they see them listed beside the message they just received.By placing Snap ads within Stories that are shown on the messaging tab, this will aid in monetizing the messaging section of the app, one of the topics that analysts keyed in on during the Q2 and Q3 earnings calls. My belief was that Snap still had room to increase ad load within Stories/Discover pre re-design, and this change will significantly boost available ad inventory down the road as stories views increase.While there has been no lack of coverage on competitors copying Snapchat, Snap has been quietly cloning the features of Facebook and Google’s automated ad platforms. Recently, Snapchat combined its editor and ad publisher into one tool, as well as rolling out “Advanced Mode” of its Snap Ad Manager. Snap’s ad publisher also recently introduced AI features to automatically crop horizontal video assets to vertical, which is highlighted in the video in this article.Combined with the potential of Context Cards and its lead over Google and Facebook in Augmented Reality advertising, Snap still has significant levers to pull to spur revenue growth, and is constantly innovating and introducing new ad products (as we have seen with the constant innovation and introduction of entirely new digital advertising products in Sponsored Lenses, Context Cards, the Snap Map, etc.), to spur revenue growth.One of the other significant changes announced in the re-design was that the Discover section of the app will now include content from users who do not follow you back (aka celebrities, athletes, influencers, brands, etc.), as well as from relevant Snapchat Live Stories, Snap Shows, and Snap’s media partners. Snap claims its new “Discover news feed” will use an algorithm similar to Netflix to show you content relevant to what you want to see, a different approach taken from the FB/Instagram news feeds, which incorporates your friends activity into the feed.This seems like an abrupt change; however Snap has been experimenting with gathering user viewing data and delivering curated content in its Search and Discover pages since inception. Snap also hired Hussein Mehanna, Director of Facebook’s core machine learning group, back in May of 2017. No doubt it was for the purpose of expanding its use of curation algorithms. As an example of how long Snap works on some projects, the Snap Map was first conceived back in February of 2016, however it was used/tested internally for fifteen months before being released in June of 2017.On Black Friday, Snap announced its newest ad product, Promoted Stories. When thinking about the product in the context of the new Discover feed, you get an idea of how it fits into Snap’s advertising offerings – similar to a native news feed ad on Facebook or Instagram. One of the big benefits of Facebook switching its newsfeed from chronological to algorithmic is that it vastly increased Facebook’s options for inserting ads within content. By giving users “what they want to see”, Facebook could show any content, from any time, at any place, in a users news feed. An algorithmic feed will allow Snap to do the same. If Snap figures out that a user likes a particular Snap Show, it can serve them subsequent episodes in the season; essentially allowing users to binge watch Snap Shows as they could on Netflix. Snapchat will be able to provide users an endless stream of content, whether it was created one hour ago or one week ago.Facebook has also seen significant revenue growth from limiting organic reach of brands and small businesses since 2012. Prior to implementing the algorithmic news feed, publisher’s content on Facebook was pushed to all their followers. As users scrolled, they saw posts chronologically. If a page posted at 8:32am, a user would see the post anytime they scrolled to that point in time within their feed. By switching to an algorithm, Facebook essentially controlled everything its users saw. Fast forward to 2017, and that 100% organic reach has declined to as low as 2% (expected to eventually hit 0%), requiring these pages to pay Facebook to boost their posts views (a significant portion of Facebook’s revenue). Not only does the new algorithm give Snap the ability to serve a feed of content it believes is most relevant to a user, it will also be able to generate revenue from media publishers, brands, influencers, events, etc. that wish to boost themselves to the top of the Snapchat Discover feed.I believe the benefits of an algorithmic feed could go even further for Snap then they did for Facebook. Considering the new algorithmic feed and Promoted Stories product, Snap can monetize both time spent scrolling the news feed (promoted stories) and viewing Discover content (traditional Snap Ads), the latter being something Facebook has tried to crack multiple times (with limited success) with Instant Articles.One of the benefits of having a strong and fully functioning network effect is that as you get more users, they increase the value of the network for existing users, which subsequently entices more users to join, creating a flywheel effect that continues to build the strengthen of the network. Snapchat seems to have created this sort of network effect within the largest advertising markets in the developed world, however has had trouble growing outside of its core markets.My opinion is that the new Discover feed will make it easier for new users to join the network. On “old Snapchat”, a user had to manually add friends and follow influencers. While “new Snapchat” does not immediately fix the problem of having no friends on the network, it does speed up the process of finding content. Snap also announced that it will allow influencers to monetize their content on Snapchat, something they have been requesting for years. While no details have been announced, my guess is it would be a similar revenue split to YouTube.And as we have seen with companies like Netflix and Spotify, a good content library combined with good execution can lead to significant international growth. Mashable CEO Peter Cashmore gave a presentation at the 2017 Digiday Publishing Summit, and believes the future of content is premium, mobile video shows.Snap only needs one (or a few) killer show to make itself a must-have for users around the world. Snap has been working with nearly every major TV network to create custom, “made for mobile” vertical 3-5 minute shows, where either Snap, or both Snap and the TV network, sell the ads (which introduces the TV network's advertisers to Snap’s ad platform), and they split the revenue 50/50. Per the article linked above, Snap provides significant data to all of its media partners (and can use for itself) on how young consumers view content on mobile. Snap has invested in building out a content team to create Shows in-house, while also looking to license Shows from third parties. Ultimately, if Snap can pull off either a licensing or in-house content creation strategy, it would begin seeing all the ad revenue from its Shows (which is nascent so far; Snap only recently starting allowing programmatic ads in Snapchat Shows), essentially doubling revenue from the current 50/50 revenue share and offer significant scaling opportunities in its content business as nearly that entire additional 50% of revenue falls to the bottom line.Snap also recently hired Cheryll Idell, a former Nielsen executive with nearly three decades of experience in the entertainment industry, to help pitch the value of its advertising products to the movie and TV industry.If Snapchat can continue creating vertical, made-for-mobile content that users enjoy (from both established media brands like NBC, TBS, etc. and established influencers), it will act alongside the messaging features to act as a one-two punch that brings users into the app. As users join Snapchat for the unique-to-Snapchat content (which Snap has invested heavily in over the last three years in Snap Shows and Live Stories), it could entice users to begin sending Snap’s augmented reality filters to their friends and strengthening the messaging network.Also key to international growth will be Snap’s progress on improving the performance of its Android app. These Reddit threads from October of 2015 and November of 2016 go into detail on Snapchat’s performance issues on Android. Comments from the two Reddit threads tell us that Snapchat has historically performed very poorly on Android. In summary, the problem stems from how it captures data from the camera. One of Snapchat's competitive advantages is that it owns the camera of young people in the developed world. This is, in part, because Snapchat remains the best way to capture quick moments. Snapchat keeps the camera running at ALL TIMES when the app is open, even if it is not open to the camera screen. Constantly running and tapping into the camera API is very GPU-intensive, and can be a drag on lower-end phones.When developing on iOS, a developer only has to incorporate one type of phone – an iPhone. There are a few different iPhone models (and iPads), but the phones are all designed by Apple. Comparatively, on Android, there are tens of thousands of phone models. This report from 2015 highlights over 24,000 different Android device models – and Snap disclosed that Snapchat was used on 60,000 different types of Android handsets in Q3 ‘17. Android phones vary in quality, from the new Pixel 2 from Google to the numerous low budget phones popular in Asia.On its Q3 ’17 earnings call, Snapchat announced it was completely re-building its Android app from the ground up. In a recent feature on Snap CEO Evan Spiegel from Wired, there is a note that Spiegel is currently using an Android phone – a sign that the company is taking its Android issues seriously. While pressure from Facebook has no doubt slowed user growth, I think it is fair to assume that an improved Android app could help spur user growth once again, especially outside of developed markets where Android is much more popular than iOS. If Snap is able to figure out a solution to keep the camera running in its Android app across a wide spectrum of devices, it could see an uptick in international growth. Snap acquired Strong.Codes, a Swiss firm specializing in encryption services, in early 2017. If Snap has truly found a solution, it may explain the desire to protect its code from competitors.Another feature Snap recently announced (not related to the re-design) was serving users filters related to the content of their snap. Snap has displayed its image recognition capabilities in its Search feature since its release (search “dog” and you see snaps of dogs, search “trophy”, “car”, etc. for similar results), however this could mark the start of expanded use.Image recognition as a standalone feature appears easy to copy. And I agree – the core tech is slowly being commoditized across the industry. The key is that Snapchat not only has an army of young users in the developed world (who are more likely to send a camera-based message) training its algorithm (sending snaps such as “Picture of my dog!” or “Look at my new car!”), but it also has the user and advertising network to take advantage of this data for advertising purposes.Similar to how Facebook can target ads based on how you view content within the app (which Snap does as well), Snap can also gather extremely relevant, recent data on the content of Snaps. Things such as “new car buyer”, “someone who just sold their car”, “someone who just got in a car accident”, etc. are just a few examples of very relevant ad targeting metrics that could be generated based off of the text and images contained in snaps and stories that users send over the network.When combining these capabilities with Snaps extremely engaged network of users creating 3.5 billion photos and videos per day, as described earlier, you see how Snap’s black box of data centered on camera usage gives it a significant advantage. It is no secret that Facebook is pushing users towards the cameras inside Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatApp; however when it comes to the developed world (the largest advertising markets), Snapchat seems to have similar reach to Instagram, and absolutely dwarfs the reach of Facebook and Instagram when it comes to teens, as seen in the charts below (from August, 2017) that compares the number of ad viewers within the Facebook News Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and Snapchat’s Discover/Stories (which may potentially increase after the re-design as described above, as it excludes users who ONLY use messaging).Source: How Facebook's, Instagram's and Snapchat's audience size estimates compareSource: How Facebook's, Instagram's and Snapchat's audience size estimates compareSource: How Facebook's, Instagram's and Snapchat's audience size estimates compareA recent report by App Annie also shows that despite the competition from Facebook, Snapchat still reaches an exclusive audience within the United States that cannot be reached on other platforms on any given day.Source: https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-strategy/snapchat-audience-exclusivity-data/Facebook HAS disclosed that Instagram Stories, WhatsApp, and Messenger Day have 300 million, 300 million, and 70 million users using these features on a daily basis, respectively, however it does not give any breakdown of how many users are actually creating stories versus just viewing the stories of celebrities, influencers, or brands; or a geographic breakdown of where those users are located. Both these are important, as the creation of content by the majority of users in these apps, especially when it comes to messaging, as each message pushes a notification to a user that brings them into the ecosystem (a pulling mechanism that gets more difficult to pull off effectively as users reduce the amount of content they are directly sharing on the platform). And as we can see in the charts above, Snapchat is very competitive in the largest ad markets, which is essentially what matters as we think about revenue opportunities over the next few years (while completely disregarding any international growth Snap may see with its expanded focus on content and improved Android app).Snapchat’s messaging network is sitting on an untapped treasure trove of data, which can be used for both optimizing content and delivering ads. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Could the same be said about a snap?In February of 2016, Snap hired Sriram Krishnan from Facebook. While almost two years ago, it was an important hire, as Krishnan worked on the team that developed the Facebook Audience Network – a third party ad network that allowed Facebook to both track user data and show ads on third party platforms (under a revenue share). Very similar to what Google did with AdSense, it allowed Facebook to expand its reach and grow revenue beyond its own platform.Many attributed the hire as Snap’s move into an Automated Pragmatic Interface, or API (essentially an automated ad-buying system), which allowed advertisers to purchase ads via an online system instead of manually calling/emailing/discussing with Snap’s sales representatives. It served as the foundation of Snap’s relatively new auction-oriented automated ad platform, and I believe could set the stage for Snap moving into a third party ad network of its own as Krishnan worked on the similar product at Facebook.Krishnan left Snap in February of 2017, which I believe signaled that his work was done. As the linked TechCrunch articles states, he was living with his family (with his wife, a startup founder, and plans to have children) in San Francisco and commuting to Snap’s HQ in Los Angeles – not an ideal long-term situation.Snap appears to have acquired MetaMarkets in Q3 of 2017, a platform that offers inventory discover and bid monitoring, gives clients an API to import data into other apps, and aggregates ad metrics over numerous ad platforms (notable clients include Twitter and Oath, the combined AOL and Yahoo). MetaMarkets is reportedly generating tens of millions in revenue, and saw 426.6% revenue growth between 2013 and 2016. While this acquisition could simply be Snap beefing up its existing internal ad network, I think it is far to assume this could be a step towards Snap creating a third party, mobile native, vertical video ad network.Combined with Snap’s recent launch of its Pixel ad targeting feature (with similar to tracking capabilities offered by Google/Facebook), it definitely appears Snap is beefing up its ability to measure ad performance outside of Snapchat. Snap has also recently rolled out “Advanced Mode” for its Snapchat Ad Manager, which made managing large ad campaigns on the platform much more efficient. Snap’s Q2 acquisition of Placed, a third party location measurement solution for advertisers, will also be integrated into the platform, providing further location tracking features, such as the ability to measure if a consumer visited a physical location after viewing an ad on Snapchat.With the challenges digital media publishers have faced thus far in 2017, I would not be surprised to see Snap throw some sort of lifeline to publishers (as they did with Discover). A recent study by Nielsen seems to show that Discover not only benefited publishers within the Snapchat app; it also boosted their audience growth on TV, desktop, and other mobile platforms as shown below.This lifeline could be in the form of a third party ad network, allowing publishers to cut costs on their sales force and split revenue with Snap, just like they do within Snap’s Discover feed. Buzzfeed recently announced it was cutting 100 employees, largely in advertising and business operations, and also recently experimented with a Snapchat-like Stories feature in its own mobile app.Alternatively, Snap could also be looking acquire one or many digital media companies at fire-sale prices in order to plug them in to its ad network. Ziff Davis recently acquired Mashable for $50 million, one fifth the value of its reported peak valuation of $250 million, after raising $46 million since 2005. Snap has been upfront at stating it is a media/content company – something Facebook has avoided – and its recent moves suggest it may be looking to leverage its newly created auction network.Snap already has a base of 60+ digital media publishers on its Discover platform. While I doubt everyone would be interested in what I outlined above, some may experiment with a third party ad system powered by Snap. Snap has also experimented with college newspapers publishing on Discover. While this alone will not drive any significant revenue growth, I believe it represents Snap making a move into more localized news; something that nearly every local newspaper in the world could eventually take advantage of.Aside from just veritical videos, Sanp’s third party auction network may also revolve around augmented reality advertising. Snap introduced 3D Bitmoji avatars in Snapchat two months ago, and two days ago announced that McDonald’s was the first brand to sponsor a 3D Bitmoji lense. While obviously something that is not going to happen any time soon, CEO Evan Spiegel did state on the Q3 call that Augmented Reality was a key focus for the company in 2018. Spiegel also mentioned Snap Lens Studio was being tested by the likes of Netflix, which will essentially allow any user or advertiser to create a Snapchat face filter.With the release of Apple’s ARKit in iOS 11, analysts are projecting explosive adoption of consumer AR over the next few years. Similar to how apps and websites can allow users to “login with their Facebook profile” in exchange for user data, Snap could do the same with Bitmoji and other augmented reality apps. Could Snap be working on the first augmented reality advertising network?When looking at Snap’s financials, the company appears to be an absolute disaster. It continues to burn cash at a faster rate each quarter, increasingly losing more and more money. This is due to Snap investing heavily in future innovation, both on the consumer and the ad product side, as I have described above.Looking at the last eleven quarters, most noticeable to me is the drastic increase in employee count (which is a relatively fixed cost). Total employees increased from 600 in Q4 ’15 to 2,995 at Q3 ’17; a nearly 400% increase in less than two years. Per the Q1 and Q2 ’17 conference calls, 90% of new hires in those quarters were in sales and engineering… hard to expect all of those expensive hires, who are going to be the key drivers of future revenue growth, to immediately begin contributing to said revenue growth.Source: Q1 ‘15: Estimated, could not find a source; Q2 ’15: The 50 Unicorns Hiring The Fastest And The 50 Losing The Most Employees; Q3 ’15: How many employees does Snapchat have?; All others, Snap’s SEC filingsSnapchat has positioned its business in a favorable position as the large brand advertisers convert their traditional TV advertising dollars to digital. On the Q2 ’17 earnings call, Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan stated that over 75% of the top 100 adage leading national advertisers spent on Snapchat’s ad platform in Q2’ 17. The top 100 advertisers represented over $240B in annual ad spend in 2015 globally, and present a significant opportunity for Snap going forward. While revenue growth has come in below Wall Street expectations since going public, Q3 ad impressions increased 400% year-over-year and ad prices have dropped 60% due to the newly implemented ad auction. As the auction becomes more competitive, ad prices will stabilize and increase alongside ad load. Digiday reported that Snap's progmattic ads fetch $3-8 CPM’s, similar to Facebook and Google. As brand advertisers are able to compare the ROI on Snap’s full screen, vertical video ads that play with sound by default to Facebook and Instagram news feed ads, which are essentially the same concept as animated banner ads that have existed since the 90's (of which Snap ads also have a much higher ""swipe up to watch this full 2-3 minute video"" than FB news feed ads), we may see a price floor develop as more advertisers pile in and push up auction prices.On the margin side (when adjusting for non-cash stock based comp and the one-time inventory write-down in Q3 ‘17), gross margin continues to increase each quarter (aside from a seasonal revenue decline in Q1 of ’17 that management said they expected on page 81 of the S-1). Management also disclosed on the Q3 call that gross margin in its US business was approximately 50% - hardly the sign of a dieing business model.Source: Snap SEC filings.Looking at solely the revenue brought in versus hosting costs, you can see that the core Snapchat product continues to viable. It is important to note that this excludes some of the content costs and non-cash expenses. Content cost is primarily employee salaries and revenue share to Discover partners, which are less variable than hosting expenses. Stock-based compensation, depreciation, and one-time inventory write-downs are also non-cash, and not as relevant when looking at purely from “does this product generate any cash flow” perspective.Source: Snap SEC filings.And while hosting cost is variable and will increase if Snapchat increases engagement, an increase in revenue will not necessarily increase hosting expenses. Snapchatters are already using the app over 30 minutes per day on average, and either a change mix in how time is spent in the app or an introduction of new ad products to take advantage of existing user behaviors could bring in additional revenue with nearly no marginal hosting cost. Snap has been investing in new lines of revenue over the last two years, and we are now starting to see a corresponding increase in revenue. Snap has seen positive contribution margins since Q2 ’16, with 73% and 43% in Q2 and Q3 of ’17, respectively.On the fixed expense side, Snap stated on the Q3 ’17 earnings call that its pace of hiring would slow going forward. As revenue increases, we should expect to see more of that cash fall to the bottom line.Assuming it continues burning through cash at the same pace; Snap will most likely run out of cash sometime in the next two years. This however, assumes Snap does not achieve any sort of scale and becomes profitable as its business matures. It also does also not factor in its $1.2B line of credit (see page 84 of Snap’s S-1), which could provide a last minute source of cash if monetization takes longer than expected.Additionally, when comparing Snap to Facebook, it is important to note the difference in how their financial performance is represented. For example, Facebook’s gross margin in 2016 was 86%. Per page 39 of its 2016 annual report:""Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.""Comparatively, Snap's gross margin in 2016 was -12% (worth noting that it had improved every subsequent quarter in 2015 and 2016). On page 75 of Snap’s S-1, it states:""Cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products. Hosting costs primarily include expenses related to bandwidth, computing, and storage costs. Cost of revenue also includes revenue share payments to our content partners, content creation costs, which include personnel-related costs, and advertising measurement services. In addition, cost of revenue includes inventory costs for Spectacles and facilities and other supporting overhead costs, including depreciation and amortization.""There is huge difference in how Facebook and Snap’s hosting costs hit their financial statements. The only real “hosting” costs that hit Facebook’s net profit number are operating/depreciation expenses related to its data centers. The actual costs related to building the data centers are CapEx, and do not actually hit FB's income statement. On the other hand, the majority of Snap’s COGS is actual cash being paid to Google/Amazon for hosting (definitely some content creation costs in there as well that FB does not have). Competition in the cloud hosting space continues to heat up, with providers continually cutting prices to gain market share, a trend working in Snap’s favor.In conclusion, the major Snapchat re-design may help boost user and revenue growth going forward. Key revenue and profitability drivers going forward will be how Snap’s auction pricing evolves over time, the success of its Snapchat Shows and the new Discover feed, potential future iterations of its hardware (Spectacles), and the evolution of the Snap Map. Snap appears to have significant levers to pull going forward, and has shown a knack for innovation in both the features in its Snapchat app and in the ad products offered to advertisers. Snap has invested heavily to support future growth and is not in as rough shape as consensus would have you believe. Over 75% of the largest brand advertisers in the United States spent on Snap’s ad platform in 2017, and Snap’s continued investment in its ad and measurement products should continue to bring in more revenue that scales the business."
4126940,102875,2017-11-21T15:37:35-05:00,"Since its IPO in March, Snap stock continues to gradually depreciate in value.The lack of the institutional support due to the poor performance is the main reason why Snap stock continues to be trading in a distressed territory to this day.We started to short Snap stock before the recent earnings results and increased our position after the company missed its revenue forecast for Q3.","Over the last few months, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock has considerably depreciated in value, as the competition started to gain foothold on the market and the company continued to disappoint its investors. Since its IPO in March, Snap missed its revenue forecast three quarters in a row, as it still fails to figure out in which direction it should move and on which products to focus more.Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, UBS, Barclays, and other investment banks and advisory firms downgraded Snap stock to either underweight or sell stating that the company will face a lot of challenges regarding its monetization potential and its ability to become profitable in a foreseeable future. In addition, Snap’s major competitor, Instagram, which is fully owned by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), has recorded 500 million daily active users, which is higher in comparison with Snap’s DAU of only 178 million. The aggressive growth of Instagram’s users is mostly fueled by the release of the stories feature, which was introduced a year ago and goal of which was to tackle Snap’s major competitive advantage. With Facebook resources, Instagram will continue to establish a stronger presence in the image messaging and multimedia app market. And if Snap will continue to show poor performance, it will completely lose its investors’ confidence and has every chance to become irrelevant in a foreseeable future. At the moment, institutional ownership continues to remain at a low level, as only 26% of Snap shareholders are major funds. In order to improve the situation, Snap plans to redesign its Android app and bring new tools for the influencers to use in 2018 to attract new users. However, there is no proof that those moves will have a positive effect, as the redesign could make old users use Snap app less frequently, and the number of influencers could shrink, as they will be looking for other, more popular platforms to market their products and services. Only time will tell if Snap will succeed in its endeavors.Image: TechCrunchTo find out if Snap stock has any value left, we created a DCF model, which will show how much the company is really worth today. The table below shows our forecast of Snap’s growth by different metrics for the upcoming years:Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesWithout a doubt, the aggressive growth of revenue will stop in the upcoming years, as the competition will continue to gain foothold in the market where Snap is participating, and the customer acquisition cost is going to increase, as over time, it becomes harder to attract new users to the platform. In addition, our revenue forecast is in line with the Capital IQ estimates up to the terminal year 2026, with a terminal growth rate of 1.50%. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 10%, as the cost of equity is 10%. The cost of debt at the moment is irrelevant, since Snap has only around $15.9 million worth of debt, while its capitalization is more than $15 billion.When we combined all of that data, we determined the intrinsic value of Snap to be $12.21 per share, which is relatively close to the current market price.Source: Own estimatesAfter that, we made a comparable analysis, which helped us to find out how Snap is performing against its rivals. The table below shows multiples at which Snap and other companies from the industry are being valued.Source: Capital IQ, Own estimatesThe main problem with this comparison is that Snap is a relatively young company, which creates products for a small range of customers in comparison with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Facebook. On top of that, Snap has greater sales multiples for the previous and the current year, if compared to the industry’s median, while its EBIT and EBITDA are negative and the EBITDA margin is -121.5%. Because of this, our comparable analysis determined Snap’s fair value to be $2.38 per share, which represents a downside of more than 80% from the current market price.Since the company will continue to lose money for quite some time, it’s no surprise that the peer analysis, goal of which is to value the particular business by looking at the performance of other businesses from the same industry, showed such a result. However, in order for us to be realistic and determine the final fair value of Snap, we decided to combine both of our analysis, where we gave our DCF model more weight in deciding that final value, since it’s based on the more fundamental data than the comparable analysis, and came to a conclusion that as of today Snap’s intrinsic value is $9,75 per share, which represents a downside of 23% to 24% from the current market price.Source: Own estimatesAs we could see from the analysis, Snap stock still has some downside at the moment. We believe that if the company will continue to disappoint its investors in the upcoming quarters by failing to achieve its revenue goals and increasing its net loss, the stock will continue to depreciate in value. The lack of the institutional support due to the poor performance is the main reason, in our opinion, why the company’s stock continues to be trading in a distressed territory to this day.We opened our short position in Snap a couple of weeks before the recent earnings results and increased our position after the company missed its revenue forecast for Q3. We don’t believe that in Q4, the company will show some extraordinary results and thereby believe that there is more downside to come, as the competition will continue to strengthen its positions on the market.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4126622,24849,2017-11-20T18:28:37-05:00,"Barron's discusses $38 million in sales below IPO price.But wait, there's a lot more since!Are shares heading towards new lows?","A couple of weeks ago, I analyzed the disappointing earnings report from camera company Snap (NYSE:SNAP), which was in the discussion for the worst corporate report for this earnings season. Unfortunately, for investors, the news continues to worsen, as it now appears insiders are dumping shares at a strong pace, leading me to believe the worst is yet to come.As Barron's detailed in an article last week, four company insiders have combined to sell $38 million worth of stock since the company's lockup expiration period hit in late July. Through preset trading plans, sales started a couple of weeks later, and 2.7 million shares have been sold under the $17 IPO price, with a sale low of $12.50. Here is a quick summary of who has sold and how much:Interestingly enough, Sehn and Horowitz both sold shares just a few days before the company's disastrous Q3 earnings report, so I hope they weren't subject to any blackout restrictions or that could be a problem. A few months earlier, when the Q2 report was almost as bad, CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy stated they would not sell any shares this year in an effort to calm investors about the terrible performance. There is one curious item that has come up, however, that was originally pointed out by TechCrunch:Now, I'm not sure exactly how deep the ""promise not to sell"" goes into Spiegel's compensation plan, because just last week, a Form 4 was filed on his behalf that sold over 1.65 million shares (about $20.5 million worth) to cover taxes in regard to the settlement and release of fully vested restricted stock units. If I read the Form 4 correctly, the plan to sell these units for tax purposes was set back in March 2017, so this was in place before Spiegel made his promise not to sell. Since this basically was an automatic transaction that appears to be happening each quarter moving forward, some will argue that it doesn't violate his promise not to sell. On the flip side, critics will say that even if that is true, the optics just don't look good.Unfortunately, for shareholders, the insider sales that Barron's mentioned have continued during the past week. A Living Trust that holds shares on behalf of a Snap director sold 25,000 shares last week, so that was another $313,000 worth. Also, while the Barron's article mentioned that Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan hadn't sold recently, they probably should have just waited a few more days. Late last Friday night, nearly 10 PM on the East Coast, a Form 4 was filed where Khan sold another 150,000 shares for almost $1.87 million, bringing his total sales up to around $9 million. A lot of Snap's Form 4s that display insider selling show up late at night, so you might miss them if you are looking during market or extended hours when we normally would see a lot of these filings.With the company having only bad earnings reports since it went public, analysts are basically tripping over each other to cut their revenue forecasts. Back in March, the street was looking for $1.03 billion in sales this year and $1.94 billion in 2018. As of Monday, those numbers have come down to $799 million and $1.31 billion, respectively, with non-GAAP EPS loss forecasts also getting a bit worse. I can't remember a recent IPO that I've seen have such large cuts to its forecasts in such a short period of time.Snap shares closed Monday at $12.41, a little over a dollar away from their public trading low. As seen in the chart below, they are down almost 58% from their peak after multiple bad earnings reports. Last week, Barron's detailed a number of insider sales transactions, and if they had waited just a few more days, they could have added a few more sales to their list. The way things are trending, it is only a matter of time before this name falls to the single digits like some analysts think it will.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Author Update: A few hours after this article's publication, three additional Form 4's were filed by selling insiders - Chief Strategy Officer Imran Kahn, who sold another 372,210 ($4.67 million), General Counsel Michael O'Sullivan, who sold 10,016 shares ($125k plus), and Engineering VP Steven Horowitz, who sold another 286,332 shares ($3.59 million)."
4129289,22148,2017-12-03T20:48:47-05:00,New report shows Snap has an exclusive user base.Snap must prove the business model though plenty of revenue upside exists with monetizing existing user base.Valuation is extremely stretched despite the opportunity to grow revenues due to unconstrained operating expenses.,"A new report backs the thesis that Snap (SNAP) has compelling user engagement that remains sticky. Unfortunately, user engagement is only one part of an investable business model that my research has questioned since the IPO.The stock has been a dismal performer since the IPO earlier this year due to slowing user engagement and massive losses. Is exclusive engagement enough to change the fortunes of shareholders?For Q3, Snap reported that DAUs only grew sequentially by 5 million to 178 million. Sequential growth slowed to 3% and annual growth has now dipped below 20%. North America growth was a similar anemic 2 million users added sequentially.The one thing Snap has going for itself is that engagement remains strong for the core user base. According to App Annie, a large portion of domestic Snapchat users don't use other social platforms on any given day.Source: Ann AnnieSo Snapchat users consistently don't use the key Facebook (FB) apps like Instagram and Messenger on a daily basis. In essence, for advertisers to reach the Snapchat user base, they have to go directly to that platform with 48% of United States users not logging into Instagram on any given day. The numbers are even worse for Twitter (TWTR).This data continues to support the theory that the ability of Instagram to copy Snapchat features such as via Instagram Stories has killed user growth. Instagram Stories has now soared to over 300 million users and is heading to double the amount of people that use the creator of the concept.The below chart from BTIG highlights how Facebook via Instagram has killed the user growth of Snapchat. So the opportunity for Snap exists in turning those exclusive users into valuable revenue generators. Of course, the social platform could figure out a concept that would attract more users, but that is a different story and difficult to include in an investment thesis at this point.Looking at the average revenue per user (ARPU) might show some keys to whether Snap can derive value with the stock worth $16.5 billion now. For Q2, the social platform obtained $1.17 per user, up 39% from last year.Looking at Facebook, the largest social platform generated ARPU of $5.07 per global user and an incredible $21.20 per US & Canada user. The numbers are vastly larger than what Snap generates and appears related to MAUs where as an ARPU based on the smaller DAUs of 1.368 billion is closer to $7.50.Source: Facebook Q3'17 presentation If Snap was to just generate $5 per DAU, the company would see quarterly revenues approach $900 million. One could splice out North American users and potentially come out with a larger figure using that $20 ARPU.Either way though, Snap has to figure out how to turn profitable much quicker. The company can't continue burning $220 million in cash each quarter like during Q3 while waiting to boost ARPU to Facebook levels. In fact, Snap has to still prove that generating Facebook level ARPUs will even generate a profit.The company has made some steps via laying off recruiting personnel that suggests slowing down expense growth, but Snap has a massive way to go. For Q3, operating expenses were $223 million, down from $229 million in the prior quarter. Snap has to continue controlling costs while at least doubling quarterly revenues into the $400 million range before the company can even approach break-even due to huge hopping costs that already top $200 million per quarter.Yet, the stock already trades at about 4.5x normalized revenue targets based on the existing user base approaching ARPU levels of Facebook.The market though has to deal in reality. Snap trades at nearly 13x '18 revenue estimates of $1.3 billion. The way estimates are falling, the stock might trade closer to 15x sales reality while competitors like Facebook and Twitter trade at much lower levels while actually generating positive cash flows.SNAP PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that an exclusive user base provides Snap with an opportunity to thrive down the road as a company. The problem is that the social network must first prove the business model works in the same manner as Facebook.The company must grow revenues without expanding operating expenses for an extensive period just to make the stock investable regardless of the valuation concerns. At that point, justifying the current stock price would still prove difficult so the recommendation remains to continue avoiding Snap at these levels."
4122905,86896,2017-11-09T14:57:54-05:00,"Snap Inc. delivered another quarter of poor earnings results.While revenues grew, expenses are growing disproportionately. In turn the company cannot find positive income.With poor user growth, I don't know how Snap will turn the trend around.","Outside of Facebook (FB), I've been pretty critical of social media stocks. Snap (SNAP) has been no exception. I called the company's prospects as a stock from the beginning. The company's earnings results, and poor user growth are proving my point. As of writing, the stock is down 16% due to its disappointing third quarter results.The economics of Snap are pretty simple. The company makes money from advertising. To increase advertising revenue, it needs more users. Counter-intuitively, the company is struggling to produce that user growth. I said in the beginning that the concept of Snapchat lacked the substance to grow as a public company. The concept of a disappearing video or picture isn't enough. The costs being incurred by the company are too much for the actual growth potential. As a result, losses are mounting.Revenues for the third quarter increased by 62% to $207.9 million. Unfortunately, that isn't nearly enough to cover the company's expenses. With total costs of nearly $670 million, Snap had a net loss of $443.159 million in the third quarter. That's more than three times higher than last year. For shareholders, it's an earnings loss of $0.36 per diluted share (attributable to class A, B, and C) vs. $0.15 in 2016. That's a 140% increase year over year. In non-GAAP diluted earnings that's a loss of $0.14 a share; a $0.01 increase in losses year over year.What's troubling is how little effect the significant increases in costs and R&D are having on sales growth. For the nine months ended September 30th, Snap has increased costs by more than five times the expenditures in 2017. R&D alone is around ten times more than this point in 2016. Spending over $1 billion on research and development wouldn't be such a big deal if it was leading to results. Unfortunately there's very little of that happening.Snap only added 4.5 million users in the third quarter. The 2.9% increase is the lowest quarterly performance thus far. The problem isn't new. Quarterly user growth has been slowing through 2017. Much of the credit seems to lie with Facebook's Instagram. There's a surprising correlation between snap's slowdown and Instragram's introduction of Instagram stories; a very similar model to snap. By basically copying the features of snap to its own app, Instagram has damaged snapchat's demand.The plus side for Snap is it doesn't have much debt. The balance sheet is strong with over $3 billion in stockholders' equity. They've managed to avoid liabilities through the progressive sale of more stock, and investments. Shares increased to 1.23 billion shares compared to 832 million last year. I question how long this will hold up in terms of strong capitalization considering the company's spending is not creating value. The stock has lost half its value since the IPO. At $12.91, it's a lot more difficult for Snap to raise some quick cash. Based on their developing losses, they're going to need it. The company has $317 million in cash. If net losses stay on the current tract, Snap will be selling more stock or taking on debt.The lack of monetary value within the Snapchat app is evident. To fix this problem CEO Evan Spiegel says they are redesigning the app to make it more user friendly. Snapchat seems pretty useable to me. I think the problem revolves more around the lack of depth or real usefulness. It's a silly social media app for people to mess around with. It holds no real value. Facebook pulls it off because it connects friends and loved ones who may not be able to see it each other all the time. You can keep track of old friends, and it indoctrinates you into wanting to see what others are doing with their lives. Snapchat consists of ten second silly videos. To really create widespread appeal, they're going to have to do a lot. In the mean time, where's the catalyst for earnings?The poor user growth makes me very skeptical of this stock. Earnings should be increasing as revenues climb. A company with a strong foundation should not be delivering such poor results."
4122472,103480,2017-11-08T15:08:40-05:00,"Snap posted a gory Q3, with revenues and user trends both missing analyst consensus by a mile.The company's losses also tripled y/y to $443 million. The company lost more than $2 for every dollar of revenue (a -213% net margin).Worst of all, user engagement is down and Snap had its worst quarter for net user additions yet.Worrying user trends have caused Snap to announce a huge redesign to its app, which may turn even more people away.","For the entirety of its existence, Snap (NASDAQ: SNAP) has been a one-trick pony, and regardless of whatever else you may think of the company, its singular trick is a good one: making pictures disappear. Not long from now, Snap will bring its signature disappearing trick to its stock as well, making Snap the MySpace of 2017 (or AOL, MyScape, or Pets.com - whatever tech failures you prefer). While Snap still has north of $2 billion of cash (most of which was accrued in its overblown IPO, not through operating profits), investors must seriously question how long that cash pile will last - especially when net losses are trending at ~$400 million per quarter (free cash flow was negative -$220 million in Q3) and not showing any signs of slowing down.Snap is already one of the worst-performing IPOs of the year, and post-earnings, Snap shares crashed more than 15%. Though the company hasn't yet fully tumbled to its all-time low of $11.28, there are just no more positive catalysts that can lift the stock any higher. Snap has yet to find a bottom - and given the spectacular and deep-seated failures revealed in this quarter, it's more than likely that this bottom is somewhere below $10.SNAP data by YChartsFailed social media companies die quick deaths - once user attrition begins, the company implodes in a death spiral, as fewer users lead to both fewer ad clicks as well as lower pricing per ad, as Snap will lose its bargaining power with advertisers if it can't prove the stickiness of its user base. As I wrote in a prior article, Snap has failed to become a ""platform"" company - a service that links together a variety of vital services the way Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) combines social networking with photo sharing, messaging, event management, and even a P2P marketplace. Because of this, once the ""fad"" period is over, users will find few reasons to keep the app installed.The cards have fallen for Snap, and there's no coming back from a quarter like this one, especially once momentum has been lost. Let's take a closer look at the reasons why.Stocks don't tank by nearly 20% for no good reason. Snap's Q3 results contained some genuine, nuclear threats for even the hardiest of Snap bulls.The company posted only $207.9 million in revenue (+62% y/y), missing analyst consensus of $236.9 million (+85% y/y) by more than 20 points. This quarter's growth rate also represented a stark deceleration from Q2's growth rate of 153%.Figure 1. Snap Q3 resultsWhen Snap first went public, its S-1 filing showed $404.5 million in FY16 revenues. A lot of spectators were estimating that Snap would grow to $1 billion in revenues by FY17, implying a 147% y/y growth rate in FY17. This dream has all but shattered with Q3's results. Year to date through Q2, the company had posted 200% y/y growth, but through Q3, its year to date revenues of $539.3 million are up only 126% y/y - short of the 147% growth needed to hit $1 billion. In order for the company to hit the fabled $1 billion mark, it would need to post $460 million in revenue for Q4, or a 177% y/y increase for 4Q16 - out of the question, now that growth has decelerated to the 60s.Snap's disappointing revenues were both a function of slower user growth (we'll get to that shortly) as well as deceleration in the growth average revenue per user (ARPU), indicating a slowdown of user engagement. ARPU was $1.17 in Q3, up only 12% sequentially from Q2's $1.05. Analysts had expected ARPU at $1.30 - clearly, they were expecting Snap to perform much better on the user engagement spectrum.Snap has also given in to the times and rolled out a programmatic ad buying platform - which is how most ads are sold these days - meaning that automatic, software-triggered bidding wars determine the placement of almost every ad on Snap's platform and drive down pricing. Evan Spiegel, Snap's founder and CEO, said that programmatic ad buying has driven down Snap's pricing by 60% y/y - a scary amount.Top line aside, let's not forget Snap's staggering losses. Net losses ballooned to $443 million in Q3, from only $124 million in the prior year quarter. This is a net margin of -213% (versus -97% in the prior year quarter).And year to date through Q3, Snap has lost an even more mind-boggling amount - $3.1 billion in net losses. That's more than Snap's current cash balance. And while it's true that a large portion of those losses are non-cash (thanks to large stock-based comp expenses), free cash flow was -$622 million through Q3; we can assume that FCF for the full year will trend close to a -$1 billion loss.Snap reported only $2.3 billion of cash on its balance sheet, so it might not have much liquidity left to play with. Worse yet, misguided management decisions have cost the company even more in losses. Snap's hardware foray has cost the company a pretty penny - you might recall that teenagers tripped over themselves to get a pair of $130 Spectacles from a pop-up vending machine, but once the fad died down, Snap was left with a mountain of unsold inventory - 300,000 unwanted units. The company took a one-time, $40 million charge-off in Q3 to account for these losses.In another lesser-known story: Snap recently decided to sell a dancing hot dog costume for Halloween for $80. Snap appears to be a company that can't take its business seriously. While actions like these may seem silly and harmless, they cost an enormous amount of management distraction. In the case of Spectacles, that experiment cost them $40 million - and countless hours of management time that could have been better applied toward gaining more users and winning more advertising deals.Massive losses - even $3 billion losses - would be forgivable if Snap showed meaningful growth in its core business, but even these billions in ""investment"" have produced lackluster user growth.Snap ended Q3 with only 178 million DAUS (daily active users), up only 5 million from Q2. Analyst consensus had called for DAUs of 181.8 million. A miss on DAU growth is arguably more penalizing than a miss in revenues, as user trends drive fundamental results for all future quarters, not just the current one.Figure 2. Snap DAU trendsSource: all DAU figures taken from public filingsYou can clearly see, in the chart above, that Snap's user base is beginning to plateau. DAU growth of 5 million represents only 3% sequential growth from Q2, and 16% growth y/y - Snap's worst showing ever.DAU figures are presented as net adds, so Snap doesn't disclose its user churn; but it's more than likely that the company suffered quite a bit of user defections as well that led to its lower net adds figure.In his prepared remarks, Evan Spiegel said that DAUs grew ""at a lower rate than we would have liked,"" and that July and August were slower months relative to September. If the summer months were slow - when teens go on vacation and take Snaps of themselves on the beach and drinking martinis - what can we expect from the rest of the year?You're probably familiar with the fact that the whole world grouses and moans when Facebook rolls out a new user interface. The menus and click-throughs of a social media app are already confusing enough, and most prefer the old app just as it is. Nevertheless, in response to concerns over the slowdown in its user growth, Snap has proposed to redesign its app to make it more engaging for users.Snap hopes the update will make the app more intuitive and easy to use - it plans on algorithmically generating the Stories that appear on a user's feed, in the hopes that presenting more relevant stories will keep users more engaged on the app.Snap bulls might be thinking: if continuous app redesigns didn't kill Facebook, it won't kill Snap either. But the circumstances are different. Facebook users kept using the app because they had few alternatives to turn to. What would they do otherwise - convince their friends to start using Google Plus? (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). As if.Snap, on the other hand, already faces direct competition from Facebook's own Instagram, whose 500 million daily users are already triple that of Snap's user base. If the new app design is clunky or ""uncool,"" the remaining Snapchat users who haven't defected to Instagram may start to leave en masse. There's nothing worse than opening an app you use daily and have to re-learn how to use it again, for no apparent benefit.Even Evan Spiegel commented on the huge risk in re-jiggering Snapchat's design. On the earnings call, he said:Snapchat's upcoming app redesign is a massive black box, with its estimated impact totally uncertain. Spiegel and the company may be fine with uncertainty, but Wall Street definitely isn't. Until it's abundantly clear that the app redesign doesn't scare away Snap's core user base, the threat of further user defections will hang over Snap's stock and prevent it from recovering from its new lows.There were a hundred land mines coming out of Snap's Q3 release, but there are only a few that investors need to know to make a sound investment decision to stay away from Snap:It's common knowledge that Mark Zuckerberg once offered $3 billion to buy Snapchat, an offer Evan Spiegel refused. This was the right decision at the time, as Snap soon grew to a $25 billion public valuation. However, Snap's successive stumbles in the public market have slashed that valuation to $15 billion in less than one year. Soon, it will be lucky to be worth the $3 billion Zuckerberg offered.Yahoo, too, was once worth $100 billion at the height of its dot-com popularity. Just recently, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) picked up the shattered pieces of Yahoo for just $4.8 billion, underlining just how spectacularly an Internet company can fall when it ceases being popular among its users.Billion-dollar IPOs generate a lot of hype - particularly because the investment banks promoting these offerings stand to make hundreds of millions in fees for the deal - but they are no guarantee of long-term success. In Snap's case, it only took a few months for the story to start unraveling.Snap's Q3 release, laden with all the company's shortcomings despite is hysterical early hype, has affirmed the thesis that Snap is the great internet failure of our day. A few more quarters of earnings misses and underwhelming user growth (of Snap's three public earnings releases since its IPO, it has missed all three) should be the final nail in the coffin. Soon, too, the maker of disappearing pictures will disappear into the realm of penny stocks.Keep a close eye on this one: large-scale flameouts are always fun to watch."

4122904,22445,2017-11-09T14:26:17-05:00,Snap had another bad quarter. However this time revenue growth is decelerating faster.I expect analyst price targets to drop like a rock.There are limits to how many times analysts and the market will give Snap the benefit of the doubt.,"Snap (SNAP) had another horrible quarter with the stock diving as much as 20% in after-hours trading. I was short into earnings and covered at the low-end after hours. I then put in a few short orders in the $13.50 range and went to sleep (I'm in Europe).To my surprise, when I opened up my terminal in late afternoon Athens time, not only had my orders been executed, but Snap was actually up in the pre-session. As high as $16 a share!The news was that China's Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) bought a 10% stake in Snap as per a recent regulatory filing. Well, I can tell you one thing, the Chinese also are going lose their money.Now as per Snap's Q3'17 results, the main highlight was the revenue miss. The company booked $208M in revenue, when analysts were modeling an average $240M.This is a huge miss. Because in addition to the current quarter's miss, revenue estimates have been coming down over the past several quarters. Just to give you an example, back in August (please consider: Why Snap Is Not Worth More Than $7.4 Per Share) analysts were modeling $1.86B in revenue for 2018. As per yesterday (even before the results), that number has been reduced to $1.58B.source(As a sidetone, I took the picture to follow the downward revisions in the future.)So with Snap only doing $208M in revenue for the quarter, what will 2018 look like? And I'm talking about EPS or EBIDTA. I'm talking strictly revenue, which is probably the only variable analysts are basing their price targets on.One thing is for sure, it will not be a current $1.58B analysts are modeling, and new estimates will come down once more. Please also note several months back revenue estimates for 2018 were as high as $2B.As per the conference call, Evan Spiegel said Snap ""reached over 70% of the 13 to 34 year-old population in the U.S., France, the U.K., and Australia."" On the one hand this is a proud achievement, but on the other hand it probably means Snap has reached some kind of user engagement limit.If you have just about every 13-34 year old who uses your app, who else is there? And the above theory could be confirmed by sequential user growth metrics. For the quarter Snap registered a sequential increase in DAUs by only 3%. And if you ask me, even the 17% Y/Y increase is not all that impressive when one considers Snap's valuation. For the nine months Snap had $622M in negative free cash flow, an increase from the $490M it burned Y/Y. Yes there is still penalty of cash on its books (about $2.3B in cash, equivalents and securities), however at some point cash will be a concern, if things don't turn around soon.Nothing has really changed pertaining to my view of Snap, with perhaps that revenue growth is decelerating faster that I thought.I'm not sure what metric analysts use to come up with a price target for Snap shares, but I'm assuming they are using revenue metrics that no one likes (AKA price/sales ratio).For the first nine months of 2017 Snap's revenue came in at $540M. Please note market expectations for 2017 as of yesterday were $879M. Will Snap register revenue of $340M in Q4 to meet those expectations? I think it would take a miracle. In fact I would not be surprised if revenue Q4 is barely above Q3 figures.So assuming Snap's Q4 revenue is somewhere around $240M, revenue for 2017 might be something like $780M. Also assuming revenue increases by 50% for all of 2018 (which I doubt), then Snap will book something like $1.17B for 2018.That's a big difference from the current estimate of $1.58B analysts are modeling, and even bigger than the $1.86B analysts were modeling last quarter.And the important takeaway from the above information is Snap's market cap still stands at somewhere around $16B, even with the rapid fall in the stock. Or in other words, about 20X 2017 revenue, and about 14X 2018 revenue.I'm sorry folks, this is still a grossly overvalued stock anyway you look at it. So while I'm reiterating my $7.40 price target, I might be too generous.In the conference call the CEO announced Snapchat is working on a significant app overhaul, even though it might be disruptive to Snap's business in the short term.First of all, he is right about it being disruptive. However disruptive for who? I see the following risks:User engagement risk: Users who have been using Snap's app, suddenly have to get acquainted with the new app. That might stall user growth.Advertising revenue risk: Advertisers have to figure out the new app from scratch. That might cause advertisers to refrain from opening money.So while I don't doubt management thinks the new design will be better, in the short term there are many risks involved, both on the revenue and user engagement front.My beef is not with the app, or even management, but with the fact that Snap is still a very expensive stock. In addition, given that revenue growth has not been what everyone was hoping for, the risks to the downside for Snap shares have increased.I'm therefore reiterating my $7.40 price target fro Snap shares, but please note even this figure might be too high.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4122319,22148,2017-11-08T13:07:42-05:00,Snap missed Q3 estimates as expected.The lack of user growth is a major problem with mounting losses.Continue to avoid the stock.,"Based on the news of cutting staff to start of October, my investment thesis reiterated a bearish view on Snap (SNAP). The social networking stock was not in a position to support a change in growth mode and the market shouldn't be surprised that the Q3 results disappointed. The stock is plunging after hours and the numbers don't suggest any reason to look for a bottom here. The limited sequential DAU growth combined with massive losses set up Snap for major problems down the road. The company has proven no way to mirror ad revenue with the current costs to operate the business. For Q3, Snap saw revenues only grow 63% over last year to $208 million. While the headline number sounds impressive, the social company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $179 million and missed revenue estimates by $29 million.The company grew revenues extremely fast, but still ended up generating massive losses and burning cash at an alarming rate of $559 million for the YTD period. Snap burned roughly $194 million during the quarter from operations alone and an incredible $220 million when counting the $26 million spent on capital expenditures. A noticeable point on the operating costs is that retrained spending on sales and marketing has been met with decelerated growth. Snap only spent $71 million in the last quarter and DAU growth is stalling big time. Source: Snap Q3'17 presentation The company only grow DAUs by more than 4.5 million in the last quarter and suggests that total DAUs could be maxed out soon. The key European market saw from DAUs from Q2 while a big part of the growth came from the ROW that has little ad value. Snap only has 178 million users each day, but the success of Instagram (FB) to copy successful products limits the ability of the company to grow. Source: Snap Q3'17 presentation Snap earned $1.17 in revenue per user in Q3 while losing adjusted EBITDA of roughly $1.00 per DAU. In essence, the company has to double revenues per user while maintaining costs at the current levels. A really concerning trend is that hosting costs per DAU continue to rise. Instead of reaching a level of scale where costs plummet, Snap actually grew costs to $0.68 per user, up from only $0.61 in the prior quarter and above prior year levels. Investors have no reason to believe Snap will improve operations based on the limited cuts to expenses. The company has missed revenue targets in all three quarters since going public and constantly hints at problems with ad products. The company has constantly spent based on irrational targets. The key investor takeaway is that Snap has limited value with the massive losses and cash flows. Even after the dip, the social stock has an incredible market value of $15 billion. Snap has considerable downside risk as user growth stalls and revenues miss estimates while so far from being profitable. Investors should expect more costs cuts to hit the stock even further."
4122515,92586,2017-11-08T16:11:42-05:00,"I'm impressed by how Snap's under-performance continues to catch investors and analysts by surprise.I established a usage, monetization and margin benchmark for Snap back in March. The company is as far as ever from achieving those milestones.Investing in SNAP is throwing good money after bad money, and I believe only short-term trading gains can be achieved with this stock.","If ""Snap Inc. (SNAP) is a camera company"", as the company's investor relations page claims it to be, then take a picture of the stock now. It may not be around for very long.Credit: Windows ClubIrony aside, I'm impressed by how Snap's under-performance continues to catch investors and analysts by surprise. Anecdotally, the recent IPO smelled funny to me as soon as Snap disclosed in its initial SEC filings, even if interpreted to be tongue-in-cheek in nature, that ""the company may never be profitable"". CEO Evan Spiegel didn't ease my concerns when he stated that ""bigger isn't better"", while I firmly believed (and still do) that scale is the only feasible path for Snap to ever achieve success in this space dominated by titans like Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB) and its sidekick Instagram, only to name a few of the main players and ignoring the threat from giants like Apple (AAPL). Read my article on this subject for a more in-depth discussion.Back in March of this year, I naively proposed that Snap could produce the results necessary to support its stock price in the long term if the company reached a series of usage, monetization and margin milestones. For example, despite a slowdown in the sequential growth of its DAU (daily active users) base early in 2017, I believed that improving the rate to +5% and keeping it at those levels for the following 15 quarters or so would be recommended. Instead, Snap delivered a +2.9% quarter-on-quarter increase last night that was unimpressive at best, after achieving a better but still insufficient +4.2% in 2Q17.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsOn monetization, ARPU (average revenue per user) increased to a historical high of $1.17 in 3Q17. But that figure also fell below my expectation of $1.19. In the longer term (i.e. by the end of 2020), I have been supporting that an ARPU of $3.00 would be necessary for Snap to reach scale profitably. However, that mark seems far from the company's reach for now.The only decent news worth celebrating in Snap's 3Q17 results was the sequential decline in operating expenses. General and administrative, for example, shrank at a double-digit rate for the first time, to $66 million. Sales and marketing inched higher, while R&D remained largely stable quarter over quarter despite having increased two-fold YOY. As a result, adjusted EBITDA fell mostly within expectations, despite revenues having missed consensus estimates by the widest margin in Snap's short history as a public company.Source: company's slide presentationI have previously commended Evan Spiegel and his team for breaking ground with innovative platform features (e.g. Stories and augmented reality), and for making the big wigs in the industry follow the lead of a young, six-year old tech company. But in the same breath, I have also argued that Snap could not successfully raise effective barriers to protect its platform from competition. When Facebook's annual R&D budget ($7.4 billion on a trailing-twelve month basis) is nearly 17 times larger than Snap's total revenues for the year, the small fish will likely fall prey to the large, well-funded sharks that are much better equipped to dominate the space.Add to the market challenges the fact that SNAP IPO'd at astonishingly rich valuations, given the under-developed fundamentals (which must have made a few bankers and early private investors very happy). The table below compares SNAP and FB when they first started trading publicly. Notice how the latter was born a public company much more mature, highly profitable, with a more robust user base in place and monetization efforts already bearing fruit. Yet, SNAP was valued at a much richer EV/sales, EV/op profits (in fact negative then and now) and market cap-to-DAU multiples, suggesting increased downside risk to shareholders that chose to jump in at the $17/share IPO price.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from SEC.govToday, I continue to hold my views that investing in SNAP is throwing good money after bad money. Sure, the stock has been so volatile that short-term gains could be snatched by the more astute and risk-seeking trader. In fact, I would not rule out a dead-cat bounce on takeover or other speculations, after shares dipped nearly -20% during Wednesday's trading. But as a long-term play, I believe SNAP is dead in the water.I suggest potential investors considering a buy on the dip approach the stock with extreme caution, along with easy access to the ""sell"" button.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

Since the firm went public earlier this year, its prior two earnings reports were both disasters, and investors were hoping that Q3 would finally show some positive progress. Unfortunately, the situation remains quite terrible, which likely will send shares to new lows.The company came in with revenues of $208 million, which represented 62% growth over the prior year period. Unfortunately, analyst estimates called for more than $30 million more than that, and going into the Q2 report, the street was looking for $272 million in Q3 (112% growth). In fact, if we go all the way back in early May, the average estimate called for almost $296 million! There is no way you can say this was a good number.It wasn't any better on the daily active user front, with the company reporting just a 4.5 million sequential increase to 178 million, while the street was hoping to see closer to 180 million. User growth was up 17% year over year, but that's a slowdown of roughly 400 basis points. When you can't grow your user base at a decent rate, advertisers don't come in, and that's clearly being reflected in the company's top line.Despite revenues increasing sequentially by $26 million, the overall GAAP net loss was just a tiny bit higher at $443.16 million. For every dollar in revenues produced, the company actually lost $2.13. A portion of this loss was related to a nearly $40 million inventory charge for the company's spectacles product, which by all accounts were not selling well. Perhaps the only good news in this report was that the non-GAAP loss per share came in at $0.14, a penny better than expected. That still translated to a $168 million non-GAAP loss.The main reason I continue to rate this name a sell, beyond the terrible revenue picture and huge losses, is that the company continues to burn through a tremendous amount of cash. Cash burn was $220 million in Q3 and has totaled nearly $622 million in the first nine months of the year. While the company still has over $2 billion in cash, it will need to raise capital in the next year or two if it continues along this path. That's not a good situation for a company that just went public this year.In the after-hours session, Snap shares have lost more than 17% to $12.50. At their late afternoon low, this puts them only $1.05 above their 52-week low, after trading for almost $30 a share after going public. This company still has a huge problem attracting users, and with the spectacles writedown showing you product sales are bad, we saw another large revenue miss. With the company continuing to have huge losses and significant cash burn, it is likely only a matter of time before we see single digits as the future growth trajectory of this name continues to be slashed."
4122248,94846,2017-11-08T12:06:04-05:00,"Ever since Snap went public, it has been struggling to maintain the hype.With only 4.5 million new users in its Q3, Snap lags way behind its competitors.In the long run, Snap will need to get aggressive in its monetizing efforts, ensuring alongside that it does not clutter users’ space with too many ads.But Snap's journey in search for profits looks like a long one.","Incorporated in May 2012, Snap Inc.(SNAP) calls itself a “camera company”.But interestingly, when the startup went public this year, instead of competing with camera companies, it faced stiff competition from the tech and social media giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Snap was considered the second-largest tech stock IPO, behind only to Facebook and was one of the few unicorns to go public. But after its IPO, Snap’s stock price soon tumbled, falling below its IPO price of $17 per share.As Snap Inc. announced its Q3 earnings on Nov 7, 2017, all eyes were on its monetization efforts that could define the company's future strategies. But the camera company missed Wall Street's expectations.Poster earnings release, the stock fell roughly 20% in after trading hours.Here are some important indicators that the investors may want to keep in mind before including Snap in their portfolios.Snap Inc. has been spending millions in its research and development, something that is evident from its previous earnings report.In its second quarterly release this year, the company reported that it spent $255.73 million in Research and Development (R&D), which included $163.8 million related to stock-based compensation. The research and development expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation expenses for engineers and others associated with the R&D of Snap products. In its third quarterly reports, Snap's R&D fell to $239.4million.Snap does not reveal many details of its R&D spending.In the past, it has heavily promoted Spectacles, which is the closest traditional hardware camera product it has showcased. The hype remains around the technology that allows a pair of glasses to record and share videos on Snapchat. At 2017 Cannes Lions festival of creativity, Snap’s Spectacles won three golds for its youthful relevance, user experience, and aesthetic design. Spectacles connect seamlessly with Snapchat and create Memories because “they capture video from a human perspective”.But the product has failed to resonate with the interests of many millennial – Snap’s largest demographic. Additionally, the company sits on “hundreds of thousands” of unsold glasses. IN its third quarterly report, Snap has recorded a loss of $39.9 million, related to Spectacles inventory.Photo by NeONBRAND on UnsplashThis year in June, Snap had decided on rolling out Spectacles to its users in Europe. Post Spectacles lukewarm performance, Snap may be moving towards developing a second version of video-recording glasses. The newer version could include one of Snap’s biggest strengths – Augmented Reality.So far, Snap remains a leader in the space of Augmented Reality, much ahead of its rivals like Facebook and Google and may now be using AR features to its advantage on Spectacles. In the past, Snap AR features have allowed brands to come to life, allowing users to interact with brands. With an average user spending more than three minutes, Sponsored Lenses also remains popular amongst corporate users. The latest Netflix lens remains a prime example of Snapchat's 3D World Lenses which used the lens ahead of its hit show, Stranger Things. A lot of what Snap does is owed to its past and recent acquisitions.The most recent AR art feature of Snap stems from its quiet merger with Israeli based firm, Cimagine, which showcases works of artists including pop artist Jeff Koons.Mergers and acquisitions by Snap are not surprising since the 'camera company' has been quite clear about its strategy to monetize advertising.In Snap's S-1, the firm mentioned:According to sources cited by TechCrunch, Snap recently acquired Metamarkets and will most likely reveal more on its acquisitions in its latest earnings report.Snap Q2 reported $181.6 million in revenue, and losses were largely from advertising. In Q3, Snap showcased revenues of $207.9 million - much below Wall Street's expectations. The company's losses have grown quicker than its revenues.Snap's acquisitions could allow the company to boost its advertising revenues but so far the performance of Snap looks dismal. ITs recent acquisition, Metamarkets is an ad tech startup and could allow advertisers to view data through interactive visualizations.This year, Snap also confirmed with TechCrunch that it had acquired a startup called Placed- that would help in tracking the offline success of digital ad campaigns. Placed has partner platforms like PayPal and Pandora attached with it. The association could boost the confidence of advertisers that use Snap as a primary advertising platform.For Snap, monetizing of business is done primarily through advertising products like Snap Ads and Sponsored Creative Tools that include Sponsored Lens and Sponsored Geofilters.But interestingly, Snap’s advertising business has been in early stages.Though Snap has obsessed users, they are clearly not converting Snap into a cash cow.The user engagement for the ads has not been enough to trigger Snap’s stock price, which remains at $14.83, way below its IPO price of $17.In Q2, Snap added 7.3 million daily active users with a 4.2 percent growth rate reaching 173 million. The user growth was slower than the first quarter that recorded 166 million DAU. But in Q3, the user growth has been dismal. Adding only 4.5 million new users, Snap has failed to generate and draw a huge audience. As reported in Q3, its daily active users are 178 million, a number much small when compared to the 500 million of its closest competitor, Instagram.SNAP data by YChartsIn 2016, Facebook launched the stories feature on Instagram, which became one of the biggest reasons for Snap’s slow user growth. One big factor for a low engagement user growth is that Snap has no exclusive feature and even if it did, the switch from Instagram to Snap is clearly not happening. The aggressive competition from Instagram remains a huge roadblock for Snap's slowed user growth.Following Snap’s IPO, Instagram has also quickened its process of introducing features that closely resembles Snap’s – all in an attempt to generate more users. With 1.37 billion daily active users on average for June 2017, Facebook is clearly engaging its users by integrating its internal platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.For investors, Snap’s average revenue [generated] per user or ARPU is an important measure to gauge at when looking for Snap’s revenue growth. Last quarter, Snap’s ARPU fell 14% consecutively to less than a dollar.Improvement in this metric could remain crucial to Snap and its investors.Data hosting for companies like Facebook and Snap comes with a considerable cost.With a few months in as a public company, such costs could remain a growing concern for Snap. With a spending of $2 billion spread across five years, Snap relies on Google cloud for the vast majority of its computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.Snap booked only about $330 million in ad revenue in the first half of this year. In other words, it’s paying more than half of its revenue to Google. In Q3 of 2017, Snap disclosed that its hosting costs per DAU were $0.68 this quarter, compared to $0.64 in the third quarter a year ago.Snap also uses Amazon Web Services at the cost of $1 billion in a five-year deal, as mentioned in its updated S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The firm mentions,In the first half of the year, the cost of revenue for Snap showed an increase of 85%, amounting to an increase of $145million. A major portion of this cost was owed to $63.5 million that were related to increased hosting costs.Snap's journey in search of profits is a long one and even though the company has strong promises on Augmented Reality in the future, its stiff competition from Facebook and high costs should not be overlooked.Additionally, Snap's user growth remains a growing concern and if the company tries to put in more advertisements for its users, there may be a switch to better platforms with fewer ads. A balance remains crucial for Snap at this point.Snap's financial performance in first half of the year has done little for its stock performance and its third quarterly report just adds more worries for the company's future. Any investment in Snap should be slow and done with extreme caution."
4122099,76115,2017-11-08T09:00:00-05:00,"Snap reported unsurprising numbers considering the last two quarters of disappointment.The narrative this time is everything must change including Snapchat itself.Changing it's OS targeting, target demographic, and app all at once as advertisers are still getting their feet wet is poor management.This really sounds like a potential turnaround play . as an IPO!","Snap (SNAP) announced earnings on Tuesday with more of the same as the prior two quarters - more losses, more underwhelming growth, and more narrative. But, the theme on the conference call was about change - changing everything. There is so much I could talk about based on the discussion from the conference call alone but I want cover what may be the most damaging to the company moving forward.The conference call was predominately about how the company will change just about everything it does. CEO Evan Spiegel talked about the low growth of users means the company must move into other regions of the world, go after Android users, and go after users over the age of 34. This means the app must be redesigned in order to become everything to everyone.It wasn't long ago when Snap's CEO was talking about how Android phones are the reason for slowing user growth. The key point in that article was from an investor who agreed with the CEO saying, ""the story will be monetization, in terms of the North America and Europe user base..."" It turns out the growth in users and monetization of those users is not happening the way it should.Combine that narrative with this quarter's conference call and you see a backtracking management team. Considering the company should be doing both of these things quite well this early on, it's a telling sign when narrative flipping is taking place - all within 9 months!The worst part is the one thing which was considering the most offensive part to growth now must be tackled head on. What does it say about your roadmap when it has been determined the only way to grow is to go after the thing which was targeted as hampering growth?Aside from this small fact is the issue of paying for this redesign and scope expansion of the app. After burning $559M in cash so far this year and on track to burn close to $744M the entire year, there isn't much time left to pivot the app to something more user and non-teenager friendly before cash runs out. This also concedes the app as it currently stands is not attractive enough for users beyond the current millennial demographic - a demographic which is clearly failing Snap on growth.What's to say this push for those over the age of 34 won't alienate the current core user base of 13-34? This is an admission by Snap management this young, mostly teen demographic is not continuing to pile on and, more importantly, not able to be monetized as first thought.Evan talked about performance, quality, and automation - the three priorities for this year. It seems the first two may be for naught if the company is now going to redesign the app and redesign its approach to feeding users with content. What good is the performance and quality of the app today when tomorrow it will be thrown out? Sure, there are things you can learn from the old and continue to do well in the new but this is simply a case of unfocused objectives and poor execution on management's part.But so far this is the effect of the user experience and the app itself; I haven't gotten to how terrible this will be for advertiser momentum. Advertisers at this point are not committed to advertising on Snap simply because it's still too new and unproven of a platform. I can work with this since every app needs to start somewhere with its business model and prove itself to customers. The part which should strike fear into anyone invested or looking to invest in Snap is advertisers will have to start over in a sense. A redesign can change everything - from user experience to user retention to marketing campaigns. What may have worked in the current app may not be effective in the redesigned app.With advertisers just now getting up to speed on the self-serve ad tools, it's the worst time to say, ""it's time for a change; it's just not working out on the user growth front."" Advertisers are understandably putting only experimental budgets toward Snap due to the new nature of the ad platform so for the company to set expectations for a redesign surely means advertising will need to be tested all over again - both from a user perspective and from an advertiser dollar perspective.There's just too much change planning to happen all at once. Management seems to be in a bit of a quiet panic, otherwise sequential, marked changes would suffice to keep Snap on the leading edge. Instead, management is going after a ton of changes all at once after realizing much of its plans have not spurred the growth on the top line or in the daily user column.If you were thinking the hardware side of Snap in its Spectacles could buoy the company in the meantime you'll be sorely disappointed. As many expected, Spectacles has not been a smash hit. Instead the company used this quarter to take a $39.9M write-down on inventory and purchase cancellation charges.It's clear Spectacles has not taken off and Spiegel said as much in the Q&A portion of the call when he admitted his expectations and enthusiasm for the glasses were misplaced as the company's level of investment in ordering hardware was a mistake. This piles on top of the company's other misreadings in direction, demographics, and ad platform. And while it's $40M in ""oopsies"" today, it could be $400M in bad investments toward a redesign tomorrow.The quarter for Snap was not only dismal on a revenue front, a user growth front, and a hardware front but the narrative for changing the foundation of the app itself is the worst news yet. While most may say change is good in this case in order to reinvigorate growth to drive users and advertisers to the platform, this management team has shown it is not visionary and unable to execute.There's still no incentive to put money toward an investment in Snap as the company has not proven it's capable of the massive amount of growth needed to offset a massive investment in its core app. While I think management has come to face reality and has fallen away from the arrogant attitude it had just six months prior, there's no evidence it's able to execute what is seemingly an IPO turnaround - a concept which says it all.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Snap, along with other tech and social media companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name.I discussed Snap earnings in real-time with my subscribers and evaluated the merits of different strategies to profit on Snap's movements prior to the release.

4121403,103672,2017-11-06T20:52:37-05:00,"At around just $15 per share, Snap is a stock priced with large upside potential, yet crucial factors will continue to restrict the stock.Facebook, through its acquired platform Instagram, is completely unapologetic about replicating Snapchat's features, and it's doing wonders for the company.Snap's advertising approach is intrinsically flawed based on the nature of the app itself, and advertisers are well aware of this.Snap is the right company at the wrong time; it's 2017, and the tech market is too competitive for a company with a flawed business plan to prosper.","In a year screaming for an IPO, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) seemed to many a godsend. Especially given at face value everything about this company screamed tech unicorn ready to leap sky-high, yet Snap’s reality is much more complicated and, unfortunately, far less promising.Snap blew up with its revolutionary messaging approach, taking elements of Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) platform and utilizing them in a way previously unseen. The introduction of stories was another innovation that propelled it from exciting start-up to a seriously promising company. Most companies are lucky to have one USP; two could take a business to the very top of its industry. Yet, newly public tech companies like LinkedIn (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), for example, faced no real threat to their respective USPs in their first 2 or 3 years post IPO. Snap’s IPO was just 8 months ago and it had been facing serious competitive pressure for almost 8 months prior.When Facebook implemented its own version of stories last august on Instagram, Snap’s daily usage growth slowed from 17% in Q2 2016 to just 3.2% by Q4 2016, and for the first time to date, its quarterly revenue actually decreased by 9.5% in Q1 2017. Now, granted Snap’s quarterly revenue was much improved for Q2 2017, at $181.6 million, yet this was an underperformance based on Street expectations that were set at $186 million. Furthermore, as of the most recent quarter, Snap’s overall daily usage has grown by 30 million YOY, whilst over a shorter time period, October '16 to May '17, Instagram’s daily usage grew by 300 million users; this is especially concerning for Snap when considering that Street expectations for Snapchat’s user growth were at 175 million, whilst it only managed 173 million. This is an overwhelming comparison between the platforms, especially considering Instagram’s user growth has particularly taken off since the introduction of Stories. The severe impact this has had on Snap can be seen in Facebook's most recent earnings call, where Zuckerberg announced both WhatsApp Status and Instagram Stories now have over 300 million DAUs, whilst Snap has 173 million DAUs on its entire platform, let alone just stories.The replications don’t stop there either. As well as stories, Facebook has seemingly introduced its own versions of Geo filters, picture drawing tools and even early stages of implementing its own disappearing picture messaging service all onto Instagram, the latter of which, ironically titled Instagram Direct, has already amassed an active user base of 375 million, more than twice the Snapchat’s total user base. Consensus forecasts for Snap’s total 2017 revenue are at $886.25 million, which would be more than double its 2016 annual revenue of $404 million. Yet, neither of these totals even comes close to Street revenue expectations for Instagram of close to $1.5 billion and a projected $5 billion total in 2018.Overwhelming pressure from Facebook is certainly reflected in Snap’s financial metrics. Literally all share price/fundamental comparison metrics indicate a poor sentiment and a potentially overinflated stock price even at current levels. The social media tech sector P/E ratio average of 15.99 makes Snap’s -27.89 a particularly ugly metric for potential new investors. However, based on the fact Snap is yet to post positive net results, the company's price-to-sales ratio is a more coherent reflection of its intrinsic value, at 29.47, indicating investors are taking into consideration that Snap should be priced closer to its IPO high of $30. Yet, despite this, there is little to justify such valuations other than overconfidence in a young tech start-up without understanding the extent of overbearing competition it faces, as ultimately Snap’s greatest assets are its USPs, which seemingly lose value every day.(Source: TechCrunch)For me, this is the most complex and difficult issue for Snap to try and overcome. The entire nature of the app cripples the potential for substantial advertising revenue. As soon as an ad pops up after a Story, the user can make it disappear in under a second by tapping the screen. The key aspect here is marketing exposure, and when comparing Snap’s approach to that of Instagram, Facebook or YouTube, it's clear to see it's heavily outgunned.Instagram’s approach centers on advertising products through celebrities and users with large followings, so if users’ favorite stars love a product, they have to get it, manipulating the psychology of younger demographics perfectly with simple marketing. And although Snap also has a high following of users who model and market products to their viewership, the nature of the app once again means users can be rid of the tedious advert in under a second; whilst for Instagram users, they can look elsewhere on the explore screen and news feed, but the picture will still be visible, as well as consistent sponsorship picture allocations tailored to the users' activity on the app. For every couple of posts on Facebook, there’s an ad for products tailored to the user's search history, once again giving Facebook an advantage over Snap in another crucially competitive area. As for Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) through YouTube, there’s an ad before almost every popular video on the site and the user has to wait at least 5 seconds to skip it, so that’s 5 more seconds of product exposure then Snap gets.Granted, I’m basing my argument heavily on Snap’s competition, but ultimately, the ability to win users over from competitors is how companies grow. Reflecting this, in early September, Deutsche analyst Lloyd Walmsley released a note stating many advertisers are still unwilling to allocate themselves to Snap’s advertising platform, as Instagram remains a preferential and more efficient platform, causing him to downgrade Snap and lower revenue estimations for the remainder of 2017. To further add fuel to the uncompromising fire, as if that were needed, eMarketer revised its initial expectations for Snap’s 2017 ad revenue of $935.5 million to $774.1 million. This reduction of $160.5 million is no safety net for an overshot expectation. With the Street consensus sitting at $886.25 million, such a reduction is indicative of a realisation that Snap’s revenue potential is near its ceiling, with the nature of the app continuing to restrict the company regardless of user growth or engagement. Spiegel and Co. would need to work hard and heavily fund a restructuring program to their advertising approach in order to reduce the gap between the company and competitors.SNAP data by YChartsSpiegel and Co. are clearly aware of the threat that Facebook pose for a while now, given their efforts to further innovate and potentially develop a new USP. Some of such features have showed promise and hold potential. The Discovery section, introduced in 2015, has drawn a large amount of interest due to the wide range of the world’s most popular news channels and the fact that short news segments are perfectly suited to the millennial love of absolute convenience. As well as this, the Paperclip feature is a very effective way of maintaining the user base, as it creates a transparency between the app and the internet, as it allows users to send website links which can be accessed through the app. This has also aided the company's aforementioned advertising problem in that consumers can now directly access the website links of advertised products and services through the app.Both of these features are great add-ons for existing users, but is either of these features alone likely to attract mass amounts of new users? In short, not really. Although Snap has a great feature in Discovery, it doesn’t seem to have captivated Twitter’s audience as the primary social media platform for news updates quite to the extent they would’ve liked too, given that Twitter has still been able to grow active users by 6.49% since Discovery was introduced. To make the matters even more difficult for Snap, as of the start of August, Facebook introduced its replication of the feature titled ""Watch"", which literally mirrors the design of Snap’s Discovery, but instead of using it for the same purpose, Facebook has jumped one step ahead and used the feature for presenting original content, an area where Snap has heavily invested. The first shows released have, for the large part, been very short (3-5 minutes) - including MLB content, popular vlogger content, as well as the cooking show Tastemade. This is particularly concerning for Snap when considering the content it is set to produce will be almost exclusively 3-5 minutes long, giving Facebook not only the audience advantage but also the potentially priceless advantage in getting there first.As for other innovations such as the Snap Map and Snap Spectacles, the less said the better. The lack of success of Spectacles is hardly surprising, which was reflected in Snap’s ""other revenues"", predominately made up by Spectacles sales, falling from $8.3 million to $5.1 million by Q2, as just an approximate 41,500 were sold. Ultimately, it's a novelty consumable with a lack of appeal to the vast majority of Snap’s audience. Anyone that uses the app has a smartphone, and anyone with a smartphone in 2017 automatically has a pretty decent camera - so why would a teenager want to spend $130 on something when their phones do the exact same function and is where the rest of their lives are? I held this view when this was first announced, and I still do now.Snap Map went far beyond just the fact of not being a hit success, as the feature caused worldwide controversy upon release. With the whole concept of the feature being able to see exactly where your friends on the app are at all times, widespread concerns of user safety were raised. Considering the majority of Snap's user base is teenagers or younger users, this obviously raised real concerns from parents over their children’s safety. Such a tainted view almost completely undermines the commercial potential of the feature.(Source: OfficeChai)As part of what is becoming a tech arms race between the industry’s biggest companies, original television streaming is one of the most sought after sectors in the market. Thus, it’s clear to see why Snap would want to invest into such an area, especially given that Facebook is also heavily invested. Personally, I see investment into this area within the blueprint of short-length shows as a real positive sign from Snap’s management, as it’s a clear sense that it's beginning to understand who exactly constitutes the user base, with 83.8% being between the ages 12-17.This is an age demographic that has grown up with the Internet and apps like Facebook, YouTube, etc. And thus, it is an age group with the embedded characteristic of short attention spans. A study conducted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information in 2015 showed that the average time spent watching online videos is just 2 minutes and 42 seconds. Given that the vast majority of people who watch online videos are within Snap's primary audience, original content of such short length would clearly appeal to them. Deals like the $100 million Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) content agreement announced in June, as well as an agreement to present content from Disney (NYSE:DIS), are really promising signs for Snap.But as the company’s biggest content deal by far, there’s a clear discrepancy between Snap’s audience interests and tendencies and the type of shows Time Warner is known for. HBO and Turner Broadcasting are TWX's two biggest networks. HBO is renowned for popular shows such as Game of Thrones, The Wire, Westworld, etc. - lengthy, sophisticated shows with episodes that have never shied short of 45 minutes, which is why their audience consists of older demographics, not 12-17-year olds. And even when it's attempted to produce shorter-length shows, say a show like Ballers, which runs for 25 minutes on average per episode, it has come under scrutiny for the plot being confusing, with too much unexplained context in very short episodes. As for the older demographic, it’s very likely that they would already be fans of a network like HBO, so why bother downloading an app just to see 3-5 minute snapshot versions of their favorite shows when they already pay for an HBO subscription? It’s clear that HBO isn't well suited to Snapchat’s nature.Turner holds more promise in that its primary shows are NBA-oriented. So from that perspective, the deal with Time Warner could materialize. The deal with Disney is, for me, the most promising, with channels such as Kids Network, Disney Channel, as well as the content capabilities of Marvel shows being able to directly appeal to Snap’s core demographic. But regardless of the intricacies, by entering the original content market, the company is entering a very saturated market with very tough and established competitors: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hulu, Alphabet (through YouTube), to name a few, and I doubt Snap has the resources to produce shows to compete with such tech titans. Snap would need its network companies to bring substantial innovative qualities to their short shows in order to attract vast new users from competitors, and given the quality of shows produced on competitors' platforms, it would be a very tough feat, to say the least.With the stock trading at $15 per share, I struggle to see the argument for ""huge upside potential"" as justified. When it comes down to Snap versus Instagram, it’s very easy to differentiate: Snapchat is a picture messaging service with popular interest features, Instagram is social status. For users, Instagram posts are social currency - the more likes they get, the more liked/popular/attractive they are - thus why users only post pictures at certain times of the day to gain the most attention or to make sure their accounts are following less people than the number that follow them. Snap has no such established features, and the one it did - the viewable Best Friends feature - the company removed some time ago, only to replace it with an underappreciated ""emoji"" substitute.Ultimately, the most important focus for the company right now is to healthily grow revenue, yet continuing to miss Street expectations will only disillusion the remaining Snap longs keeping the ship afloat for now. Perhaps with two revenue and net loss misses to date, expectations will be lowered and pressure will be relieved, but fundamentally, that isn’t enough to inject prosperity into the company’s outlook - the reality is far too daunting. Snap has upside potential, and with a revamped ad approach, a well-coordinated and planned introduction of original series, and perhaps the introduction of its own social page/account feature, it could achieve such potential. Yet, with its Q3 earnings announcement on Tuesday, any poor ad revenue or user growth results will likely send the share price tumbling and diminish the bottom buy resurgence that has kept Snap afloat since August.From a long-term perspective, I don’t see much promise for Snap with the potentially unconquerable issues it faces. A share price of around $10/11 seems justified at this stage, and looking forward, I would advise investors to steer clear of the stock until a price is presented that can be justified by promising progressions in the aforementioned areas."

Why write a report, whether long or short, when the result is that you are thrust into the receiving end of an endless stream of toxic engagement? Many of these comment sections are denuded of any real enlightened criticism. These comments amount to what I believe are a declaration to the world that one was either long or short the stock, as if such actions would will the stock in ones favor.As an investor, my goal is to develop opinions and to make a calculated bet on the value of an organization. Accordingly, I have no interest in holding an incorrect or incomplete opinion any longer than I have to. It is very human to instinctively double down on one’s position when confronted with opposing views. However, this does little to enrich your bank account. Crowdsourcing our knowledge and resources to get an edge over the market is an incredibly valuable approach. And if I encounter new facts that are in opposition to my own, you can expect me to dispassionately walk back any inaccuracies or adopt any additional views that I have overlooked.Snap has been analyzed to death. However, I'm going to try and perform an exorcism on this organization and the bulls and bears who follow it. My intention is to be as charitable and honest as possible to both the long and short views, so that neither crowd can find fault in my analysis. Please understand that I expect to make mistakes, and that it is impossible for me to have a truly complete understanding of the organization. I welcome you to point out any errors, and seal any cracks that I have left open so that we can all converge on the best investment decision for Snap.There are a few key drivers that will ultimately be the main contributors to the success or failure of Snap.DAUsSnapchat’s DAUs have been growing at an impressive rate since 2014, however, DAU growth has dramatically slowed down since Q3 of 2016. This large and sustained contraction in growth was no doubt due to the launch of Instagram stories on August 2, 2016. The pattern was similar across all regions, so I decided to share only the global DAU growth metrics.Source: S-1 and 10-q filingssource: recodeThe company has attempted to explain away the recent slowdown in DAUs by claiming that it was due to bad product updates – the impact was apparently more pronounced with Android users. Although the company does cover competition as a risk in their S-1 filing, they did not bother to reference it with respect to DAUs in the earnings call. This is clearly misleading.Social media companies are in an arms race for capturing our attention. This battle is zero sum, and users have to allocate their time between these platforms. This is especially true between Snapchat stories and Instagram stories, given their similarities.There are several reasons why Instagram stories has proven to be a worthwhile competitor to Snapchat stories, irrespective of the fact that it still lacks some of the features on Snapchat (discover/shows).Instagram makes it rather easy to find and add contacts. Users have access to all their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) friends, phone contacts and they also have access to suggested users to follow. In order to add your friends on Snapchat, one needs to either have their number, their snapcode, or their Snapchat URL. These options do not allow for much scalability of friends and viewership. When using Snapchat one has to write a user's name perfectly and in full in order to find them. Typing in a user or influencer's real name does not pull up the individual unless they are a verified user (of which there are few). I also will note that it is a bit of a chore attempting to find particular influencers on Snapchat. In fact, there is a website called Snapdex that was started earlier this year to make this easier. Instagram on the other hand has been quite diligent at verifying influencer, celebrity and brand accounts.Snapchat historically ignored the value that influencers and celebrities have had on generating users on the platform. Some influencers have received the message that, “Snapchat is an app for friends, not creators,"" when telling management that they were thinking of leaving the platform. Others have been literally turned away at the door. Snap has, within the past month, changed their tune and has begun to reach out to influencers. While this is a step in the right direction, one wonders how spurned users will respond.Some influencers on the platform make a living posting branded content and require further analytics regarding their marketing strategies. Snap does not have such tools, nor has it been attentive to creating them. In fact, some influencers will set alarms for 23 hours and 59 minutes after taking a post to remember to take a screenshot of the number of viewers. UEG claims it receives many screen shots when working with influencers, because it is important for them to have a comparison with how they spend their dollars. While some view Snap’s behavior as a careless error, many believe this is a careful and well intentioned strategic decision in order to create a “friends-and-family” feel that will differentiate it from rivals. There is an inherent paradox of Snap, in that it wants to create a culture of privacy and authenticity yet wants to claim that it provides a better ROI for advertisers. The downfall of Vine also was as a result of a lack of analytics and support from the platform. Consider the value of maintaining such a strategy.Instagram on the other hand has provided “Instagram Insights” so that users can access basic stats for assessing ones Instagram marketing efforts. Many influencers have expressed much more opportunity and interest from Instagram to help them improve their marketing efforts. In addition to this, Instagram has a heavy presence at VidCon, the influencer conference in Anaheim, California. Snapchat does not send executives to the event.The influencer marketing agency, Mediakix, recently did a 30-day study on influencers’ use of Snapchat vs Instagram stories in February and August of this year. They found that of the 12 top social media influencers they tracked, they published 2x more Instagram stories than Snapchat stories, there was 14% growth in Instagram stories published in six months, and there was a 33% decline in Snapchat Stories published in six months.I wanted to test this out on my own, so I did some analysis on whether influencers who are using both platforms publish their content on either Snapchat or Instagram. I performed this analysis over ten days. Oct 11 – October 20. I tracked the amount of users who posted more content on either their Instagram or Snapchat accounts on each day. Although the study was only done for 10 days, I believe its insights are useful because it directly analyzed how influencers chose to allocate their time and attention given two similar and competing platforms in Snapchat and Instagram.My first set included influencers from Snapchat as suggested from business insider and Izea. I only kept those individuals that had both an Instagram and Snapchat account.The data, although showing similar usage across platforms, was slightly more skewed towards Snapchat which was not what I was expecting given my research. I expected Instagram stories to be used consistently more than Snapchat stories across the length of the study.source: my own analysisMy second set included influencers from Instagram as suggested by Forbes. I only kept those individuals that had both an Instagram and Snapchat account.source: my own analysisInstagram usage against Snapchat usage among these users was considerably high. Much fewer influencers decided to publish more content on their Snapchat account versus Instagram Stories.  Interesting to note that most users were not attempting to simply copy and paste content from one app to the other. Content made for Instagram stories was generally only for Instagram stories, and content made for Snapchat stories was generally only for Snapchat stories.The one thing I will draw from this study is that among Snapchat influencers, there still remains interest in publishing content between both platforms. It seems as though this is true despite the lack of interest Snap has shown to influencers. Given that the numbers are fairly close, I may do a second study in the future to see how influencer behavior changed over time, similar to Mediakix.Whatever the studies have shown, it is true that for those users who value celebrities or influencers, they will reliably be drawn towards the platform on which those influencers publish. It will remain an important practice to analyze how these influencers are adjusting their publishing habits among competing platforms in order to recognize the opportunity or lack thereof in DAU growth.Irrespective of the DAU slowdown, the company does not seem concerned with user growth because they believe that revenue growth is not reliant on it. Instead, they believe that the nature of Snapchat's platform and the higher engagement they have with their users will allow Snapchat to sell their ads at a premium to a Facebook or an Instagram.source: recodeSnapchat’s user engagement has grown over the past few quarters. Snapchat’s users currently spend about 33 minutes a day. For Instagram users, those younger than 25 spend “more than 32 minutes a day” on the app, while those older than 25 “spend more than 24 minutes a day” on the app. Snapchat’s user base is more skewed toward the younger generation.One surprising thing that I have uncovered about Snapchat is that many of their younger users actually use Snapchat as a communications app. This means, rather than sending texts or using WhatsApp, they are primarily using Snapchat. What's interesting here is that 60% of DAUs post Snaps every day, while 25% of DAUs post snaps to their story everyday. Spiegel has stated that they will never publish ads within their chat service, since “it’s creepy.” This is likely a wise strategy, however, it also suggests that a considerable amount of content is not monetizable. Richard Greenfield from BTIG noticed this discrepancy and questioned Evan Speigel in the Q2 earnings call without receiving a clear answer.It also is useful to notice that just because users are posting content everyday, it does not necessarily mean that they are more amenable to advertising and as a result, higher ARPUs. It is instructive to recognize that historically, the majority of ad viewers have been passive content consumers. Radio, television and film audiences all apply there. Facebook and Instagram likely follow the 1-9-90 rule (not precisely) in which the majority of their content is created by 1% of the users, 9% of users are commenters and raters and 90 percent of users are lurkers. Think about Seeking Alpha’s contributors and readers. The contributors have to be on average more engaged with the service, but does that mean that contributors are more likely to purchase the products in the ads? I do not necessarily believe that high publisher metrics encourage an increase in ARPU.There also is a phenomenon of younger Instagram users creating “Finstagram” accounts. These are fake Instagram accounts where people post funny and embarrassing photos that would not make it on to their real Instagram. One wonders what the actual percentage of users are actually engaging in this activity and potentially increasing DAUs. From my research it does not seem widespread.The discover feature includes ads in-between content. These ad revenue from this feature has been shared with publishers on a percentage basis, however, Snap has attempted to change this agreement to a fixed fee. The S-1 filing says that they still have a revenue share strategy in place. The ads can either be sold by the publishers or by Snap itself. Snap records ads they sell in the discover tab in full and record the publisher share as an expense. When publishers sell their ads, Snap will record their share net of costs. It will be necessary to see if Snap attempts to take more control over their ad sales and whether this may inflate revenue and costs yet return similar profits. Another way to increase the ARPU would be to create an ad platform that can target the exact type of user that would be amenable to a particular type of advertising. For example, advertising whey protein to someone who is interested in fitness or advertising toys to someone who has children. Snapchat's dogmatic stance toward privacy has forbidden them from accessing this kind of info. They do allow businesses to either upload email lists of customers and target them specifically, or using those email lists, find an audience that is a “lookalike” audience to broadcast the ad to.source: Advertising on SnapchatInstagram’s adverts manager is considerably richer. The dials that can be pulled to narrow down ones audience are census like. For example, I can find an audience of 23-25 year old men, who speak Korean and French, studied biochemistry, work at Amazon, are early technology adopters, are having a wedding anniversary within the next 61-90 days and who do not have a special affinity for yoga. This kind of granularity is absurd. As it stands, Snapchat has no way of developing an ad product that is comparable without considerably walking back their culture and views regarding privacy.source: Instagram Business According to Digiday, buyers say that the cost for ads on Instagram Stories is about $3-$4 CPMs (cost per 1000 impressions), and completion rates are between two and three times higher on Instagram than Snapchat. Snapchat Ads cost approximately $20-$40 depending on where the ad appears. I do not believe this pricing can be maintained given the larger viewership and the capabilities on the Instagram ad platform.Snapchat also has been offering discounts and coupons for using their ad service. The purpose in doing so was to accelerate 2017 ad revenue given the Q1 earnings miss according to some marketing agency executives. Some media buyers have received 10% discounts, while other have said that the value of the discount varies from client to client, but that Snapchat has been aggressive. Snapchat provides no guidance as to whether these sales are recorded net of the discount or including it.In many ways Snapchat has pushed themselves into an advertising backwater. I have to concede that their younger audience identifies with the app and the culture of being able to share their life in a nonjudgmental way. They have adopted a stance that Facebook is creepy, Instagram is for showing off an unrealistic life, and that Snapchat allows you to be yourself and does not try to invade your privacy. These are all great value propositions to a user, however, they do little for advertisers. Consider that Spiegel felt it was wise strategy to denounce other social media companies for “growth hacking,” which is euphemistic sanctimony for adding notifications to encourage users to check your app. Apparently this became a major issue in which he disagreed with his engineers on how to deal with the slowing user growth. Snapchat has since added notifications for when a friend posts Snaps, and it was difficult for Spiegel to explain how they decided to change course. I believe the company will continue to walk a tight rope in which they are attempting to balance user needs with advertiser needs and this gives them a disadvantage that none of their competitors are subject to.The other caveat that I will issue is that ad spending overall is still bundled up in TV. Seemingly more and more spend is moving toward the mobile segments. Snap states that mobile ad spending is likely to increase 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. Zenith believes that social media advertising will hit $50 billion by 2019. Part of Snapchat’s belief is that it will be able to capture a decent portion of this ad spend. I contend that this will remain a difficult proposition due to competition and their ability to provide ROI for advertisers.In addition to the primary drivers, there remains numerous troubling issues that should be cause for concern for any investor. I will outline these issues in no particular order.Evan SpiegelSpiegel is an interesting character and public perceptions of him generally falls between two extremes. Some believe that he is a genius product designer along the lines of Mark Zuckerburg, Steve Jobs, and Picasso. Others see a “deeply insecure” and “unbearably cocky” individual. There are accounts of Spiegel’s younger years in his parents' divorce documents as well as with leaked emails by Gawker, however, accounts of his strategies and behavior while running Snap has been equally disquieting.As CEO of Snap he retains an incredible amount of control. He has an obsession with privacy and keeps even high level executives in the dark. All decisions go through Spiegel and his decisions are final. This has led to frequent turnover of high level talent. Earlier in this report I detailed his parochial views on increasing DAU growth which resulted in arguments with his engineers. Recode claims a source said “when you go to work at Snapchat you go to work for Evan, you don’t go to teach Evan. You don’t go to show him the ropes.”He apparently fabricated his interactions with Mark Zuckerberg in a Forbes interview. Snapchat pays $890K for Evan Spiegel’s security detailed compared with $220k for Tim Cook. When asked whether he was worried about Facebook by his employees, he has often replied with one word answers, “no.” It feels as though he has set up the organization in such a way that he does not have to answer for any mistakes. Spiegel silos his work force in California among a variety of buildings, rather than encouraging communication. His employees do not recommend what competitors are doing due to fear of getting on his bad side.I will give credit to Spiegel for bringing the app to its current state and adding great features such as lenses, geofilters and the discover tab. However, investors must balance his successes with the concerns that I have detailed.Zero Voting RightsSnap has three classes of shares. Class A shares, which have no voting rights, class B shares are entitled to one vote per share, and class C shares are entitled to 10 votes per share. Together both Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy own 88.5% of the voting rights, giving them complete control over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election, removal, and replacement of directors and any merger among others. There are basically no checks and balances on their actions, and one’s investment in this company requires faith in both Spiegel and Murphy to direct it accordingly.Evan Spiegel managed to reach an agreement with his investors in 2015 which would award him 3% of the company’s outstanding shares as a bonus for IPO-ing the company (worth $800 million) with no other restrictions. This award more than replaced the $300 million of stock that Spiegel sold on the IPO. Spiegel and Murphy have control of board member seats and indirectly to the compensation committee. The opportunity to continue to award themselves excessive, unwarranted, and condition free compensation remains a major risk that investors must accept.In addition to this, the S&P 500 and FTSE Russell have decided to exclude Snap from their indices for this less than shareholder-friendly characteristic. As a result, not only is Snap missing out on ETFs that would otherwise purchase their stock as part of their indexing strategy, but also individual investors who may be less likely to purchase the stock due to the dent in their credibility. Mind you, IPO shareholders had full knowledge of this arrangement prior to investing, so the market continues to price this in however it sees fit.The lack of opportunity that is Spectacles/VR/DronesSpiegel recently pointed to the fact that Snap has sold more Spectacles (150,000) in their first year (2017) than Apple sold iPods (143,000) in their first year. It should be incredibly obvious to investors how hollow it is to claim that there is an equivalency between both products. First of all, this is hardly a comparable product. Compared with Google glasses which sold 831,000 units in 2014 as estimated by Statistica, Spectacles sales are quite disappointing. The technological differences between 2017 and 2001 that would affect the sales of such a product would likely also result in skewed results. Not to mention that Spectacles are being sold exclusively through a vending machine that remains in each location for 24 hours with limited stock, so as to encourage sales. Neither the scene at the US open nor at Westfield Mall were encouraging.source: Walt Piecyk's twitter feedsource: my own pictureAlthough I asked two Snap vending machine operators on separate occasions how many Spectacles they had left in their vending machine, the most I got out of them was “we have a handful left.” When I asked operators whether I could get their honest opinion on the product they did not want to reveal their opinions.In addition to this, investors should not be encouraged by this “growth opportunity.” Hardware is capital intensive, and increasing COGs and capex are likely to hinder Snap’s ability to keep their promises on their asset light social media business that should have a considerably higher ROI. The same goes for the company’s purchase of Ctrl Me Robotics and of the alleged purchase of selfie drone company Zero Zero robotics.Some have claimed that Snap has a unique opportunity to make inroads to the burgeoning AR/VR scene. Snapchat has created exceptional lenses and augmented reality functions on their app, however, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Sony (NYSE:SNE), Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all making attempts at breaking into this new industry. Snapchat could very well be a beneficiary, but the future remains murky given the competition.In 2015 Anthony Pompliano was recruited from Facebook to lead Snap’s growth team. Pompliano claims that he was abruptly fired after he raised issues that the company falsified its growth metrics. While other executives boasted of Snapchat’s user growth, Pompliano claims that “DAU growth was actually often flat” between January and September 2015. Pompliano claims that Spiegel said that inflating DAUs were “no big deal.” When proposing to add users in international markets, Pompliano claims that Spiegel responded “this app is only for rich people, I don’t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.”Pompliano filed a lawsuit in January to compensate him for lost salary and stock awards as well as for damage to his professional reputation. The suit is ongoing. Snap has said that he is a “disgruntled former employee” while Carson Block believes he is a standup individual. It is worthy to note that Pompliano managed to get a new job at Brighten Labs shortly after being fired from Snap. Less than two months later he was fired from Brighten Labs. Pompliano filed a lawsuit against Brighten alleging wrongful termination as well as unjust denial of stock rewards.Given the controversy, I would rather not draw any conclusions until the suit unfolds.Management admits they have no durable competitive advantageThe S-1 filing clearly states “in a world where anyone can distribute products instantly and provide them for free, the best way to compete is by innovating to create the most engaging products. That is because it is difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage – new software is available to users immediately, and for free.” Snap’s strategy is therefore to innovate at a greater rate than their competitors. Snap downplays the importance of distribution and the network effects that are incredibly valuable to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google search. I will give full credit to Spiegel and team for creating excellent additions to their platform, but recognize that none of these innovations are inimitable. Facebook and Instagram have significantly more scale and funds at their disposal. Once they shore up their deficiencies in their stories product and decide to innovate themselves, will Snap be able to match up?Share dilutionWhestuizen carefully and objectively analyzed this issue. I will point you to his article in which he describes the share compensation plan as ""legal theft.""Preparing a Discounted Cash Flow (NYSE:DCF) analysis that likely captures the path that Snap will take is challenging. My research has led me to believe that Snap is particularly overvalued, and so what I would rather do is to plot out an optimistic view that would suggest the best case scenario for the company.User Growth: Snap’s DAU’s have only increased by 3%-5% QoQ over the past four quarters (CAGR of 22% over a year). I decided to use a growth rate of 25% that gradually dropped down to 8% over the course of 10 years.ARPU: I issued Snap an ARPU growth rate at 40% that dropped down to 5% by the end of year 10.I made the assumption that Snap would be able to gradually reach 30% operating profit margins by the end of 10 years.Other Assumptions:Using conservative inputs, the suggested value of Snap is $9.62-$12.03 per share. When considering all of the concerns that I have delineated, however, I do not see how Snap can gracefully coexist with Instagram Stories. Snap would need to succeed on many fronts in order to achieve the growth and opportunity that some believe are possible. At the same time, the company is riddled with risk and patently questionable business strategies.Snapchat has managed to break through tremendous competitive pressure in years past as Facebook launched Poke and Slingshot. Facebook has seemingly taken a shotgun approach to the competition that Snapchat has brought upon them by adding stories to Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Unfortunately for Snapchat, the addition of stories to Instagram seems to be a real threat to their business. Instagram is now well positioned to overtake Snapchat, given their scale, funding, and management of influencer and advertising relationships. Innovation alone is not a sustainable competitive advantage that Snapchat can continue to rely on.  One analogue that I recalled during my analysis was the competition between Buffalo Evening News (NYSE:BEN) and the Courier-Express (NYSE:CE) in 1977. Once Warren Buffett took over BEN, the CE sued the BEN and launched a public relations war in which it portrayed itself as a tiny David fighting ruthless Goliaths from out of town. Although both papers were losing money, BEN’s scale and efficiency were above CE. Eventually CE shut down in 1982 and BEN absorbed the advertising spend and operating profits soared.   At the time Buffett said “Look. The economics in the business is inevitably leading to one newspaper in town. Survival of the fattest is what I call it. And you win. There is no second place. There’s no red ribbon. In the end, there isn’t going to be any competition because that isn’t the way it works.”Now, this is certainly not a perfect example, and I do not suggest just blindly accepting Buffet’s claims on every topic. I do believe, however, that this analogue captures the principal forces that are currently at play between Snap and Instagram.As previously mentioned, while I believe my analysis to be thorough and captures the primary factors affecting Snap, it is undoubtedly lacking some amount of information. If you disagree with my view of the company or feel that I have missed some salient details, I welcome you, dear reader, to stretch my intuitions so that I can come to a fuller understanding of Snap."
4116826,52752,2017-10-26T12:14:22-04:00,Snap is a company behaving like a start-up with unrestrained spending which results in heavy losses.Significant efforts are spent on product development which yielded reasonable success in growing its subscriber base against Instagram’s competition.Snapchat is a viable product with weak advertising tools. We are seeing early signs that such weakness is being addressed this month.Management is starting to take steps to address its untenable spending patterns but the road to profitability is long.Snap has the potential to challenge the Facebook and Google duopoly but the execution is key.,"Snap (SNAP) is in trouble. Instagram (FB) is hot on its heels by launching similar products aimed at luring away its most valuable asset: subscriber base. On the financial front, investors are uncomfortable with the growing losses. Over the past 5 quarters, Snap had increased its cost by 236% but its revenue increase trailed behind at 153%.Most importantly, Snap’s management has not come to terms that it is a listed company and not a start-up anymore. They are more focused on product development rather than developing their advertising platform. Product development allows Snap to defend its subscriber base successfully against the competition but not its revenue base.For investors, Snap presents a dilemma. It is a leading social media company with its own unique advantages compared to Facebook and Instagram and hence too valuable to write-off. However, the actions of its management suggest that if current trend where to continue unabated, Snap is more likely to face bankruptcy than to reach Facebook’s $508 billion market capitalization.It is notable that Snap’s IPO underwriter, Morgan Stanley (MS) rebuked Snap’s management very publicly through a downgrade in July 2017. Reading between the lines, we can infer that Morgan Stanley had gotten the management’s commitment to improve its advertising product before its listing in February 2017. After waiting for more than 6 months, there has not been any meaningful improvement and hence the downgrade.To be fair, Snap’s management is facing a tough job fending off the competition from Facebook and Instagram while facing an urgent task to upgrade its unacceptable advertising platform. First things first, the most important task for Snap’s management is to ensure that they are attractive to its subscribers amid the competition. If there are signs that its subscriber base is being eroded significantly, then we don’t have to talk about its advertising products. It would be over for Snap.Source: ZDNetWhile there are flops such as Spectacles, Snap had been largely successful in its push to attract more users. In the previous quarter, Snap increased its subscriber base by 7 million to 173 million daily active users which is just 2 million below analysts’ expectations.In discussing its subscriber base, it is worth noting that most of its users are in North America and its reach in the rest of the world remains untapped. If management were to put up a concerted effort to reach Asia, Latin America, and other geographic regions; there is large growth potential. Then again, this is likely to be a medium-term goal to be addressed after immediate concerns are solved.Next, Snapchat is more attractive than Instagram despite the latter’s effort to copy Snapchat with Instagram Stories. Snapchat’s young base of users spend 40 minutes every day on it compared to 30 minutes on Instagram. Piper Jaffrey (PJC) had polled 6,100 teens and they found out that an overwhelming 47% of teens favor Snapchat as Instagram and Facebook took the second and third spots. Another survey shows that Snapchat is clearly popular not only with teens from the age of 13 to 17, but also college students from 18 to 24. Now that we are clear that Snap has a viable future, this allows us to shift our discussion to its advertising product. The big question is just how bad is Snap at attracting advertising revenue? If you are not in the advertising space, this is a difficult question to answer. The following chart gives you an idea why Morgan Stanley is so mad at CEO Evan Spiegel and team.Source: e-MarketerIn a survey released earlier this month, e-Marketer found out that while advertisers like the creative capabilities of Snapchat, they are staying largely on the sidelines simply because they don’t know how effective Snapchat is. A massive 74% of advertisers don’t intend to spend a single cent on Snapchat, while 21% allocated a token 1% to 10% of their budget.Compare this to Facebook, where a significant 38% of advertisers allocated 11% to 30% of their budget or Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) where an impressive 37% allocated more than 31% of their budget. These two are the success stories and Snapchat are nowhere near them.The weaknesses of Snapchat’s advertising toolkit are well known and spelled out clearly by Morgan Stanley. They are not scalable, don’t allow for proper targeting and measurability of its effectiveness. To cut a long story short, advertisers will not want to risk their funds “experimenting” with Snapchat if they don’t fulfill these requirements.The good news for investors is that the management team had started to respond to such advertising demands. Snap had launched a geolocation based ad targeting in Place and Snap Map this month. This allows advertisers to track where people are shopping so that they can offer customized offers and measure its effectiveness. Advertisers are pleased and they are voting on their feet which resulted in 73% increase in spending this month.Whether this 73% increase in geolocation ad revenue will turn Snap into profitability lies largely on its ability to tackle its exponentially growing cost base. As mentioned earlier and worth rehashing, while revenue grew by 153% over the past 5 quarters, cost grew even more by 236%.Start-up incubators such as Y-Combinator would be proud of Team Spiegel but don’t expect Warren Buffet to hold this stock. This splurging is untenable which explains why the stock dropped from $29 to $11 within 6 months in August 2017.Source: Snap’s Investor Relation Q2/2017 ReportSome cost is fixed such as Snap’s commitment to spend $2 billion over 5 years with Google for its cloud application. Snap is bound by contractual obligations and such service is fundamental to its product offering.On the other hand, tax and labor costs should be cut. According to 3E Accounting, Snap’s current loss-making position gives it a tax advantage, which should be utilized with proper corporate tax planning. On the labor front, Snap went on a hiring spree over the past 2 years, where the company increased its headcount from 600 to 2800. For a start, Snap had committed to slow its hiring process and had reduced 18 internal recruiters. Management is more focused on evaluating the performance of its existing hires, and we might hear news of more dismissal of underperforming staff.According to VB Profiles, Snap had raised $5.82 billion over the past 5 years of funding, including $3.4 billion from its recent IPO. The company had spent 54% of investors' money, and it is left with only $2.7 billion in cash given the net loss position.Right DirectionOverall, it is clear that Snap management is moving in the right direction in cutting its cost base and improving its advertising revenue. We will only know how far they had gone in the next quarterly results. For its previous quarter, Snap reported revenue is $182 million while cost stands at $631 million. This wide gap suggests that investors will have to wait several quarters for Snap to be profitable.The attractiveness of Snapchat suggests that Snap can challenge the duopoly of Google and Facebook in the digital marketing space. If that is true, Snap can easily increase its valuation by more than 10 times and more. At this stage, the key risk lies in the execution and if you are buying it now, you are placing a lot of faith in Team Spiegel."
4118191,22148,2017-10-30T13:57:20-04:00,Snap reportedly cut recruiters to start Q4.All indications are that the social network needs to cut costs versus containing the level of cost growth.Watch for a Q3 revenue miss based on these actions.,"Business Insider reported that Snap (SNAP) laid off more employees last week and plans to slow hiring in 2018. My investment thesis suggests that the social network loved by teens needs more drastic moves before becoming investable. The stock ended the week trading above $15 following a slew of positive tech reports, but Snap is far below the IPO level. The stock remains an avoid for the following reasons. As BI details, Snap grew headcount dramatically over the last couple of years to 2,600 last quarter. More importantly though, the company grew expenses at a faster rate than revenue grew. All fine for the startup phase, but a horrible combination for a company surging past $1 billion in annual revenues. If Snap was on a path towards the success of Facebook (FB), the company would only need to slow the pace of employee expansion. Containing cost growth would create substantial leverage. Instead, Snap reportedly cut 18 people from the recruiting division and is now requiring that executives make ""hard decisions"" about employees suggesting a move far from slowing growth rates. Back in Q2, Snap presented the following financial position. The costs were completely out of control. Revenues grew $110 million, but costs soared $443 million. Excluding stock-based compensation of $245 million, costs still grew by nearly $100 million more than revenues. Source: Snap Q2'17 earnings release The social network continues announcing apparent solid video content deals with the likes of NBCUniversal (CMCSA) for original scripted shows, but Snap Hasn't shown how these deals are profitable. Even teens tell the story that Instagram is more effective for communicating with them. Ultimately, no amount of costs would matter if engagement was growing rapidly. Facebook forecast reaching over $50 billion in revenues next year. Snap at about $1.5 billion in annual expenses based on Q2 run rate only amounts to about a month of expenses at Facebook. If Snap is giving up on robust engagement and hence growth, one shouldn't invest in the stock with a market cap approaching $20 billion. The social network is clearly taking the same engagement path of Twitter (TWTR) that is only worth $15 billion now after surging following Q3 results. Remember though that Twitter is cash flow positive and never amassed the outsized cost structure, yet still traded below a $10 billion valuation at one point. The data points suggest that Snap has the same engagement problems along with needing to make ""hard decisions"". Cutting recruiters and making such financial moves that have negative sentiment and growth implications such as keeping top talent. Revenue estimates continue to plunge. Snap is clearly not on path to reach $1.6 billion in annual revenues next year. The estimates originally topped $2 billion and watch for more cuts to the estimates along with the Q3 results. SNAP Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsAnalysts are forecasting at least a $600 million loss next year based on these revenue estimates. Cutting a few recruiters to start Q4 isn't enough.Snap needs to cut expenses back to Q2 levels to breakeven based on the current 2018 revenue estimates. Based on Q3 loss forecasts, annual expenses are already set to reach a $1.7 billion annual rate. Throw in increases for costs of revenues that will soar along with revenue growth and Snap is on at least a $2 billion annual cost path for 2018. Even by containing costs by not expanding the employee count for R&D and G&A isn't enough. The company needs to cut costs and that actually has growth implications. Any restructuring sets a company back a few quarters. The key investor takeaway remains that Snap is set up for a major fall. The only way to get out of this financial predicament is to grow. Facebook has made all that but impossible with Instagram. The upcoming Q3 results should produce more disappointing financial metrics, hence the need to not only cut costs but eliminate recruiters.The story doesn't get better from here. Avoid the stock."

However, this wealth building method entails a lot of risk.If investors would resist the ""hare"" mindset, and learn to think like the ""tortoise"" - a lot of wealth could be generated over long time horizons.Using SNAP to illustrate why dividend growth investing - simply works.But first - a personal note to share.","For those who follow me, you may (or may not) have noticed that I haven't posted on Seeking Alpha for the past five months. My wife and I had brought our first child into the family. The past five months have consisted of my wife and I ""getting the hang of"" this parenting thing - and it has been an absolute blast. I apologize for my lack of presence on Seeking Alpha during this time frame. For those that have continued to follow me - THANK YOU. I am easing my way back into writing, which is truly exciting to me. Not only that, but I am working on a Marketplace service that will contain my best ideas, with a higher level of detail than what is published on the public site. Stay tuned!It is quite interesting how some folk tales stand the tests of time, and continue to ""ring true"" in different areas of life. Take the famous tail of ""The Tortoise and The Hare"" for example. Most people are aware that one of the main themes to the tale, is that ""slow and steady"" often wins the race. Yet, there is something in the human psyche that continues to tempt people to seek out instant gratification. Investors continually take on massive risk when they try to find the next Amazon (NYSE: AMZN), or invest in various crypto-currencies in an effort to speed through the wealth building process. While it sometimes pays off for the lucky few, chasing these unicorns often leads to disappointment. Yet, if more investors were willing to be patient, investors could amass impressive fortunes over time with ""slow and steady"" investing styles such as dividend growth investing.Dividend growth investing works because the fundamental and financial environment that is conducive to a stock's dividend growth over time, correlates with stock performance. This is very similar to the basic needs of a plant in order for growth to occur - nutrients, water, and sunlight. If one of those three are missing, the plant will not grow. Similarly, a company cannot continually grow its earnings, and dividend payout over time if certain conditions are not met. In most cases, a company needs both top line growth and profitability in order to drive earnings and dividend growth over the long term. These two conditions drive cash flows, which are the life blood of any company.Circling back, I wanted to highlight SNAP Inc. (NYSE: SNAP). Going public a little under nine months ago, SNAP was met by investors with a lot of enthusiasm as it closed up 44% from its IPO on its first day of trading. However, it quickly began to cool off. In late May, I wrote a commentary article on a report that SNAP was trying to incentivize advertisers to do business with them. Since that article, SNAP has gone on to drop around 27%:What has happened since May? When stripping away all of the fat, it really isn't that complicated. First of all, top line growth has not been the problem at SNAP. One of the main reasons that investors flock to companies like SNAP, is that the top line is usually growing at an extremely high rate. Top line growth is highly coveted by the market, and therefore shares of companies with such top line growth will get ""snapped"" up by investors.Pulling from the last earnings report, one can see that SNAP has more than doubled its top line year over year. In addition, the number of daily users has expanded globally from 143 million users in Q2 2016, to 173 million users in Q2 2017. The problem with SNAP lies in the other half of the equation. SNAP has seen its earnings and free cash flow (remember FCF being referred to as the ""life blood"" of a company?) continually worsen over time.This negative development is mainly being driven by the continual rise of both costs of revenue, and operating expenses.Readers may be thinking right now: ""Well duh, Justin. Of course companies need to make money to thrive"". But it is hindsight being 20/20 for a lot of investors who may have jumped into SNAP months ago, and now sit in the ""red"".The point of this, is that when you invest in dividend growth stocks - the track record of raising dividends over time - is an obvious signal that a given company is growing its top line while turning a consistent profit. The ingredients for long term wealth generation are already there - investors just need to buy at a reasonable valuation, and enjoy the ride.Take Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) for example. Johnson & Johnson has raised its dividend to shareholders for 55 consecutive years. Before going any further, one can reasonably deduct that the company must be successfully growing its profits in order to afford a consistently growing cash outlay such as a dividend. This is NOT always the case - sometimes companies use tricks to accomplish dividend growth (such as taking on debt), but this is a good ""sniff test"".JNJ Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsNow, if we graph the financials, we receive confirmation. Over the long term, Johnson & Johnson has successfully grown its top line in a profitable manner which has in turn - grown free cash flows, earnings, and the dividend payout. Notice how the payout ratio has stayed remarkably consistent at around 40%. Management funds the dividend with organic profits, capping the payout. The rest of the cash is used as ammo to fuel future growth - whether it be through share buybacks, acquisitions, etc. By growing every year, management is able to organically raise the dividend, and continue investing the rest into growth, and the cycle starts again. A very profitable ""chicken or the egg"" scenario.As a result, one can see that Johnson & Johnson has absolutely smoked the S&P 500 over the long term, and this doesn't even factor in dividends!SNAP will probably begin to figure things out at some point, and begin to turn a profit. However, how many investors will have cut their losses by the time this happens? Opportunities for the ""next big thing"" will come and go, and investors will probably continue to chase the next Amazon. The majority will also suffer the risks that come with chasing the investing world's version of instant gratification. For those with an open mind, and some patience, I implore you to adopt a tortoise mentality.If you liked this article, please find my profile icon at the top of this page, and hit the follow button.

(PETS) Recent price: $ 37PetMed Express, Inc. (PetMed Express), also known as 1800PetMeds, is a integrated leading pet pharmacy. The Company sells the full gamut of pet medications and health products direct to the consumer. It offers approximately 3,000 SKU’s including market leading brands such as Frontline , Advantix II, and Heartgard Plus. It also offers pet supplies on its Website, and outsources delivery and fulfillment which are drop shipped to its customers by third parties.Spending on pets was a high growth pursuit with sales growing 10.7% in 2016 , over five times US GDP. Petmed Express is well positioned as a specialty online retailer in a near $5 billion market for pet medication in the US alone. As the small-cap , valued at less than $1 billion, Petmed Express has considerable upside until it becomes a viable take over candidate for Amazon (AMZN), which is seeking to domineer and conquer the US retailing marketplace. A trend that does not bode favorably for job creation.Meanwhile, Short interest has grown to a relatively high level of over 20% of the float. This could provide further tinder to upside as shorts feel the heat when the stock trades higher. We believe fair value based on our fundamental research is $47 *per share.*Model valuation assumptions : $1.50 ttm eps, 5yr estimated cagr 15%, 25xpe, 10% discount rate for small cap risk .12- 18 month target price: $47--The Short: SNAP Inc. (SNAP)Current price: $15Snap, formerly Snapchat, is a mass phenomenon, largely with 18-30 aged Millennials’, a self-professed “camera company”. The Company’s appeal lies in its quick and spunky, temporal multimedia messaging technology that appeals to heavily, more narcissistic Millennials.However, Snap's appeal beyond this demographic seems to quickly fade as “adults” are still relatively new to Facebook and feel content with its expanded new features which also aim to cannibalize Snap's . and Its core messaging flagship product.Briefly, Snap is a camera application that helps people to communicate through short videos and images known as a Snap. The Company offers three ways for people to make Snaps: the Snapchat application, Publishers Tools that help its partners to create Publisher Stories, and Spectacles, its sunglasses that make Snaps.The Company’s core business opportunity is driving advertising products that include Snap Ads and Sponsored Creative Tools, such as Sponsored Lenses and Sponsored Geofilters. As of December 31, 2016, on an average, 158 million people used Snapchat every day to Snap with family, watch Stories from friends, see events from around the world, and explore curated content from publishers.Our core fundamental thesis is Snap's phenomenal growth will radically slow as it reaches saturation levels in its key Millennial demographic, DAU (daily average users) year over year growth has decayed from 36% in q/1 to the 20’s%, which projects to a flattening to low growth rate within 2 years.Furthermore, Facebook (FB), the ultimate knock-off artist will steal Snap's thunder in other demographic markets such as the “boomers”. Given its current lofty valuations, this will leave a steep plunge down to much lower and sustainable growth levels and subsequent valuations, we rate Snap a sell. It is overvalued to its group valuation: on its Price/Sales ratio, (a key metric for non - positive eps reporting companies) trading at over 32x P/S vs 24x for the sector mean.And based on next 12 months estimates. Snap trades at more than a 100% premium to its peers based on its EV/Sales ratio. At 9.69 vs. 4.62.To recap our Sell Thesis:12- 18 month target price: $10"

If you'd like to stay on top of my future articles on Snap, as well as other companies, please click the ""Follow"" button at the top of this page.I discussed in my recent article, Does Snapchat Stand A Chance Against Instagram?, the immense competition Snap (SNAP) faces from Instagram (FB), and recent data corroborates my thesis. Unless the company can soon turn around the precipitous decline in its daily active users, I expect the decline in stock price to continue for the foreseeable future.The following graph contrasts Snap (SNAP) and the NASDAQ index as the benchmark in the last two days:SNAP data by YChartsSnap dramatically underperformed both its primary competitor, Facebook, and the overall NASDAQ index by a wide margin in the past two weeks.Although I am normally not phased by short-term swings in stock prices, I do always keep an eye on if the price swings were supported by changes in the underlying fundamentals of a given company.In SNAP's case, I believe that it is.This recode article published on the morning of September 19 points out that, ""Instagram is rapidly eating away at Snapchat’s share of new users,"" and includes the following eye-opening graph:The trend is clear, and it's a very important one that shareholders should note.As I discussed in my article, Does Snapchat Stand A Chance Against Instagram?:As more data has become available recently, the headwinds that Snap faces seems to have grown stronger than I had estimated.The following graph shows the stunning rise in Pandora's (P) stock price, before Spotify (MUSIC) and Apple (AAPL) started eating its lunch:P data by YChartsRight around the same time, interest in Spotify had started accelerating, as indicated by Google Trends:Furthermore, also around the same time in June of 2013, a New York Times article was pointing out possible competition from Apple:Of course hindsight is 20/20, but I believe a comprehensive strategic analysis of industry players could have prevented Pandora's shareholders from the following dramatic declines in the following two years:P data by YChartsMany had expected SNAP to recover after the recent lockup expiration in July, but this expectation has not materialized. I believe this is because of the significant deterioration in the company's prospects as competition from Instagram has proved stronger than estimated.Similar to how I view Tesla (TSLA), a pre-revenue (Model 3/Y) venture capital investment, Snap's future bottom-line results depend on its ability to grow its top-line quickly so that it can build upon the recent improvement in its gross margin and operating leverage inherent in social media companies.SNAP Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThis, however, will likely prove near impossible.In fact, Instagram just revealed that it added another 100 million monthly active users in just four months, for a total of 800 million.For reference: Snap most recently had 173 million daily active users, total.Instagram's daily active users? 500 million.It seems to me that the new user trend is accelerating against Snap. Without adding more users to its platform, Snap, let alone turning profitable, cannot sustainably grow its top-line. More importantly, however, it cannot create its own network effect. The last piece is the most important in my view.Maybe this is why one of Snap's largest institutional investors, Fidelity, recently slashed its position in the company by more than half, and at 24%, the institutional ownership in Snap is lower than some of the other stocks I follow closely. You can find further information on this topic in my recent article, Institutional Ownership In Snap.Snap's competitive position is looking awfully similar to that of Pandora's in 2013: hot product, intensifying competition, and no clear competitive advantage.Until the company turns around the declining trend illustrated in this article, and further improve its gross margins, I remain on the sidelines.Let hindsight guide your future investment decisions.If you enjoyed this article, please scroll up to the top of the page and click the ""Follow"" button next to my name.

4107359,99506,2017-09-15T15:43:00-04:00,"Snap has monetization problems. Questions have been raised about why Comedy Central will not renew its contract. Possibly content providers are having difficulties making money on the Snapchat platform.If it is accurate that youth-oriented content cannot make money on Snapchat, then it becomes apparent how serious monetization problems have become. In fact, this could indicate a watershed moment.Comedy Central's departure may be a prelude to other content providers leaving Snapchat's platform. The message may be that it is difficult to make money on the Snapchat platform.Recently, Deutsche Bank's analyst reported that many ad buyers were experiencing poor ROI on Snapchat and that advertiser's interest in the Snapchat platform was ""waning.""Results from both Q117 and Q217 financial results indicated revenues falling short of expectations. The upcoming Q317 report does not appear to be promising either.","The much-hyped Snap, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNAP) IPO roadshow made great promises that had analyst's expecting revenues of well above $200 billion. After the disappointing financial results of Q117, analysts reduced revenue forecasts below the $200 billion mark. Now after the once again disappointing Q217 results, analysts are reducing revenue estimates for this year and 2018 still lower. Shown in the SA News Report excerpt below is Deutsche Bank's reduced revenue estimates from $1.9B to $1.6B for 2017 and 2018.SNAP data by YChartsThere seems to be a clear trend in the reduction of revenue forecasts for Snap underway, however, the stock still trades at only $1.80 below its IPO price amidst the growing consensus of reduced future revenues. More concerning is the underlying problems that are causing the revenue shortfalls. Snap is suffering from monetization issues that are indicative of a business model that is currently failing.One need look no further than the two dismal quarterly reports that have been issued since Snap came public in March for confirmation that Snap's business model is currently failing.The graphic below is Snap's Q217 Consolidated Statements From Operations excerpted from the company's 10-Q. Please note that Total Costs and Expenses of approx. $630 million exceeded Revenues of approx. $181 million by a ratio of about 3.5:1. With increasing competition from superior competitors like Apple and Google within a saturated U.S. marketplace (where Snap derives over 80% of its revenues), it is difficult to envision the company's future revenues ever exceeding its rapidly growing expenses. Snapchat infamously warned during the IPO that it ""may never achieve profitability.""This past week two key items emerged as the Deutsche Bank analyst reported waning interest in the Snapchat platforms by advertisers, and Comedy Central will not be renewing its contract to provide content.The following graphics may help to explain the monetization problems for content providers on Snapchat. Only a small fraction of Snapchat users actually view the platform's Discover content. This problem for content providers and Snap is compounded by sharply slowing user growth for the Snapchat platform:The failing monetization effort gets much worse for content providers when the above 24% of Snapchat users who view Discover/Live content is broken down further. The graphic below illustrates that only about 10% of users view New Discover Stories daily:Viacom's decision to pull the plug on Comedy Central becomes more obvious when factoring in the short attention span of Millennials for ads. Furthermore, research has shown that Millennials do not respond to ads. Hence, the inability of both content providers and ad buyers to achieve an optimal ROI on the Snapchat platform. Bad news if you are trying to actually pay for the expenses of bringing content or placing ads on Snapchat. Worse news if you are Snap who is trying to sell these money-losing content spots and ads to customers.Snap's entire business model is predicated upon generating revenues from selling advertising to ad buyers. It has become increasingly clear that the user base on Snapchat is not supporting these ads. Accordingly, Snap's business model may now be approaching free-fall with the latest bad news that Viacom's Comedy Central is leaving the Snapchat platform.This alarming news for Snap that Viacom is canceling its contract for Comedy Central comes on the heels of this week's other crisis alert from the Deutsche Bank analyst that, ""Advertising interest is waning."" Keep in mind that Deutsche Bank was one of the Snap IPO's underwriters. Generally, when an underwriter discusses a former client so close to a recent IPO it is with a positive tone. It is very telling that Snap's own underwriting team has become increasingly negative on Snap.In fact, the largest lead underwriter of Snap's IPO, Morgan Stanley, recently issued a mea culpa by stating, ""We have been wrong"" on Snap. The lead underwriter slashed its price target from $28 to $16 and interestingly added an addendum to their price target that was a ""bear market price target of $7."" I earned my Series 7 license to begin work as a stockbroker in 1986. In 30-years on the Street, I cannot remember a lead underwriter turning on a recent IPO in this fashion. CNBC's Jim Cramer actually called the Morgan Stanley report, ""An obituary.""If one were looking for a clear signal that might indicate the beginning of the end of Snap's worsening struggle for corporate survival, then this week's dual crisis alerts just might be it. When another IPO underwriter, Deutsche Bank, turns negative upon a recent IPO with comments of ""waning interest"" in the Snapchat platform by advertisers who are experiencing low to no ROI then investors should sit up and take notice. But when news of a major content provider has cancelled its contract with Snap occurs in the same week, then investors must seriously question their motivation for holding this stock.Although often controversial and with a mixed record for his stock market calls, CNBC's Jim Cramer has garnered significant experience over his years. Cramer's pronouncement of the recent downgrade of Snap by Morgan Stanley as an ""obituary"" may prove prophetic. These type of messages are not what investors want to hear about any stock they own and should not be ignored.However, close followers of Snap's stock know that there is a very hardcore following of mostly Millennial and less experienced investors who have sworn allegiance to their leader Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap. These investors seem to be enamored with the ""shiny buttons and bright lights"" aspects of the attractive Snapchat platform. At the same time these investors are very disinterested in boring items such as valuation; staggering losses; burn rate of IPO cash; increasing expenses; sharply decelerating revenues; saturated markets; increasing competition from superior companies; dismal quarterly reports; class action and patent infringement lawsuits; all of which are being experienced by Snap.Considering the growing list of negatives for Snap it is increasingly possible that we are looking at a failing business model. Snap's existence is being propped up only by a dwindling amount of IPO cash that decreases by significant amounts quarterly. In this previous article, we began an accounting watch of the rapidly decreasing IPO cash position. At the current burn rate, this capital will be exhausted in about 7 quarters. This week's alarming news of a deteriorating revenue model indicates still larger problems looming for Snap in the near future.Perhaps the Michael Jordan quote below expresses the sentiments of the cult-like tenacity of many Snap shareholders:"
4114580,47521,2017-10-19T07:15:02-04:00,"Snapchat's teen user base doesn't translate into marketing reach.A small percentage of teens use Snapchat only.Revenue and earnings will remain a challenge to grow as marketers not willing to spend a lot on the platform.In more bad news, influencers reportedly gravitating more to Instagram.","Source: wccftechWith teenager usage the primary demographic to hang its hat on, Snapchat (SNAP) will continue to struggle, even though a recent ""Taking Stock With Teens"" survey by Piper Jaffray found 47 percent of those responding choose Snapchat over all other platforms, it isn't translating into meaningful revenue and earnings.Even though teens prefer Snapchat as their platform of choice, they say they can be better reached on Instagram when being marketed to. Almost 60 percent said the best way to reach them was via Instagram (FB), with less than 50 percent saying Snapchat was more effective.Citing a survey by RBC Capital Markets and Advertising Age, eMarketer said only 26 percent of marketers responding were committed to spending ""1% or more of their digital ad budget share to Snapchat."" Most of that was 10% and under.In another important metric, MediaKix studied a group of influencers on the using Snapchat and Instagram, and found influencer usage of Snapchat declined 33 percent from earlier in 2017.Snap missed on the top and bottom line in the last reporting period, having a net loss of $443.1 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $194.0 million, against a $188.2 million loss in the first quarter, and a loss of $105.1 million year-over-year.With revenue in the quarter coming in at $181.7 million, a gain of 153 percent, it confirms the heavy spending the company has to undertake in order to attempt to attract more advertisers to its ad auctions.The low number of advertisers limits the competition, which in turn lowers the amount needed to win a bid. That puts downward pressure on margins and earnings. This is why an uptick in gross margins had little if any effect on performance of the company, as well as the increase in advertising revenue over last year in the same reporting period.Operating expenses jumped to $228.7 million, up 17 percent. The company said higher employee costs were the major catalyst there.One major advantage Facebook's Instagram has is it can piggyback from its advertiser base on Facebook and scale it quicker into Instagram. The company has 5 million Facebook advertisers, and 1 million Instagram advertisers.It implies Instagram is going to quickly ramp up, while Snapchat struggles to do so. After all, Snapchat doesn't have a large social network it can draw advertisers from. That'll make it hard to keep up with Instagram because teens, influencers and brands all prefer to use Instagram over Snapchat.There is of course some overlap, but the trend is ominous for Snapchat.In its last earnings report Facebook said it have over 15 million business profiles on Instagram.No one disputes the fact Snapchat is the market leader for attracting teens to its social networking platform. What is at issue is even when the teens were asked which platform they see as the best to reach them, Instagram comes out on top.It could be argued teens are fickle and their response could be suspect to the question, depending on how it was asked, still, there can be no doubt the implications are they prefer not to be interfered with concerning ads on Snapchat, while enjoying the engagement on Instagram.Whatever the reason, this is bad news for Snapchat.Finally, while Snapchat does position itself as the place to come to market to teens, in reality, only about 10 percent of teen users use it as their only social networking platform, according to Piper Jaffrey, which added, ""Instagram has largely the same user base as Snapchat, but a better ad unit and advertiser engagement.""As mentioned earlier, of the 24% of advertisers spending on Snapchat at all, they only spend in a range of 1% to 10% of their budgets on the platform.This is why the bragging rights to the choice of teens, at least as far as investors go, at this time is meaningless.Instagram on the other hand confirms what the teens say concerning it being the place to reach them. It stated recently that its advertiser count in September has doubled to 2 million from 6 months earlier.There are a couple of things to consider with Snapchat's advertising. First, and in my opinion, most important, is it will have to commit more capital to advertising in order to convince and attract more advertisers to its platform. That which it has already done has cut into operating margins, and that will continue to be the case going forward.Another factor to consider in regard to margins is the consequences of shifting to auction-based advertising. The result has been downward pressure on the price of ads. What has happened there is there is a lot of ad supply which allows advertisers to bid less for an ad impression and win the auction.Management has said an increase in advertisers will help deal with that issue. That of course means more spending and more pressure on operating margins.To gain advertisers it'll also have to do something to improve engagement to stop the churn from influencers and users that prefer to engage with Instagram Stories.Since Instagram launched Stories about a year ago, uses have soared to 250 million, easily surpassing Snapchat's 173 million users, according to Hubspot.Although marketing responses were anecdotal, the majority queried said they ""prefer Instagram Stories."" A study by MediaKix over a 6-month period found that among top social media influencers, Instagram Stories was the preferred platform to use.Among those they studied, influencers said they shared double the stories on Instagram than they did on Snapchat. It was also found that there was a drop of 33 percent in influencers using Snapchat Stories. During the same 6-month period they increased the number of stories on Instagram by 14 percent.Another major concern is data from Snaplytics points to influencers getting more ""brand engagement on Instagram Stories than on Snapchat.""Source: HubspotI think it's clear at this time the attempt by Snapchat to position itself as the leader in teen usage on social networking platforms, while technically true, has to be digested with a big caveat, and that is the teens, influencers and advertisers prefer Instagram to Snapchat when considering advertising and branding.That means Snapchat must answer this if they even want a small chance at being considered a legitimate platform for marketers to place ads against their content. Everything hinges around that for the company.Even its decision to go with an auction means for it to be successful, it has to attract a lot more advertisers. While that is very visible and clear, the company must prove it's able to do so. It will cost them money to make it a reality, assuming they are able to successfully execute a plan.More importantly, the most significant people on its platform - the influencers - are rapidly moving over to Instagram. That may be why the teens said advertisers would do better by reaching out to them there.A lot has been made of Instagram copying Snapchat's story feature, but that's irrelevant. That has been happening in a variety of ways across all business sectors and segments for a long time.What's really important about that is Snapchat's Stories appears to be considered more of a commodity tool, while Instagram Stories has managed to position itself as more of a premium tool, in the sense of influencers preferring to use that instead of Snapchat's.With the pace of abandonment of Snapchat by influencers, this is a huge challenge for the company as it tries to attract more advertising while using an auction which produces oversupply and low price bids.The data show it's going in the wrong direction, whether teens prefer it over other platforms for their general interaction with their friends. When they want serious engagement, the trend is they move over to Instagram to find their influencers, and where the money is being spent."

Snap, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNAP), Snapchat’s parent company, is equally popular in the investment community. Its claim to fame was the IPO pitch “We lost money, expect to lose more, and we may never make any money”. Were management and their investment bankers just being modest? Or is Snapchat really a black hole of VC (and now public investor) money?The only things I love about Snap Inc. are Snapchat and its logo.I will attempt to assess Snap’s situation in 7 pictures.  Source: Piper Jaffray via emarketer.comThere is no arguing that Snapchat is an addicting product, especially popular amongst teens. In Piper Jaffray’s most recent survey of more than 6,000 teens, almost half the respondents prefer Snapchat over other forms of social media.In tech, one of the most important metrics to monitor is how much revenue an average generates for the company (ARPU). Looking at this metric alone gives investors a sense of security, as it appears to show that Snap’s profitability is trending up.  However, revenue is just one side of the picture. Snap does incur costs for each snap and for running the back-end engines that power the video-sharing-and-deleting operation. Average cost per user had been growing hand-in-hand with revenue per user.Despite strong user and revenue growth, consistent gross profit (before incurring any corporate level costs) remains elusive. Snap, Inc simply has not successfully monetized its user base. It is normal for mass-market tech products to incur losses initially due to high fixed costs. Platform building is a time and capital-intensive undertaking, but the expectation is that these businesses (Amazon, Uber) will reach profitability once their user bases grow to a certain size. Snapchat does not have the same path to profitability, however. Aside from the fact that each additional user “costs” Snap, Inc. money, even if we can magically wipe out all the cost of revenue, the company’s revenues cannot even cover its corporate expenses! Most Snap, Inc. longs expect ARPU to continue to increase, Average Cost per User will eventually stabilize, and eventually, the company will start making money. But the reality is that corporate expenses – which are considered “fixed costs” – have been growing at an alarming rate. In fact, “other costs” grew at a 29% quarterly rate, much faster than the 5% rate that Daily Average Users are growing at.Unlike other platform-type tech businesses, which incur high initial fixed costs but will eventually turn profitable once they reach a critical volume, Snap’s core Snapchat business does not seem to have a path to profitability. Besides the much discussed “Snap loses money on each snap” narrative, the company’s supposed “platform-type” operating costs are still growing 29% QoQ and showing no signs of slowing down.With 2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities and current burn rate of 200 million per quarter Snap Inc. can survive for at least another 3 years if the cost problem persists, but the current picture does not look pretty.Until Snap, inc. starts showing signs of cost containment and ability to generate consistent gross profit, investors are strongly advised to avoid SNAP at all cost. Enjoy disappearing snaps, not disappearing money."
4109631,102657,2017-09-26T15:34:14-04:00,"Facebook drops plans for a new capital structure.Overview of Snap's capital structure.Snap's non-voting shares aren't worthless, but certainly worth less.","Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced early this week that it will not continue with plans to split its stock. This could have widespread implications on other companies with dual or tri-class capital structures but let’s talk about the news first.Back in April of 2016 during the company’s first-quarter earnings report, Facebook announced that it would issue a new “C” Class of stock which held monetary rights but no voting rights. The rationale behind the new class of stock can be explained by Zuckerberg here, but basically entailed the ability to remain in control of the long-term vision of the company while being able to sell shares for philanthropic activities related to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Prior to the news, Facebook operated under two different classes of stock: Class A and Class B. Both classes were entitled to monetary rights but Class A common stock was entitled to one vote per share, while Class B stock was entitled to ten votes per share. The new capital structure would again include a Class C stock, with monetary rights but no voting rights, that would be issued as a dividend on a 2-1 basis for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.Days after the announcement, Facebook was hit by a lawsuit claiming that the new capital structure would be unfriendly to shareholders. Fast forward to Monday and these plans have officially been squashed.So how does this relate to Snap (NYSE:SNAP)? Well, Snap is one of the few companies with a tri-class structure. Others include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Under Armour (NYSE:UA). Snap’s capital structure is bad. And in my opinion, it’s really bad. It is shown as following:Snap on IPO day.Class A Common Stock: Monetary rights, non-voting (0 votes per share).Class B Common Stock: Monetary rights, 1 vote per share.Class C Common Stock: Monetary rights, 10 votes per share.Just as a recap, the table below shows the voting control held by co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Shares outstanding is based on the most recently filed 10-Q and shares owned by Spiegel/Murphy are based on Form 3’s -- the initial statement of beneficial ownership.Table created by the author, based on forms from Snap's IR page.So Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are entitled to roughly 93% of the voting rights of Snap. You may have seen a number around 88.5% floating around at the time of the IPO. This is misleading as stated in Snap’s S1. “…will be able to exercise voting rights with respect to an aggregate of 215,887,848 shares of Class C common stock, which will represent approximately 88.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock immediately following this offering.” In short, the 88.5% voting power between the two of them actually only accounted for the Class C stock, and not the Class B stock they also owned. So, just for housekeeping, 93% is a better number.While some point to the concentration of voting rights for co-founders of tech companies being the new normal, I think it’s bad. But it gets even worse.“If Mr. Spiegel’s or Mr. Murphy’s employment with us is terminated, they will continue to have the ability to exercise the same significant voting power and potentially control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.” What this means is, even if Spiegel or Murphy were to leave the company, they would still hold the same control as if they were the CEO or CTO respectively.So basically, what’s happening is they have the voting power until they die. And I’d be lying if I said that too. “Either of our co-founders’ shares of Class C common stock will automatically convert into Class B common stock, on a one-to-one- basis, nine months following his death or on the date on which the number of outstanding shares of Class C common stock held by such holder represents less than 30% of the Class C common stock, or 32,383,178 shares of Class C common stock, held by such holder on the closing of this offering.” Therefore, to be precise, I should say that Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy will have full control of the company until nine months after their death or they divest. And, if that happens, the other will be in full control of the company. I think that’s really bad.But you don’t have to take my word for it. Because my thesis is not that you should stay away from companies with complicated capital structures (I believe you should) but that Snap poses an increased risk due to having one. And, with the announcement on Monday, the potential for lawsuits and backlash from activist investors could enhance that risk. But how can it be quantified?Fortunately, we have a few examples. As it relates to the difference between 0 votes per share and 1 vote per share, we have companies such as Alphabet and Under Armour. Both companies have similar tri-class capital structures with shares entitled to 0, 1, and 10 votes. Unlike Snap, however, Under Armour and Alphabet have two classes of shares that trade on a public exchange (the 0 and 1 vote classes).At the time of writing, Under Armour Class C (0 votes per share) trades at $15.39 per share. Under Armour Class A (1 vote per share) trades at $16.74. This is about a 9% difference and generally trades in that range, although if one looked, they would find it has been as high as 20%. Google Class C (0 votes per share) trades at $920.97 while Google Class A (1 vote per share) trades at $934.28, only about a 1.5% difference.While the difference doesn’t seem to be excessive, let’s move on to an example of the difference between classes with 1 vote per share versus 10 votes per share. An article from MarketWatch points to an example of Forest City Realty Trust Inc. Forest City Realty Trust had a dual-class capital structure. Class A common stock was entitled to 1 vote per share, while the Class B common stock was entitled to 10 votes per share. That is until active investor Scopia came in and the company agreed to convert Class B common stock to Class A common stock at a rate of 1.31 to 1. In this way, the Class B stock (with 10 votes per share) held a 31% premium to the Class A stock (with 1 vote per share).Now, just as a rough exercise, let’s see what Snap’s valuation would like if we assumed nothing was built into the stock price. Let’s use a 1.5% premium for the difference between Class A and Class B (0 votes per share and 1 vote per share respectively) and the 31% premium for the difference between Class B and Class C (1 vote per share and 10 votes per share respectively). The math is shown in the table below. While a nearly 6% increase in valuation may not seem overly significant, it is worth noting.Table created by the author, based on forms from Snap's IR page.I’d like to finish off with a few comments I see often on Snap’s capital structure as it relates to other companies that aren’t entirely correct.Not true. Snap is the only social media (or “camera”) company to offer only publicly traded shares with no voting rights. Facebook, as mentioned above, recently tried to do this but has officially cut its plans to do so. Facebook’s publicly traded shares are entitled to one vote per share, which is entirely different than 0 votes per share. Twitter only has one class of shares. This follows for the other hot tech IPO’s such as GoPro or Fitbit.2. Google has the same capital structure as Snap --This is true but there is an important distinction. Alphabet has two tickers which trade on public exchanges. Ticker “GOOG,” for Class C stock with 0 votes per share, and ticker “GOOGL,” for Class A stock with 1 vote per share. Snap’s ticker “SNAP” has but one class of shares, offering no voting rights to the public. Again, Snap is the only company to offer exclusively non-voting shares.3. Shares are the same whether they have voting rights or not –While the difference in prices may seem insignificant, it doesn’t necessarily mean it always will be. Investor perception can change and it appears to be doing so. As such, companies like Alphabet or Under Armour with multiple classes of shares that are publicly traded can be a good look into how investors value the difference between shares with and without voting rights.To reiterate, I think Snap’s capital structure is an increased risk to investors. While there are certainly larger risks, (a sky-high P/S ratio for one) investors tend to skim over the fact that Snap’s publicly traded shares are non-voting. And with news of Facebook abandoning an effort to create a Snap-like capital structure, there may be more to come. It’s also worthy to note that, should it come to a change in capital structure, monetary headwinds for current investors are sure to follow."

4107256,74385,2017-09-15T11:46:13-04:00,"Snapchat's stance on influencers has been characterized by indifference.Influencers add value to social networks by delivering regular content, driving engagement and user growth.Instagram Stories was made into a success in part by Instagram's active influencer community.Snapchat may be reconsidering its policy, but Instagram has dealt a heavy blow.","When looking into Snap (SNAP) for a potential investment, I was somewhat surprised to learn about the company’s unconventional attitude towards influencers. Most social media platforms are inhabited by a number of different users, including people looking to connect with friends, but also by companies looking to engage with consumers and by media organizations looking to generate traffic. Additionally, a lot of social networks have a base of particularly avid users, who have gained a large following by posting regular and sought-after content. Those users are known as Influencers because they can, through their reach and status, influence the buying behavior of their followers, which makes them commercially attractive for consumer businesses.Influencers can be celebrities like the Kardashians or Paris Hilton, but oftentimes they are regular people who started out with a modest following and utilized the platform to grow an audience. Youtube (GOOG) and Instagram (FB) especially are known for having a large group of influencers, who contribute to the platform by regularly posting on specific topics like fashion, beauty or gaming.This phenomenon has been embraced by the owners of those platforms for one reason in particular; regular high-quality content drives user engagement while the companies bear no direct cost for the creative process. In other words, Youtube and Instagram have actively courted influencers as a way of increasing the utility of their networks. Some platforms, like Youtube, share some of the revenues from ads with their influencers, while other networks like Instagram do not, but both platforms have generally been supportive of their influencer community.Given the largely beneficial nature of their presence, it is curious that Snapchat has managed relations with its influencers in an entirely different manner. Instead of embracing them as meaningful contributors to its social network, Snapchat has appeared indifferent to them, or has perhaps even looked down on them.Enter The CompetitionI think that Snapchat may have made a strategic mistake in turning a cold shoulder to influencers. Most importantly, a significant amount of Snapchat’s influencers are reported to have abandoned Snapchat for Instagram, especially since the latter has launched its own Stories feature. Instagram Stories has been turned into a success largely because it had a large influencer population willing to fill Stories with content. Similar features on Whatsapp and Facebook have experienced much lower uptake because they have remained devoid of content. It therefore appears that Instagram has successfully used its larger influencer community to make its new feature a success, which has possibly been exacerbated by Snapchat’s distant attitude towards its influencers.Social networks are often referred to as being platform businesses, which means they aim for a very diverse ecosystem with many different users. Allowing your network to become a meeting place for all of these different actors, helps you to build a platform with the highest utility for the average user, because each individual can use the platform in whichever way they see fit. In technological architectures, maximum utility, not product superiority, is the key to becoming the dominant platform.In my opinion, influencers are essential to success in social media, because the content they produce is an important factor in keeping users engaged. Snapchat has maintained good relations with celebrities on its platform, for instance by giving them verified accounts, but a lot of regular influencers rely on feedback and support from these platforms to build an audience. If influencers feel they are being ignored by the platform’s management, and they do not receive technical support, access to data or verified accounts, you run the risk of alienating them.Instagram Stories is probably an inferior product compared to Snapchat, but it is a good enough knock-off to persuade influencers to switch some, or all of their content creation, to Instagram. At Instagram, influencers have been expertly courted and have received the support and feedback they need to grow an audience. As they have shifted an important part of their content production to Instagram, where they can also more effectively measure their reach, Snapchat has felt the negative effects of slowing user growth. This turn of events would suggest that Instagram has won an important battle in the war for platform dominance.There have recently been some signs that Snapchat has changed its stance towards influencers, and that they are now actively reaching out to some of them. A different influencer policy may rekindle some of the content creation, but I think Instagram will remain the platform of choice for most influencers because of its larger user base and superior discoverability. DiscoverabilitySnapchat has no trending topics, hashtags, likes or even a sophisticated search function. On Snapchat you build a social graph by adding friends through their phone number, username or Snapcode. That is quite different from competing networks like Facebook, Twitter (TWTR) or Instagram, where you can search for terms, topics or names. On Snapchat it can be something of a challenge to find someone if you do not have any of the aforementioned means of identification. This does not only have implications for the app’s ease-of-use, which is generally considered to be quite low, but also for an influencer’s ability to grow an audience.The lack of likes, shares and comments means the concept of virality is absent from Snapchat. Nobody, except for the company itself, really knows which Snaps are being watched a lot. This means that people, companies or other organizations looking for an audience are having more trouble reaching users than they would on other networks. And if they are reaching a lot of people, they are having a lot of trouble keeping track, because the Snapchat ecosystem is still in the process of developing an efficient data analysis toolset.On Instagram, which has a similar focus on visually engaging content, a very active influencer community posts enormous amounts of content related to fashion and beauty. A lot of those influencers have commercial interests related to their content; they are either paid for posting certain content or they receive free stuff. Instagram, and by extension Facebook, do not receive their take of those revenues, which may seem disadvantageous to the platform owner.But at the same time, the presence of those influencers, and their follower communities, have made Instagram the go-to place for online fashion and beauty advertisements. Especially so for online-only fashion companies like ASOS and Boohoo in the UK, who use their presence on the network and their ads to generate traffic to their online shops. Ads on Instagram can be equipped with links to online stores without users having to leave the app, which creates an app-as-store utility that is highly attractive for advertisers.ConclusionAs evidenced by my earlier article on Snap, I do not believe Snap has been finished off by Facebook, but the struggle to draw influencers appears to have been won by Instagram. As I cannot imagine Snapchat’s management being unaware of the role influencers can play on social networks, the only logical conclusion is that their attitude towards influencers was intentional. CEO Evan Spiegel has said that Snapchat was designed to create a sense of intimacy and of being something of a secret between friends. Perhaps having a sprawling influencer community, with all of its unauthorized commercial practices, does not fit into Spiegel’s vision of Snapchat as an intimate and fun environment to engage with friends.The app’s unusual design, with low discoverability, has also certainly allowed Snapchat to avoid, or mitigate, some of the other pitfalls social networks have had to contend with, such as the wide prevalence of harassment, fake news and spam. According to Spiegel, maintaining a clutter-free environment will help Snapchat in keeping its users engaged and feeling uninhibited about sharing. His ideas in this regard make some sense to me, but it also appears to have major implications for the app’s utility to certain users, which could ultimately limit its potential user base, and thereby its economic value."
4105278,74385,2017-09-08T11:52:18-04:00,Instagram has succeeded in slowing Snapchat’s user growth by cloning the popular Stories feature.Snapchat’s work on new product features and advertising tools is a positive but unlikely to fend off Instagram’s encroachment.Discover feature now the company’s best bet for growth by offering unique content and potentially tapping tv advertising budgets.,"Sentiment around this year’s hottest tech IPO Snap (SNAP) soured pretty quickly when the company’s results for the first and second quarter of 2017 underwhelmed investors. Snapchat’s parent company has reported very large operating losses, as its monetization efforts are still relatively early-stage, but the deceleration in its user growth rate is probably the most important reason for the stock’s current discount to its $17 IPO price.After bottoming close to $11 in early August, we have recently seen a rebound in the company’s stock price to $14-$15, which still implies a valuation for the company of more than $17 billion. That means the company is worth more than Twitter (TWTR), which has roughly the same amount of monthly users but has registered much slower user growth in recent years.Snap’s valuation is also quite close to the $19 billion that Facebook put on the table for Whatsapp in 2014, which had some 450 monthly active users at the time. Snapchat is estimated to have some 166 million daily active users, of which 71 million are located in the United States. Monthly active users are at roughly 301 million, which is somewhat below Twitter’s 328 million MAU’s (for 2016). Snapchat’s user growth rate has slowed down sequentially but is still growing by double-digits year-on-year.Stories ClonesSnapchat has a pretty impressive history as a product innovator; not only through the intentionally ephemeral nature of its messages (or snaps), but also by pioneering the very popular augmented reality features in its messaging app. Another innovation that has done well is the Stories feature, which we have heard so much about having been cloned by Instagram. The idea behind Stories is that people enjoy seeing updates from friends in chronological order rather than in the standard timeline usually featured on social networks.Snapchat was the first one to come up with a chronological autoplay feature for messages. Besides being a more natural way to consume content, a product feature like Stories also has advantages with regards to ad placements, as ads can be inserted into the message presentation that Stories really is. Ads are shown full-screen and (at least shortly) demand the user’s full attention instead of being (largely) ignored on a timeline scroll-down.Screenshot from Snap’s S-1 showing the process of delivering ads in Stories. The commercial advantage of a stories feature over a timeline is pretty obvious as ads (briefly) occupy the full screen.Stories is a very simple concept that works well and, at least in hindsight, seems like the most obvious way to display updates on a social network. But, as with any innovation, someone still has to come up with up it first.Facebook (FB) has been copying some of the most popular features first designed by Snapchat, including Stories and lenses, for its own social networks. Instagram Stories has been mentioned often in the press as an example of the rising competition, but Messenger, Facebook and Whatsapp have also been updated with similar features.Like most analysts, I do believe that Facebook’s cloning has led to a deceleration of user growth at Snapchat, as users can now conveniently use similar features in apps they already have installed. On the other hand, press reports citing Instagram Stories as surging past Snapchat in terms of user counts are technically correct, but it is important to realize that Instagram Stories is a feature inside the Instagram app, and not a separate product. The rapid growth of this feature is therefore not really surprising as the hurdle for existing Instagram users to adopt it is really low.Facebook has taken some criticism for shamelessly copying the popular features of its competitor, but that is simply how the game of capitalism works. Mark Zuckerberg knows a good idea when he sees it and he cannot afford to have qualms about copying them. Most insider accounts of him, like the ones from The Facebook Effect or Hatching Twitter, all point towards him being a very tough competitor who has successfully employed a sell-to-me-or-else strategy to take out emerging competitors.He failed to buy control of Twitter and Snapchat but has largely succeeded in forcing Twitter into a niche role. Snapchat was approached by him as well, with an offer for $3 billion, which Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy turned down. As could be expected, Mark then turned to copying their product instead.If we look past Snap’s dismal numbers for the first half of 2017, we can actually see some positive things happening. Snap’s management has a history of coming up with highly engaging new product features, which in my opinion gives Snapchat a decent chance to succeed despite the increasing competition from Facebook’s ecosystem. But they do have to move rapidly in terms of product innovation if they want to compete effectively with substantially larger competitors like Facebook.Product Improvements: DiscoverThe key to success will rest on Snap’s ability to tap into the rapidly expanding market for online video advertisements. So far, internet ad giants Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook have been very successful in drawing print ads online, but the tech firms are increasingly looking for a piece of the advertising budgets still spent on tv. Given that television advertising spend is about as big as all the money spent on online advertising, the potential prize for those who can successfully tap into these budgets is very large.Facebook, Twitter and Snap are all moving into premium video content for precisely this reason. And as this shift is in the early stages, Snapchat still has a decent chance of securing a position in this market, despite the increased competition.The Discover feature of Snapchat, which was launched in early 2015, is the company's best bet for tapping into video ads. Discover is the fourth screen in the app, after the Snap, Chat and Stories screens, and features premium content delivered to Snapchat by content partners like Vice, MTV and NatGeo. Content consists of short video segments with occasional photos or text-based information, and is used to deliver news and entertainment.The main benefit of having this type of content is that you can sell ad inventory in a controlled content environment, which other platforms like YouTube currently lack. Brand owners usually prefer this type of ad delivery because there is less risk of your brand being associated with controversial content. YouTube for instance suffered through something of an advertisers’ revolt last year because it was placing ads before or in video rolls containing, among other things, extreme political messages.Screenshot taken by the author of the Discover screen inside the Snapchat app. Content partners deliver premium entertainment and news stories to Snapchat in this screen.Being associated with inappropriate content has been a concern for advertisers for as long as online advertising has been around. Therefore, if the tech companies want to draw tv advertising budgets online, which are usually intended for brand building, they really should offer the advertiser a premium content environment. Facebook is already moving in this direction with a separate tab in its app called Facebook Watch, which is specifically designed to deliver premium video content.The attractiveness of premium video is not just the ability to sell advertising against it, but episodic video can also be a great way to drive higher user engagement. Additionally, exclusive content can be a great way to bring in new users and may help Snapchat to respark user growth.Snapchat Discover offers content partners a 50-50 share of ad revenue for exclusive content, which increasingly includes short-form shows. Because it can be used to move more aggressively into online shows, the Discover feature has significant potential for advertising revenue growth.Product Improvements: Snap MapA relatively recent addition to the Snapchat app is Snap Map, which can be accessed by pinching the home screen in the app. Just like Stories, Snap Map is also a very engaging feature for the user while at the same time offering Snap potentially lucrative commercial benefits. It is a social map, which allows you to share your geographical position and your snaps with friends or the public at large. Your position is identified by a bitmoji, which is a cartoon-like version of you.I think Snap Map is an engaging way to discover other people’s snaps, oftentimes taken at parties, concerts or sporting events. It is pretty fun to watch what other people are doing in your neighbourhood, or even in the world at large. It also helps Snapchat to improve discoverability in the app, which compared to other social networks is quite low.Screenshot of Snap Map, showing a selection of public snaps in the Los Angeles area, taken from Snapchat by the author. Zooming in and out of areas will change the selection of snaps. Colors ranging from green to red indicate Snap activity in a given area. Some Snaps are highlighted by an editorial team at Snapchat.The commercial benefit of Snap Map is quite obvious. Using Snap Map forces a user to allow the app to track their location, which the company will use to measure the success of advertisements. The company will be able to, for instance, track whether a user who was shown a retailer’s ad actually visited one of the retailer’s stores within a certain period after the impression was delivered.This is attractive for a company selling online ads because those are the kind of metrics highly sought after by people controlling advertising budgets. Snapchat has been criticized for instance for generally offering advertisers a lower level of ad efficiency metrics, which this new feature can help to address.ConclusionSnap still carries a premium valuation despite selling below its IPO price of $17. Even if the company manages to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, which is uncertain, the company still sells for a hefty 17x current year’s sales. Given the lack of profits or positive cash flows, price/sales may be the most useful valuation metric for Snap, and becomes more meaningful when combined with user growth and user monetization estimates.Even though user growth slowed to +4% on a sequential basis in Q2, the company’s revenue growth rates are expected to remain very high as the company squeezes more ad dollars out of every existing user. As for the competition with Instagram, I believe Snapchat’s best shot at keeping Instagram at bay is in its decision to double down on original shows in its Discover feature. This is not something Instagram currently offers and it has the potential to become a user destination for unique content. Having a hit show for instance could spark some new life into the app’s user growth rate.I am keeping an eye on the company's progress, but I do not believe Snap is a highly favorable bet at this price. There is no question that Instagram Stories has thrown a wrench in Snapchat’s flywheel and repairing the damage will take time and significant effort. But I am also not writing Snap off entirely; social networks may be platform businesses but, in my opinion, the social media landscape is not destined for a winner-takes-most scenario. Facebook’s ecosystem itself shows that different apps will be used for different purposes by a user base with significant overlap. After all, having a number of different social media apps on your smartphone and switching between them requires little effort.Snapchat therefore has a chance to succeed even in a mobile universe dominated by Facebook. But it does have to maintain a differentiated functionality over Instagram, which will require continuous product innovation and offering access to unique content.

I continue to stay far away from the stock.","It looked like an innocent little software feature embedded in a newly launched mobile device. But it might have been a preview of Snap's (SNAP) ultimate demise.Credit: Financial TimesOn Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) announced its top-of-the-line smartphone, the iPhone X. Among all the high-end hardware features presented during the company's launch event held in Cupertino, one demonstration caught my attention. Of all things, I was impressed with Animojis: ""facial recognition software that will transform your expressions into an animated emoji,"" as properly described by the Mirror.iPhone X users will now be able to record videos of him or herself as moving emojis and share the messages in audio and video with friends via iMessage and, I assume, other communication platforms. The feature is made possible due to Apple's TrueDepth camera, capable of analyzing 50 muscle movements and translating face motion onto the screen quite accurately.Source: DM Martins Research montage using Apple's event videoTo be clear, I don't believe that a talking chicken that mimics someone's expression in real time is either that groundbreaking of a concept or a game changer in smartphone user experience. Having barely missed the millennial generation window by a few years, I actually find the whole concept fun yet silly. However, after watching Apple's live Animoji's demonstration, I couldn't help but immediately think about Snapchat.Snap's flagship social media platform became known for incorporating augmented reality into the way people communicate online. For a few months, users that vomited rainbows and wore cat ears while talking to their friends became the company's signature. That is, until Facebook (FB) with its nearly $6 billion-a-year R&D budget (the equivalent of about 15 times Snap's 2016 total revenues) quickly caught on to the trend, and with the snap of a finger (pun intended), introduced augmented reality filters into its much more popular and widely-used Instagram platform.Now, none other than the most valuable company in the world, maker of arguably the most successful mobile device ever marketed, has entered Snap's turf. Apple has integrated hardware (new camera) with software to offer its own version of what has helped make Snap an early success story. It is true that Animojis alone do not replace the full features offered by the Snapchat social platform. But in my view, it is a first step in that direction, with the added benefit of simplicity and ease of use provided by the integrated solution that does not rely on third-party platforms to operate.But aren't these tech and social media behemoths just copying Snap's features and product development strategies? Yes, and I think Snap's management team deserves some brownie points for breaking ground and making the big wigs in the industry follow the lead of a young, six-year old tech company.But when it comes to business, it's all about protecting the platform and building barriers to entry. As I see it, Snap has unsurprisingly not been able to do either, and I don't think there is much that the young company can do about it. The social media and online communication space is fertile ground for competitors of all sizes to try their luck, and for big names like Apple, Facebook and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) to nimbly incorporate the best practices into their well-developed platforms and ecosystems. In the case of Snap, it began with Stories and augmented reality, and competition quickly caught up. Whatever the Venice, California-based company chooses to focus on next, whether hardware like drones and glasses or something else, I fear that its older brothers will be right there, either one step behind or several ahead, to eat its lunch.Traders might choose to take a swing at SNAP. Given the stock's wild volatility since the IPO, there is likely lots of profits to be made (long and short) in the near term. But staring farther down the road and looking through the lenses of long-term investing, I believe Snap is in trouble. For that reason, I continue to stay far away from the stock.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

4104830,99506,2017-09-07T11:58:52-04:00,"It's time for prudent investors to candidly evaluate the chances for Snap's survival. There are several threats present and future that are potentially lethal for this beleaguered company.The long trail of failed technology companies over the years is littered with victims who were beaten by superior competition. Snap's emerging competitors want its share of the Millennial demographic.Occasionally, we see technology companies with failed business models like the ones prevalent at the peak of the dot.com boom-bust cycle. Snap and Blue Apron are reminiscent of those failures.Snap has both superior competition and also a failed business model at once. The confluence of these factors is causing a surprisingly rapid failure of this recent IPO.Facebook has been an increasingly lethal competitor for Snap, but now Apple's ARKit launch may damage Snap's crucial user engagement with the launch of ARKit on September 12th.","Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) relentless efforts to destroy Snap (NYSE:SNAP) are continuing and increasing. The sharply decelerating growth of Snap's key metrics has been impacted by competition from Facebook. We might expect to see continued efforts by Mark Zuckerberg and company to dismantle Snap. But Snap has another very significant problem looming in addition to the increasing competition from Facebook.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) drops a potentially deadly stealth bomb on Snap this September 12, 2017, with the launch of Apple ARKit. This new technology by one of the world's premier design and engineering teams in Cupertino can be extremely bad news for Snap's chances of survival. Here is why:SNAP data by YChartsNow the upcoming launch of Apple's ARKit in just a few days threatens to undermine Snap's user engagement by possibly stealing away many valuable daily minutes from Snapchat's platform as Millennials gravitate towards the hottest, newest AR technology from Apple. We always suspected that Snap's core demographic of young Millennials might be notoriously fickle and that they could drop Snap like a dancing hot dog just as soon as the next wave of the newest, most exciting technology arrived. Well, that moment arrives on September 12, 2017, as Apple brings the first waves of the world's cutting edge AR technology to market along with the latest iPhone launch. There will be a great many waves of future AR technology innovations from Apple, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and other major tech companies ahead but the first wave hits the beach in only one week.Please watch the brief Walking Dead: 'Our World' Mobile Game Official Trailer found within this link. Now, decide whether users will prefer to spend their available daily minutes playing with Snapchat's dancing hot dog AR character or with the voluminous waves of cutting edge, highly innovative AR tech that will keep coming from Apple and its developer community? The Walking Dead game is just one of thousands of immersive AR games and work tools that will be forthcoming from Apple (and Google's ARCore) in the months and years ahead.The competition for Snap from major tech companies will be fierce in the next generation's newest technology race in AR apps for work and play. The forthcoming AR products from Apple and others will likely bring significant competition for the daily minutes and engagement of Snap's Millennial user base. This will very likely diminish Snapchat's user engagement greatly as Millennials migrate towards the marketplace's next hot, new technology. Alas, Snap's dancing hot dog's claim to AR fame may be roasted, toasted, and eaten alive by the competition that is now about to arrive upon the beleaguered recent IPO headquartered in Venice Beach.Apple AR products may significantly damage Snap's user engagement minutes by taking Snapchat users off of Snap's platform while they are immersed in superior AR technology from Apple's ARKit. This potential negative impact upon Snap's user base may be devastating to the already failing business model at Snap.The graphic below is Snap's Q217 Consolidated Statements From Operations excerpted from the company's 10-Q. Please note that Total Costs and Expenses of approx. $630 million exceeded Revenues of approx. $181 million by a ratio of about 3.5:1. With increasing competition from superior competitors like Apple and Google within a saturated U.S. marketplace (where Snap derives over 80% of its revenues), it is difficult to envision the company's future revenues ever exceeding its rapidly growing expenses. Snapchat infamously warned during the IPO that it ""may never achieve profitability.""With rising competition for Snap from other major tech firms, the company may experience: increasing expenses, slowing growth, and its warning that there may not be a pathway to profitability ever. Trader's Idea Flow believes that it is time to begin monitoring Snap's dwindling IPO capital:In addition, Snap spent another $135 million in July 2017 on an acquisition of an advertising measurement company. This reduces the company's total current assets to under $2.9 billion.It is anticipated that Snap will continue to post consecutive quarterly losses until 2021 according to Morgan Stanley. Prudent investors must question whether Snap's IPO money will run out prior to that date, or if the company can ever achieve profitability. It is noteworthy that Snap has never been profitable in its private or public history.Snap's losses during the company's first two quarters as a public company have been staggering with a Q2'17 net loss of $443 million. If the company is unable to improve its operations above this level, then the IPO capital would be gone in less than seven quarters or under two years from now. With increasing competition emerging from major technology firms for Snap's user base, there is no guarantee that it will be able to improve beyond its current failing level of operational losses.It should be noted that Snap has potential legal liabilities as well that could significantly impact the company's total current assets. One such liability is the patent infringement lawsuit by UnitedCorp regarding the crucial GeoFilters location feature that is integral to Snap's app. UnitedCorp has received an independent valuation of its technology of $1 billion. Without GeoFilters, Snap's platform, Snapchat, would be negatively impacted. GeoFilters are crucial to the functionality of Snapchat. If UnitedCorp were to win this lawsuit or if Snap were forced to settle this lawsuit, it could be very expensive. This could reduce the amount of Snap's total current assets by up to $1 billion, although a settlement could possibly cost less. Still, this issue bears watching as the lawsuit has already been filed in the federal court of Canada and is likely to also be filed in U.S. courts.While Snap's fundamentals are being destroyed by superior competition from Facebook and now possibly Apple, it is clear that Google will bring further competition to the Android market with its ARCore products. This level of intense competition from these major tech firms that all covet Snap's market share in the Millennial demographic for their own products would likely be enough to cause a continuation of the failure of Snap's business model until its IPO money runs out. A secondary by Snap, if offered, could be perceived as an act of desperation. The market would recognize this attempt to stay alive for a while longer. So the terms of that secondary would likely be disastrous for existing shareholders.As Apple (and Google) raise the bar on state-of-the-art AR technology far above Snap's current capabilities, the underdog from Venice Beach likely has no option but to increase R&D spending to try and compete with these major tech firms. Snap might also have to increase stock-based compensation for the recruitment and maintenance of talent for its team of designers and engineers, which is more bad news for existing shareholders.This ramp of R&D spend might cause expenses to skyrocket out of control even further in coming quarters, thereby depleting the dwindling IPO money faster. But if Snap hopes to have any chance whatsoever of maintaining engagement and even tepid growth of its user base, then it simply must answer the bell for the next round of competition in the AR battle against the major tech firms of the world. Even if Snap can bring itself to enter the ring for this newest round of competition, it is clear that Snap lacks the talent and financing to compete in the R&D wars against major tech firms over the long term. It may be time to consider Snap's chances for survival in the future as the advent of new AR technology may cause Snap's dwindling IPO money to disappear faster than has been expected.Skyrocketing expenses, combined with slowing growth of users and revenues, have been the prevalent theme for Snap's first two quarterly reports since coming public. And this was prior to the upcoming launch of Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore. How will Snap possibly match the R&D and compensation spending of major tech firms to innovate new AR technology that will enable Snap to maintain its user base and crucial user engagement?Candidly, even if Snap answers the bell for this round of competition, which is by no means a given, the recent IPO simply does not have the financials to compete in future rounds of competition. It is time for investors to be honest: Snap's chances for future survival are decreasing by the quarter.Sadly, Snap may already be destined to become just another failed tech stock on the heap of discarded and broken companies in tech. Many of these failed companies were smashed by superior competition. Others were betrayed by their own failed business model. Snap is experiencing both superior competition and its own failed business model together at the same time. This may very likely be a lethal combination of factors for Snap."

4103334,22445,2017-08-31T11:26:07-04:00,"SNAP has been the easiest stock in world for me to short.Even if I was initially wrong, time was on my side and eventually, the money came to me.I did not expect SNAP to rally from its lows to $15. Short it once more for easy money.","You gotta love this market. I mean it's so predictable, it's getting too easy. And by that I mean the speculation crowd. It's getting to a point where all you have to do to make money in this market is to either sell a high-flying expensive stock before earnings, or buy it afterwards. It will tank after earnings, and then rally as if nothing happened, because everybody forgets why the stock tanked after earnings reports.Take Snap (SNAP) for example. The stock tanked right after its latest quarter, but since then has rallied from its recent lows. Has anything changed to justify this rally? I don't think so.SNAP data by YChartsIt remains to be seen if short covering was the reason for the rally (chart above). However, I doubt it. Strategic short sellers short for good reasons, not just to trade.And the reason they have shorted about 70M SNAP shares thus far, is because they know an expensive stock, that will go down, when they see oneI am also guessing that short interest will increase in the future, as the IPO lockup period expired a short while ago.SNAP data by YChartsThe above chart of SNAP shows its trajectory over the past month. The question is, what were the news headlines responsible for the stock's rally from its all-time low of $11.80, to about $15?To begin with right after the company's Q2'17 report, we had an avalanche of downgrades with lower price targets. Susquehanna cut its price target to $10, UBS to $12 from $19, Piper Jaffray to $12.50, and Barclays and Citi both cut their price targets to $13.Only Goldman Sachs is keeping the faith, with a target of $23, but also down from a previous target of $27. In fact, even SNAP's lead underwriter Morgan Stanley lowered its price target to $14 from a previous $16. And if you missed it, my target is about $7 a share (and I am being generous).Have analysts upgraded their EPS estimates for SNAP shares recently?SourceNo, in fact, analysts have increased their estimate for EPS losses, both for this year and next year. And in my opinion, it will take a long time before we see upward revisions.I simply think this market has become complacent. This market has not corrected for a long time, and everyone has forgotten what it feels like to lose money. And when speculation is rampant, I feel defensive, which is why I have increased my cash levels over the past several weeks.Another reason why I think SNAP rallied is because the founding shareholders said they would not sell shares this year. But is this a good enough reason? If you are speculating and trading short term yes, however, outside of that no. SNAP is still a very expensive stock anyway you look at it.Please note SNAP's market cap has risen to almost $18B once more. If analysts are correct, SNAP will do about $900M in revenue this year. If you do the math, that comes out to a Price/Sales ratio of 20!And if I am right that the social space is saturated, I think analysts are wrong modeling revenue growth of 100% for SNAP in 2018. But even if revenue grows by that much, buying any stock at 20X revenue with massive losses does not make any investment sense in my book. Please also consider my previous articles as to why SNAP is overvalued here and here.So kudos for speculators that bought SNAP because the founding shareholders said they would not sell shares. I take my hat off to you, because you are a much better speculator than me.SNAP is the easiest stock in the world to short. At least it has been for me. Even when out of the money, I let time do its business, and eventually, the money came to me. The chances of success are on our side, by virtue of the fact that is such an expensive stock.I shorted SNAP a bunch of times, covering and shorting based on the charts. The last time I covered was around $15. After that SNAP went to $18, but I was greedy and thought it might go higher, so I did not short.It hovered at $18 for a while, and then it was all downhill from there. But when I tried to sort once more, I could not find shares. However, my last successful trade was right before earnings, and I covered the next day at the open close to the very bottom.And while I covered with the intention of shorting again, I was not expecting the stock to rally to $15. So here we are and SNAP is giving me a chance to short it once more. Thank you Mr. Market."
4103423,102757,2017-08-31T14:59:00-04:00,"Snap's second quarter was disappointing.While the company's sequential DAU growth rate of 4.4% represents an 17% annualized growth rate, it is not enough to justify the valuation.Snap is hanging in there but the current premium is too much to pay for an unproven story.","Introduction While Snap (SNAP) disappointed analysts for the second time since the IPO, the stock has now run up quite significantly. Therefore, it is perhaps wise to ask whether the new valuation is justified or presents an opportunity.  I’ll be discussing the biggest takeaway. By far the biggest takeaway is that Snap’s DAU growth is slowing.   Snap gets a pass Snap's DAUs grew by 7 million while analysts were expecting 9 million in growth. The 7 million addition was less than the previous quarter's 8 million. A sequential decline is unacceptable if you are pitched as a growth story. After all, the only reason that growth stories get a “pass” on valuations is because of the growth rate.   I should note that growth stories do not necessarily get a “pass.” Rather, the growth is fast and today’s valuations appear extreme, while the valuation is actually based on performance a year or even two, three years from now. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) appears extremely overvalued given that the stock trades at a P/E of 242 and a forward P/E of 117. If you perform a DCF valuation Amazon appears roughly fairly valued. This also would be the case if you applied analyst 2020 estimates to your PE calculation.   In any case, SNAP is valued much the same way. On top of that, SNAP is still early in the monetization stage, which means revenue growth is not necessarily the best metric. Therefore, analysts have flocked to the DAU metric. The reasoning is simple, if you simply apply a mature monetization stage, you can figure out earnings based on DAU growth.   This is why the DAU figure is one of the most important metrics to watch. A growth of 7 million DAU represents a sequential growth rate of 4.4%. This doesn’t look too impressive but works out to be a 17% annual growth rate. Double-digit growth rates are always a positive, but given that SNAP only has 171 million DAUs, it is a very underwhelming development.   Explaining away the lower growth rate I need not point to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) early growth rates. They are not comparable. It would appear to me that management is trying to pass off this lower than normal growth rate by blaming competitors. Competitors are using growth hacking methods that supposedly hurt the platform’s relationship with users. Given that SNAP is not using these supposedly harmful metrics, it would follow that the growth rate is not as extraordinary as that of the competitors that do use these methods. Well, SNAP seems to be growth hacking as well. Perhaps they are just less effective?   Here’s a quote from an analyst inquiring about the matter:  “Evan on your first investor call and actually Imran have just mentioned it earlier as well. You have both spoken about how others use growth hacking to inflate DAUs and that would really hurt the platform's relationship with users yet we definitely over the past quarter began to see push notifications from Snapchat essentially alerting us to one of our friends or one of our connections has published story would you like to go and see it. Wondering the comments earlier has your philosophy on growth hacking begun to change.”And here's Evan Spiegel’s, CEO, response:  “Yes, I think there are plenty of examples online if you want to go for a Google, but I think the most important thing for us is that when we are telling you about content on a service that is really highly relevant to you and from your very close friends and I think if people as they become more reliant on push notifications to sort of relax the standards there and I think it's important for our business.”If this answer seems unclear to you, do not worry, you’re not the only one. This question was actually the prelude to a hot mic moment wherein the analyst’s co-worker exclaimed while laughing: “I didn’t even understand his response!”  It would appear that the CEO is trying to say that they are sending “better” push notifications because they are only doing it when it’s “really highly” relevant for you and your friends. Clearly, any company using push notifications would claim that it is only used when “really highly” relevant.   The good news It’s clear that SNAP is trying to growth hack just like its competitors. Perhaps the reality is that it just isn’t as good as its competitors. On the one hand, this should be seen as a positive. Not wanting to growth hack was a bit of an arrogant attitude. It implied that SNAP was above such tactics, while it’s clearly a legitimate and valuable marketing strategy. The fact that SNAP is not as good at it as its competitor means that growth can be accelerated as the team improves.   SNAP’s growth story doesn’t appear dead as of yet. Getting better at growth hacking shouldn’t be a problem considering the means the company has at its disposal.   Conclusion still overpriced  Snap appears overpriced to me. The company is burning cash and growth is slowing. At the same time, investors are paying 30x its sales. If you remember, I explained that growth stories are valued on expected revenue and earnings two or sometimes three years ahead. If we take SNAP’s 2Q17 earnings and apply a 20% sequential growth rate for the next 10 quarters, we’ll find that annualized revenues should be $4.5 billion. In other words, you are still paying 3.3 times sales, while expecting a very tall order of 20% sequential revenue growths for 10 straight quarters.   It appears unwise to pay such a hefty premium if we now factor in that the company has Facebook as its competitor. In a previous article, I called Snap Facebook’s R&D lab. Snapchat does, Facebook copies. There is nothing proprietary from Snapchat so there is no reason for me to believe they can fend of Facebook and its vast resources."
4104516,103600,2017-09-06T12:50:58-04:00,Underpriced IPO turned into an overpriced stock in the short term.Snap stock is experiencing significant downward price pressure due to poor earnings reports and lockup expirations.Executive management and its young team are in the post-IPO learning phase.Company is facing hard competition due to Facebook's Instagram stories.Huge upside potential in the long term if strategic acquisitions are made in the US and in Europe.,"Source: DreamstimeSnap Inc. (SNAP) recently reported its second earnings 112 trading days after it went public as an early-stage social media platform on March 2, 2017. The disappointing results, the unwillingness to provide Street guidance in the subsequent conference call and the final lockup expiration on August 14, 2017 has been driving down the share price by more than 40% since the first day closing on the day of the IPO.Probably this was the major reason for the company founders of Snap to announce that they won't sell any of their stock in 2017 in order to give existing and potential investors confidence regarding the upcoming share price movements.Despite all of the short-term difficulties of this young start-up company, it might make a run in the long term. The potential of Snap to be the next Facebook is very real as it all depends on the management's ability to ensure further internal growth as well as business expansion of the company.The company's share price tanked by 52% from the IPO date in March 2017 to the end of the second lockup period in August 2017 as you can see from the chart below. In other words, the IPO turned out to be overpriced due to the poor share price performance in the aftermath.This was primarily driven by disappointing earnings results due to the slow user growth as many features are being imitated by its rival Facebook (FB) and that it was not generating more revenues through its app during the first and the second quarter. Another reason was the IPO lockup expiration periods, allowing the early insiders and employees to dump their shares, which simply caused investor fear.Source: TradingView, CNBC, Own calculationsShort sellersBecause of the very bearish stock phase, it shouldn't be surprising that Snap is one of the most-shorted tech IPOs of the year, with a high number of traders, here for example one trader betting either legal (covered short selling) or illegal (uncovered short selling = naked short selling) that the stock will fall. In June 2017, Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Instinet commented this behavior as follows:Unlike covered short selling, (uncovered) naked shorting is the illegal practice of short shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. In other words, ""you are selling something which you don't own"" and because of this it is most unlikely that you can do this as a retail investor via your broker. In the following, we will see the historical naked short volume chart and data for Snap for the past 20 trading days.Source: Naked Short ReportAccording to the report, the stock has been systematically naked shorted since August 8, 2017. The naked short selling accounts for 3 to 16 million shares daily. We also see that there is a general up-trend of naked short selling for the last 5 trading days with the highest % of volume shorted on last Thursday's trading day (65%).Source: Naked Short ReportDue to the high number of short sellers, whether covered or naked, we understand that Snap is not only a heavily-shorted stock but also take away that most short sellers simply expect that Snap will keep on having significant downward price pressure by the share dump, mainly due to the lockup expiration and the next (third) earnings report in November 2017.Institutional InvestorsDespite the high short selling pressure however, the stock has recovered by 21% since the end of the lockup period on August 14, 2017, mainly due to the fact that institutional investors started to add more shares, which can be explained by the following quote from Michael Graham, an Analyst of Canaccord Genuity:The following table represents the Top 10 Institutional Investors of Snap based on last Tuesday's closing (09/05/2017) and shows that most of them added more shares since the lockup expiration with the largest adds highlighted in yellow.Source: Fintel, Own calculationT. Rowe Price Associates has become the largest institutional investor with 37.9 million shares (19.2% of total), followed by a massive share purchase by Lone Pine Capital (+325%) and Sands Capital Management (+44%), respectively. It can be assumed that investors believe the bottom price of $11.83 per share was reached with the lockup expiration, making them so confident to buy more shares for a low price.The previous largest institutional investor FMR however, sold 55% of its shares when the price bounced back up to $15.19 per share and is now the third largest institutional owner of Snap. The reason for the huge sell-off is most likely due to profit taking. Interestingly, we observed a huge increase of naked short selling in the subsequent days of the FMR sell-off (see Naked Short Report).Retail investors and traders should keep an eye on this as the change of institutional ownership is an excellent indicator regarding the level of confidence of the professional investors towards the firm's future and its management.Analyst RatingsAs a consequence of the overall poor stock performance and its short-term outlook, Wall Street Analysts have substantially downgraded Snap with lower price targets.Source: The Wall Street JournalAs we can see from the snapshot above, the current analyst consensus recommends to ""hold"" (19) the stock, offset by a ""buy"" consensus with 11 analysts. The average stock price target is now at $15.26, giving an upside potential of 6.9% based on the last price from Friday, September 1, 2017.ManagementSource: nymagSnap company founders, Evan Spiegel (27) who is in the CEO role and Bobby Murphy (29) who is in the CTO role, belong to the youngest billionaires in the world for a very good reason: Driven by a genius idea and the entrepreneurial spirit during their studies at Stanford University, they together worked and created social media app Snapchat, targeting teens and young adults in the U.S. and ultimately resulted in 170 million daily users for the app between the ages of 18 and 34.The on average young user loves the app due to the mix of adventure, young and rebel spirit, something very new, fun and probably the fact that it is not a part of the ""giant Facebook network where you could even find your parents profile."" The outstanding success story of the young start-up tech firm with now roughly 2,500 employees and its astonishing beachfront offices in Venice, California, resulted in the debut as Snap Inc. on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2017.Since the IPO however, Snap now as a listed company is facing rough winds in the finance world as it, for example, comes along with obligations to deliver results on time, at least five times a year (quarterly earnings and year-end report), to address analyst questions in conference calls in a professional manner and to act in the best interest of its shareholders at any time. Because of the two special characteristics, questions raise up if the young leadership team is capable to lead Snap in the post-IPO area.In my opinion, people should not forget what Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy have achieved so far from scratch. I agree that they both still have to learn and improve a lot, but as times goes by, they will get used to the new professional environment and be more mature with the right people and mentors on their side. But one thing investors and analyst should never forget: If the founders would not have had this young, rebel and funny California character that created this outstanding app, Snap would probably never be successful!Like Facebook, when Snap made its market debut, it was the star in the tech world; however, shares plunged fast in the first weeks and months after the IPO (Day 1), especially with regard to the lockup expirations as we can see from the chart below, representing historical share price developments between Snap and Facebook since Day 1.Source: Yahoo Finance for Snap, Yahoo Finance for FB, CNBC, CNN MoneyBased on time series analysis between the two companies from Day 1 to Day 130, I calculated a 67.3% correlation coefficient, which indicates a positive association and can be also seen in the chart above. The reason why I computed with maximum 130 days is mainly driven by the fact that it was the last available record day of Snap after the IPO. Although this is not a reliable measurement to predict the upcoming share price development of Snap in the future, we must admit that there are some similarities between both the companies.Interestingly, Facebook stock rose when its lockup ended, in part because the company bears had highlighted the date so aggressively that bulls were waiting for the expiration to jump in. We also know that Snap stock recently started to rise when its lockup ended, mainly due to the confirmation of the co-founders that they will not sell their shares by end of 2017.Competitor LandscapeBased on the IPO prospectus from Snap, the company stated the following regarding its competitors:Its largest competitor however is Facebook, especially its internet-based photo-sharing application and service that allows users to share pictures and videos either publicly or privately, Instagram. Due to the slow user growth among teens and young adults in the U.S., Instagram has massively started to clone most of Snap's features aiming to attract young people from Snap to Instagram = Facebook. The CEO of Snap responded to that action in a conference call for the first quarter in 2017:Without naming Snap, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an earnings call for the first quarter:The fight with Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg about the strong dominance in the mobile engagement and advertising will continue. Please keep in mind that CEO Evan Spiegel rejected a $3 billion buyout offer from CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2013. The key to happiness here is on how can CEO Evan Spiegel make sure that he will remain in a unique position with its app without losing its young customer base to Instagram?Talent Acquisition Although the company did leave money on the table by raising only $3.4 billion when it went public, net proceeds should give the company at least a greater ability to compete for talent and acquisitions against larger Internet companies like Facebook, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) or Twitter (TWTR). Getting the right people to innovate and grow the business is far more important in achieving overall goals than any other part of a business plan. People are one of the largest investment a company makes.Because of that, management has to make sure that they keep on hiring developers, designers and marketing guys in order to ensure the competitive advantage against Silicon Valley rivals. A huge plus point is the beach office at Venice Beach in the Los Angeles area as we can also see in a review note from Glassdoor:Based on the most recent job openings, I feel comfortable for the company's ambition to compete with Facebook. A lot of people will be hired in the fields of engineering, operations, sales and even legal; however, I don't see any open positions asking for Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) specific guys in the Finance & Accounting department (see attachment), which makes me feel uncomfortable. Source: SnapWhen Snap went public, the management stated in the IPO prospectus at that time:A half year later, it appears to me that management is still not considering to grow its business via strategic acquisitions in the short term. On the other hand, I must admit that I don't have insights on the current size of the M&A team. I will discuss the importance of strategic acquisitions for a business in the next point.Growing through M&A transactions/buyout optionMergers and Acquisitions (M&A) are a great way to grow a business without having to wait years for the marketing and sales strategy to pay off. When you need immediate growth for your business, this can be the best option for you that provides instant results.Since its IPO in March 2, 2017, Snap completed two transaction with a total deal value of $450 million. The good news is that the management did a strategic acquisition out of the US; however, the bad news is that this is not enough when you want to grow and expand your business faster.Source: MergerMarketThe amount of Snap post-IPO transactions (2) is still low in comparison to 5 post-IPO transactions Facebook had in 2012, with Instagram Inc. as the most important one. Facebook has even made a total of 37 post-IPO transactions in the US and in Europe, resulting in a total deal value of more than $19 billion. One of the most prestigious transaction was the acquisition of WhatsApp Inc. for $16 billion in 2014.Please note that not all transactions made by Facebook were disclosed with deal values. Because of this, the total amount Facebook did spend for all the transactions ($19 billion) could be even much higher.That being said, Facebook's success has been made by external growth through M&A transactions, leading to more revenue streams and a dominating market position in the world. If Snap would follow the same idea by doing some strategic acquisitions in the following months and years, I have no doubt that it can expand its products to the rest of the world much easier with even higher revenue potentials. One company that comes to mind as a strategic fit to Snap's business model would be GoPro (GRPO).Based on the news on August 3, 2017, it appears that a buyout option is still not off the table, especially if the management determines business growth issues in the near term.Snap offers significant opportunity as an investment in the long run if the management is able to address Wall Street concerns in the short term. In doing so, the company is hiring heavily to come up with the next great feature for users and new advertising products for its customers. For the greater achievement in the long term however, management must be also willing to expand its business through a series of strategic transactions in the US and abroad.Overall, I believe that an investment in Snap's stock is still risky. However, I will keep on tracking this stock and will update my recommendation with the next earnings report in November 2017.Author's note: If you liked my article, then don't miss the next one I will publish by clicking the orange ""Follow"" button at the top of this page or my profile.

(NYSE:SNAP). Maybe it's too soon to be worried about this. But a convincing strategy for making money is an important part of a business plan, and Snap doesn't have one right now. Unlike Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), the Snapchat app relies on expensive third-party hosting. Snap's gross margin is only 16.25%, which is tiny compared to that of other social media stocks.Despite significant gross margin improvement in the second quarter, Snap's contracts with its hosting providers may freeze the company in a cash-burning situation if ARPUs aren't high enough.In the second quarter, Snap increased its gross margin by doubling ARPU, while hosting costs per user remained relatively flat. But although hosting didn't scale with revenue last quarter, the situation can quickly change.Snap's agreement with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) requires the purchase of at least $400.0 million in services for each year of the 5-year contract. If the minimum isn't reached, Snap will be required to pay the difference. The agreement with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) requires that Snap pay at least $1 billion by 2021. Hosting commitments total $1.13 billion for 2018 and 2019, which divides into $575 per year, which is 142% of 2016 revenue. (Data Source: Q217 Item 1: 10-Q)Snap's hosting providers seemed to have hedged their risk against lower-than-expected purchases, while keeping their upside intact at the company's expense. Hopefully, Snap got a good price in return for its risk. But if the company needs more than its minimum hosting expenditure, costs will scale directly with a major growth driver until the contracts are renegotiated.Snap's future depends on its ability to increase average revenue per user (ARPU). If the company succeeds at this, it can grow without dramatically increasing hosting costs or relying on its DAU/MAU growth. Snap's ARPU was $1.05 as of the most recent quarter. This is more than double last year's ARPU, but not all regions contribute equally.Snap's U.S. ARPU is a healthy $1.97, while Europe and ROW ARPUs are $0.39 and $0.29, respectively. These numbers are significantly lower than Facebook's, but they are comparable to where Facebook was at this point in its lifecycle. That being said, unlike Facebook, Snapchat has to overcome the hurdle of hosting costs; these were $0.61 per DAU as of the second quarter.Snap's international operations are deeply in the red. And even if ARPU grows to, say, $1.00 per user with zero hosting cost growth, the company will still struggle to generate EBITDA after including other costs of revenue on top of operating expenses. To put a $1.50 ARPU for ROW in perspective, consider that this is less than Facebook managed to generate for this region in the second quarter of 2017.Snap's low-margin business model gives it an uncertain pathway to profitability. The company's hosting agreements are risky and could cause its costs to scale too much with its revenue growth drivers.The good news is that revenue can be driven by ARPU growth, while hosting costs are probably driven by MAU/DAU growth or user activity levels. But because user growth is so expensive, I think Snap should increase ARPU at the expense of user growth and focus on the highest-margin regions of the world.With Snap's high hosting costs, large-scale international expansion seems out of the question unless ROW ARPUs increase dramatically. The company may need to focus on leveraging its demographic advantage over Facebook to command premium prices from advertisers in the U.S. Right now, even Snap's U.S. ARPU is low, but there is room for improvement."
4104202,101863,2017-09-05T13:39:45-04:00,"Institutional ownership in Snap remained low at 24% at the end of 2Q17, according most recent ownership data filed with the SEC by August 15.In this article, I discuss significant ownership developments, which may give us clues as to what heavy hitters are thinking about the company.I continue to remain on the sidelines primarily due to intensifying competition from Instagram Stories.","Within 45 days after the end of each quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file a Form 13F with the SEC. Most institutional investors wait until the last possible date, so on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15, we see a surge in ""Berkshire Hathaway (or Carl Icahn or David Einhorn etc.) bought/sold these stocks"" type of headlines from financial media outlets.Such news can be important, because after a well-known hedge fund manager or a big-name institutional investor has had a good run with a previous investment, many retail investors follow them into their ""latest pick."" An example of this is after Carl Icahn realized out-of-this-world returns with Netflix (NFLX), many retail investors followed him into Apple (AAPL).The following data from Nasdaq illustrates institutional ownership in Snap Inc. (SNAP) as of June 30, 2017, the most recent date for which the ownership data is available.Readers should note the following observations:The following graph illustrates the short interest in Snap:The short interest in Snap doubled in 2Q17, before the stock price per share took a dive from above $20 in May to below $12 in August. As of the most recent data, the percent of shares outstanding short was near 6%, which is relatively high.I remain on the sidelines for the following reasons:In my recent article, Does Snapchat Stand A Chance Against Instagram? I pointed out that Snapchat is not yet profitable and that I did not see a clear path to profitability in the near future. I further explained that, in addition to substantially increasing its growth rate, the company needs to also substantially expand it average revenue per user, and do so at a relatively low incremental cost of revenue, to achieve profitability. Accomplishing these two goals simultaneously will be challenging because any action taken to increase revenue per user (introducing a subscription service, showing more ads to users, charging advertisers more, etc.) would likely slow down the growth rate.Making things even more challenging for Snap, Instagram Stories has grown at a very rapid and accelerating rate to more than 250 million daily active users, significantly more than Snap's daily active users. As Facebook made it crystal clear during its most recent earnings call, Instagram Stories is a priority for the company.On the positive side, however, Snap's gross profit margin has improved significantly and turned positive in the last quarter:Future quarters will show if the positive trend in Snap's gross profit margin is sustainable as competition from Instagram Stories continues to intensify.Although several major institutional holders in Snap added to their respective positions in 2Q17, Fidelity's sale of more than half of its stake, combined with the still elevated short interest and the low overall institutional ownership in the company, is significant.I am watching the company closely, but I'm not yet convinced that Snap will be able to weather intensifying competition from Instagram Stories.If you enjoyed this article, please scroll up to the top of the page and click the follow button next to my name.

4101268,76115,2017-08-23T10:11:16-04:00,"A new report from eMarketer says teens are leaving Facebook and heading to Snap and Instagram.We've heard this before - quite literally the same argument - yet Facebook has flourished and Snap hasn't had an exciting go at earning money.But, teens are not the real worry for either - instead it's the ad platforms both create and the user information therein.","An eMarketer report surfaced outlining Facebook (FB) is losing traction with teens while Snap (SNAP) is set to gain traction with teens. Instagram is poised to grow at ""Snapchat-like rates"" in the same time frame, also.If this sounds familiar to my Facebook readers - well, it is. Except this time studies have a public company to point to. Back in 2013 this same rhetoric made the rounds and - you guessed it - Facebook was losing teens and Instagram and Snapchat were where they were headed.The problem for this rhetoric is this teen phenomenon has not had any adverse effects on Facebook; it has thrived since those first calls of a teen fleeing problem. Revenue and net income have increased at fantastic growth levels for several years, and this means Facebook didn't depend on teens.FB EPS Diluted (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe reason for this is rather simple and one I've repeated before: Facebook is not only Facebook.com - it's Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Oculus, and, yes, Facebook.com. This is inherently Facebook's advantage as it is a multi-faceted, multi-demographic holding company. So we can very much marginalize any effect this study has on Facebook the company as Instagram is holding up its end of the deal in attracting young folks - if all of this actually does matter in the end.The real question is, are teens worth something major to advertisers? Most people simply say, ""Of course! They are the best to target because of their age!"" Well, ""why?"" is my question. Thirteen year olds are not spending their own money impulsively. They can't easily transact online because they don't have a bank account or credit card. They must use the medium of someone older. There could be something about brick and mortar spending if Snap can perfect offline transactions but again we wind up with the disposable income issue.There are a lot of pain points to get a teenager from ""Ooh I want that!"" to ""Ooh I bought that!"" If I go back to my high school days, I worried more about getting a vehicle and paying for the related expenses - it was not easy to spend cash on myself, let alone on an impulse purchase I saw from an ad.But, if teens are desired for advertisers, then it should be an easy sell for Snap to line up advertisers. Instead Snap moved toward auction-based ads which subsequently lowered ad pricing - and doing so from a position of weakness. On the other end Instagram is also handing out reduced or free ads but from a position of strength. How can Snap compete?It can't.Now the counter argument is Snapchat is an unproven platform. This is true and advertisers need some coercing to try it. This means Snap has two potential problems - one they can control and one they cannot. If it turns out teens are not worth as much to advertisers as many have contended over the last few years, then Snap is dead in the water. It would need to expand outside of the young demographic in order to be viable or completely change its business model somewhere outside of ads.On the other side, Snap has to lure in advertisers with a platform that works. If teens are all it's cracked up to be then all Snap must do is create a painless, efficient platform and the magic happens - with the financials following suit.But, many Snap investors say the two platforms don't compete - they serve different purposes and thus advertisers have every reason to split resources. You know what? For a minute, I'm going to totally agree!The problem is the two companies don't see it that way. If Instagram felt like it didn't need to compete then there's no reason to offer advertisers incentives to use its ads to lure them away from other platforms, namely: Snapchat. That's not to mention the many features it has added which resemble much of Snapchat's functionality.All of this being said, this hand wringing over teens moving from one platform to the other is pretty insignificant - proven in part by Facebook's ability to grow massively in spite of it all. The real limiting factor is the platforms of Snap and Facebook. The latter has had a head start on the former so we can give Snap some slack on getting its act together and its cash burn down. But, Snap isn't going to have any breathing room while Facebook uses its two massive ad machines to pinch it - as it can afford to.But even if Snap creates a great platform and even if teens are the best demographic to ever hit social networking, the company doesn't have near the targeting abilities Facebook has. Instagram can target beyond what users actually share because Facebook shares user information across platforms. Advertisers get the data of Facebook with the attractive and full screen ads of Instagram.Snap may be the sleek looking car while Facebook and Instagram are the typical SUV, but the real power is under the hood. Snap may look attractive at first but taking it for a drive you realize the powertrain is a go-kart engine while the SUV has a V6. Teens or no teens, it's difficult to get your marketing going with a small platform.For either company, teens aren't going to be the issue. The rubber meets the road with social media platforms when they can target the users they have. If a marketer knows it wants to advertise to those with certain interests, they are going to spend their money on a proven platform - like Facebook. While digital advertising isn't a zero-sum game, if Snap can't garner enough revenue to pay for its costs it could be a zero-sum balance sheet.Snap has a long way to go to prove its ad platform. In the meantime Facebook can work from a position of financial and technological strength regardless of teens on Facebook.com being present. The competitiveness between platforms though is inherent and will play a factor in Snap's success.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Facebook and Snap as well as other social media and tech companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4101471,24400,2017-08-23T18:29:51-04:00,"The dark shadow that once hovered over Snap has suddenly been lifted.Tuesday’s close at $14.53 translates to six positive days in the last seven.After punishing long investors over the past three months, SNAP stock has bottomed and is now moving upward with strong momentum.","The spectacle that was the solar eclipse might have come and gone, but that hasn’t been the only dark shadow to disappear. The darkness that once hovered over Snap (SNAP), parent of popular messaging app Snapchat, has suddenly been lifted.Thanks to a flurry of good news, the embattled camera company saw its stock rise 7% Tuesday to close at its highest level in more than a month. And if you’re keeping score at home, Tuesday’s close at $14.53 translates to six positive days in the last seven. Essentially, after punishing long investors over the past three months, SNAP stock has bottomed and is now moving upward with strong momentum.After such a strong move, I would not recommend new money to enter this stock, as I expect a pullback to occur at some point. But current shareholders, those who own the stock at an average price north of $17, can use this current level to average lower. From Tuesday’s close of $14.53, long investors can earn 17% as the stock is a sure-bet to regain its $17 IPO price at least before the end of September. And if you have a longer-term holding period, as I do, SNAP shares are poised to close out the year between $23 and $25, if not higher.Take a look at the chart, courtesy of TradingView.While I have a long term view of SNAP, it’s nonetheless helpful to maintain an informed view of how the market feels about the company. And the dissecting the short-term charts is one of the best ways to gauge not only market sentiment, but also to pinpoint strategic buy signals. In this case, the first buy signal occurred right around $13.50 after the stock had already risen some 20% from its bottom of $11.28 immediately after the lockup expiration came and went.It was clear to me that the downdraft had ended. With insiders seemingly committed to holding on to their positions, who was left to sell? I determined, at that point, there were now more interested buyers than sellers of SNAP. And from a psychological perspective, the market would assume the $17 IPO price as “reasonable” base — a “discounted” level that would become a magnet for buyers, especially given the 9% gap (first red oval) that existed when the stock first dropped below $17 on July 10. If you believe that trading gaps often (I didn’t say “always”) gets filled, as I do, then buying below that level — as the market has begun to do — would be a good trade.Fundamentally, we know the Snap story. The stock, which soared 44% to a high of $29.44 on its first trading day as a public company, snapped back to reality. The reported $2 billion loss the company suffered in the first quarter remains fresh on investors’ minds. And the fact that it missed analysts’ second-quarter daily active user estimates didn’t help matters. All told, the company is being rocked by larger rival Facebook (FB) and its property Instagram. That drumbeat continues in each bearish article published.But there’s also been tons of improvements in the company’s result. Take, for instance, Daily Active Users (DAU), which SNAP defines as users who open the app at least once during a defined 24-hour period. DAU grew 21% year over year to 173 million in the second quarter. That's four percentage points faster than Facebook's 17% year over year rise and it's almost twice as fast as Twitter's (TWTR) 12% increase.Just as impressive, the company grew second quarter Average Revenue per User (ARPU) by 109% year over year to $1.05. Again, this pales in comparison to Facebook's 24% rise in ARPU to $4.73. The problem, however, is that SNAP still piled losses as its expenses, which grew to $2.68 billion in the first half of the year, are rising just as strongly. This compares to just $473.2 million in 2016. Obviously, the company’s hosting costs per DAU, which increased 61 cents in Q2, compared to 55 cents in Q2 2016, is an issue.That 11% year-over-year rise raises questions about the company’s ability to, either grow its user base, accelerate ARPU or lower its costs. To what extent can SNAP address these areas remain its biggest question. On Tuesday eMarketer provided an answer to one of those questions.The marketing research firm reported that Snapchat’s overall U.S. user base will surge some 26% from last year to reach almost 80 million monthly users in 2017. Notably, the company, which is expected to see increases across all age groups (exception of its oldest users), will enjoy its largest gains in its prime target of 18-to-24-year-old and 12-to-17-year-old categories.The question is, how will SNAP monetize those eyeballs? And that’s where betting on SNAP stock becomes risky. Even then, from a risk-versus-reward perspective, with SNAP stock trading 14.50% below its IPO price, there’s a compelling opportunity here, especially as TV news outlets such as CNN and NBC are beginning to test Snapchat’s viability. This is on top of the company’s recently signed $100 million content deal with Time Warner (TWX). All of this ties into the vision of CEO Evan Spiegel has set for Snapchat to one day become a next-generation TV platform, — one that can rival Netflix (NFLX).At this stage of its existing, making a fundamental argument for SNAP stock on metrics such as earnings per share, P/E, cash flow, revenue, etc., doesn’t make sense. Sometimes it's enough to decide whether you want to believe in this story or you don’t. I’m not going to tell you SNAP is on the verge of overtaking Facebook. There’s enough advertising dollars, particularly in the realm of digital, for both companies to survive. And like Facebook, which faltered in the first five months of its IPO, SNAP — especially under $17 — has more than enough time prove doubters wrong."

(SNAP) was down almost 60% from its post-IPO high back in early March of this year. It's been a steady downtrend for the social media company, but following a recent Cantor Fitzgerald upgrade, Snap has bounced up almost 25% off of its lows to $14.40. Cantor Fitzgerald's Kip Paulson upgraded Snap from neutral to overweight and added a $15 price target. credited his optimism to the fact that the lock up period on Snap shares had ended and there wasn't much insider selling. While it's true that most insiders haven't gone running for the exits just yet, the lack of insider selling is not surprising.The ending of the lock up period was arguably the most widely discussed topic since the company's IPO. Everyone was watching. If the market saw that insiders immediately began selling off large blocks of their shares, Snap would have plummeted even further. These guys have way to much at stake here to just let that happen. This bounce over non-insider selling is an overreaction, as none of Snap's major issues have been solved.Snap Inc. has a story problem. What are they? We all know Snapchat the app, but what about Snap the company? According to CEO Evan Spiegel, they're supposed to be a camera company. Let's ignore the fact investors have seen very little evidence of Snap actually becoming a camera company and assume they are successful in breaking into the camera business. The first problem is that hardware, specifically cameras, are generally a race to the bottom. The second problem is integrating hardware with Snapchat - their main platform. Are consumers really going to go out and buy an expensive piece of hardware just to post a 10 second picture/video for 24 hours on an app? It seems like your phone is the perfect device for that purpose.Snap is a business that won't be profitable for a long time and it isn't helping itself. The company recently started cutting down on its ad pricing, which on the surface sounds like a good way to attract more advertisers, but I think this will only create further revenue headwinds for Snap. Even with the lower pricing, I expect them to fail to attract more advertisers as companies continue to do more advertising with Instagram, whose Stories feature already has more DAU than Snapchat.Another big area of concern is Snapchat's continued decline in its DAU growth:Snapchat's user growth is starting to look much more like Twitter (TWTR) than it does Facebook (FB). Snapchat added seven million new users in Q2 2017, which not only came in below analysts' expectations of 10 million new users, but also lagged behind their eight million new users in Q1 2017.Snapchat, Snap Inc.'s biggest product, is a toy, not a stand alone company. Snap needs to find a way to integrate their app with some sustainable business model. In my opinion, the company went public way too early. There's no real sense as to what their business is or wants to be and until that happens, the price will remain under constant pressure. Snap should have waited a couple more years before going public and used that time to really hone in on its story and future path to success, but when a 27 year old CEO receives a $800 million bonus to take his company public is anyone surprised that he jumped the gun?I bought Jan. 19 2018 $14 SNAP Puts for an average cost of about $2.00. This trade gives me a break-even price of $12 with a maximum loss of $200 per contract.If you would like to follow along with my analysis of Snap Inc. and get alerted on my articles, I would encourage you to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name at the top of the page.

(NYSE:SNAP) has recently attracted investor criticism of their less than satisfactory results, culminated from questionable business methods and macroeconomic outlooks for their app Snapchat. I will be exploring and discussing the root of their high capital burn rate, and the underlying asset that could facilitate a turning-point for SNAP, and stock growth potential.Down from 27.09 at IPO, SNAP has consistently managed to increase its costs exponentially whilst reducing net income. The seven-fold expansion has not fooled anybody, and these less-than-benign metrics are easily explained by SNAP's day-to-day activities in an attempt to cosmetically scale up their operations.SNAP has adopted the outlook of a large tech company, and the attitude of a conglomerate, flooding its cauldron with vast resources in an attempt to cook up a magic concoction.SNAP's Q2 reveals a squandering of $3.60 per current user and $89 per acquired user to generate a revenue of $1.05 per user in 3 months, flouting the scale argument as spending per user versus revenue per user have behaved inversely. In a B2C environment, drawing on revenue from advertising, it is most difficult to justify these costs, particularly at this stage of their business maturity. This represents an element of a myriad of statistics, that, in combination with a Morgan Stanley downgrade, has led to the significant price contraction. The argument has been that future word-of-mouth and group-adoption would compensate for this expenditure and recoup damages. This expenditure constitutes some of the 77% decrease in Snap's Cash (and Cash Equivalents) from FY'15 to FY'16.Furthermore, the bulk of this spending was made in areas with a relatively high capacity of users, as opposed to broadening geographical horizons. CEO Evan Spiegel overlooked galactic growth opportunities in countries with a growing middle-class and immense media-consumption, such as India, justifying that Snapchat was ‘only for rich people’. The comments were rejected publicly by Spiegel after cropping up in a lawsuit by ex-employee Anthony Pompliano, subsequently covered in the Economic Times and The Guardian. Should this be SNAP's outlook, it would certainly be a contrarian play in an industry whose core narrative is to improve accessibility and to counter social barriers.Additional examples of the 'flood and profit' strategy of SNAP exist in their internal policies. For one, SNAP segments its operations into an array of luxury modern business units around the capital-intensive Venice Beach - a lack of cohesion that is another contrarian play in the tech world. Google and other tech leaders have been drivers in new-wave management, breaking down borders and allowing employees of all levels and divisions to come together and share ideas, as opposed to isolating them in separate units.This is also reflected, respectively, in SNAP's external activities which gives negligible space for 3rd party developers to use, contribute and build on the Snapchat framework, a key factor in modern tech successes (Open source code, Development frameworks, Stores/Exchanges, Profit-sharing opportunities). We have seen over time what an invaluable asset it can be to attract developers and entrepreneurs to build platforms and help them excel.All development operations are executed in-house (at a stunningly low rate of productivity and return on capital employed (-44.59)), where SNAP's boasts a splashing on interns to the tune of $9,000 in compensation and a $2,3000 housing stipend per month, a level of compensation that mirrors the attitude of Uber in competing with the larger tech players for the finest talent. Talent expenditure is certainly rational, but SNAP could leverage the brainpower of millions of developers across the globe and geographically stunted future prospects (in addition to incumbent in-house talent) by opening up and democratizing the playing-field.The counter-argument comes in the form of hybrid cuisine. The rise of the dancing hot-dog is testament to Snapchat's commercial reach and user engagement. 54% of American teenagers use Snapchat on a daily basis (UBS Evidence Lab). Snapchat seems to have a loyal, frequent unique image-rich content-creation and consumption base. This is not to be overlooked. The top 10% of Snapchat users create more content per day than the to top 10% of Instagram users. On average, there are 3 billion Snaps sent per day (TechCrunch) versus 95 million Instagram photos posted per day (Omnicore) Whilst judging uniqueness is harder, my bet would be that on the content created, Snapchat would be producing the more unique content. Whilst there are known workarounds, it is easier to duplicate and/or re-post content on Instagram. SNAP is the undisputed owner of the content posted with its app.How could snap use these large unique data sets? The recent development of Artificial Intelligence, and the advent of some powerful machine-learning algorithms via TensorFlow has created demand for large data sets: for learning, training, re-training, categorization and identification. Whilst further utility may need to be serviced by some filtering, sorting and packaging, the data sets could be of great use, not least of all, to governments and security organisations. The data sets are vast, and are not limited to a single-dimension. These data sets include location, device, social-connections and so on. They can be analysed for sentiment and a whole host of observable behaviors. Whilst this is a valid path, the shift from B2C to B2B, towards government cooperation or an emergence of a conflict of interests could unsettle the, typically younger, audience and may question the integrity of the firm. I have no doubt that SNAP are already evaluating this pipeline, having been registered as a data-processing firm and filing for a patent for a revolutionary method accompanied by large databases.Should SNAP look to make tangible changes in their business strategy, such as undertake a more communal approach to shaping the future (through opening up the doors to 3rd party developers) or perhaps using their unrealized assets in a productive manner (creating a database for their images, and targeting a specific use e.g.security) and integrating their structural facade system (and related methods), SNAP could be a descent buy opportunity.The current business strategy, grossly overvalued stock and market sentiment shift towards the tech sector render short-term buy opportunities superficially optimistic. Furthermore, we see limitations to Snapchat's near-term expansion in the continued deceleration of quarterly increases in Daily Active Users, slipping from 7%, (to 5%), to 4% over the past three fiscal quarters. Short-term opportunists may see it a good idea to short whilst the price continues to depress and the market reacts to Snap's gross overvaluation, as well as its tech peers as we have seen in the 13F filings over the past couple of days. Although, one may consider abstaining to mitigate exposure to the market vagaries. The 13F positions are certainly an expression of disinclination and reluctance towards the methods of tech valuations (arising from the doubt in sustaining these rising valuations), a market that has been overvalued for a long time. David Einhorn recently described blue chip tech stocks as a 'bubble basket' (Financial Times).This is not investment advice. You are advised to conduct your own due diligence."
4099592,80135,2017-08-16T20:05:44-04:00,Key performance metrics witnessed a sequential decline in growth.Instagram is leading the way in terms of growth and downloads.Current drop in the stock can’t be rationalized away by valuation.,"Snap Inc. (SNAP) posted disappointing second-quarter results as the company missed both the revenue and the earnings consensus. Revenue climbed to $181.67 million for the quarter, a 153% year-over-year growth. However, revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations by $5.13 million. EPS stayed in the red with the company posting a $0.16 loss per share as compared to an expected loss of $0.14 per share.On the operational front, daily active users reached 173 million, translating into a 21% year-over-year increase. The company didn’t provide any color on the full-year guidance. The market reacted accordingly, and the stock was down 14% before the recent recovery. The stock is still down 7% since the second-quarter earnings report.DAUs and ARPU supported revenue growthRevenue grew 153% Y/Y amid growth in active users and increased average revenue per user. ARPU for the quarter was $1.05 as compared to $0.50 during the same quarter last year. Sequentially, ARPU increased 16%. Snapchat registered double-digit growth, with DAUs increasing 21% over the period. Overall, higher ARPU and increased DAUs contributed towards the revenue growth of the company.OPEX and hosting kept the earnings in the redOperating costs were the primary culprit for the net loss; OPEX was $229 million for the quarter, which was 179% higher on a year-over-year basis. Hosting costs also contributed towards negative bottom line. They increased 34.2% to reach $109 million during the second quarter of 2017. On a per-user basis, hosting costs increased 20% during the second quarter as compared to the same quarter last year.To review, Snapchat witnessed impressive growth on a year-over-year basis. Loss is understandable as the company is in the growth phase. And, it would not be fair to judge Snapchat on earnings basis. Why did the market, then, react negatively to earnings?Sequential performance wasn’t reassuring.Revenue grew 21.3% during the quarter in question while sequential revenue growth stood at 84.6% during the second quarter of 2016. To simplify the numbers further, revenue increased by $33 million during the second quarter of 2016, but grew only $32 million during the second quarter of 2017. This is indicative of slowing revenue growth, which is alarming as the company is still in early phase of growth.Hitting product life cycle maturity earlier than expected can never be good for technology companies, especially the ones in the app business.SNAP’s SEC Filings and Focus Equity’s CalculationsIt can be argued that revenue growth can recover once SNAP gets its sales and marketing right. But, the problem is not just with the revenue growth.Decline in revenue growth relates to slowing growth of active users, not just sales and marketing efforts.Sequentially, daily active user growth declined from 17.2% in Q2 2016 to 4.2% in Q2 2017.SNAP’s SEC Filings and Focus Equity’s CalculationsIn absolute terms, Snapchat added 21 million daily active users during the first quarter of 2016 while adding only 7 million during the second quarter of 2017.Decline in revenue growth and active user growth won’t impress any advertisers, which can only put further pressure on Snapchat’s revenue growth.The effect of slowing active user growth can be seen in average revenue per user of the company.ARPU increased 56% during the second quarter of 2016; it only increased 16% during the second quarter of 2017. This clearly points towards the fact that slowdown in active user growth is making the platform less attractive for advertisers. See the ARPU growth comparison below.SNAP’s SEC Filings and Focus Equity’s CalculationsThen, there’s FacebookThe challenge for Snapchat is to compete against Facebook’s (FB) diverse social offerings including Instagram. Snapchat-like functionality in WhatsApp and Messenger isn’t helping Snapchat’s case. Declining sequential growth in revenue amid slowing MAUs and ARPU growth indicates that Snapchat is facing stiff competition from Facebook’s offerings.It’s worth mentioning that Facebook’s apps, including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, were among the top downloaded apps during the first half of 2017; Snapchat lagged behind Instagram consistently during the first half, according (login required) to AppAnnie.Further, since July 2017, Snapchat’s download rank is hovering between the fourth and sixth position as compared to Instagram’s download rank, which was between the first and fourth position.Source: Snapchat rank history, AppAnnie analytics  Source: Instagram rank history, AppAnnie analyticsIt can be seen that Instagram’s rank is trending upwards while Snapchat’s rank is following a downward path lately. The following infographic further clarifies the situation.The point is that Facebook is giving Snapchat a really tough competition to deal with. This is reflected in app analytics and key metric trends of Snapchat.Now, despite declining growth rates, Snapchat deserves its due credit for attracting more than 170 million users. It’s only fair to value Snapchat based on its users as metrics like revenue and earnings aren’t relevant at this point of time. The updated valuation follows below.Snapchat was valued in our previous piece based on active users at that time. Average of daily and monthly active users was used to calculate Snapchat’s value. However, this valuation update takes into account the increase in active users alone while splitting DAUs and MAUs based valuation.Further, Instagram value is used as a proxy for calculating the multiple. A little adjustment is made with respect to Instagram’s terminal growth; it’s assumed to be 2% as compared to 1% in the previous valuation. You can see the dated valuation here.Valuation – Active Users 1 (0.6*700) Daily Active Users extrapolated based on the data from this sourceThe value per DAU and value per MAU in the above table are used to calculate the value of Snapchat. Instagram’s DAUs stand at 173 million while MAUs are extrapolated based on q/q growth in daily active users. Focus Equity EstimatesValuation sheet reveals that the stock is worth around $13 based on daily active users and $14.9 based on monthly active users.Note that this valuation is based on Instagram’s multiple, which is optimistic for Snapchat. Instagram has a higher growth rate compared to Snapchat. Instagram can also be offered to marketers as an up sell in addition to Facebook’s other products. The point is that a multiple based on Instagram’s value should be treated as the cap valuation, not the base case, for Snapchat. All assumptions regarding Instagram’s valuation were discussed in the previous piece.Valuation – Average Revenue Per UserWe recently came across a valuation piece on Snapchat that tackled the valuation based on average revenue per user using proxied ARPUs from Facebook and Twitter (TWTR).The author argued that Snapchat is undervalued as it has North American user base, which can result in higher average revenue per user going forward. The author estimated following revenue figures for the analysis.Note that the author assumed North American ARPU at $9.79, $14.58 and $19.38 for Snapchat while the company managed an ARPU of only $7.79 based on revenue during the trailing twelve months. Anyhow, even if the company manages to post revenue according the table above, the stock isn’t cheap at all.Using Facebook’s net margin, following will be the projected net income and respective valuation.Cost of capital is based on total shareholders’ equity, which was around $3.54 billion as of the end of the second-quarter of 2017. Value added is discounted based on 4% growth in perpetual earnings.Valuation sheet reveals that even the aggressive revenue estimate incorporating Facebook’s net margin and 4% perpetual growth isn’t enough to justify Snapchat’s current valuation. Not to mention, aggressive ARPU is a stretch based on current slowdown in Snapchat’s growth.Although Snapchat witnessed impressive year-over-year growth, sequential growth was disappointing. Declining revenue growth was caused by a slowdown in active user growth; ARPU growth also decelerated. Facebook’s Instagram seems to take the market away from Snapchat. Instagram is growing at a higher rate; app download ranks also paint a favorable picture for Instagram. Moreover, Snapchat isn’t trading at a discount. Multiple and ARPU based valuation reveal only minimum upside for the company in some scenarios. Recent sell-off doesn’t create a buying opportunity. We believe that the stock will continue to underperform despite being beaten down."
4100589,39301,2017-08-21T07:58:30-04:00,"Snap Inc. exhibited a rally from $11.00 to $14.00 in the span of a week.The poor performance was partially owed to a sequence of missed ER announcements, and speculation over share lock-up expiration.Short interest lost momentum heading into September, and with the addition of more shares, short interest in Snap Inc. declined to a more normalized level.The bears ran out of conviction and chased shares to a valuation that was hardly sustainable, hence Snap Inc. exhibited a relief rally in the third week of August, which we had expected.The bottom is in, and investors looking for an entry may have finally found an appropriate opportunity.","Snap Inc. (SNAP) may have finally bottomed out and is positioned to rally from the low-teens. We felt that the stock could break below $15 and trade even lower following the lock-up expiration. Now that we have passed two weeks, it’s worth re-examining the stock to see if there’s a solid enough risk/reward to take a contrarian position on Snap Inc.Source: TC2000The stock has steadily declined following its IPO. However, post the lock-up expiration beginning in August, we have now found a desirable entry point to get back into the name. Furthermore, expectations heading into the next quarter seem beatable, as we have illustrated to our premium subscribers.The stock has finally broken above the 20-day moving average and is now approaching resistance at approximately $15.00. The stock is moving on heavy volume, and we believe this is partially owed to a short cover rally. We never recommended shorting Snap Inc. because we felt there was a certain element of timing respective to margin expense required to make a successful transaction.Figure 1. Break-even analysis on Snap Inc. short tradeSource: Cho’s Investment ResearchIn August, our trough valuation was $12.44 versus the all-time low of $11.28, implying that returns inclusive of margin expense were maxed out in the first two weeks of the month.The recent price performance mirrored our expectations from our prior analysis published on July 12th, 2017 (when the stock price was $15-$17):Clearly, the stock didn’t reach $10 or below by September, and it’s looking increasingly less likely that investors/traders who were short the stock will maintain an outsized position over the next couple weeks.Figure 2. Short Interest Since InceptionSource: Cho’s Investment ResearchFigure 3. Total number of shares shortSource: Cho’s Investment ResearchThe number of shares short relative to market float was disproportionate at 17.69% heading into August, but as the shares unlocked, the number of shares short (71.47 million) relative to total share outstanding of 1.197 billion was less consequential as it reduced the actual percentage of shares short/outstanding to 5.97% versus 17.69% (when >80% of shares were composed of restricted stock units).Furthermore, the number of shares short remained stable at 70 million shares heading into August, which already suggested a crowded trade that wasn’t getting any added position size to send Snap Inc. any lower. Bears lost momentum heading into August, and with the consequences of some employees liquidating positions, some had opted to close positions over the prior week.We believe we’ve made it past the last leg of the downtrend, as it’s increasingly unlikely that shorts would add position size given how dangerous it is to bet against momentum names. The social media app has demonstrated promising monetization metrics and has returned to DAU growth. While expectations called for something higher, it’s hard to be wrong on a stock that’s trading 50% below its peak value of $30 with a multi-year growth runway that’s attractive.Keep in mind, I’ve stated on Cheddar TV that anything beneath $15.00 was an acceptable entry given the risk/reward profile of the social media app and how under-monetized the app actually was.Furthermore, the perception of risk was characterized incorrectly leading into the share lock-up. Therefore, we expect a swift recovery to Snap’s valuation, as bargain conscious momentum investors will come out in droves these next couple weeks.Cho’s investment research provides extensive coverage on stocks with price target recommendation and buy, sell, hold recommendation so investors can manager their investment portfolios more successfully.

4099451,24473,2017-08-16T12:45:17-04:00,"Snap hit a new low of $11.28 per share after its Q2 2017 earnings report underwhelmed investors.Although revenue was up 153% in Q2 to $182M, it marked a dramatic slowdown in Snap's growth rate from 286% in Q1.Operating loss nearly quadrupled year over year to $449M, as the Snap struggles to show any signs of operating leverage.With expectations of $960M in revenue for 2017, Snap continues to trade at a pricey ~20X price/sales ratio, despite shares being at all-time lows.The current financials look ugly, but Snap's exciting product pipeline (Snap Maps, Spectacles 2.0, SnapDrone) could be laying the groundwork for a social media titan.","Despite continued threats from Instagram, Snapchat posted a record 173M DAUs (Daily Active Users) in Q2 2017.Snap's DAUs were up approximately 21% from Q2 2016, and 4.2% from Q1 2017. This was a notable sequential slowdown from Snap's DAU growth rate of 36% in Q1 2017.As Instagram continues to relentlessly copy all of Snapchat's successful features, there's no question it's having an impact on the company's ability to grow its user base. However, an aggregate gain of 7M new DAUs in the quarter despite these attacks offers some hope. Snap's user base is by no means collapsing, and in fact, continues to grow at a healthy clip.I have previously written that if Snap can grow its user base to 300M DAUs by 2020, the company has a shot at justifying a $50B+ market capitalization. Although Snap's growth is slower than I had initially projected, 300M DAUs is still well within reach. Even if Snap's growth rate continues to slide, and falls below 20%, 300M+ DAUs looks achievable sometime in 2021.Sales continue to grow significantly faster than users, as Snap ramps its advertising efforts and users spend more time on the app.Revenue grew 153% in Q2, to a record $182M. While this is an impressive growth rate at first glance when compared to prior periods the trend is very clear. Snap's momentum is decelerating quickly.This deceleration is poised to continue as Snap's user base growth rate is likely to slow below 20% in the coming period.Gross profit made a nice improvement from -32% in Q2 2016, to 16% in Q2 2017, but remains far below the norm for other public social media companies. Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG) all boast gross margins well over 50%.Although revenue soared and gross margin improved during Q2, losses grew at an even faster rate. Snap's operating loss nearly quadrupled to $449M in Q2 2017.We are still very early in Snap's monetization ramp as a company, but the lack of any operating leverage could be a cause of concern. If Snap cannot begin to improve its operating margins, faith in its future potential earnings potential will quickly diminish.One of the biggest drags on Snap's profitability remains the company's hosting cost per DAU.Snap's hosting cost per DAU rose by 11%, to $0.61 in Q 2017. For comparison, the company's revenue per DAU in the quarter was $1.05, up 110%.Even though Snap is losing nearly 60% of its gross profits to hosting costs directly, that cost structure appears to be shifting quickly. This is why we continue to see gross margins trend in a positive direction.If revenue per DAU can continue to scale this quickly, then hosting costs will quickly become a smaller and smaller piece of revenues.But beyond gross margins, Snap's operating structure leaves a lot to be desired. Both SG&A and R&D expenses continue to climb much faster than revenue.It's unclear when we will begin to see a slowdown in spending relative to revenue. Snap's management has issued no financial guidance.For now, the market accepts this lack of profitability, due to Snap's growth and relative immaturity as a business. But going forward, increasing scrutiny will be placed on Snap's ability to profitably monetize its user base.Snap's shares have dropped precipitously since an early 2017 IPO, as growth has underwhelmed expectations. Analysts were previously expecting 2017 sales of $1B, and 2018 sales of $2B.For now, it seems those estimates have gone out the window, as Snap's revenue numbers have disappointed in its first two quarters as a public company.Based on these estimates of $960M in 2017, at $12.50 per share, Snap is trading at a market capitalization of $19B (with 1.5B shares outstanding). This projects a 2017 price/sales ratio of 20X.Snap's business has potential, but given the structural issues of profitability, this still seems like a stretch.With a user base that's now only growing 20%, revenue growth is hinging on a ramping ad-load and improving hardware sales per user. Both of these initiatives are in very early stages and remain nowhere near profitability.The bulk of Snap's share price is based on future expectations of continued user growth, combined with rapidly growing profits per user. At its current rate, it could be years before Snap shows any sign of profit.Although the company's cash cushion of $2.8B (as of the end of Q2 '17) is formidable, it may not last long if Snap makes a few acquisitions or its cash used in operations continue to increase.Despite all the woe that was Snap's Q2 2017 financials, the company remains social media's leading innovator.Snap's market capitalization is just $19B, a pimple compared to Facebook's ~$500B, and Google's ~$650B. However, Snap is the innovator in the social space.During Q2 the company made several notable enhancements to its core app. The first being Snap Maps. This interactive mapping feature allows users to see who is creating Snaps around them. Features like this are keeping Snap one step ahead of its competition.Beyond its expansion into maps, Snap continues to invest in creating quirky, yet cutting edge features for its app.Snap's dancing hotdog may seem comical, but it has already been viewed more than 1.5 billion times. These viral forays into augmented reality are cementing Snap as the visionary in the new frontier of social media.Additionally, there have been rumors that Snap has acquired Chinese based drone-maker, Zero Zero Robotics for $150-$200M. If true, this would echo many other rumors about Snap exploring the potential of a drone as its next hardware product.It's far too early to draw any conclusions about the timing of Snap entering the drone space, but the potential is exciting. Zero Zero's drone the Hover was available in Apple stores and was heralded as the best selfie-drone.Although many skeptics regard Spectacles sales of $5.4M in the quarter as a disappointment, I'd argue Snap's first hardware product has been a huge success.Device sales are already layering nicely on top of Snap's advertising business, while simultaneously empowering content creators and acting as a differentiator for the platform.Spectacles were Snap's first hardware product, and will likely be followed by a second generation version. The technologies behind camera quality, processing power, and battery life are all getting better. These trends will be a huge tailwind to the functionality of both Spectacles 2.0 and the potential SnapDrone product.Although the future of Snap's hardware business is very speculative in nature and very dependent on the continued growth of DAUs, it's a remarkably unique business model. No other social network is selling hardware. This is truly Snap's push into becoming a camera company. If just 10% of Snap's users (173M) buy a hardware product for $100, that's $1.73B in sales.Hardware sales have the potential to move the needle for Snap in the long-term.Although the financials leave much to be desired, Snap's leadership as a social media innovator is undeniable.Snap's ability to fend off persistent threats from Facebook will be vital to its success, and appear to be working for now. Staying one step ahead by doubling down on software functionality in areas like augmented reality (aka more Dancing Hotdogs) and unique hardware products, will give Snap a chance.If Snap can continue to improve gross margins, launch successful hardware products, while ramping its ad business, this is quickly becoming a buy."
4100729,24400,2017-08-21T13:35:36-04:00,"The end-of-the-world scenario investors feared post-lockup didn’t happen.SNAP has taken one the toughest beatings the market has unleashed on a young company. And it’s still standing.If you’re truly seeking alpha, it’s now better to focus on where SNAP is going than from where it came.","Shares of Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), the parent of popular messaging app Snapchat, have surged as much as 26%, reaching $14.25, since falling to its all-time low of $11.28 last Monday.Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Bill Maurer, with whom I’ve debated the sustainability of Snap’s recovery, calls the recent rise in SNAP stock a “dead-cat bounce.” I called it an opportunity to make money, offering the following response:This response, however sensible it might have been, wasn’t enough to sway Maurer. Indeed, stocks go up and stocks go down. It won’t surprise to witness profit-taking after such a massive upward move of 26% from the low. But even if SNAP were to sell off 10% to 15% (or even 20%) it’s tough to dispute that the story is now different from where SNAP was at the dawn of its IPO.To Maurer’s point, each time SNAP — on several occasions — has risen to such a degree, the shares have been met with severe selling pressure. But doesn’t it feel different this time? Consider, SNAP had its best week in it short history during a five-day stretch when the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were each down almost 1% during that span. As it stands, SNAP is now up for the month of August.I’m not saying that the company is suddenly the best thing since sliced bread. I’m not suggesting that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) should be worried, either. But after months of worrying about the IPO lock-up expiration on July 31, where almost 800 million shares were to flood the market, the end-of-the-world scenario investors feared didn’t happen. SNAP has taken one the toughest beatings the market has unleashed on a young company. And it’s still standing. The bulls are now in control of this stock and with the share price gaining 24% from its 52 week low, I’m saying the bottom has been reached. As such, if you’re truly seeking alpha, it’s now better to focus on where SNAP is going, rather than from where it came.It’s also time to let go of the notion that in order for Snap to win, Facebook must lose (or vice versa). Spending on digital advertising is projected to rise 18% in 2017 to $229.25 billion, up from $194.6 billion in 2016. That increased ad spending affirms the extent to which advertisers continue to value digital and mobile when it comes to connecting with potential customers. That’s more than enough business for Facebook and SNAP to go after.SNAP is projected to deliver fiscal 2017 revenue of around $900 million, compared to almost $40 billion for Facebook. SNAP’s 2018 revenue is projected to be $1.6 billion, while Facebook will grow at around $51 billion. There’s no comparison. In its second quarter, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 153% and still missed Street estimates by more than $5 million. Expectations have been too high. And they’re now starting to come down.There’s no question Snap must continue to prove its mettle in the social media space before staking a claim in the advertising market currently dominated by Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). SNAP has tons of work to do over the next couple of years before it can be mentioned in the same breath as Facebook. In short, the drubbing SNAP took after the company reported second quarter earnings was deserved. But purely from a valuation perspective, the risk/reward proposition has fully shifted towards the poise side. The stock is trading some 18% below its IPO price of $17. And I’m willing to bet, at the very least, that the share price - which is still currently trading below their 200-day moving average of $18.88 and 50-day moving average of $14.47 - regains its $17 IPO price sooner rather than later."
4099232,83796,2017-08-15T20:36:00-04:00,Heavily profitable North American user base is often overlooked and gives SNAP a massive advantage over competitors such as Twitter.SNAP can become a respectable company with P/EBITDA ratio below 13 without any growth just by monetizing existing users.Commitment from Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel to not sell shares until 2018 should lead to limited downside over the next few days.P/EBITDA comparison with Facebook leads to a valuation of $27/share to $106/share based on monetization of existing users.Short sellers who made a killing since March 2017 should consider closing their positions.,"Snapchat is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by former Stanford students Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Beginning as ""Picaboo,"" the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would, therefore, encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction.SNAP Inc. (SNAP) went public on March 2, 2017, as the biggest tech IPO of the year. Valued at ~$25 billion, the stock initially took off rising from the IPO price of $17 to highs of $29 a few days afterwards but quickly crashed back down to its current price of $12.8/share on concerns regarding earnings and Daily Active User Growth. While growth companies are notoriously hard to value due to the unforeseen nature of predicting future trends, this article will try to analyze SNAP from an objective viewpoint by comparing to competitors Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Balance sheet metrics, user growth and revenue per user will be used to determine valuation and whether SNAP is worth an investment today.The following chart displays relevant metrics for the three companies SNAP, FB and TWTR.Based on the data above, Snapchat can be seen as a tech company with characteristics similar to both Facebook and Twitter. Snapchat has the user engagement similar to Facebook but total user count similar to Twitter. While all 3 companies do have their difference, Snapchat stands out for having both a low market cap and high % of users within the lucrative North American Market. As can be seen in the graphics below, both Facebook and Twitter reported 3-8x more revenue from North American users compared to non-North American users.Source: Facebook Q2 Investor PresentationSource: Twitter Q2 Investor PresentationSince SNAP just began the process of platform monetization, it is not fair to value the company based on traditional metrics such as P/E ratio, EBITDA or revenue. Instead, it is more important to extrapolate future earnings potential based on peers such as Facebook and Twitter. This is an important point since Facebook and Twitter are both established brands with stable earnings and revenues. Based on comparable company monetization analysis, we can determine whether or not SNAP has any value at current prices.While future earnings are difficult to predict, this analysis will focus on three scenarios: (conservative RPU (Revenue Per user) same as Twitter, base RPU avg between FB and Twitter, aggressive RPU same as FB). All three scenarios regarding monetization at current DAU counts can be seen in the tables below:This Scenario assumes that SNAP matches Twitter’s North American and International Revenue Per User rates of $9.79/user and $1.85/user respectively.Scenarios 2 - base:This Scenario assumes that SNAP splits the difference between FB Revenue Per user and Twitter Revenue Per user.Scenarios 3 - aggressive:This Scenario assumes that SNAP matches Facebook’s Q2 Revenue Per user.As can be seen from the charts above, Snapchat does not have to grow to become a successful profitable standalone company. Just by monetizing its existing, mostly North American, user base, SNAP will have a respectable P/EBITDA ratio between 3 and 12 at current market prices. While higher earnings would likely lead to higher costs in the form of more R&D, hosting costs of $0.61/user are still relatively low and growing revenue/users will only reduce R&D costs per user due to a larger base audience.Using Facebook’s P/EBITDA(28) ratio as a benchmark, SNAP should be worth anywhere from $106/share (aggressive) to $27/share (conservative) with a base valuation of $67/share. That being said, it takes most growth companies years to achieve these valuations and I would not be surprised to see SNAP stay under $20 for quite some time.While fellow technology peers Twitter and FB appear overvalued compared to SNAP, none of this really matters so long as the lockup expiration releases a flood of shares to the market and causes the stock to crash. That being said, Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel (the two co-founders of SNAP) recently released a statement saying that they would not sell any shares until 2018. With the recently released statement from the two co-founders, a flurry of selling seems unlikely and downside is limited.  While daily active user location within North America combined with high user engagement are great for SNAP, downside risk remains due to increased competition. Both Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook are vying for a slice of the Snapchat market by adding some sort of disappearing message service to their platforms. We have seen what Facebook can do in the past with the elimination of Myspace and acquisition of Instagram. To survive, SNAP will have to demonstrate its ability to retain customers by building some sort of competitive moat.At the moment, SNAP is still growing Daily Active Users and has diversified beyond disappearing messages to include TV shows from big players such as NBC & Warner Bros in addition to original content. The addition of TV shows is huge for SNAP since it creates a moat which will be very hard for Facebook to breach. While things look good so far, investors should be concerned if DAUs start declining on a consistent quarterly basis.Snapchat’s stock has been hammered over the past few days because of earnings misses and “slowing growth.” However, investors are treating Snap like an established company focused on earnings, instead of a growing company that just began monetization. At this stage, daily active user growth/retention is more important than earnings. With 30 minutes per day of time from 75 million people in North America, SNAP’s high user engagement should allow the company to monetize existing North American users at or above Twitter’s $9.74/quarter. Any growth is just icing on the cake. Furthermore, short-term risk is limited due to both Murphy and Spiegel promising to not sell shares until 2018. While downside risks remain regarding competition from Instagram and Google, SNAP’s video partnerships with NBC/ Warner Bros combined with continued DAU growth should allow the company to survive for some time. For those with the stomach to survive a turbulent 2017, SNAP is a worthy long-term bet."
4098733,76115,2017-08-14T13:50:31-04:00,"Snap released earnings last week which didn't meet the expectations of anyone looking for growth.CEO Evan Spiegel discounted the company's lack of DAUs because it doesn't engage in ""growth hacking"" - or does it?Far be it from me - a financial website contributor - to tell a CEO how to manage his company, but making up frivolous excuses is not a winning strategy.","By now you know Snap (SNAP) released earnings last week and it was hard to find something good in the numbers to discuss. It's no surprise then there have been three bearish articles for every bullish article on Seeking Alpha. But the numbers weren't the worst of it for me. Instead, I found the commentary from management to be the most disconcerting. One of which was the comment ""others"" use growth hacking to accomplish impressive daily active user (DAU) growth.In order to understand why this stance from management is not good for shareholders, we must first understand what exactly is growth hacking. Just the sound of the term gives you a picture of an avid gamer complaining about someone camping their re-spawn spot (yeah I was a gaming nerd in the day). That's probably not a good first clue. Allow me to give you management's own definition:So notifications, push notifications, and the like are within the realm of growth hacking according to the company.But, here's the first problem - management isn't on the same page. Or, if it is, it's talking out both sides of its mouth. The quote above was from Imran Khan, who is chief strategy officer, while the below quote is from CEO Evan Spiegel:Putting aside this response to an analyst is more confusing than enlightening; it doesn't make it apparent if Snap is on board or not on board with notifications and the elements therein. The CSO presents the case they don't do ""growth hacking"" yet the CEO says they are but its ""highly relevant"" notifications. It's clear management isn't on the same page.The second problem is the perspective on what growth hacking truly is. I decided to give Evan's advice a shot and went ""for a Google."" What I found was interesting, in particular the web's definition of growth hacking:Growth hacking is an intimate knowledge of the product and finding ingenious ways to put the features direct to the consumer in a technology-based method. This sounds like a fantastic way to help a company needing higher growth to bring its products and users to another level. It doesn't say do the opposite of what is advised; it simply pushes the bounds. Sounds like the method of ""others,"" which we really know is Facebook (FB), is what Snap is decrying. As an investor, Facebook is creating equity, not destroying it. Snap... well we see how that's working out thus far.Snap, maybe your inexperience and immaturity needs this approach instead of trying to explain away the decelerating user growth and demonizing these tried methods.This reminds me of the time when the CEO made the excuse for lack of growth caused by its lack of support for Android and lower cost phones. Seriously, who wants to hear excuses? You are a public company, not a private one where you get to run the company free of any outsiders.When you put aside the numbers for a minute, it's absolutely clear Snap is struggling on the best way to perform and run the company. Then bring the numbers back in and you aren't surprised how the two fit together; poor management with excuses finds poor growth.Sure, some who are bullish go directly to the 150%+ revenue growth, but when you compare it to a year where it first started monetizing, it isn't as impressive. In fact, with the two quarters we have seen, the growth year over year has gone from 285% to 153%. It won't be long until revenue growth is under 100% while expenses remain on the wrong side of profitability or, in the track record we have thus far, continue accelerating in the wrong direction.Since writing my last article on Snap, the stock has gone from $18.08 per share to $11.83 - a 34.5% decline. I bring this up because I had the expectation I would be writing a different article - one that would let up on Snap and begin shifting my bearish sentiment. Unfortunately, the disconnect within management - and dare I say arrogance - trying to excuse the lack of growth in defense of user experience, has changed that expectation. Instead I continue to stay away from any investment and will maintain my prior call.There's absolutely no reason to catch the falling knife that is SNAP. Even if management was firing on all cylinders and I saw expenses making a difference, the sentiment in the stock would keep me away. Instead, both aspects are showing there is more downside to come. Continue to stay away, there isn't anything for you here.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Snap as well as other social media and tech companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4098795,24849,2017-08-14T16:11:15-04:00,Shares recovered after new low on Monday morning.Q2 results showed many troublesome items.Single digits just a matter of time.,"Last month, I talked about the possibility of Snap (SNAP) shares falling to the single digits. At that point, shares had just set a new low around $15.50, a price that investors currently would probably kill to see. Last week, the company announced its second quarter results, a report that was much worse than many expected. Shares hit a new low of $11.29 on Monday morning before rallying a bit, thanks to a surge in the overall market. I believe this is just a dead cat bounce, with the recent news supporting the notion that single digits are coming.While the company reported revenue growth of 153% over the prior year period, the top line number still missed street estimates by more than $5 million. Even after substantial adjustments for items like stock-based compensation, Snap's adjusted earnings missed by 2 cents per share. Two quarters are in the books for the company as a publicly traded entity, and in both reports, there have been misses on the top and bottom lines, as well as the key daily active users metric that many focus on.When the company was about to go public, investors were warned that profitability, even on a non-GAAP basis, could be a number of years away. In the Q2 period, the company reported revenues of $181.7 million, yet it lost over $195.5 million on a non-GAAP basis! Obviously, GAAP numbers were much worse, coming in at a loss of $443 million. That means that for every dollar of revenue generated, it cost the company $2.44. That's not a sustainable business strategy. Despite a more than $30 million rise in revenues on a quarterly sequential basis, the company's highly touted Adjusted EBITDA metric dipped sequentially as seen below.(Source: Snap Q2 2017 earnings slides)In just the past couple of months, the company's 2018 revenue estimate has plunged by more than $300 million, a drop of more than 15%, to just over $1.7 billion. Does anyone think that Snap can adjust its cost structure to mitigate the lower revenue base, because in Q2, total costs and expenses were over $2.5 billion on an annualized basis. It will be impossible for that cost base to stay flat as the company looks to double quarterly revenues from current levels as we move into 2018.Even if you throw out non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation, cash burn was almost $230 million in the period, and the company continues to make acquisitions as it looks to grow. Snap will likely require further capital in the next year or two if the pattern continues. An equity raise would be very dilutive at this point, perhaps more than 10% of the market cap if things play out as I expect. On the flip side, a bond issuance is likely to carry a high interest rate, further pressuring the bottom line. With so much negativity surrounding the name currently, it is hard to justify a capital raise now, but it could be several times worse for Snap down the line if results continue like this.In an effort to keep the ship from completely sinking, Snap's CEO and co-founder promised to not sell any of their shares this year. Unfortunately, there are still hundreds of millions of shares held by employees, other insiders, and early investors that are now available to be sold post lockup expirations. The current float of 187 million will easily soar, and that also means that short sellers will likely have access to a significant amount more shares that can be shorted. Once we get into 2018, the CEO or co-founder might start selling, adding further pressure from investors who want to bail.Does this stock have potential? Sure, but I don't think that is the case today, or anytime in the near future. Year over year, user base growth is decelerating rapidly as we all knew it would. That puts the company in a tough spot where it needs to work on attracting the next level of users, while at the same time trying to monetize the platform and keep costs under control. Perhaps the ending quote from the above linked article says it best:While this makes for a cute little niche company, does it really make for a good investment with a market cap of $14 billion? I doubt it, given massive losses and heavy cash burn. Monday's rally looks like another dead cat bounce, one we've seen in the chart below multiple times. In the end, Snap shares are likely headed to single digits. It's just a matter of when.(Source: Yahoo Finance)"
4099117,102436,2017-08-15T13:34:40-04:00,"Snap is on track to improve its top-line numbers significantly.At current price, the rewards outweigh the risks.At $12 per share, we rate Snap as a ""buy.""","Last week, after Snap (SNAP) reported its Q2 results and the stock fell 13%, we initiated a long position in the company (read here). We were attacked by many Snap bears who believed that the company is worthless. In this article, we will offer more detailed reasons for why we believe Snap stock is attractive at its current price. Note 1: All numbers are from Facebook's 2012 annual report and Snap's latest 10-Q. Note 2: For an apples-to-apples comparison, we compared Facebook's 2010 numbers to current Snap numbers as in 2010 Facebook had the same age as Snap today.In its latest quarter, Snap added 4 million users in North America and reached 75 million DAUs in the region, which is impressive since Facebook (FB) in 2010 had only 99 million users there. That's still 24 million DAUs higher than Snap's number (or 32% higher), but when a company is not far away from Facebook's path, you'll know there is a future for it. Also, in Q2 2010, Facebook added 3 million DAUs in North America while Snap added 4 million DAUs in the same quarter this year. This shows that the path between the two companies in NA, when they were at the same stage, is somehow close. That's a badge of honor for Snap. However, from a revenue perspective, Facebook was better in monetizing its users in 2010. For instance, FB generated $3.6 quarterly per DAU which is 80% higher than Snap's current rate. This implies that Snap's revenue growth is at its very beginning as there is much room for ARPU to grow.In Q2 2010, Facebook had nearly $540 million in revenues. However, Snap had $180 million in revenues in the second quarter of this year. That's pretty low. The problem with Snap is its weak international ARPU. For instance, in Europe, Snap's quarterly ARPU is $0.39 while Facebook generated $1.25 quarterly from each DAU in 2010. If Snap's European segment reached the same ARPU the company generated in NA, revenues could increase 50%, assuming no change in DAUs in Europe and no change in NA revenues. We believe that ARPU expansion in Europe is imminent. The company has 57 million DAU there which is just 20 million less than what Facebook' had in 2010. This means the company's low ARPU in Europe is temporary as it's probably due to management's complete focus on its NA segment.Thus, when management turns its focus to Europe, a place where 33% of Snap's DAU is, revenues would increase significantly. It doesn't need rocket science to know that Snap and Instagram are appealing to advertisers more than Facebook. Advertisements on Snap and Instagram offer a more direct engagement with users. And while Facebook's ads are boring, ads on Snap are much more creative and entertaining.Here's an example of Snap's sponsored geo-filters. Snap can't run many ads per users as Facebook can, but it has a price per ad. that's much higher. This makes Snap more appealing to big corporations that are willing to spend heavily in order to differentiate themselves from other small competitors. However, the problem that advertisers are finding in Snap is the platform's complexity. Unlike Facebook, running an advertising campaign on Snap is not easy as the company's infrastructure is at its early stage. That's why this time Snap copied Facebook (not the other way around) by launching its ""Ads Power Editor"", a platform that's similar to Facebook's campaign management platform. The improvement and simplicity of Snap's advertising infrastructure should make the company's platform more appealing to advertisers. Indeed, the CEO of the world's biggest ad. buyer stated that his firm will double its spending on Snapchat in the second half of this year. It's worth to note that Snap now can reach 75% of the total US population in the age group of 13 to 34. This would be an attractive entry point for any advertiser that wants to target this group. We believe that advertising on Snap will be a priority for any business that needs to target the nation's millennials.It's worth to note that in its latest CC, management stated that Snap advertisers in the retail apparel industry recorded 2.7x the average return across all online and offline advertising tools (other examples where Snap advertisers recorded impressive results were given by Imran Khan, Snap's Chief Strategy Officer). If that's accurate, Snap advertisers would be standing in line in the next few years. Simply, we don't like Snap's management team. This is a major hurdle as these types of companies need responsible/visionary management teams. What we don't like there is the excessive spending, which shows a lack of financial responsibility.For instance, in its latest quarter, Snap spent 73% of its revenues on administrative costs while Facebook spent just 7% (!) of its revenues on administrative costs in 2010. Also, the company spends heavily on sales and marketing expenses. For instance, in its latest quarter, Snap spent $91 million on S&M ($455 million annualized) while Facebook spent $167 million in the whole year of 2010! And guess what? Snap now has 1,859 employees while Facebook had 4,619 employees in 2010. So, the cost per employee is ridiculously high at Snap and must be reduced significantly. The 50% depreciation of its stock price should be viewed as a wake-up call for management to control its compensation spending. We also don't like Snap's huge R&D spending which is 7x Facebook's 2010 figure. While it's true that Snap requires higher R&D due to its graphics-intensive nature, we don't believe spending $255 million on R&D per quarter to generate $180 million in sales is justified. We like Snap's platform and the stock price that it's trading at. However, we would like to see some form of improvement in the company's expenses. The compensation per employee is extremely high and must be slashed by half or so.We bought Snap shares because we believe that the company's problems can be fixed as the company's DAUs (the hardest thing to get) are impressive relative to the company's valuation.Moreover, Snap's revenues have a huge room to grow. For instance, Citigroup expects the company to generate $3 billion in 2019, a 70% CAGR. If Citi's expectations are accurate, Snap would be now trading at 5x 2019 revenues, a realistic multiple for a high growth stock. To feel more comfortable with holding the stock, we would like Snap's management to be more stockholder friendly. Issuing guidance and slashing salaries/bonuses are examples. The 50% drop in Snap's stock should be a wake-up call for Snap's management. We believe that at $12/share the stock is a bargain and the rewards outweigh the risks.

4098652,92586,2017-08-14T10:56:07-04:00,"Snap Inc. delivered another weak quarter that sent shares to an all-time low of $11.83 on Friday.The soft spots, in my view, were timid user base growth and cash bleed; partly offset by better ARPU that drove gross margin higher.At the end of the day, I see an investment in SNAP as a far-fetched exercise in optimism.","Snap Inc. (SNAP) has done it again.After dropping a bomb in 1Q17 and seeing its stock dip back to IPO levels, the Venice, California-based company delivered another terrible quarter that sent shares to an all-time low of $11.83 on Friday. Before looking at whether the most recent dip might present an opportunity for the long-term biased investor, let's take a quick look at the results of the quarter.Credit: FortuneLess-than-impressive revenues of $181.7 million in the quarter trailed consensus estimate of $186.2 million, while a rich $245 million in SBC (stock-based compensation), representing an astonishing 135% of total revenues, helped to push GAAP losses to $0.36 per share. Adjusted for SBC and amortization, net loss of $0.16/share compared slightly unfavorably to consensus loss of $0.15.Source: Montage using company reportThe headline numbers, as bad as they were, don't tell the full story. DAU (daily active users) improved slightly, but less so than last quarter's already unimpressive results: up +4% sequentially vs. +5% in 1Q17, and only +21% YOY over a rather small 2Q16 base vs. +36% last quarter.ARPU (average revenue per user), on the other hand, bounced back this quarter to $1.05 after a worrying $0.90 in 1Q17. While the increase might seem encouraging to the more bullish investor, as per-user revenue returned to 2016 holiday-quarter levels, the figure is still very far from what I believe Snap needs to generate in the long run to support the business model (more on this subject below).Elsewhere, GAAP gross margin of +16% is substantially better than the -9% registered last quarter, although this comparison is skewed by much higher SBC charges above the gross profit line in 1Q17. Hosting cost of $0.61 per DAU was nearly flat sequentially, but continues to look high on the YOY comparison: +11% YOY.On cash generation, FCF took a larger hit this quarter than it had in 1Q17: -$228.9 million. The cash bleed now represents a gut-wrenching 121% of total revenues YTD. Meanwhile, cash on hand of $2.8 billion is still sizable, but much less so than the $3.6 billion that the company had at the bank immediately following the IPO, less than 6 months ago.As the reader might remember from one of my previous articles published in March, SNAP could prove to be a good buy for the long-term investor if a set of (rather aggressive) assumptions were to materialize. Under this scenario, annual non-GAAP EPS of $1 would justify a P/E ratio that was once in the mid-20x range, and that now sits much closer to a de-risked 12x.These assumptions included:On the first bullet, Snap continues to be (barely) in the ballpark. But the user base growth deceleration worries me, as the company saw sequential improvement fall from 7% in 4Q16 to 5% in 1Q17 to 4% this quarter. While trends can easily reverse, I find management's statement that ""bigger isn't better"" (regarding the idea that Snap's ""network may stay relatively small and intimate"") very dangerous, since scale will be crucial for Snap to turn sustainably profitable.On the second bullet, Snap is miles away from my target. The company might still be in the early innings of its monetization efforts, considering the company made its first ad dollar as recently as 2014. But to reach the $3 ARPU that I believe is needed to prove the Snap business model viable and the stock price justifiable, it looks to me like there is quite a bit of work yet to be done.Finally, on the third bullet, I do not currently see a clear path to op margins of 30%, even on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding sizable SBC costs, Snap's op margin in 2Q17 was -112%, only a modest improvement over 1Q17 levels. While scale would certainly help Snap turn its huge op losses around (but see comment above about ""bigger isn't better""), I believe Snap can only achieve this feat if it doubles DAU and triples ARPU in just about 3 years - a very high bar given the company's recent performance.At the end of the day, I see an investment in SNAP as a far-fetched exercise in optimism. The company can very well ignite user growth and jump-start its monetization efforts, particularly if the platform succeeds at fending off increased competition from the likes of Facebook and Instagram. But to make an investment decision based on these hopes is, for me, too risky - if not irresponsible.I reinforce my prior views on the stock that ""the odds are stacked against SNAP, given the negative short-term catalysts (covered in my previous article) and the unappealing long-term prospects."" I continue to think that there is too much risk and uncertainties involved in buying the stock today, even as share price hits all-time lows and may start to look cheap to some, more optimistic investors.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

4099576,102870,2017-08-16T17:41:35-04:00,"Snapchat has lost 50% of its value since its IPO six months ago. But the company suggests that it has an immense user base, ad revenue, brand recognition, and income growth potential.SNAP serves nearly 400 million monthly users, which provides enormous exposure to ad revenue. Therefore, Snapchat appears to be a disruptive force in its industry, as revenues have surged sharply.Facebook is often left playing catch up to Snapchat in an attempt to compete with the latest popular trends in interactive messaging. This could be an additional unintended advantage for SNAP.Snapchat would make for an ideal takeover target due to its ability to grow ad revenues incredibly fast. SNAP is far less like Twitter and much more like Facebook.","Snap, Inc. (SNAP), the immensely popular social networking platform, surged by 6.5% after an incredibly volatile day Monday. Incidentally, it was the first day of a lockout expiry where employees could start selling their shares on the open market, which they did. However, as they sold early morning and the stock cratered to a new all-time low, someone started buying -- and they were buying big. It might have been hedge funds, mutual funds, individual investors, or anyone else who decided enough is enough.Snap shares shares are down over 50% since its IPO, but since we are dealing with a company with enormous ad revenue growth, nearly 400 million monthly users and strong buyout potential, the time to buy might be closer than some expect. Has the bottom in Snapchat been put in? Or is there more pain ahead?Snapchat enjoys amazing brand recognition and is enormously popular with younger users. These consumers will likely become lifetime customers of Snapchat. Snap provides users with a unique feature they can't get anywhere else, and even if they could, Snap users would be unlikely to switch services due to extreme brand loyalty and convenience. Therefore, one of Snap's great advantages is brand recognition and loyalty. In fact, Snapchat is so well known that its brand is already reportedly worth roughly $1.7 billion.SNAP dropped 14% on results that were actually not as bad as many analysts had predicted. User growth was mainly in line with analyst estimates, and revenue growth came in at 153% yoy. The fact that Snap slightly missed on growing some of its metrics does not necessarily mean the company is not growing extremely rapidly. Snapchat's active user base has expanded by 500% in the past three years, and Snapchat could have between 350 and 500 million daily active users by 2020.However, the company's annual active daily user growth has somewhat stalled at around 50%. If the company can sustain this impressive growth, Snap would have at least 260 million users in Q2 2018, 390 million users in 2019, and roughly 585 million active daily users in 2020, using a 50% YoY growth rate. By using a lower 30% growth rate, active daily users could be around 350 million in 2020.Snapchat has experienced 50% active daily users growth for three years in a row now. Even if this growth rate stagnates or falls off a bit, in three to five years' time this company will have a much larger following of 350-500 million active daily users in 2020, according to a continued growth rate of 30%-50% through 2020. Even if we use a modest 30% YoY growth rate, Snapchat would have roughly 370 million daily active users. Either way, 350-500 million active daily users add up to a lot of eyes for ad revenue.This chart illustrates the fact that user revenues in Europe and in the rest of the world have an enormous amount of untapped potential and represent significant market share potential for SNAP. This strategy should allow the company to receive higher rates for their advertising services.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) receives more than 95% of its total revenue from advertising, and Snap had over 170 million active daily users as of Aug. 10, 2017, a 30% increase from same time last year. The company also grew quarterly YoY revenues by 285%. This is somewhat unprecedented growth, if you take a look at the surrounding landscape. There are few companies like Snap capable of delivering such promising results in the ultra-competitive arena of internet advertising.No one knows how to monetize Snap's developing business better than Google. In fact, recent reports surfaced that Alphabet wanted to pay $30 billion to acquire Snap a year ago (50% higher from now), but the offer was apparently turned down by Snapchat's management.However, Snap is much cheaper now, and is trading under $15 billion as of Aug. 10, 2017, roughly 50% of what Google was willing to pay for it a year ago. I would imagine that if a bid to purchase Snapchat came in, the stock could easily move back toward the $30 level --maybe even the $50 level in on year's time.Snapchat likely deserves the relatively high valuation it has now. The company has incredible growth, amazing brand recognition, and access to millions of loyal users. If monetized properly, this business can become immensely profitable. The trick is growing their user base, and with increased popularity among young people, Snapchat has remarkable growth potential. I believe the company will leverage its contacts and use its influence to create a system in which it will be able to continuously produce growth, which will in turn make it possible for Snap to grow revenues, increase margins and produce some real profits.Internet advertising is big, and it's the only game in town for many internet juggernauts. Snapchat is a very young company, yet it has already found a way to monetize over $400 million in ad revenue in 2016. Snapchat is extremely focused on building its ad business, and most of its revenue growth is projected to come from this lucrative business.One major element concerning investors is Snap's burn rate. The company ran through a couple of billion last quarter and only brought in around $150 million in revenue. However, approximately $2 billion of the costs were due to IPO charges that should not occur again. This actually provides an opportunity for Snap to surprise investors to the upside going forward, especially since the stock seems to have taken the brunt of the damage related to the one-time loss. Future Snapchat earnings will look much better due to moderate burn rate.Another obstacle SNAP has to deal with is competing with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on a certain level. Even though Snap's concept is unique, Facebook's Instagram acts as a direct competitor to Snapchat's service, thus creating a struggle for market share.Facebook has been adopting some of Snap's features. Facebook Live has ""masks"" now. Instagram also has geostickers. These features are very similar to what Snapchat exclusively offered -- in fact, so much so that it's not clear whether Facebook will escape unscathed from this type of predatory business practice. As of right now, though, this is forming somewhat of an obstacle concerning Snap's growth. However, this too can be looked at as a positive element. After all, competition breeds innovation, better services, and more advanced solutions -- and, as a result, creates higher growth, revenue, and more profits.Snap is about to produce roughly $900 million in revenue this year. That number is widely being reported to nearly double to $1.63 billion in 2018. This represents a nearly 100% surge in revenues YoY. Future growth projections are slightly lower than 100%, but even if we use a 50% YoY rate for 2019 and 2020, Snap would bring in more than $3 billion in revenue.Facebook shares are currently being valued at roughly 15x sales. If we apply that same multiple to Snapchat's projected revenues of approximately $3 billion in 2020, we get a valuation of about $45 billion, bringing the share price to around $50. However, even if the numbers are a bit less stellar, $50 is a lot higher than $12.The chart below illustrates that SNAP shares have given up roughly 50% of their value since going public around six months ago. However, we witnessed a significant move on Monday, when SNAP traded wildly intraday on extremely high volume. This is a key textbook indicator of a possible trend reversal. Furthermore, short-term remarkably oversold conditions appear to be confirmed by the RSI, which has been under 30 for almost a month. However, yesterday's black candle indicates a higher open and a lower close, which might not be a positive indicator short term. It might be smart to wait a few days to see if the recent lows can hold in SNAP shares. After all, just because a stock is oversold doesn't mean it can't go lower.There is good news on the horizon, though, given that the technical image is becoming much brighter. Numerous technical indicators are suggesting that SNAP is extremely oversold on a technical basis. A washout day appears to have been confirmed, which could propel shares significantly higher from current levels. It's also very possible that shares could retest recent lows. If they hold, this would represent significant potential for the stock to move much higher over the short, medium, and possibly even long term.Judging by the analysis concerning this study, all evidence points toward Snapchat increasing its ad revenue business to monetize and leverage its businesses, while at the same time are working diligently to attract more active daily users to Snap's platform. The company has seen growth rates of around 50% the past few years in creating a larger user base. Even though these figures could decline slightly, we believe a 30% growth rate in this area is very plausible to achieve over the next few years. In turn, Snap should be able to grow its revenue and, based on the projections presented in this analysis, could reach $3 billion in 2020. Furthermore, using a Facebook-type valuation based on sales, Snap's market share could be at around $45 billion in 2020 and would equate to roughly $50 a share.SNAP is here to stay, and it is already successfully competing with the likes of Facebook and other prominent players in the industry when it comes to advertising revenue. Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and other tech giants would love to incorporate Snapchat into their business models. Snapchat would provide an indispensable ad revenue stream with potential for enormous growth over a long period of time. Furthermore, with the right kind of funding, SNAP could transform into a massive profit-creating operation over time, with some sort of strategic partnership or perhaps even on its own.In our view, SNAP is drastically undervalued long term, even though in the short term it might appear expensive. You have to look at this company in terms of where it could be two, five, and even 10 years from now. The bottom line is that this stock could be a great long-term investment. Moreover, due to the volatile nature of this stock, it represents a remarkable trading instrument that could be utilized to realize enormous profits in relatively short time frames.I believe in this company, and if serious bid talks begin, my stock price target for SNAP is $30-$50 a share. If the company is on its own, then the price target is $15-$25 by year-end, which is still substantially higher than current levels.Regarding a trading strategy, look for an opportunity to buy September/October $12-$15 call options, or possibly sell $10 put options as well (though that involves more risk). Your stop-loss should be $11 in SNAP; if the price goes below $11, $9-$10 is very likely the next short-term support. To illustrate the potential magnitude of trades pertaining to options, Monday's near-the-money call options in SNAP expiring in 30 days moved up by nearly 50%, while SNAP surged by only 6.5%. Remember, however, that options trading comes with a high risk of losing capital."
4098539,53092,2017-08-14T02:59:22-04:00,"Snap has been one of the worst-performing IPOs in the past few years, and the CEO isn't helping.IPO investors in Snap were expecting the company to grow at an impossible rate and are facing a harsh reality.Morgan Stanley is responsible for the 60% drop in Snap shares, but prospective investors should consider thanking the investment bankers.","Investors that are looking for a risky allocation in their portfolio should consider buying Snap (NYSE:SNAP) for the following reasons:I think among the most important thing anyone that owns SNAP shares needs to be aware of are the conflicts of interest inherent in investment banking. Arguably, getting the investors and the yet-to-be public company to agree on terms that are mutually beneficial is a daunting task. Free market incentives are strong enough that almost always the IPO process becomes a win-win solution, but it's definitely not easy.On one hand, the higher the valuation, the more capital the company can raise for a set amount of shares. On the other hand, the lower the valuation, the more beneficial it is for the investors. This delicate balancing act is why investment bankers are critical to our capitalist system, but also why investors need to be mindful of the double-edged sword.Let's prove our point. SNAP went public at an astronomical valuation, and investors are now paying a high price for that. Shares were priced at $17, but traded to almost $30/share on IPO day. To put that into context, that was a nearly $24 billion valuation at $17, and nearly $35 at the highest trades on opening day!Let's recall an article from Business Insider that week:Furthermore, let's recall what one of the most respected analysts Aswath Damodaran said before the IPO:Let's take a look at the IPO math and see if SNAP deserves an allocation in our portfolio. Snapchat lost $514 million in 2016 on revenue of $404 million, according to Forbes. The good news is that as a cash-burning machine, SNAP was never subject to any traditional valuation methods and could spin the story as best it could. Based on the post-IPO trading performance, it looks like the investment bankers did a hell of a job.Let's put on our unicorn glasses (like the IPO investors did) and see what a profitable SNAP could look like in a few years.According to Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter on the IPO, the company could generate $4 billion in FCF in 2025:As I mentioned above, investment bankers are also magicians, and less than 24 hours later MS found ""two offsetting errors"" in their calculations.Firstly, it miscalculated taxes and is cutting $1.6 billion from its 2025 FCF calculations, or a 40% drop.However, any good investment banker will tell you that you must keep the TP the same, in this case $28. Well, how can you drop FCF estimates by 40% and keep the price target the same? Easy! Just lower the risk parameters.For non-investment bankers, please note how sensitive equity valuations are to small changes in WACC:Compounding this problem is that other investment bankers are much more conservative in their WACC assumptions.Most importantly, Morgan Stanley magicians use a 9% WACC for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Mind you, FB is worth almost half a trillion dollars and generated ~$10 billion in FCF in the past 12 months. It is an aggressive comparison to judge FB cash flows are risker based on higher WACC.I think the worst is yet to come for SNAP shares. Based on the amount of euphoria SNAP received on IPO day, there's no reason to believe that we won't see the other extreme and thus single digits for this name. An $8 share price would mean a valuation of ~$9.5 billion, and thus leaving an investor greater than 100% upside based on the original IPO price. I think we will see $8, and the risk-reward finally favors investors at that. Does Morgan Stanley agree?SNAP shares will also face continued pressure, in my opinion, because of the relatively close proximity of its IPO to that of Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN), which was nothing short of a scam. Due the fact that SNAP and APRN will often be compared for the time being, APRN's failures will further inhibit SNAP bulls from taking charge.Summary, SNAP is an amazing company that will likely grow revenues ten-fold from 2015 through 2020, or $56 million to $5 billion. However, the investment bankers priced the IPO so optimistically that it was almost impossible for any of the public offering investors to make a profit. Investors that do not yet own SNAP should wait for the stock price to drop to single digits before purchasing."
4098203,25120,2017-08-11T16:51:16-04:00,"Snap´s second quarter results provide few clues to become optimistic, as only the increase in ARPU looks reasonable.Very modest growth of the user base continues to go hand in hand with exploding costs.The burn rate is quite high and does not match with very modest growth of the user base, as Snap still looks very rich on a fundamental basis.The fundamental overvaluation continues to be the case, even as shares are down two-thirds from their high already, as I question if strategic buyers are interested already.","Snap (SNAP) continues to disappoint its investors. The company went public in March of this year in a much-debated IPO. Shares were eventually sold to investors at $17 per share, two dollars above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.Enthusiasm and perhaps a very early short squeeze pushed shares to levels as high as $30 in the days following the offering. Ever since it has been all downhill as shares are now trading at just $11.50 following softer second quarter results, marking the second soft earnings report following the IPO.Based on the fundamentals I see no reason to become very upbeat on the prospects for the business, as growth in the user base is not compelling and the cash burn remains very steep.A 153% increase in revenues looks like a decent result for virtually any company, but not for Snap which faces two issues. For starters, around this time last year, revenues were really not that meaningful. The other issue is that not many companies with the size of Snap´s revenue base has 1.2 billion shares outstanding.Growth is mostly driven by increased revenues per user, as the growth of the platform is really not that impressive anymore, in large part due to competition from Instagram. Daily average users came in at 173 million for the quarter, up 30.5 million compared to last year and up 7.3 million in the past quarter. The real growth driver is an increase in ARPU which came in at $1.05 per share for the quarter, marking big acceleration from the $0.90 in Q1 and $0.50 in Q2 of last year.While monetization is getting stronger, the active user base growth is not that impressive. The real disappointment comes from the cost base of the company. Despite a 153% increase in sales, the company has not seen any leverage in terms of the cost base, in fact, the contrary. Operating expenses totalled $630.7 million in Q2 of this year, which makes that the $449 million loss is equivalent to 247% of revenues. In comparison, the operating loss amounted to 161% of revenues in Q2 of last year, when the revenue base was much smaller.So based on the current trajectory, revenues come in at a rate of $750 million a year, while operating losses trend at $1.8 billion a year! The only bright spot is that adjusted EBITDA loss of $194 million, (which exclude a dilutive $245 million in stock based compensation expenses) is kind of stagnating after this highly adjusted metric revealed a $188 million loss in Q1.With 1.19 billion shares outstanding, Snap was actually valued at close to $37 billion in the days following the offering, which implies that the valuation came in at close to 50 times annualized revenues back in March.Shares have now sold-off to $11.5 per share which combined with 1.19 billion shares outstanding (or 1.44 billion on a fully diluted basis) yields a valuation of $13.7 billion. If we take into account (declining) net cash balances of $2.8 billion, Snap is still valued at $10.9 billion, still valuing the business at 15 times revenues!It is really a shame that the company is not addressing the expense base, as the growth in the expense base can not be rationalized given the modest growth in the user base and high profile life of the CEO. I completely understand why confidence in the business and management is low at this point, as Snap is really not delivering and continues to be pressured from an operational and valuation point of view. For now, the company really has to deliver on all fronts or has to hope that a big tech name feels obliged to make an offer for the business in order to boost their social media presence.Any sequential pickup in revenues is likely to be limited in the coming quarter, as much growth and expense discipline is needed to erase or seriously narrow the current loss rate of $1.8 billion per annum. While the company is not likely to run into financial troubles, given that most of the losses are actually paid out in stock, the company continues to run into valuation troubles.From a sentiment point of view, it might be too late to short, although the fundamentals still warrant such a position. It is kind of ironic to hear executives about a +$10 billion company say ""our dancing hot dog is most likely the world´s first augmented reality super star"", on the conference call given that they have these problems.That being said, Snap has the potential to become a decent business. If they could grow to let´s say 250 million users three years from now and boost ARPU to $10-$15 per user, (per annum) it could become a niche platform with $2.50-$3.75 billion in sales. With GAAP margins of 20%, operating profits of $625 million could yield after-tax profits of $500 million which combined with a market multiple translates into a $10 billion valuation.The problem is that the company will see dilution and cash burn in the meantime, as the current valuation still stands at nearly $11 billion ex-cash. You get the point, the reduced price is improving the situation, but shares are far from appealing to me at these levels, especially if dilution is taken into account."
4098522,22445,2017-08-14T00:45:04-04:00,"Snap's Q2'17 was actually not bad, but I do not expect revenue to increase as much in 2018.Taking into consideration the market cap vs. the massive losses, the dilution, and user engagement metrics, SNAP is still very rich.I reiterate my $7.4 price target; however, given how this disaster is unfolding, even that might be too generous.","Snap (SNAP) released Q2'17 results and markets did not take the results with a cheer. SNAP lost $443.1M for Q2 vs. $115.9M the same period last year. Revenue increase was impressive and rose to $181.7M (153% Y/Y), although slightly shy of expectations of $186.5M the market was looking for. Adjusted EBITDA came in at -$194M vs. expectations of $185.4M.However, I do not consider the miss in revenue or EBITDA the reason for the stock's tumble. Nor do I consider it the reason for the stock's tumble since its IPO.The reason why SNAP tumbled after its Q2 numbers is because the stock has been a bubble ever since its IPO. Please consider Snap: A Bubble Is Born. And when your stock has a stratospheric valuation, then something strange happens; no matter what kind of numbers you throw at the market, it's simply not enough. Chances are your stock will go down.However, besides the fact that SNAP's valuation is still in the stratosphere, there are other issues why SNAP tumbled and will continue to do so.DAU (daily active users) grew from 143M to 173M in Q2 an increase of 21% Y/Y. At the same time, revenue grew 153%. Is this a problem, you say?While revenue growth was very good, it cannot be sustained unless user growth continues at a much higher pace. The reason is because there are limits to how much money you can make from users.And that is exactly what is happening to SNAP's biggest market, North America.Source: Snap's Q2 presentation If you notice in the above chart, while North America revenue per user was up by almost 100% Y/Y, it has been flat over the past 4 quarters. So don't expect revenue to increase by another 150% this time next year, because I think SNAP is approaching some kind of limit as far as how much money it can make from users in North America.In other words, if SNAP does not increase user growth by a lot, revenue increase this time next year might be in the low double-digits. No, I do not expect SNAP to have the same type of success it has in North America, in Europe or other parts of the world.So in the absence of much higher user growth, don't expect revenue to increase as it did in Q2 next year, or next quarter.In my mind, it's only permissible to dilute shareholders if you are growing revenue and profits at a much faster pace than the stock you issue.Has anyone noticed how much stock SNAP is issuing?source (appendix page 2)Leaving the matter of massive losses aside, and also the corporate governance issue (in which two shareholders have 85% of the vote), SNAP over the past 12 months has issued 50% more shares. Granted that 200M of those shares were issued in the IPO and don't count, however, that still means that shareholders were diluted by 25% over the past 12 months.And my question is, will this continue in the future? How long can management continue to issue stock for compensation purposes? I don't know, but with the massive losses the company has, my guess is dilution will continue.As of Friday's close, SNAP's market cap is about $14.5B, according to SNAP's outstanding shares since June 30. Folks, even if SNAP does about $900M in revenue like analysts think, that still comes out to a market cap of about 16X revenue.I'm sorry folks, but that's a very high Price/Sales ratio in my book, no matter how fast a company grows. And if one adds the losses that SNAP is piling up quarter after quarter, and the dilution, then that number is even higher than it looks.SNAP is a disaster in the making. Any way one looks at the stock, it is screaming that it will go lower.In my previous article on SNAP, I gave a price target of about $7.4 per share. However, I said that even this price target was generous.I will stay at $7.4 per share, for now, to give management the benefit. However, if revenue growth stalls the slightest, and the quarterly losses do not stop, and outstanding shares do not stop rising, then even $7.4 is too high."
4097975,68315,2017-08-11T11:02:49-04:00,"Snap's losses are mounting.The company burns through almost one billion dollars in cash a year.A takeover bid could be a positive catalyst, as Snap seems rather inexpensive relative to its user count.","Snap (SNAP) has reported second quarter results that were quite bad: Basically all of the company's financials were worse than expected, with just a few positives. I don't believe that Snap is attractive for investors right now, except as a speculative play for those believing that Snap will be taken over.Snap's second quarter results missed estimates for the top line as well as for the bottom line:The company's revenues grew by an immense 150% year over year, only slightly missing estimates. That strong revenue growth was primarily based on significantly higher revenues per user:Average revenues per user totaled $1.05 in the second quarter of the current year, versus $0.50 in last year's second quarter. This shows that Snap is making a lot of progress in monetizing its user base, although the company is still lagging behind peer Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which grossed average revenues per user of $4.57 in the second quarter -- more than four times the ARPU Snap has been grossing. This is one of the main reasons Facebook is highly profitable and Snap is not, the other factor being that Snap has a much lower user count (which means fixed costs, e.g. for programming, are distributed over a lower amount of users, which leads to a higher cost per user).Daily active users increased 21% year over year, and total about 170 million now -- relative to Facebook, which is growing its user base by high teens currently, that growth is slightly higher on a relative basis, but a lot lower on an absolute basis. Due to Snap's user count being roughly one tenth of Facebook's user count, Snap should theoretically be able to deliver much higher relative growth rates -- the fact that the company isn't able to deliver higher growth rates here is a major weakness.When we look at Snap's financials, the picture is still pretty much abysmal:The company lost $440 million in just one quarter, with net losses roughly quadrupling from last year's second quarter net loss of $115 million.SNAP Book Value (Quarterly) data by YChartsAt that rate it will take two more years and Snap's book value is completely wiped out. Luckily the picture is a bit better when we look at Snap's cash situation:Snap burned through $230 million in cash in the second quarter (primarily due to cash from operations being negative, capital expenditures were quite low at only $20 million), but the company still has $2.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet. At the current rate Snap thus has enough cash to cover twelve quarters, or three years, of its cash burn. Since Snap could very likely get additional cash through issuing debt or through a secondary offering it is quite unlikely that Snap runs out of cash anytime soon. Nevertheless investors should think hard about whether it will be a good investment if they buy shares of a company that is valued at $14 billion despite burning through close to $1 billion in cash annually -- keep in mind that cash flows actually worsened compared to the prior year's quarter (as did net losses), which shows that there are no real improvements being made here yet.Right now the only catalyst I see for Snap's share price would be a takeover: Monetization is not as easy as it is at other platforms such as Facebook, but the user count still has some value for sure. LinkedIn, which was bought out for $26 billion, has a monthly user count of just 110 million.Snap's daily active users are more than fifty percent higher (Snap doesn't break out its monthly active users), and even when we assume that one of Snap's daily active users is only half as valuable as one of LinkedIn's monthly active users, this could still mean that Snap would be worth $20 billion in a takeover -- just as a ballpark figure.Snap's financials were worse than expected across the board: Revenues were lower than expected, net losses significantly higher, cash burn was worse than analysts had estimated, etc.Snap is making progress in increasing its ARPU, but that number is still quite low compared to Facebook's ARPU, and Snap's user growth is not that high any longer.If the company continues on the current track, it will run into cash problems in a couple of years, and its book value will be zero before that.A takeover could be a catalyst for Snap's shareholders, but apart from that I don't think that shares have much upside, relative to the company's much bigger peer Facebook.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles.

Down more than 50% since its IPO in March, and with the lock-up period already expiring for early investors, with general employees eligible to sell an additional 850 million shares August 14th; there’s a good chance, Snap has not seen the bottom yet. To just put it in perspective, Snap’s current float is 1.179B shares. So around 75% of that will be eligible to change hands in a few days -- scary if you don't see much upside. It’s anyone’s guess if many of the employees will start selling immediately next week, but the fact that they hold such a strong position, and I’m sure a lot of their compensation could have been tied to stock-options, wouldn't bode well for the future of the stock. Which one could argue, would further incentivize Snap’s executive team to look for a buyer, so employees don't feel like they’ve been dealt a losing hand, and leave en masse -- potentially continuing to tank the stock, and possibly even the company.With Instagram eating their lunch and owned by tech titan Facebook (FB), there appears to be no silver lining for Snap's current woes. That coupled with a potential acquisition of Zero Zero Robotics, a drone company for $200 million, has people doubting the sanity of Snap's vision and business model. Analysts and shareholders may be right, as Snap's once glorified spectacles only roughly generated $8 million of the $150 million of the first quarter. With the company currently floundering in their space, Snap appears to be grasping at straws for further innovation; and is in for a rude awakening, if help is not found soon.There had been rumors circulating around of Alphabet (GOOGL) offering $30 billion for Snap close to the time of IPO, and some have continued to claim that Alphabet is still interested in pursuing the deal. If the deal were to go through, it almost doubles Snap’s current valuation ~ $16B.The deal makes a lot of sense for both companies. For Google, they can finally establish a beachhead in the social network arena. You can't fault them for continuing to try -- especially after Google Plus and the ever forgettable Google Buzz came and went... although Google Plus still haunts our dreams when an unsuspecting colleague or friend adds us to their circle.For Snap, they became apart of one of the biggest Tech companies in the world, with a literal footprint of billions of users and millions of companies engaging with them on a daily basis. Not to mention, some of the smartest minds in tech and business to bounce ideas off of, and evaluate a profitable and unique path forward for Snapchat and its latest innovations. The fringe benefit of course, is that Snap no longer has to worry about down quarters, public scrutiny, and low user growth; while it gets its house in order and worry about the product, so it can get back to focusing on what made Snapchat so sticky in the first place.The numbers that came out of Q1 '17 were just simply bad. Snapchat only was able to add 8 million viewers from Q4 '16 to Q1 '17 for a total of 166 million. Even more scarier were the numbers broken down by region. This is what should worry Snap the most. Snapchat's inability to connect with the rest of the world will make it an ever increasingly harder value proposition for shareholders to stick it out for the long run. However; would be less so if it was backed by an international behemoth like Google.(Source: Snapchat hits a disappointing 166M daily users, growing only slightly faster)The average revenue per user (ARPU) was also down -- way down. However, similarly this number becomes less of an issue, if saddled into Google’s offerings. Yes, ARPU does show the total effectiveness of the platform and its ability to generate revenue; but if it’s more of a funnel or just one avenue to convert users in Google’s large ad revenue stream -- it’s less of a pill to slowly. (Source: Snapchat hits a disappointing 166M daily users, growing only slightly faster)Snap could deliver a serious blow to Facebook and others in the digital advertising space, if it teamed up with Google, which eMarketer predicts could be $113.4 billion in 2020.The space is primarily owned by Facebook and Google, which captured 20% of the entire world’s advertising budget across all media platforms last year. Snapchat, while disappointing on user growth in Q1, still has an impressive 166 million monthly users. There user demographics are also impressive and highly prized by companies and advertisers the world over. 71% of Snapchat users are under 34 years old -- and 45% are between 18-24. Out of the 166 million monthly users, 70% of them are female. Let us not forget, Snapchat is a content generating machine. The fact that everything a user creates (pictures, videos, posts), can only be viewed once and then is gone forever, is a constant reminder of how much more content they have to churn out on a daily basis. This incessant need for generating new content, to stay relevant or cool with friends and followers creates an almost scary dependency on the application. This dependency equates to hours on the app, which equates to ad revenue, which would be why Google could acquire and further invest in Snap’s new innovations and technologies.The alternative -- Snap doing it alone, is much more bleak.(Source: Snapchat Vs. Instagram Stories: What Business Owners Need To Know)With an influx of fresh capital by a potential Google takeover, Snap could focus on delivering new homegrown content like it did with “Slickhouse”. A movie entirely shot using the Snapchat platform, ala the Blair Witch Project, where people didn't know it was staged until after the fact. Or even more recently, when CBS announced James Corden creating a show strictly for Snapchat (a first for CBS). Could TV shows create fun and engaging mini-episodic arcs within Snapchat, or could any of the various streaming media giants want to find a way to deliver meaningful content one Snapchat at a time? I don't see why Google wouldn't want a piece of that to further coincide and potentially leverage their fledgling YouTube service (Google Studios per chance?); so they can own, publish, and distribute content, getting advertising revenue along the way. Therefore I'd argue, Google + Snapchat = a formidable pair.If you enjoyed this article, please scroll up and click on the ""Follow"" button next to my name to not miss my future articles.May your falling knives never cut too deep,Remy Kouffman AKA The Knife Catcher"

The social stock missed on most key financial metrics and saw another decline in the key user growth.The only real number that matters is that DAUs only grew 7 million during Q2 after growing 8 million sequentially during Q1. The company continues to face too much competition from Instagram owned by Facebook (FB).Source: Snap Q2'17 presentation The troubling part is that no regions show signs of promising growth. North America saw the most growth, but the ARPU in this region saw the smallest gain of 9% to $1.97 in Q2.Without the momentum in users, Snap faces a troubling situation. The company had a non-GAAP loss of $195.5 million in the quarter that blew past the Q2 revenues of only $181.7 million.The net loss actually grew from the $192 million level in the prior quarter despite the nearly $32 million gain in revenues. Snap has a very troubling trajectory with even free cash flow growing to a nearly $229 million lost in the quarter. The company has burned an incredible $400 million of cash in the year so the IPO proceeds aren't going to last forever at these spending rates.The stock just isn't going to see any gains when financial metrics are negative and continue getting worse as highlighted by this adjusted EBITDA table. The $105 million loss last Q2 nearly doubled in the last quarter.Source: Snap Q2'17 presentationThe key investor takeaway is that the stock is hard to provide any value when slow user metrics are mirrored with expanding losses. Note that revenues have to more than double without growing costs all while Facebook continues to pressure user growth. Avoid the stock as the problems are only getting worse from my past research."

In our view, the results weren't bad, as the stock's 12% decline is showing. We believe that at $14 billion market cap, Snap is a bargain.Snap's DAU increased 21% to 173 million. We believe that's impressive, as this number should be higher than Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) DAUs. It's believed that Twitter's DAUs are 44% (give or take) of its MAUs. At 328 million MAUs, Twitter's DAUs stand at 144 million. So, Snap has 20% more DAUs than Twitter.That's impressive, considering Snap is 5 and a half years younger than Twitter.Snap generated ~$182 million in Q2 revenues. That's an increase of 20% sequentially. If we assume a similar rate for the next two quarters, the company would generate $812 million this year. This means Snap is trading at 17x this year's estimated revenue. That's cheap considering the triple-digit Y/Y growth rate the company is having.Also, we believe Snap would manage to bring its hosting costs down in the coming quarters, as it would take advantage of its increasing scale. Building its own data centers can improve hosting costs significantly, but it's early for the company to worry about its bottom line now.Snap should focus on improving revenue per user, and we believe it will be successful in doing so. For instance, last week, WPP, the world's biggest ad buyer, reported it will double the amount of money it spent on Snap to $200 million per year. This should translate to higher Q3 revenues.Last but not least, we believe that over the next few quarters Snap would stop burning money at a worrying rate (it burned $228 million in Q2), as its revenue per user increased more than 100% Y/Y and 16% sequentially, while its hosting cost per user increased just 1.6% sequentially. The current gap between ARPU and HCPU is standing at $0.44, while that gap was negative  $0.025 last year. The wider the gap, the less cash Snap would burn.The bottom line: After a 60% decline from its peak, we believe Snap is a bargain. We also believe the rewards outweigh the risks at current levels. As a result, we rate Snap as a ""buy""."

Just for reference, the table also shows that competitor Instagram got a 2.4% increase over the same period.The 84 million downloads in Q1/2017, as we said, have been enough fuel to propel an 8 million increase in the DAUs compared to Q4/2016.Under this perspective, it is more than reasonable to believe that the 85.2 million downloads in Q2/2017 can easily support the 6-million-only expected increase in DAUs expected by the market.Back in March, after its first earnings report as a listed company, Snap price was down 20%-plus overnight due to missing expectations. Currently, the analysis on options on the stock also suggest a price movement magnitude of at least +/- 15% following the second earnings report on 8/10.Being myself heavily short on the stock, I must admit I am not happy of having found a potential evidence of Snap meeting analysts expectations.What's more, I also understand that a lot of negativity is already baked into the current stock price ($13.58, well below IPO price of $17), and also that analysts' expectations have already been lowered down following disappointing Q1, and thus easier to meet.On the other side, of course, I know that estimation on Snapchat's number of downloads can be only a proxy for its DAUs and can't be considered as fully reliable.Also, the company doesn't provide any guidance, giving analysts a harder job in making their estimates, leaving more room for error.As 84.6 million Snapchat downloads in Q1/2017 were enough to propel a +8 million increase in DAUs QoQ, the 85.2 million downloads in Q2 can easily support the expected +6 million DAUs expected for the quarter. Still, there are many other key factors which will heavily impact on the market's reaction to Snapchat's second Earnings Report, including (but not limited to) loss per share, revenue and ARPU.Please let me know your views and opinions in the comments."

(SNAP) reports second quarter earnings after market close on Thursday, August 10. Since going public in March, shares have declined past the company’s initial public offering price of $17 and recently hit a new low of $11.91 on August 3.Like other social media companies that have gone public, some of the main focuses among analysts have been on SNAP’s user growth, average revenue per user (ARPU) and the company’s path to profitability. In last quarter’s results, SNAP reported daily active users grew from 122 million in Q1 2016 to 166 million in Q1 2017, but that growth slowed on a sequential basis.Turning to the revenue it is generating off those users, SNAP reported that ARPU in the first quarter increased 181% year over year to $0.90, but that it declined 14% sequentially compared to Q4 2016. Some analysts have expressed concerns over the results of last quarter’s user growth and ARPU. While it was just one quarter, analysts’ concerns could grow regarding the company’s path to profitability depending on the results in upcoming quarters.According to CFRA analyst projections, SNAP isn’t expected to deliver annual non-GAAP profits until 2020 at the earliest, but they have said that they think the company “is poised to take notable market share in global mobile advertising.” With that, those analysts also have cautioned that a large number of companies will be vying for related revenues and that many businesses have developed similar offerings and features.Earlier in the year, Facebook (FB) launched several features on its Instagram platform that appear to be inspired by Snapchat features and the Wall Street Journal recently reported that Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is developing technology for publishers to create digital content that is similar to Snapchat’s Discover feature.FIGURE 1: POST-IPO DECLINE.

When the Q117 report showed sharply slowing growth, Snap crashed 23% during that single trading session.Snap's $17 IPO was, ""priced for perfection"", according to some analysts.

But the stock is still valued for very rapid growth while trading in this elevated $13 range.The Q217 earnings report may confirm Snap's slowing growth that was first reported in Q117.

Here we are on the day of Q217 earnings and this is only the second earnings report for this recent IPO since coming public. Candidly, this Q2 earnings report for Snap has so much riding on it for this young company that it may be packing more punch than the upcoming McGregor-Mayweather fight. So Let's Get RRRReady To RRRRRRRumble!The above statement almost feels like a Public Service Announcement to protect Snap investors from losing more money. It is clear from the large number of statements by newer investors in our comments sections and chat forums that people expect the coolness of the Snapchat platform to equal a successful stock performance. It is one of the classic mistakes of less experienced investors to conflate a company's successful product or service with the performance of the company's stock price. Focusing upon the successful Snapchat platform while ignoring the overvaluation of the IPO price, the failing business model, and the mis-management of the parent company, Snap Inc., has been a painful experience for some shareholders.In real estate we often hear that a property's value is determined by, ""Location, Location, Location."" Analogous to a real estate property's location, a stock's price can be determined by, ""Valuation, Valuation, Valuation."" Obviously, there are a number of variables that must be considered in determining the valuation for a stock like Snap. This Barron's article from the time period during Snap's IPO does a good job of addressing the pros and cons of Snap's valuation. The article finishes by saying, ""Stay away from Snap. It's priced for perfection."" So if the IPO price of $17 was priced for perfection, then how should we consider the current price of about $13.50? Yeah, sorry bulls. I think you already know the answer to this crucial question: Snap is still way overvalued. But let's discuss why this is true.Measuring the growth rates of the key metrics for this stock is very important for determining a reasonable valuation for the stock's price. Rather than repeating the same information covered in other excellent articles, let's use possibly the most important metric of all that is having a big impact upon the direction of Snap's stock price: Rate Of Revenue Growth.Many investors reviewed the YOY revenue growth for Snap in Q117 and felt like 286% growth was great. What these investors failed to factor into their analysis was Snap's Rate Of Revenue Growth as it relates to its pace of deceleration. In this context Snap's sharply decelerating revenue growth is slowing much faster than what was promised during the IPO process that had investors so excited and the IPO priced so high. Remember, the Snap IPO was ""priced for perfection"" and that meant maintaining rapid growth quarter after quarter for years to come just to grow into the $17 price per share / $20 billion market cap valuation.Please review the graphic below illustrating quarterly revenues and the rate of growth. Unfortunately, column 3 below shows a sharply decelerating Rate of Growth for revenues that is slowing much more rapidly than was promoted to investors during the IPO marketing:This graphic above is very telling. If you were to overlay the trend line for the rate of growth deceleration on the stock chart you would see that the price decline roughly matches the rate of growth's deceleration line. This is bad news for the future price action of Snap shares. Here is why: look at the revenues for the upcoming YOY comparable quarters in the graphic above. Even with this Q2 quarter that is about to report on 8/10/17, Snap's growth is decelerating sharply when it has a relatively easy YOY comp of only $71.8 million. What rate of growth might we expect for Q317 and Q417, which both have much harder YOY comps?The 2H17 optimism of some Snap analysts may be misplaced unless the company can somehow fend off the increasing competition in the marketplace and re-accelerate revenue growth. This task would be extremely difficult to achieve for Snap. This means that Snap's rate of revenue growth may continue its sharp decent into the double digit range in the coming quarters. The stock price could continue to track the company's growth rate lower.This is not what was promised by Snap's management and the underwriters during the IPO hype when they were selling this stock to investors. Revenue growth was promised to be extremely rapid, even hyper growth. Instead, Snap is only delivering a sharply decelerating rate of revenue growth. This is not the ""perfection"" that was promised when the stock was priced at $17.This dissonance between what was promised by Snap and what has been delivered by Snap is the basis for a large number of class action lawsuits that are pending. It is important to note that these lawsuits allege that Snap issued ""false and misleading information"" during the IPO process. This is fraud. Fraud is a criminal felony. Criminal felonies in the securities industry often cause people to go to prison. This high profile, very large, tech IPO has received a lot of attention. It is possible that this IPO's performance in the after market is being monitored by regulators. Our public markets need to be protected from the type of misconduct that has occurred during the Snap IPO.For many reasonable investors who have reviewed this stock during its IPO process it is disturbing to see the valuation that Snap management and the underwriting team sold to investors when they had to have known full well that competition was rising from Facebook (FB) and that this rapid slowdown in revenue growth was occurring. But Snap and the underwriters wanted to get this IPO sold as soon as possible before it became clear to the rest of the market that competition was rapidly increasing while the growth of key metrics was rapidly decreasing. If this well-known fact had been disclosed by Snap and the underwriters to the public, then a more appropriate pricing of the IPO would have been somewhere in the $5-$10 price per share range and not the egregious $17 IPO price that was foisted upon unsuspecting investors. The market is now in the process of re-valuing Snap shares lower to a more appropriate level as evidenced by the recent declining price action.A lower-priced IPO would have meant much less compensation for Snap management, insiders, and the underwriters. So these individuals rushed this IPO to market before the window of opportunity closed upon them. We as investors must take charge of our public markets that belong to us and make examples out of charlatans who intentionally misrepresent facts and abuse the trust that the public places in their representations. The people who priced and sold the Snap IPO must have known full well that it never had a chance to meet the expectations that were sold to investors during the fraudulent IPO process. This misconduct was wrong and our public markets must be protected from this improper conduct being repeated. A lot of decent people have lost their hard-earned money investing in Snap stock since it came public. Snap's Q217 earnings report will be delivered on 8/10/17 after the market's close. Trader's Idea Flow expects Snap to disappoint on at least one key metric and possibly on several metrics. The sharply slowing revenue growth that was displayed in the Q117 earnings report was a key reason that the stock price crashed. Expect a revenue number that once again represents sharply slowing revenue growth. If revenues disappoint again, then expect the stock to trade much lower instantly as the markets continue to re-value Snap shares lower. The current $16 billion market capitalization for Snap may still be far too high based upon the weak fundamentals of the company amid strongly rising competition that appears to be beating Snap in the marketplace."
4097031,94846,2017-08-09T16:49:47-04:00,"Snap will disclose its second quarterly report for 2017 on August 10 where its ad revenues, user, and product growth will be up for scrutiny.Snap has found an obsessive rival in Facebook’s Instagram.Instagram has not shied away from copying Snap’s most innovative features.The camera company’s biggest challenge has been competing against Facebook (FB) that is a little more than 30 times its size.","When Snap(SNAP) made its market debut, it was a star.Considered to be the second-largest tech stock IPO ever, behind only to Facebook (FB), Snap’s IPO was one of the few unicorns that went public. But Snap's stock price soon went in a downward spiral, falling below its IPO price of $17 per share. Adding to this mayhem, Deutsche Bank recently downgraded Snap to $20 even though it maintained the stock’s ‘buy’ position.Amidst all this chaos, the buzz around Snap’s second quarterly earnings is only natural.In its first quarter, Snap’s revenue climbed from $39 million to $150 million but failed to meet the market estimates. The second quarterly earnings will provide a clearer picture as to the growth engines that will eventually drive Snap’s business model.Ad GrowthOne of the key growth features to look out for in second quarterly earnings would be the ad revenues and a comparison with Snap’s closest rival is inevitable.Instagram has been cloning most of Snap's features (with no apologies), beating Snap at its own game. Its parent company, Facebook has mostly received good news in its 2017 second quarterly earnings.The share price of FB climbed 37% from $125 per share last year to approx. $172 per share. Its ad pricing has grown 24 percent over the past one year in comparison to 14 percent in the first quarter.Clearly, Instagram’s storytelling feature remains a driving force behind the ad revenues that continually add value to Facebook. With more than one million advertisers using Instagram, the most viewed Instagram stories comes through businesses using Instagram to promote and advertise. The photo-sharing app currently ranks No. 7 with over 700 million monthly active accounts and has become a living nightmare for Snap.The social media juggernaut, Facebook managed to beat market estimates in its second quarterly report, showcasing a 47 percent increase in advertising revenue of $9.16 billion over the same quarter last year. Interestingly, its mobile users made up 87 percent of the company’s overall ad revenue, up by 3% from the second quarter of 2016. Facebook has already hit 2 billion monthly visitors in June but has also warned that ad-load growth could slow down, with FB’s spending increasing and ad impression growth slowing.But even with FB’s slowdown, Snap may nowhere be close to that number. Having said that, even a slight growth in its ad revenue in the second quarter could provide a sigh of relief to its investors.According to a report by Recode, the average revenue [generated] per user or ARPU is a key metric to look out for. Snap’s revenue per user or ARPU is an important measure to gauge at when looking for Snap’s revenue growth. Last quarter, Snap’s ARPU fell 14% consecutively to less than a dollar. Improvement in this metric could remain crucial to Snap and its investors.But Snap investors may not be completely disappointed.Snap had some positive news on advertiser’s side this year. In June 2017, Snap got a fresh revenue ad stream through Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) through a global partnership. Even though the companies are yet to disclose additional information, a report by TechCrunch pointed out that the deal could well be valued at $100 million across two years. So far, Snap has worked with major media companies that include NBC, BBC, and Discovery Networks.In a recent announcement, the world’s biggest ad buyer, WPP also announced that it will double its ad spending on Snapchat. Last year, the ad behemoth had spent as much as $100 million on Snap. Interestingly, WPP also spends on Facebook. The spending on Facebook was about $1.7 billion last year and will be ""well over"" $2 billion this year according to CNBC.Earlier this month, Snap had also confirmed with TechCrunch that it had acquired a startup called Placed- that would help in tracking the offline success of digital ad campaigns. Placed has partner platforms like PayPal and Pandora attached with it. The association could boost the confidence of advertisers that use Snap as a primary advertising platform. Like Zenly, Placed is said to run independently.User GrowthAnother metric to be on the watch list of Snap’s second quarterly earnings is the user growth through Snap’s Daily Active Users (DAU). Snapchat has a relatively unique user base, with 35% of Snapchat's users in the US not on Facebook and 46% not using Instagram. But even with its devoted Millennials, the total number comparatively stands small in front of Instagram or Facebook.Scale is a powerful competitive advantage and in the Snap-Instagram saga clearly, the winner is Instagram.It’s rival, Instagram’s user base has only been increasing. Last week, Instagram celebrated one year of Instagram stories by highlighting a metric that Snap uses to gauge at its user retention and engagement.Instagram, announced that its users under 25 spend “more than 32 minutes a day on Instagram,” and those 25 and above “spend more than 24 minutes a day” on the app. But while this may seem like a celebration for Instagram and Facebook, it potentially means trouble for Snap and can affect its user retention.In February in its S-1, Snap had boasted of it's under 25 users spending over 30 minutes on the app every day while users 25 and older spent “approximately 20 minutes on Snapchat every day.” Amongst the associated risk factors, Snap mentions, “Falling user retention, growth, or engagement could make Snapchat less attractive to advertisers and partners, which may seriously harm our business.”Snap stated that if users increasingly engaged with competing products instead of Snap’s and competitors mimicked their products then such actions could harm the user engagement and growth.Obviously, Instagram seems to be doing just that.Snap user growth faces competition from Instagram, which has a benefit of attracting users by integrated platforms like that of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger.In the second quarterly earnings of 2017, Snap investors may want to closely look at the company’s North American subscriber growth since Snap uses the region to recruit new users at a rapid pace. The company added about 3.0 million new daily active users in North America in the first quarter of 2017, but only added about 1.0 million daily active users in the Rest of World region.Product Growth In S-1, Snap mentions,“If we do not develop successful new products or improve existing ones, our business will suffer. We also invest in new lines of business that could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue.”Because Snap likes to call itself a ‘camera company’, a look at its camera related products may be a wise idea.At 2017 Cannes Lions festival of creativity, Snap’s Spectacles won three golds for its youthful relevance, user experience, and aesthetic design. Spectacles connect seamlessly with Snapchat and create Memories because “they capture video from a human perspective”.But the product has not resonated with the interests of many millennial – Snap’s largest demographic. According to Statista, 81% of US teens said they use Snapchat every month, compared to 79% for Instagram. But few may be using Spectacles.As first reported by Barron’s, Aegis Capital's Victor Anthony had a bunch of millennials take an informal poll that reflected that Snap’s Spectacles may not be doing too well and may face the same fate as Google Glass. According to the survey, none of the respondents purchased the Spectacles nor knew of anyone who did.The financial impact of Spectacles failure may create a significant dent on Snap’s revenue stream since Spectacles is a vital part of Snap’s business. In the first quarter of 2017, Spectacles primarily contributed in Snap’s reported income of $8.3 million under the company’s “other revenue.” If Aegis Capital’s surveyed millennials are a good reflection of Snap’s entire user base then, Spectacles may not be a key driver in revenue generation for Snap.To stay ahead of the curve, Snap’s newly introduced features like “Snap Maps” and “World Lenses”, “Custom Stories” and “Limitless Snaps” which could be the key focus. Snap has added series of extensions to its existing products, introducing a search feature for stories on its messaging platform. SnapChat calling it Stories in Search allowed users to search through 1 million stories. In another recent announcement, it added 'limitless snaps' which made changes to creative tools by adding Magic Eraser and setting the viewing time to infinity.But Snap’s fresh features also seem to fail in front of Instagram’s strategic positioning. After copying nearly most of Snap’s features, Instagram may now be a step ahead in introducing innovative features. It recently introduced a feature to a small percentage of its community that allows two friends to go live at the same time. The screen splits into two and another friend pops up. Other viewers can like and comment on such feature.After a dull performance in its first quarterly earnings report this year, the second quarterly earnings may answer some important questions for investors.If not, then it will surely simplify one thing: whether Snap’s comparison to Facebook is a prudent idea or just an unfair match!"
4095969,103001,2017-08-07T14:33:12-04:00,"Snapchat shares have fallen well below their IPO price of $17 per share.Many investors have compared Snapchat to Twitter and other social media companies, but it is entirely different.Snapchat users and content will ultimately lead to strong and growing advertising revenue for years to come.","There are many possible reasons for the decline in Snapchat's (SNAP) share price. Most recently, it seems to be the ending of the ""lockup"" period during which original investors of Snapchat could not sell shares. Before that it was the worse than expected user growth and enormous losses released on their first ever quarterly earnings report. The stock has been compared to stagnant companies like Twitter, and it has proclaimed by many that Instagram will kill its growth with its copycat like features. However, these negative headlines will be trivial in the long run for many reasons. At a market capitalization of around $16 billion, Snap is a steal for the platform it provides its young and growing user base to communicate and create content in a way like no other service can.Snapchat Is a Different BreedThe Content is Entirely DifferentSnapchat has been compared to other social media applications and platforms, but it is truly something different. Snapchat provides a platform to make everyday communications through homemade pictures and videos reaching large amounts of audiences with minimal work. The content created on Snapchat is vibrant and descriptive making it easier for people to share what they are doing in a fun way. The way people use Snapchat is fundamentally different than the way people use Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.The Content is More Valuable to UsersThe type of content created on Snapchat is inherently more valuable than all other social media platforms. Snapchat users send video or picture messages to communicate what they are doing. It has replaced text, email, and calling for many because it describes so much more than the other forms of communication and it is so quick and easy to send. Snapchat has become so useful that users spend massive amounts of time on the application and its likely to grow as user growth continues and the network effect strengthens. Its current users need it the most to stay connected to others.Snapchat Advertising PotentialSnapchat has just started to tap into their massive advertising potential. The vibrant images and video content sent to others on Snapchat are an incredible place for advertisements and truly engage the users because it reflects their true selves and their daily activities. It allows advertisers to get closest to consumers' personal lives.Snapchat has already tapped into monetizing this content through Snap Ads, Filters, Lenses, and even their Discover category. All four categories represent huge and unique opportunities for advertising with massive user engagement. For example, it is reported that the rate for a Discover Spot on Snapchat can run companies $50,000 a day. Today I counted approximately 40 Discover publishers on the Snapchat application. Annualized this would mean the company would earn around $730 million alone in revenue on the Discover feature. Discover is just the start of the excitement. When you consider that there are over 10 billion daily video views and on average 9000 snaps are sent per second, the opportunity for monetization becomes much larger. Snapchat can monetize a fraction of these snaps through Snap Ads, filters, and lenses and make tons of cash. If Snapchat monetized just 10% of the videos at $10 per 1000 impressions, the company would earn $3.65 billion in revenue a year through Snap Ads, filters, and lenses. See Table Below.Jones, Brock, ""Snapchat Advertising Revenue from Video Views Estimation.""When you include the Discover potential revenues the foreseeable ad revenue computes to over $4 billion. While, these estimates are very difficult assumptions to make, this exercise serves as an indication of Snapchat's underlying economic earnings power. With 166 million daily users, Snapchat has plenty of room to grow. As its user base grows and its network effect truly takes hold Snapchat has potential to earn many times my foreseeable revenue estimate as they monetize more snaps and charge more for each advertisement.ValuationSnapchat is misunderstood in the way it is valued. Other analysts use ratios such as price to sales or look at its negative earnings and feel that is overvalued. However, Snapchat is in the early stages of monetization and cannot accurately be valued until full monetization of users happens. Firstly, with the little data we have, we know that sales have grown incredibly over the last year as show in their most recent quarterly earnings report. See the image below. Source: Snapchat 10QThe huge revenue growth shows that Snapchat should either have a massive price to sales ratio or that it is too volatile of a metric to value the company. Also if you see from the cash flow statement below, most of the losses were stock issuance expenses rather than cash losses.Source: Snapchat 10QAlthough still U.S. GAAP losses, these non cash losses are not as devastating to the company's survival as cash losses. It also goes to show that the net income number can be highly manipulated by non cash and one time items.I believe that Snapchat should be valued using a metric that is less volatile and truly more predictive of future profits. Snapchat should be valued by how many daily active users it has and how much each user is worth. As earnings reports come out, investors should evaluate how much they think each user is worth and how many Snapchat has. As I believe that Snapchat is a better platform to advertise on than Facebook, it should eventually be valued per user at roughly the same rate. Of course I will give a slight discount to that value because of the risk of Snapchat not being able to monetize its users.Currently Facebook (FB) is worth around $191 per daily active users after taking into account its 1 billion DAU using Whatsapp, its 1.325 billion DAU using Facebook, and its 250 million DAU using Instagram and its $492 billion market capitalization. Snapchat should be able to command at least 75% of that value based on their ability to monetize so far. This would leave a value per user of $143.25 and with 166 million DAU, an estimated value of around $24 billion which is much higher than the current $16 billion valuation. As Snapchat user growth continues, the estimated value of the business should also increase.ConclusionSnapchat is a differentiated platform with huge earnings potential. People group it into social media, but it is different. While many investors will try to use traditional metrics to compare it to other social media companies, the keys to understanding an investment in Snapchat are the way people use it and how much each daily active users are worth. Its first mover advantage and better interface will most likely propel its user growth for years to come dodging the competition from Instagram. As it grows its users and monetizes its platform, it has the potential to become massively profitable and more valuable."
4097657,99506,2017-08-10T15:39:52-04:00,"Snap's Q217 financial report was scheduled in between a large dual lockup expiry. The August 10th financial results fell in between the expiry dates on July 31st and August 14th.A substantial amount of 400 million shares in the July 31st lockup will not be available to sell until the insider/employee blackout period ends after the August 10th Q217 report.742 million shares come available for sale upon the August 14th date for lockup expiry. We might expect a significant amount of selling by the owners of these employee shares.The sheer amount of shares coming available for sale as the delayed insider sales from July 31st combine with the new 742 million employee shares on August 14th is problematic for Snap's stock price.While the initial lockup expiry on July 31st received a lot of attention, there has not been much discussion of the much larger number of shares available for sale after the Q217 report.","While the initial IPO float of Snap, Inc. (SNAP) was only 180 million shares, the dual lockup expires on July 31st and August 14th bring more than 1.1 billion additional shares available for sale. Many of the initial 400 million shares that were included in the July 31st lockup expiry were not initially eligible for sale due to the blackout period that exists prior to the Q217 earnings report on August 10th. However, any shares delayed by the blackout period will be available for sale after the August 10th earnings report has been made public.The delayed July 31st shares will combine with the 742 million shares scheduled for August 14th. Investors should note that this combination of shares makes the lockup expiry after the Q217 earnings report significantly larger than the initial amount of shares available for sale on July 31st. In fact, the number of shares coming available for sale after earnings and the August 14th lockup expiry is an estimated five times larger than the first lockup expiry on July 31st. Snap's ""real"" lockup expiry has not taken place yet, it will occur starting on Monday August 14th.History shows that when lockup expiries of this size dwarf the amount of shares in the initial IPO float that it is a negative for the stock price. The sheer amount of the new shares coming to market relative to the much smaller IPO float can be problematic for the stock price. This can be especially true if the stock has been experiencing weak demand prior to the lockup expiry. Snap fits this description well as its stock has been weak in recent weeks as shown on the chart below:Complicating the confluence of these two lockup expiries are the indications for Snap's weak fundamentals that have been emerging:Summary and Conclusion:All of the indications listed above seem to point towards ongoing weakness in Snap's overall fundamentals. With 742 million shares coming available for sale on Monday August 14th combined with any of the delayed 400 million shares from the July 31st lockup expiry, the last thing that investors will want to see from Snap is more weakness. This is why it can be argued that the ""real"" Snap lockup expiry is about to take place on Monday August 14th after the Q217 earnings on Thursday August 10th after the market's close.All of these shares coming available may put a significant degree of pressure upon Snap's stock price, increase the supply of shares available to sell short, and reduce borrowing costs. The bottom line is that it's about to get a lot easier to bet against Snap.It seems that these two independent research firms are becoming increasingly accurate on their calls for Snap's Price Target:Needham & Cos Laura Martin reports that revenue from Facebook's Instagram is rising faster than expected as a result of, ""lower competition from Snap than we had previously projected."" Translation: Snap's business model is in big trouble as Facebook competition increasingly targets Snapchat.Very shortly market participants will be discussing the increasing competitionfor Snapchat from Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in addition to Facebook's relentless pursuit of forcing Snap's eventual business failure. Other emerging competition may arise from Amazon (AMZN) with Amazon's Anytime. And while it is unclear if this fall's launch of Apple's (AAPL) AR products will compete directly with Snapchat, it is likely that this new technology will impact the amount of time that users have available for engagement on Snapchat if they are busy working with Apple's AR products.Snap's growth has been slowing sharply under the intense competition from Facebook. It seems clear that Zuckerberg will continue to do whatever is necessary to eliminate Snap as a viable competitor. The increasing competition from Facebook appears to be enough to cause Snap's growth to stall and thereby cause Snap's business model to fail over time. By introducing new competition for Snap from additional major tech firms Google, Amazon, and Apple the scenario for Snap can only become more difficult."
4094859,99506,2017-08-04T09:33:25-04:00,"Recent news reports that Google may have had interest in Snap last year in 2016 have surfaced. A spokesperson for Snap has denied the rumor.In 2016, Snap was perceived as a promising, hot property that could disrupt social media and challenge Facebook.In August 2017, it is clear that competition from Facebook is highly problematic for Snap. Competition is causing Snap's value to decrease steadily. The current trend lower could accelerate.Google must certainly be glad that they did not buy Snap for a rumored offer of $30 billion last year. Today Snap is valued for about half that amount and heading lower.This article will discuss a few reasons why a buyout of Snap by any company is highly unlikely.","As the immortal Yogi Berra would say, ""It's déjà vu all over again.""Every time some formerly popular tech stock begins its death spiral into the abyss of the discarded stocks of yesteryear, we begin to hear rumors of buyouts. Generally, when we begin to hear the bogus rumors of a buyout, it is a sign of desperation from shareholders who are hoping to exit the stock by any means possible.If anything, these rumors should ring the dinner bell louder for the short-seller sharks circling in the waters of troubled companies. The hopes of a buyout can become all that the shareholders of failing companies have left to hold on to in many instances. In most cases, these hopes end up being false leaving investors with substantial losses.On Thursday 8/3/17, it was reported that Snap (SNAP) had been offered $30 billion by Alphabet's Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last year in 2016. A spokesperson for Snap denies these rumors. Even if such an offer were bantered about last year, today the prospects for Snap's future have declined sharply and are becoming increasingly more bleak by the quarter. It is highly doubtful that any company would make an offer to acquire Snap in its current problematic condition.The Snap spokesperson's denial of the rumored buyout indicates that this offer for Snap may never even have taken place. Candidly, this type of rumor should never even have been reported on major media outlets. First of all, it's an unsubstantiated rumor. Secondly, it has been denied by a spokesperson at Snap. And thirdly, if the rumor even had any substance way back in 2016, then the offer occurred over a year ago which makes it irrelevant today.So why was this rumor introduced into the marketplace at all? One possible reason for the rumor to be placed in the media is that the stock is getting crushed during a lockup expiry period when some larger institutional investors are getting badly hurt. This rumor may have been an effort to stem their bleeding of losses while they dump their stock on unsuspecting retail investors who are vulnerable to bogus rumors of takeovers.There may be another reason that the year-old, irrelevant, unsubstantiated, and denied by Snap rumor was prominently reported by CNBC on Thursday. CNBC's parent company Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), via their NBC Universal unit, made a $500 million investment in Snap at the IPO price of $17.Kind of embarrassing for the parent company of an investment channel named CNBC to be down over $100 million on their Snap investment in just 5 months, isn't it? But CNBC has a vested interest in Snap. We might expect CNBC to continue to try to help Snap in the future as they tried today by reporting a bogus rumor, that was denied by Snap, and was rumored to have taken place last year.But if the Google offer to buy Snap did occur, then management at Alphabet would be very relieved that Snap did not accept. Today Snap's market capitalization of $15.2 billion is about half of the amount rumored to have been offered by Google last year.And Snap's future prospects seem to be very bleak. Recently, in July 2017, CNBC's Jim Cramer spoke candidly when he called the research downgrade, made by no less than Snap's own IPO lead underwriter Morgan Stanley, an ""obituary."" This certainly is a cautionary tale of how fast a company's prospects can change in the tech industry. Snap has gone from a highly valued stock of $29.44 per share after its IPO to now being given up for dead as the stock continues its precipitous decline as shown on the stock chart below.SNAP data by YChartsProspects for Snap's very survival are beginning to come into question as the company appears to be descending into disarray. Today Snap's business model is failing as advertisers are departing the platform, user growth is stalling, increasing competition is taking market share, serious lawsuits are pending, Wall Street is turning negative on the stock, and the CEO's response is to take lengthy vacations while his increasingly embattled company is in disarray.Execution issues are prevalent as the important Self-Serve Ad Manager will not be fully rolled out as expected until an entire year after it was promised and today, 8/3/17, the Snapchat platform was suffering outages on its most basic function of sending simple chats as reported by Reuters on the Dow Newswire at 1:42 PM.Candidly, we may very well be looking at a company that is in the early stages of implosion and failure. It is becoming increasingly worrisome that the business model may be failing. And it would be unlikely that the model could be rescued in its current form due to steadily increasing competition and higher expenses while at the same time growth metrics are sharply decelerating. It is highly unlikely that any other company would ever offer to acquire such a problematic company as Snap when it is clear that the company's valuation is still far too expensive.The graphic below illustrates the sharply decelerating growth of Snap's revenues. These are not the type of results that were promised by management during the IPO process and pricing at a sky-high $17 per share giving the company a $20.4 billion valuation. Please note the sharp rate of deceleration that has occurred in revenues as shown in column three below:And then there is the issue of the single class of voting shares whereby co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy control voting rights. My guess is that these two young executives are still in denial about their company's growing problems. At this point, they may be unlikely to sell their company. Consider that after Spiegel's lengthy $60,000 per night honeymoon with his new wife recently, he then elected to take an extended yachting trip with friends that has infamously been dubbed the ""brocation.""The company appears to be in disarray, the stock is plunging, and the CEO is on back to back lengthy vacations while spending lavish amounts of money received from the proceeds of the IPO. If nothing else, the optics alone of this situation are horrible. It may also indicate a lack of awareness by the CEO that while Snap is burning, emperor Spiegel is fiddling around.Bottom line: No company is likely to be interested in acquiring the troubled business model at Snap that loses staggering sums of money quarterly. And the young CEO likely sees no reason to sell. The yachting captain of the good ship Snap may even be willing to go down with his struggling venture. Will he take investors down with him? We will see.Speaking of seagoing CEOs: If there is any upside to Spiegel's honeymoon-brocation debacle, I think it may be that GoPro's (GPRO) CEO Nick Woodman may feel vindicated at this point. Woodman infamously bought a yacht costing $40 million while the value of investors' GoPro stock plummeted. Shortly after Woodman bought his yacht, his company GoPro fired 7% of its workforce. Optics matter.The following string of graphics are indicative of a failing business model at Snap that no other company is likely to be eager to spend billions of dollars to acquire. In fact, since Snapchat has no defensible technology moat, it enables other companies to simply build competing products. Indeed, competition from an increasing number of companies is now overtaking Snapchat in the marketplace. The graphics below indicate that Snap's prospects for survival should be questioned by prudent investors:So if you were on the board of a potential acquisitor of Snap, how much would you be willing to pay for the huge losses that you would incur from the acquisition of a failing business model? Would you pay the current market cap of Snap, which is about $15 billion, to take on the huge quarterly losses and failing business model? I doubt many reasonable investors would answer this question affirmatively. Most investors run away from losses and would not seek to spend a single dollar of good money to acquire the staggering losses that Snap would bring to a buyer's balance sheet.Even if you were interested in Snap as a prospective acquisition, why not just wait until the stock is revalued to a more appropriate level in the mid-single digits? The quarterly reports from Snap are going to be horrible for as far as the eye can see right now. Why buy Snap now when you can offer maybe one-third of the current value of this company into the future as the stock price continues its steady decline?And then if you do acquire Snap, there is the problem of having this guy pictured below on the right on your tail. Gates and Zuckerberg are two of the fiercest, most ruthless competitors of our time. They are almost a mirror image of each other in this picture below, albeit from different generations. Do you really want to spend billions to acquire the continuous losses at Snap just to have this guy that they call ""Zuck"" destroy what remains of Snap after you buy it?There will be a string of buyout rumors swirling around the marketplace regarding Snap in the future. Did you happen to notice how often Twitter (TWTR) was rumored to be the target of a buyout as their stock price plummeted? Apparently, Snap is following in Twitter's failing footsteps in this regard. And notice how the strongest companies like Facebook (FB) are rarely rumored to be a buyout target? The strong, successful companies are rumored to be the buyers.The weak, failing companies are rumored to be the buyout targets. If anyone still had any doubt on whether Snap would become Facebook or Twitter in the marketplace, then you just might now have your answer. In fact, Twitter has always been a much stronger company than Snap from day one of its IPO. Snap may literally not even survive as long as Twitter has. The free-spending CEO Spiegel has already managed to burn through 14% of the IPO capital in just the first 5 months of the company's public existence.Now more foolish talk has emerged of acquiring a Chinese drone maker for up to $200 million. Combining drones and cameras has been tried before hasn't it? How did that concept work out for investors? Please review the performance of GoPro's stock on the chart below:GPRO data by YChartsCandidly, this bizarre news of Snap having discussions with a Chinese drone maker sounds like an effort to pivot away from the failing core business model and possibly distract investors from the company's increasing problems. It is peculiar that this news regarding the acquisition of a drone maker has surfaced just four trading sessions prior to the 8/10/17 Q217 financial report. If the company is trying to take the focus of investors off of the upcoming quarterly report with the news of a drone maker buyout, then they are not likely to achieve their goal.Wasting another $200 million in IPO money on a drone maker will not increase Snap's chances to be acquired. In fact, the dwindling IPO money is the only true asset of value at Snap. There is very little chance that Snap will be acquired by any company at this time. But we will continue to hear these bogus rumors surface from time to time. Disregard them or use them as an opportunity to sell any price spikes that the rumors may cause."
4095916,40251,2017-08-07T12:44:04-04:00,"Slowing user growth isn't the problem we fear.  SNAP's user engagement is very strong.A post-IPO crash isn't always a bad thing.SNAP owns the most valuable market (millennials) while FB owns more of the least valuable market.The crash and recent upward reversal could be a good entry point.SNAP is high risk, high reward.  Prepare to cut losses if you enter.","I see more negative opinions on SNAP Inc. (SNAP) than positive. They focus on slowing user growth and negative income. They say SNAP offers nothing new and Snapchat is easily cloned by competitors. But it's misleading to talk about quarterly comparisons and crashing share prices.Let's clear the air...SNAP does NOT focus on total user growth! Their vision and marketing strategy preclude this. SNAP targets millennials with a user engagement strategy. They encourage existing users to spend more time with the app, rather than increasing total users. This is their growth strategy.SNAP appeals to millennials. It lives and breathes millennials. The kids enjoy SNAP's difficult user interface because mom and dad can't figure out how to eavesdrop. College kids enjoy seeing events unfold via SNAP's Stories; real-time data from independent picture takers is more credible than mainstream corporate news. And millennials don't have to watch any of this on TV.The younger crowd watches less TV and spends a great deal of time on their smartphones. The Snapchat app isn't officially accessible via traditional web browsers. This all proves who the target market really is.What's the problem with appealing to millennials? It limits total user growth. SNAP took the majority of the 18-34 year demographic with figures as high as 70-80%. They own it. SNAP accomplished this feat with very targeted marketing. But that alienated everyone else. The 35+ age group prefers Facebook's (FB) Instagram, as it links to their Facebook accounts and has a more user-friendly interface.Where is SNAP's new growth coming from? They already own the millennial market while Instagram is taking the older users.SNAP is aware of this problem. They don't see it as a huge issue. SNAP plans to grow by increasing user engagement with millennials rather than total users. Is this strategy doomed to failure?Check out this article by Kathleen Chaykowski at Forbes. She stated:I agree with this statement. And it offers a valuable insight. SNAP figured out an effective way to access millennials for advertisers. It's difficult reaching millennials with traditional advertising. Even FB (Instagram) failed to do this. Sure, lots of millennials use Facebook. But Facebook can't engage with them the way SNAP does.Kids view Facebook as their mom and dad's social network. This is no secret nowadays. SNAP calls themselves a camera company and not a social networking site for this reason. They are a threat to FB. This is why FB shamelessly clones and copies SNAP's every move.First, FB tried to buy SNAP for $3 billion. CEO Evan Spiegel turned them down and FB used Instagram to clone Snapchat for lack of a better choice. FB succeeded in slowing SNAP from adding older demographics. But they failed to take the millennial users from SNAP.FB faces difficulty targeting millennials. It's a specialized market. FB risks alienating their broad user base if they put forth too much effort. Since they can't put that much effort into it, they can't appeal to millennials the way SNAP does. Worse, SNAP already owns the majority of the younger market. This is a business with network effects. The first to own the market usually wins the market.It's the millennial users who engage with these apps the most. The older users on Instagram are less valuable and it misses the entire point of Snapchat. The point was to engage with younger demographics. A ""camera company"" is valuable insofar as it reaches millennials. You don't need a camera company targeting adults because adults are accessible through other mediums such as television.I see the stats. Instagram has some 250 million users while Snapchat has about 160 million. Many see this as FB's victory. I do not. People forget the younger generation is the most valuable for these companies. FB has more of the wrong users. SNAP is better positioned for marketing in the future, and the future is what expensive tech companies are valued upon. Mark Zuckerberg and FB are right to be wary of SNAP.I believe SNAP is very expensive. There's no need to get into the multibillion-dollar valuation and the negative earnings. We all know what value investors think. And value investors won't trek here.Let me ask a counter-question. What successful tech company is not overvalued? They're ALL overvalued. We're at the top of an eight-year long bull market.Companies like SNAP hold value because of future expectations. People think SNAP will reach scale and stop losing money. Predictions of the future are often hyped. So should we avoid buying shares of SNAP?I think they can be purchased. But don't purchase them based on fundamentals. That's a mistake in tech. Instead, gauge the crowd psychology and use the trends.Observe the following chart. Just last Thursday and Friday, SNAP shares reversed upward on higher than average volume. This is a great entry point. Just be sure to place a stop. There is no sound fundamental backing for a post-IPO high flyer. If the trend continues downward, don't hesitate to cut losses.There is something else to keep in mind. The SNAP crash isn't the monster everyone claims. FB shares crashed after their 2012 IPO. They went well below $20 and ended up at $170 today (a 10 bagger). I'm NOT trying to compare SNAP with FB. I'm making another point. It's not always a bad thing when shares crash after an IPO. It means that the company got full value for their shares.It's the underwriters who want the shares to increase after the IPO and they always try to lowball the company going public. When the shares crash, it means the company succeeded in highballing the underwriters. Both Mark Zuckerberg and Evan Spiegel succeeded in this matter. But today, we can buy shares where the underwriters originally intended.The entry point isn't bad. But understand the risk that this is an expensive company. It's high risk, high reward. This isn't due to SNAP being a poor business. It's a great business. The risk is mostly the high share prices.The short thesis on SNAP is based on fundamentals. When are tech IPOs ever based on fundamentals? It's too soon to short. The slowing user growth is overblown. SNAP plans to grow through increased user engagement and they've succeeded in doing that with the most valuable demographic (millennials). This company might be many times more valuable than we initially imagine."
4094325,103480,2017-08-03T12:24:21-04:00,"Snap shares have cratered from IPO levels, driven by a terrible quarter and the first set of lockup expirations.User growth is decelerating at alarming and will likely draw focus when Snap reports Q2 results on August 10.Near-term catalysts all skew to the downside for Snap, indicating the stock still hasn’t found its bottom.","By now every market-watcher knows that 2017’s hottest IPO has quickly become its worst. Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP), once richly valued above $20 a share, has tumbled to $13, leaving many investors wondering whether now is the right time to jump in. Snap has barely had a positive day of trading in nearly a month. It can’t be all bad, right?Wrong. Many investors bought into the hype and momentum of Snap without truly understanding the fundamentals driving the company. And the biggest fundamental of all is its user base.Revenue is clearly the headline metric and is still expected to hit $1bn this year (about 2.5x last year’s revenue), but what drives revenue? User growth. Without an increase in daily active users (DAUs), the ad dollars will not flow in and Snap may miss its $1bn target.Two near-term catalysts have the potential to tank the stock. The first is earnings on August 10th, where user growth will be a primary benchmark the company will be graded on.User trends are looking precarious. This article will examine Snap’s alarming slowdown in user counts, as well as implications for revenue and the bottom line. The second catalyst, which has already been generously covered in other market commentary, is the second and final lockup expiration, happening four days later on August 14th. Snap shares lost as much as 5% intraday when 400 million shares were released on July 31 (about a third of shares outstanding). How much do you think the stock stands to lose when 782 million additional shares are dumped into the market on the 14th, releasing almost the entirety (97%) of Snap’s market cap into free float for the first time?Resist the temptation to purchase Snap now, because the shares still have plenty to lose from here. We’re going to look at Snap’s user trends in two ways: first, standalone; and afterwards, in comparison to its closest comp, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). Like the IPO itself, Snap’s user base is much overhyped. Common wisdom claims that every kid is Snapping ten times a day, but the truth is that Snap only has 166 million daily active users. For perspective - this is about an eighth of the mighty Facebook’s current daily user count, but we’ll get to a more in-depth comparison in a second.More worrisome still is the face that user growth is anemic. Take a look at the chart below:Figure 1. Snap daily active users by quarterIn the last quarter, Snap added only 8 million users; the quarter prior, only 5 million. The company hides this by touting the large y/y numbers, but the sequential change percentages reveal the truth. Only 5% user growth in one quarter! Is this a reassuring foundation for a company expected to nearly triple its revenues this year?Furthermore - the year/year comps will start to suffer soon as well. Notice in the chart above that 2Q16 was a banner quarter for DAU growth, adding 21 million users or 17% sequential change, the company’s best ever next to 1Q14.We are approaching the 2Q17 print, and Snap faces this mountainous y/y compare. Even the company’s y/y numbers will start to look meager after we push 2Q16 into the base. Disappointment is virtually guaranteed.Now let’s look at Snap’s troubling user trends in the additional context of Facebook’s user base. Also recall that Facebook owns Instagram and with it, Instagram Stories, both direct competitors to Snap that are rolling in user growth.The most instructive comparison of Snap and Facebook’s user counts takes into account years since the platform was launched. Facebook is older than Snap, so obviously it has a larger user base. So in looking at the chart below, let’s normalize the years since launch when comparing the daily user counts:Figure 2. Snap vs. Facebook, daily active users by quarterNote Snap was launched in 2011, so it was three years old when it started reporting user metrics in 2014. Similarly, Facebook was launched to the general public in 2006, so it was three years old when it started reporting user metrics in 2009. (Facebook was soft-launched in 2004, but as fans of the Social Network movie know, it was only available to a limited set of educational institutions.) Three years out from mass launch, Facebook had 197 million daily users to Snap’s 46 million. Sequential and y/y growth rates are greater for Facebook in virtually every quarter. Six years post launch (where Snap is now), Facebook’s 901 million daily users towered over Snap’s current 166 million. Another way to frame it: Snap’s user base about tripled in these three years, while Facebook’s quadrupled - and Facebook had the larger base to begin with, thus making the growth figure much more impressive. People often regard Snap as an app that caught on like wildfire. It’s growing, yes - but by no means did it explode the way Facebook did. Currently, Facebook reports 1.3 billion daily users - 8x more than Snap, and a figure Snap is unlikely to ever reach.Weakness in user growth trickles into ad dollars. Advertisers pay for Snap’s user counts and for its supposed popularity among the coveted 18-34 crowd.A slowdown in quarterly user growth will upset more than Wall Street - Snap’s advertising customers will be up in arms about it as well. Advertisers can react either by cutting spend on Snap or negotiating better pricing. Snap bulls like to point out that raw user numbers aren’t the primary driver at Snap, but user engagement. Users engage more with ads, they argue, when they’re snapping pictures of themselves with branded nachos on their heads.This argument has some gaping holes. Snap’s own S-1 discloses that only 60% of users use Snap with the volume turned on. This is not surprising, as most of us carry our phones on silent all day. How long until advertisers object to the fact that their video ads (which are the bulk of Snap’s paid advertising) are being muted by nearly half of the target audience?Why was Facebook so successful, whereas Snap is just so-so? The primary reason is that Facebook is a platform technology.A platform technology lends itself to a host of auxiliary services; aka, it's the central hub with which users can conduct a variety of activities. Facebook is many things: a news feed, a photo-sharing outlet (two, if you count Instagram), a messaging service, a forum to exchange secondhand goods, an enterprise communication tool (Workplace by Facebook), and an authentication method for third-party sites, and a variety of other things besides. With its endless array of extensions, Facebook has woven itself deep into the fabric of our lives.What can you do with Snap? Well, you can take ten-second selfies and videos... and that's about it. Very limited for a company that touts its supposed user engagement.Facebook more closely resembles Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with an underlying technology platform that powers a suite of tools critical to modern life and communication. These types of platform technologies become difficult to uproot, and so they claim billions of users and grow into various markets and services, turning into true technology colossuses.Snapchat, by design, is a fleeting fad. Its ten-second snap format epitomizes the short attention spans and fickleness of its user base. From here on out its growth is limited. It's been a household years for a while now, and everybody who wants to use Snap has already downloaded it (it's free, after all - what more can Snap possibly do to attract more users?), hence its decelerating quarterly user growth. Like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), another ""one-trick pony"" with few extensible use cases, its users will slowly peel off to the next big thing.Despite its pitfalls, Snap clearly isn't worth nothing. But even at $12-13 a share, Snap is already trading at ~12x forward revenues, an extremely expensive multiple considering it's bleeding cash at a rate of nearly one dollar for every dollar in revenue.Investors often look at Snap's $15bn market cap and compare it to Facebook's $450bn, thinking to themselves: Snap is catching on quickly, and will soon enough fill the value gap between itself and Facebook. Nothing could be further from the truth. When Facebook launched, it took the world by storm and became a vital platform technology around which many aspects of our lives revolve. Snap, on the other hand, found a steady user base, but with its limited set of services, has little runway left to grow.Snap shares should find a bottom around $9-10, at which point its above-average revenue growth will still be assigned a premium multiple. In the near term, disappointing Q2 earnings and the August 14 lockup expiration should push shares closer to that range. At that point, investors should monitor updated data on Snap's fundamentals and user trends before considering a long position."
4093082,73185,2017-08-01T10:44:35-04:00,SNAP stock has done nothing but grind lower since its big Day 1 pop.The grind lower will continue as SNAP follows in the footsteps of FIT and GPRO.We think SNAP stock is a good short candidate until the market cap compresses to around $12 billion.,"Ever since the IPO, we have been bearish on Snap (SNAP). Today, we remain equally bearish. Despite the plunge in share price, SNAP stock remains overvalued considering its operational shortcomings, including troubles with growing the user base, attracting advertisers, and innovating to fend off competition. Overall, we think SNAP stock remains an attractive short candidate until the market cap compresses to around $12 billion.Our bearish stance began back in March. The first day of public trading looked a lot like Twitter's (TWTR) first day of trading, not Facebook's (FB) first day of trading. The big Day 1 pop and overly hyped up growth narrative drew eerie similarities to GoPro (GPRO) and Fitbit (FIT). User growth was slowing. Competition was stiff. The moat was essentially non-existent.After a successful Day 1, all those red flags began to worry SNAP investors. SNAP stock gradually grinded lower until the company's Q1 numbers hit the tape. They were ugly. Really ugly. SNAP stock dropped like a rock.And it hasn't stopped dropping ever since. Facebook (FB) has only turned up the competition. Bullish underwriters have thrown in the towel. Insiders are now able to sell their shares.SNAP data by YChartsAll this pain begs the question: is a bottom near for SNAP stock?Unfortunately for investors, we think the answer is no. Snap is a one-trick pony. The company invented this super hip photo and video messaging application. It gained a lot of popularity, but then growth cooled off once other social media platforms (namely Facebook) simply copied Snapchat's features. That has killed Snapchat's growth narrative. User growth has been slow, advertisers aren't really allocating dollars in the way people thought they would, and competitors (Instagram Stories) are gaining tremendous traction in the market. Since these problems arose in late 2016, Snap has failed to innovate to fix the them. Outside of Spectacles (which have been a flop), Snap has just unsuccessfully iterated on its now not-so-cool platform.From this standpoint, Snap is a one-trick pony. The last company investors called a one-trick pony? Fitbit. Before that? GoPro. Looking at those two comps, SNAP stock still has a lot of room to fall as the hype story continues to unwind.GPRO data by YChartsFIT data by YChartsSNAP data by YChartsAnd here's the thing from a numbers standpoint. SNAP still has a market cap of roughly $16 billion. Even under aggressive assumptions for SNAP to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, $2 billion in revenues next year, and grow at a 30% CAGR over the next 10 years, we still only think SNAP is worth $12 billion today. That is a 12x multiple on this year's projected sales of $1 billion.SNAP Market Cap data by YChartsBy comparison, Facebook trades also trades around 12x this year's sales estimate. It makes sense for these two companies to trade at a similar price-to-sales multiple. Although SNAP is growing much more quickly on the topline, its revenue growth is also much more speculative than FB's revenue growth. FB also operates at far higher margins, has a stronger balance sheet, and features a much more attractive and broad user growth narrative.From this standpoint, then, we still think SNAP stock is overvalued even in a best-case, everything-goes-right scenario. We think SNAP stock remains an attractive short candidate until the market cap compresses to around $12 billion. That implies more than 25% downside from current levels."
4093399,55342,2017-08-01T19:18:31-04:00,"Snap's lockup expiry wasn't as destructive as expected.That said, there could be trouble ahead for multiple reasons.Don't jump in to buy the stock just yet.","Snap's (SNAP) IPO lockup period finally expired on Monday, after weeks of apprehension among investors. Surprisingly, though, there wasn't as much damage as some might have expected. Snap shares fell by as much as 5% during the day on strong volumes, but recovered bulk of their losses to settle just over 1% lower than Friday's close. This, despite the 3.5X spike in volumes. Nearly 49 million Snap shares changed hands on Monday, way higher than the average trading volume of about 14 million shares.Given that about 400 million shares became available for trading, yesterday's outcome isn't all that bad. Further, at least some analysts believe that the lockup expiry is now baked into the stock price. The thesis being:While these stats might suggest that the stock is close to the bottom, there are reasons to be wary of the stock right now.For starters, it doesn't really matter whether or not the lockup expiry is baked into the price, because in situations like these, it all boils down to demand and supply. If the supply of shares is huge, prices are likely to move lower irrespective of valuations. So, why haven't Snap shares crashed?One could argue that Snap's current stock price is too low to prompt selling by the management and early investors in the company. Early investors and founders may indeed be less inclined to sell at these levels. However, the other possible explanation for the lack of carnage is that Snap is scheduled to report its second quarter earnings on August 10th, and employees are in the middle of a pre-earnings blackout period when they cannot trade the company's shares.As it turns out, this blackout period ends on 14th August, which is also the day when another important lockup expires. On 14th August, employees will be able to sell up to an additional 782 million shares, resulting in about 97% of Snap stock becoming available for trading. It's possible that employees don't share the same sentiment that the management and early investors do. And those who have observed Twitter's journey over the years may be inclined to cash in while they can, more so after Snap's disappointing first quarter earnings.Irrespective of what the valuations look like, even if a small percentage of these shares hit the market for sale, the stock may not be able to hold its ground in the midst of such a flood of shares.With second quarter earnings due in about ten days, things get even more interesting. If Snap fails to impress investors this time around, the problem may become more acute, with more selling coming through. In Q1 2017, Snap saw its user base grow by 5% year on year, faster than the growth rate we saw in Q4 last year. However, even this didn't quell concerns. Investors may want to see double digit user growth rates to be sure Snap isn't following in Twitter's footsteps. However, if Nomura's findings turn out to be correct, this may be difficult to achieve. In June this year, Nomura analysts noted that downloads of Snapchat had declined 22% year-over-year in the first two months of the second quarter. If user growth disappoints in Q2, a big correction could ensue.That said, even a good performance doesn't necessarily guarantee relief. Good numbers are likely to drive the stock higher, and we may see some short covering as well, given that short interest stands at over 18% of float. However, unless Snap does enough to significantly alter the long term outlook, these rallies may be used by some beneficiaries of the lockup expiry to sell shares. The impact of the lockup expiry may take a while to unfold. And potential investors who were waiting for the lockup expiry to buy into the stock may want to wait longer.As Michael Graham of Canaccord Genuity points out (source linked to earlier), ""There's a lot of negative sentiment going into an event like this and in this case it will stretch out for several weeks. It does take some time, usually, for the shares to get into the market. I think the more important thing for Snap is to show some execution when they report next Thursday"".As things stand, a lot hinges on key metrics from the second quarter, with the primary focus likely to be user addition. With rival Instagram adding users at a fast clip, unless Snap shows it can grow its user base meaningfully, we might see the stock correcting further.On a positive note, Snap's commentary around its ""Spectacles"" may be an interesting aspect of the release. While this segment isn't really big at the moment, eMarketer predicts that Snap's AR glasses will drive the proliferation of augmented reality in the U.S. And since this opportunity isn't linked to Snapchat's user growth, Snap's progress on this front is worth keeping an eye on.For now, though, conservative investors would do well to avoid Snap shares. Investors who are looking to invest in the stock may want to wait until the earnings release before doing so."
4094798,103297,2017-08-04T05:50:50-04:00,"Snap has been on a decline pretty much since the company went public.The stock is now trading under the IPO price and isn't showing any sign of reversing.Snap will likely continue to fall in the short-term, bottoming out within the next month before it begins increasing.","Though Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is certainly a fun app to have on your phone, it's a dangerous stock to have in your portfolio. This grossly overvalued company will continue tumbling over the next couple months until it finally bottoms out, presenting an excellent opportunity to short it.Issued at a time of very few IPOs, Snap addressed a general sense of eagerness across the investing community ready to ""snap"" up the first one that was listed. Upon the announcement of the public offering, a large amount of hype behind the widely used platform was created, too much hype in my opinion. That initial hype behind the Snap IPO which managed to send the stock surging more than 50% above the public offering price has quickly faded away, as the initial excitement behind the company now wears thin and questions of future profitability come to light. Those who bought it at the peak have now shed nearly 50% of their original investment as the stock has been trending pretty strongly downward since it was listed just over five months ago.I believe the initial excitement behind the stock led to a complete lack of investor pragmatism. Everyone was ready to jump on the first tech IPO we'd seen in a while much less the opportunity to become part of what was previously referred to as a ""unicorn"" (a privately traded company with an estimated value of >$1bn). There were some serious questions that should've been asked by those who chose to buy it on IPO day that weren't. One of these questions should have been surrounding the fact that the stock had no voting rights. This is unusual to say the least and just recently the S&P 500 stated it will no longer allow companies that issue shares with no voting rights (CNBC). I believe this calls into question the management's intent in issuing shares.The stock not having voting rights is hardly the concern surrounding the company. It means virtually nothing to the average investor and is much more important for institutional investors who would have had much more say within the company. I think the issue lies with the intent in management in going public. I believe it was simply attempting to cash out on its ""share"" of the business without giving up individual control of said business. Don't believe me? Check out the graphic below, though in recent months it has been better than the entire time the stock has been listed, it is still concerning to say the least.(Source: NASDAQ)What you're actually paying for with Snap's stock (because you're not paying for dividends or voting rights) is simply residual value. Net of liabilities the company's total asset is $3.73bn (SNAP Filings). Factoring in the 1.18bn shares outstanding (YCharts), what we're left with is a value per share of $3.16. At a current market value of $12.65, you would be paying a premium of 300.3%. That premium is comprised of forward expectations of growth and the possibility of dividends (both of which are bleak currently) and initial hype (which has an exact value to you of $0.00).I'm of the strong opinion that the relative valuation approach for social media companies isn't as effective as some other metrics because of the vastly different ways they operate in the services they provide and level of diversification they maintain as a company. Nonetheless I have included a quick discussion of this to be as holistic as possible. Below is a chart showing Snap's valuation at IPO, and I think it demonstrates just how overvalued it was upon going public.(Source: Business Insider)Obviously, we're sitting in a little different place today as far as P/S ratios go, but Snap's inability to manage expenses, diversify its business or continue user growth at previous levels don't justify its valuation even being equal to other companies operating in similar businesses (extrapolating past quarter revenue for the entire year to create a P/S for Snap, it's still sitting on the high side of P/S of similar companies).So I think that we can all admit (hopefully at least) that when you buy into Snap, you are (at least in part) paying for future expectations of profitability and growth in the company. There are three reasons why I don't think this will be the case. First, off of the existing user base, the company managed to lose $2.21bn last quarter. Secondly, how much more can we expect that already very large user base to expand (and even if it did, if it can't make money off its users now, why would it be able to in the future). Finally, it is failing to diversify its business, fads come and go, and while Snapchat is a great idea, it could easily become not so ""cool"" anymore within a matter of a year.Addressing losses off of current users: Losing $2.2bn off of $149.6mm of revenue is highly alarming. Even removing marketing, R&D and administrative expenses from its I/S, we would still see a loss of $13.7mm. How can it become profitable from where it is now? It can't. The company even said it itself that the cost of revenue (what's driving its large expenses) is expected to rise over the foreseeable future (Market Watch). If the expenses continue to rise (increased need for cloud storage as user base grows), it can't become more profitable.(Source: Tech Crunch)Addressing the slowing user growth: This is hardly concerning in and of itself for a large company. Once Snap expands rapidly throughout its target market, there isn't a whole lot more growth that we are going to see. The rapid run-up of users has now slowed and is stagnating to some extent. There will eventually be a finite (and potentially shrinking) number of users to extract revenue off of. Even with more user engagement, targeted marketing and more features, it's unlikely it will see an explosion of growth in its product.Addressing failure to diversify: I think the two points above prove that Snap needs a more diverse business; it can't make revenue off of its major product. As far as I can see, all it has is Snapchat and its spectacles (which rely on Snapchat users). I also can't find any mention of management discussing expanding its business into other segments. If it can't make money off of its main product and isn't widening the scope of the business, it really won't be able to be profitable at all.As previously stated, you're paying a large premium on forward expectations for Snap's stock. These expectations are not just lofty, but they're also already priced into the stock. If they come to fruition, you'll see marginal gains (maybe), but if they don't, you'll definitely see a continued wear down in the stock price.Investor confidence and management actions are going to be the critical drivers of where the stock goes. While I don't foresee any catalyst driving a sharp drop in price, any management guidance relating to decreased expectations, statistics released on slowing user growth or something similar could cause a quick drop in price. What I think we are going to see is a continuous downward movement in the price, more in line with what the company is worth and what we can reasonably expect for growth in the future given the current financial standing.I see very little downside risk in shorting the stock or buying put options at the present time. Even with short-term good news for the company, it is still grossly overvalued, and in the long term will continue to decline to a more suitable level. I see that value being closer to the $8-9 range, and I see this as a point of inflection for the stock to where the hype has faded; investors are behaving with logic and we can better anticipate short-term price movements. From there where it goes is dependent on whether or not the company turns itself around, but I am very confident it will slowly move to that point before anything else happens."
4096480,55342,2017-08-08T15:56:14-04:00,"A big lockup expiry is due on 14th August, three days after Snap reports earnings.Meanwhile, some good news has lifted the stock, giving relief to shareholders.Snap earnings this week could be the make or break event.","Snap (SNAP) is scheduled to report its second quarter earnings on 10th August, and the upcoming release could be the event that makes or breaks Snap's valuation. Snap is expected to report its Q2 numbers after the bell at 2 P.M. Pacific Time, or 5 P.M. Eastern Time.Adding just that tad bit to the uncertainty, the company hasn't provided any guidance, be it in terms of user growth, revenue or profits (losses). Snap CFO Drew Vollero put this down to the need for ""flexibility to make the right decision in the long term."" Given how things have been shaping up for the company, this might actually be a good move. Snap may be better off not offering any guidance at all, rather than taking the risk of missing it. That, however, leaves us with analyst estimates as the benchmark.Analysts expect Snap to deliver $189.23 million in revenue for the second quarter, translating to a 164% year-on-year (YoY) growth. While that's massive, it's important to note that analysts seem to have toned down their expectations after Snap's first quarter results missed their estimates. Snap registered a YoY revenue growth of 286% in Q1, with revenue climbing from just under $39 million to $150 million. Yet, Snap's performance fell short of analysts' estimate of $158 million. Analysts' growth estimates seem to be less aggressive this time around. Even where earnings are concerned, analysts seem to be less confident now than they were a few months ago. Analysts currently expect Snap to report a loss of 29 cents a share. This number stood at 26 cents a month ago, and 15 cents three months ago. While Snap's headline numbers undoubtedly need to meet expectations in Q2, that alone may not be enough to shore up investor sentiment.There's skepticism around Snap's ability to grow its user base meaningfully, and Snap will need to assuage these concerns. As we pointed out in an earlier post on Seeking Alpha, in June this year, Nomura analysts noted that downloads of Snapchat had declined 22% year-over-year in the first two months of the second quarter. If this turns out to be the case, the stock may be headed for another big correction. Snap's user base grew by 5% YoY last quarter. While this figure represented an acceleration in user addition compared to Q4 of last year, it still disappointed the street, which suggests that user growth will need to be stronger in Q2. Snap may need to deliver double digit growth to soothe concerns.Snap's second quarter results will be followed by the second big lock up expiry this month, making the announcement that much more crucial. About 400 million shares became available for trading about a week ago. However, the impact so far is likely to have been muted, given that Snap employees are in the middle of a blackout period. On August 14th, another 782 million shares will become available for trading. If second quarter results disappoint on any count, expect to see a big correction.Snap's love for ""flexibility"" also cost the company a spot in S&P's key indices. Last week, S&P Dow Jones Indices decided to exclude the stock from its indices due to the fact that Snap has multiple classes of shares and a unique structure that leaves IPO investors with no voting rights at all. While companies like Alphabet also have multiple classes of shares, the structures employed still allow investors to buy shares with voting rights if they wish to do so. This development means that by default, Snap shares will also be excluded from ETFs and index funds that track indices. With passive investing gaining prominence, thus raising the importance of ETFs and index funds, Snap stands to lose a source of support for its shares.On the brighter side, there's also been some good news for Snap investors. For starters, WPP, one of the world's biggest ad buyers, said it would double its ad spends on Snap from $100 million last year to $200 million this year. Given that analysts expect Snap to record revenue of close to $1 billion in 2017, WPP's contribution to revenue could be about 20%. While that implies a fair amount of dependence on this one source, it's still great news for shareholders right now. The fact that a big agency like WPP is reposing faith in Snap's platform should help its credibility, and potentially attract more advertisers if the audience continues to grow.According to reports, Snap is close to acquiring Zero Zero Robotics, best known for its Hover Camera drone, designed to take aerial selfies. While there isn't official word on this yet from the companies, a deeper foray into hardware could help Snap hedge risks that stem from depending on user growth on Snapchat alone. So, any commentary on this front will be worth watching out for.Late last week, rumors that Google had offered $30 billion to acquire Snap in 2016 surfaced in mainstream media, leading to some buyout speculation. However, apparently, ""Google is developing technology that would allow news publishers to build Snapchat-style stories that would live inside the company’s search engine."" All this while, it was primarily Facebook which copied popular Snap features. Apparently, now Google has added itself to that list. Betting on buyouts doesn't always end well, like we've seen with Twitter, and given what's at stake right now with earnings and a lockup expiry due in the coming days, investors may want to avoid speculation. For now, investors would do well to stay focused on Snap's second quarter results later this week."
4092742,26001,2017-07-31T12:25:39-04:00,Snapchat may be the turning point in the fight for stronger corporate governance.Index owners hold the keys to incentivizing good corporate governance.FTSE Russell decides not to include Snapchat in their indices because of sale of non-voting shares to the public.,"When an investor buys stock in a company, they are not merely giving a company money, they are buying an ownership stake in the company. The board of directors and management of the company are then accountable to the owners(shareholders) for how they run the business…at least that is how it used to work.Sky-high valuations and strong market demand for many companies shares, especially in the tech sector, have allowed some companies to weaken the traditional framework for management accountability that comes with taking outside investor money. Make no mistake about it, the only parties that benefit from bad corporate governance are the managers who run the company. Inflated compensation packages, lower company performance, increased risk, expensive and ill-advised acquisitions, inability to make management changes, these are just some of the results of bad corporate governance. Silicon Valley has led the way in systematically working to debase corporate governance practices and management accountability to shareholders. Google began using a dual share class structure in 2004 which really set the example companies began to follow. Google was such a hot company and so many investors wanted to buy shares that the founders and chairmen decided to use that power to ensure they could retain control and not be beholden to shareholders. Imagine the indignity of having to be accountable to investors who are funding your company’s growth and making you rich beyond imagination.Multiple share class structures allow a company to issue two or more share classes, one with voting rights and the other with diluted voting rights or without voting rights at all. Guess who gets the voting shares, you are correct, management. Facebook is the next most prominent company that jumped on this multiple share class structure. Both Google and Facebook have continued to innovate in weakening shareholder rights in the last few years. Both companies have added a third share class that have super voting rights making it possible for the founders to put most of their shares into charitable structures without losing control of the company. So now the founders retain full control of the businesses and get the tax shelter of tax advantaged charitable organizations they also control. Mark Zuckerberg owns around 30% of Facebook but has about 60% of the voting power. He runs the company unchecked, and investors have no recourse should his leadership prove ineffective in the future.Since late last week, new hope has emerged that fewer companies will be incentivized to create corporate structures designed to take money from investors while providing no accountability for their management in return. FTSE Russell, which owns the commonly used Russell 1000, 2000 and 3000 stock indices in addition to thousands of others, decided to exclude Snapchat (SNAP) from its indices. They made this decision because of Snapchat’s share class structure which included selling non-voting shares to the public, which leaves the company totally controlled by its 20 something founders.FTSE Russell deciding to exclude SNAP from its indices is a big deal for both the company and for investors that care about better corporate governance practices. MSCI, another huge owner of indices is said to be also considering the same policy for excluding companies from their indices. A large number of investors buy stocks through mutual funds and ETF’s that mimic or closely follow an index including Russell indices. Because most investors are not buying individual stocks but index funds, many companies shares are bought in large quantities simply because they are a constituent of an index. Not only is more capital available to companies that are index constituents, but their stock prices can often be bolstered by non-organic demand from managers simply needing to buy shares because the company is included in an index and they are managing a fund that replicates that index.Currently, about 46% of all assets in the U.S. stock market are in index funds according to Morningstar. This amazing statistic demonstrates the enormous role index owners like FTSE Russell have in maintaining the integrity of the financial market. The responsibility index owners have to the markets begins by making sure companies are not rewarded for establishing corporate governance policies which disenfranchise shareholders therefore threatening the long-term stability of the financial markets. FTSE Russell has made a huge step by listening to the concerns of institutional investors who have been encouraging index owners to take the action of excluding stocks with inadequate corporate governance from their indices to combat the further erosion of shareholder rights.The impact the decision that FTSE Russell has rendered to exclude SNAP from their indices are broad reaching and should be a warning sign to other management teams with similar disdain for their shareholders. Since this decision by FTSE Russell was announced SNAP is down -2%. However, should you be holding SNAP or considering buying at these prices which are off -53% from their post IPO high and -19% from the IPO price, you may want to reconsider. SNAP has many problems, but their arrogance in asking the public for investment with no recourse is where their problems began. The stock has not found traction for many reasons, but a big reason is that institutions mostly avoided participating in the IPO and subsequent market for shares specifically because of the corporate governance deficiencies. SNAP is now facing strong headwinds as a result of their unacceptable corporate governance practices including exclusion from major indices and unwillingness of institutions to buy shares. To make matters worse, the lock up periods are beginning to expire for insiders this week and within a few months almost a billion shares of SNAP may be registered. To put that number into prospective, SNAP sold only 200 million shares at IPO and the share price is not finding any price support yet. Who is going to buy the billion shares and at what price?Corporate governance is not just picking on the rich, nor does it seek to stymie innovation or risk-taking within growing companies. Corporate governance is so important because it protects the trust in financial markets which underpin their success. The U.S. has been so successful and maintained such a dominant economy because businesses are able to attract domestic and international investment, making capital not only abundant but cheap. The reason for the availability of capital the U.S. has enjoyed is simple…trust. In return for providing the financing a company needs to grow, investors can count on accountability from management, and if needed investors have recourse to protect their investment by voting to change management through their voting rights. Good corporate governance is not only in the interest of companies but society as a whole. A strong economy requires trust which comes through the best corporate governance possible.Despite being in the best interest of both companies and society, good corporate governance often does not get the attention it deserves because it only matters when things go wrong. Policing and regulating corporate governance is like disaster planning, no one cares or wants to spend the time or money planning for emergency readiness until a huge hurricane strikes a major urban center that is caught unprepared. Disaster planning only matters when things go very wrong, but by the time it is needed it is too late. Corporate governance must be maintained and nurtured or there will be a huge economic price to pay when economic challenges present themselves.The tech mega companies have hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap, the economic damage, and damage to the trust of investors when things do go wrong cannot be overstated. Economies and markets change and companies never dominate forever. When these poorly governed companies struggle, investors will have no way to get new managers in with a different skill set that is better suited to the environment because the founders have locked in their control."

While hedge funds are thought of as the secretive force that can cause a company's stock to succeed or fail, increasingly, it is ETF flows that actually drive short-term stock price moves.The flagship SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) itself has $243 billion in assets. Assume that the S&P 500 would have given a modest 0.1% allocation to Snap - if not for the lack of voting rights - and the SPY ETF would have allocated around $250 million to SNAP stock. That's enough to buy 19 million shares at today's prices.Latest short-selling data shows that shorts have bet against 69 million shares of SNAP stock. We can see how the S&P 500 ETF being forced to buy 19 million shares due to indexing rules could have caused a run on the shorts and helped sop up a lot of supply in SNAP stock heading into the lock-up expiration. Add in other index ETFs with smaller asset bases than SPY, and the effect could have been quite large.Instead, due to Snap management's intrepid decision not to give any voting rights to its shareholders, the company won't benefit from any meaningful amount of passive index-fund based buying. Not surprisingly, SNAP stock plumbed new all-time lows on the news.This decision will hardly be appreciated by Snap's shareholders. However, for the broader investing world, this is great news. I cynically expected Snap stock to perform relatively well - see my ""Why Snap Isn't Collapsing Yet"" article from March. I'm pleased to have been wrong.The fact is, most seasoned investors knew Snap was a terrible company out of the gate. Many people (including myself) didn't short the firm, since we figured a combination of tech hype, uninformed millennial investors, and me-too passive money would flood into the stock, keeping it afloat at least until the share lock-up.However, much to my surprise, Snap's decision not to offer voting rights appears to actually have had consequences. After both Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) got away with giving investors a much smaller voting share than management, it appeared this sort of behavior would be tolerated - if not openly accepted. Whether it was Snap's poor economic performance, or its complete shunning of voting rights, in any case, the envelope was pushed too far, and the index managers decided to exclude Snap.Passive investing has a number of drawbacks. That's a subject too large for this column, but let me focus back in one concern that I've raised previously - ETFs buying stocks in sham companies solely due to market-cap weighting. In January 2016, I wrote:While Snap is a slightly different example from this sort of passive investing flaw described above, it shows the types of problems that arise from money being doled out simply based on market caps. The larger a company grows, the more money passive investors are forced to throw at it simply due to index construction.For indexing to keep working, the index managers need to implement controls to keep companies that would abuse the system from gobbling up uninformed investors' money. In some cases, such as pumps and dumps, some sort of quantitative quality screen should be implemented that tries to exclude fly-by-night stock promotions. For others, such as Snap, judging management's allegiance to shareholders is of pivotal importance. If management isn't aligned with common stockholders - by denying them voting rights, taking excessive stock option comp, or otherwise consuming too much of the pie, then the passive indexes should exclude them.As passive indexing continues to grow, the managers must do more to protect their ETF stakeholders. There are a lot of underhanded management teams out there - let's not pretend that the US market is squeaky clean. And they can and will take advantage of the opportunities that come with forced allocations into their stocks from passive investors - unless the index managers take steps to filter out low quality and/or shareholder-unfriendly firms.Snap in particular is a great test case, since more and more tech unicorns are going public nowadays. And the latest batch are showing ever-weaker fundamentals and more questionable business models. We're hardly back to 1999 yet, but underwriting standards are falling. Forward-looking moves from Russell and S&P Global can help protect investors and keep markets relatively more fair than they'd otherwise be."
4094453,22445,2017-08-03T15:11:12-04:00,"Snap is probably the most overvalued IPO I have ever seen.I'm actually shocked that so many investors wanted in on such an expensive stock.I value SNAP on a comparable price/sales ratio as Twitter, and the fair value comes out to $7.4 per share.","I'm actually amazed that so many market commentators and analysts point to the fact that the lockup period for Snap (SNAP) shares will expire shortly and that is a reason for the stock to plunge further. Don't get me wrong, it's a good reason and shares will go further south. However that's not the reason the stock has fallen so much to date.I am actually shocked that no one over the past several months ever mentioned the valuation of the company. They keep talking about user engagement and competition from Facebook's (FB) Instagram, but they overlook what they are paying for this company. No one mentions that this stock was a bubble to begin with - that's what amazes me. Please consider Snap: A Bubble Is Born.How SNAP compares to Twitter While SNAP and Twitter (TWTR) are two different companies, nevertheless TWTR is the nearest company I can find to compare to SNAP, in order to try to get a sense of what SNAP might be worth.And the reason why I am taking TWTR as an example is because it also has growth issues. Like SNAP, TWTR has had a difficult time increasing user engagement over the past several years. While profits also matter, user engagement is the yeast that will lead to profits. And for the most part, both companies are not exactly valued based on profit metrics - user engagement is party used to value them.Let me start by showing you one of my favorite indicators for fast growth companies that do not make money.Please note that at some point TWTR was trading at a price/sales ratio as high as 28, and today this ratio is just shy of 5. Does anyone know the figure SNAP traded at its IPO? The answer is almost 60. And I do not even know what the figure was when the stock traded at around $25 a share.The next issue is revenue.TWTR is doing almost 3X more in revenue per quarter than TWTR. Granted SNAP's revenue is forecasted to grow faster than TWTR over the next several years (for now at least), however please note you are paying ""an arm and a leg"" for this growth. And let's also not forget the company is not making money, and is not forecasted to make money anytime soon.But if you ask me, Snap's future growth forecasts are in jeopardy. To begin with we all know FB is going after SNAP with a vengeance. And as far as the latest statistics are concerned, FB's Instagram is doing much better than SNAP.TechCrunch reported Instagram now has 250 million daily users, compared to just 166 million for SNAP. In addition, SNAP's user growth has stalled to just 5% on a M/M basis, compared to 17.2% before Instagram stories was introduced.Another reason might be that SNAP's App is not downloaded as much anymore.A while back Nomura Instinet analyst Anthony DiClemente (via theFly) said that for April and May, SensorTower said Snap worldwide downloads were lower by 22% Y/Y. And the surprise was that iOS downloads were down 40% (same story via Barron's).So while many analysts are still very bullish on SNAP, I think growth projections will be going down in the future, and I doubt SNAP will ever grow the way many people think.Also, has anyone looked at how much money SNAP is losing?source Leaving R&D aside (about $805 million), and leaving G&A aside (a whopping $1.17 billion), how exactly does any company spend $220 million for marketing, with revenue for the quarter of $150 million? Does that make any sense?Folks, if SNAP's numbers continue along these lines, I doubt this company will remain in business for long. I'm sorry, but I see no value in any company that produces over $2 billion in losses in a single quarter with revenue of only $150. And I don't care how fast revenues grow.So my question is, why is SNAP's market cap so much higher than TWTR's?The answer is it shouldn't, it should be a lot lower.So how much is SNAP worth?Well if you want my opinion, my answer is zero. However folks, I feel generous today, so my price target for SNAP will be comparable to what TWTR trades for, on a price/sales basis.Analysts think SNAP will do $1.86 billion in revenue for 2018. If we multiply that by 4.6 (TWTR's Price/Sales ratio, chart above), then SNAP's market should be about $8.5 billion.SNAP has three classes of shares that total 1,179 billion in total. So if we divide that by $8.5 billion, the magic number is $7.4 per share.Please note I am not taking into consideration the massive quarterly losses the company has, nor the fact that about 85% of the voting rights rest with two individuals (which merit a huge discount from the market cap I calculated above). But like I said, I feel generous today."
4090030,41741,2017-07-24T20:58:27-04:00,"If there’s one thing Snap could say to investors it should be ""stop comparing us to Facebook.""Snapchat could find itself in the same boat as Twitter.Can an activist right this ship that’s gone off course so quickly?","I have alluded to Snap (NASDAQ: SNAP) not being an activist investor target given the ownership structure, but the bigger question is - what could activist investors even do for Snapchat? For starters, activist investors generally do not invest in growth. The turnaround path for Snapchat is pretty clear, and I believe they have an idea, but it’ll be all about whether they can execute.Every millennial has some sort of addiction to one or more of social media. Most investors have heard plenty about Snapchat's falling below its $17/share IPO price. Its significance is important to understand - not only does it show extreme weakness and lack of demand, but it should exacerbate selling as new shorts enter and buyers trapped from the first few weeks of the IPO begin to jump ship. It's a company that's very easy to hate these days considering they don't make money and they're constantly making new lows.In the tech space, you look at Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and what's not to like? Facebook made over $10 billion in net income last year. They have managed to post steady 50% revenue growth, which is rare considering its already massive size. They've also stepped up their battle against Snapchat with Instagram stories. They have been in a perfect uptrend since 2014.Then there’s Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR), which has been a rumored takeover target by about any and every company that's publicly listed at this point - as well as being a rumored activist target, names like Carl Icahn and Dan Loeb thrown around. A bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point. It ended up being just rumors in the end, and after a few pops it chopped around the mid to upper teens, where it's been for most of 2016 and 2017. The fundamentals aren't pretty, but the price is telling a compelling story here. One that’s indicative of advertisers not being able to figure out the value-add. The worry is that Snapchat will face a similar destiny.But let's rewind the tape a bit. When Facebook IPO'd in May of 2012, it was a mess for the first few months. It’s a near mirror image to Snapchat’s first few months. Facebook reversed rather quickly just as Barron’s came out with the doom and gloom report.The problem with Snapchat is that the lower it goes, the more bearish the sentiment. The higher, the bullish love keeps on pouring in - hence Facebook’s steady new all-time highs. Facebook is hitting new all-time highs with other FAANG stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL). A lot of this is fear of missing out.As fund managers trip over each other just to not be the only guy without FAANG stocks in their portfolio, we need to continue to look at the big picture. We are in the eighth year of one of the biggest bull markets in history. Sure, Facebook’s fundamentals are sound, but by no means are you getting a good deal at these levels. Warren Buffett famously stated, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.""Is Snapchat is the next Facebook?Facebook was dubbed a horrible investment after coming public. But you’re betting that Evan Spiegel can become the next Mark Zuckerberg. You also have the fact that Snapchat does not have a strong No. 2 - Sheryl Sandberg - that can be the CEO at any number of tech companies. I get the feeling that Snap’s product and relationship with advertisers will end up much like Twitter - becoming a niche product that doesn’t come close to touching Facebook.Instead, Snapchat needs to focus on its first mover advantage and move toward content. This could move the conversation away from the constant comparing of Snapchat to Facebook. Steps in the seemingly right direction include Snapchat’s $100 million deal where Time Warner will produce shows for, and place advertisements on, Snapchat to capture its millennial viewers. Snapchat will split advertising revenue with content providers. This is savvy, as Snapchat also is reaching out to small businesses and providing advertising discounts and bonuses to gain advertising traction.Snapchat is a falling knife, and I don't need to paint a picture of what happens when you try to go catch those. However, the negative sentiment surrounding Snapchat continues to soar and the bar will be set extremely low when it comes to earnings or any other expectation. I'd like to see some sort of base formed before owning Snapchat with a defined risk in case it doesn't go your way and hits new lows. There is no telling where the market will take this before it turns around.Facebook continues to innovate and grow at a surreal pace, taking market share from Snapchat. At these levels, the risk is not worth the reward to jump in head first. Sellers continue to dominate Snapchat. I won't start pointing fingers at short sellers, although the amount of shorts have increased pretty dramatically. Bottom line is that Snapchat can't be trusted while plowing through new lows every day."
4088271,102101,2017-07-17T20:44:53-04:00,"The bearish scream is playing a big yet unnecessary part in this growth play.Snap has a big shot at preserving and growing its market share.Acquisitions need to be delayed to focus on a data-driven ad engine.Aside from the huge bearish sentiment, nothing stops Snap from bouncing back from its post-IPO high.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is running out of ideas, as the company battles for survival in a fresh round of short selling that has plagued the digital marketing play since its IPO.Source: Financial TimesIf mal-valuation is a valid word, tagging it to shares of Snap seems perfect given the level of irrationality we are currently witnessing. I’ve never seen so much unjustified short selling on a company that has barely found its footing in its market niche. True, competition doesn’t care, but this isn’t about competition. This is about a blatant dismissal and misunderstanding of a growth play which is still in its infancy.Though, management might have erred on the side of over-promising and under-delivering, regardless, all I see is pure innovation on one side and cynicism on the other.Those Ads are More Than AdsThe narrative that Instagram will crush Snap is so over flogged and abused that we need to give it a rest. When Snap said it was a camera company, the first thing that came to the mind of naysayers was GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). Blatantly, Snap is not a GoPro and it will never be.Snap is an innovative cross between the future of advertising and social media. However whenever shorts open their eyes, all they see is single-digit share price in a future that is onboarding more internet user, video creators, and consumers than ever before. These fear-inducing tactics that Snap is yet another Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or GoPro has been echoed so loud that I fear it might be paralyzing the creative frequency across innovative desks at Snap. How so?Just look at its most recent acquisition. A location-based service (Snap Map) when the plague on the street is screaming a dearth of competitive ROAS on major ad platforms. Twitter got its diagnosis some years back when it became clear that MAU and ad load woes were little compared to the need for advertisers to break even on ad spend. This diagnosis kick-started the death of premium ad inventories on a large scale for ad networks with limited MAU compared to giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, making huge investments in intelligence-driven ad serving and measurement APIs was a no-brainer for Snap post-IPO, given the level of impatience on the Street.Months later, however, it appears bluffing no longer works. The Street is not ready to listen to narratives that don’t point to higher ROIC and shares on Snap have suffered in kind.What Happens to the Short Thesis?SNAP data by YChartsThere you have it. Snap handed those shorts the confidence they needed. In the absence of a competitive ad engine, advertisers are not going to buy the narrative for premium-priced ads and will most likely pull out after a few months of advertising on the platform. The best effort post-IPO has been the launch of a self-serving platform. That is a drop in the ocean when compared to the intelligence and data driven capabilities of bigger platforms like Google and Facebook. Interestingly, Snap can’t even blame it on lack of content given that Snapchat has one of the fastest growing engagement rate and average session duration per user. Whatever Snap is doing with all that content, one thing remains clear, the platform is still under monetized.Right now, all that is needed is the confidence to make the big leap by investing in a more competitive ad platform. Further acquisitions or product feature release will only be conceived by the Street as an effort to distract investors from the big issue; a competitive ad engine.Going ForwardEvery passing day knocks more strength into the spine of short sellers as time plays a critical factor in the willingness of advertisers to stick with Snap’s ad platform.In seasons of economic prosperity with bloated marketing budgets, expanding valuation multiples will suffer a minimal hit. However, from a macro level down to internal survival strategies being adopted by 21st century brands, using data and analytics to drive valuation remains key in the mind of global leaders. We are in the era of big data, an era in which survival depends strongly on the ability to channel user-generated feedbacks to create better innovation or lose market share to competitors that are antifragile to change. Snap seems to be a slow innovator in this trend.The Sauce and the SecretIn one of the numerous success stories, it appears Wall Street actually believes the story as highlighted by Goldman Sachs' appearance in the list of successful brands that have leveraged the viral nature of Snap's ad assets. A lot more brands have also recorded massive success stories. The only roadblock going forward will be discipline executing in the face of competition. Snap’s little history doesn’t provide much signal to be strongly bullish. Going forward, Snap needs to move fast from the basic measurement and analytics ad engine depicted in the image above or naysayers will continue to have a solid reason to back their short thesis, which is Snap’s confidence taking a knife to a sword fight."
4089545,103465,2017-07-21T18:17:38-04:00,"Many analysis of Snap concern growth, valuation, profitability, or Instagram competence.Investors were surprised after seeing the huge share-based compensation of the first quarter.In this article, I will analyze the recently issued stock-based compensation.I will prove that the share-based compensation makes it impossible for shareholders to earn a single dollar even if Snap succeeds as an enterprise.","Many people were surprised as Snap (NYSE:SNAP) showed a $1.9b share-based remuneration after the release of the first quarter results. But those who read the filling S-1 some months ago and tracked the insider trades were not surprised of this massive remuneration. In this article:The majority of the short analysis published about Snap can be quickly summarized as:I will not discuss any of these points in this article, but you must have done your study on these points too to be able to value the stock.My thesis is that the share-based remuneration is completely unbalanced, unfair with the shareholders, and it will pay such huge amounts of money to the directors that will make Snap a bad investment even if the business succeeds and generates positive earnings.Snap Inc. has three types of shares, all of them with the same nominal value. First, class A shares entitled with no votes; secondly, class B shares entitled with 1 vote each share; and thirdly, class C shares entitled with 10 votes each share. The class A shares were offered to the main public while class B shares and class C shares were not accessible to the broad public.In May 2017, when Snap filled its 10-Q, there were 682 million class A shares outstanding, 281 million class B shares outstanding, and 215 million class C shares outstanding:This kind of structure is very often used by tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). The main advantage of this capital structure is that it allows directors to run the business more effectively while investors with no votes participate in the earnings but not in the decisions. The main disadvantage is that this is a concentration of executive power that badly used can sink a business: Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is a good example of it.Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy own all of the 215 million class C shares that represent 88.5% of the voting power of the Snap. This literally means that they have the absolute executive control of the company.Share-based compensation is a way broadly used by companies to pay their employees a part of their remuneration in shares. Corporate theory says that it aligns with interest of shareholders, directors, and employees. The reality is that share-based compensations are often used by directors to pay themselves an additional salary. This has become a very broadly used strategy by directors because it is difficult to analyze.On February 2, 2017, Snap's shareholders with the right to vote approved the 2017 equity incentive plan. This plan follows and incorporates the prior 2014 and 2012 equity incentives plans. Snap understands this plan provides incentives for employees and board members as they benefit from the increases on the value of the common stock. Under this plan employees, directors, and consultants are eligible to receive awards or stock options. The plan will be administrated by the directors.The share-based plan of Snap can be found in two documents: the S-1 or ""Registration statement"" and the following S-8 where Snap makes public the terms of its stock-based compensation.The first step is to reach a fair number of diluted outstanding shares. As noted before, there were 1,178 million shares fully paid as of March 31, 2017. Having a look at the notes of the 10-Q, we can see that Snap remunerates the board and employees mainly with RSUs but also with stock options. Grosso modo, the difference between an RSU and a stock option in Snap's case is that RSUs are granted for free, and stock options have an exercise price.To get the real diluted shares outstanding, you should add 174 million RSUs outstanding and 21 million stock options outstanding. After Q1, there are 1,373 million diluted shares outstanding.As of 31 March 2017, there were 174 million RSUs outstanding and 21 millions of stock options outstanding. The diluted outstanding shares are 1,373 million:You can find this information in the notes of the 10-Q:RSUs outstanding:Stock options outstanding:The source of the share-based compensation will be issuance of new shares or required common stock. (At the moment, Snap has not announced any buyback, so you must suppose that the shares will be all issued).The amount of the shares to be issued as Stock awards (or ""share reserve"" as called in the Snap's statements) for the year 2017 is to a maximum of 337 million shares. Besides, the share reserve will increase in an amount equal to 5% of the total capital stock outstanding every year until January 2027.Shareholders must expect that a considerable amount of new shares will be issued in the next 10 years, and within this massive issuance, shareholders should expect a massive dilution in this company and incorporate it to their valuations:I estimate a minimum increase in shares of 67% for the next five years:(All data in millions of shares)Please, note that these calculations are very conservative, and they only include the addition of the share reserve plus a 5% per year of the total capital. If you read all the notes on Snap S-8 document carefully, there are certain rules, like, for example, adding back ""returning shares"" to the share reserve that will dilute the company more. The future dilution will be probably higher than my numbers. This is just a very conservative sample.Limitations are on the Section 162(m). On the S-8 issued in May, Snap established the following limitations:These are the limitations to the issuance of shares. In the S-8 form, there is a large note that explains these limitations. I can summarize it saying that:All the prior is applicable per person, per year.The maximum number of authorized shares is 4.400 million. You can find this information on the balance sheet.We have seen the amount and the limits of the share-based compensation. The performance shares are awarded for free because the condition is to satisfy a performance goal. The cash awards are also given for an achieved goal, and they are paid in cash. But stock options have exercise prices.A 100% discount of the stock options when they are granted means that if the stock is trading at $20 on the day a stock option is granted, then the strike price probably will be around $10. And then, this price must be paid by the stock holder. This price is an income in the statements of cash flow, but it does not generate value for shareholders because it dilutes the company's current shareholders.Adjusting the share-based compensations of companies is not an easy task, and it requires a lot of work and data analysis, but you must adjust this in your valuation if you want to do it properly.If this theme is on your interest, I recommend you an article of Erik Kobayashi-Solomon where he explains quickly and very well how directors use stock-based compensation to pay themselves extra salaries. To know how much discount should be applied to the amount of stock options, you should calmly read the last paragraph of the share-based plan:This means that whatever the case may be, they will guarantee themselves their remuneration, lowering strike prices at will, or even paying cash if their stock options are worthless or not enough.At least 750 million shares will be issued between 2017 and 2022, and I calculate another 500 million until 2027. The next 10 years, the stock-based compensation will be at least 1,250 million shares. As we have seen before, the two manners of the stock-based compensation will be:Performance stock awards are granted for free if certain goals are reached. Stock options are issued with a strike price with an estimated discount of 100%.Shareholders should apply a discount to the value of the stock options. I've chosen 100%. I think it is the appropriate discount. Here is how much the stock-based compensation of the next 10 years is worth at different prices, and the reason why shareholders will not earn a single dollar on Snap even if the business succeeds:The reason why shareholders will not earn a single dollar on Snap even if the business succeedsOn the one hand, in 2022, there will be at least 1,950 million shares. If bulls are right and Snap succeeds, we can conservatively estimate that the stock can be trading at $50. The company should be earning $2,400 million of free cash flow putting a price to free cash flow multiple of 40 times:Remember that on 2017, Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are trading around 30 times free cash flow. 40 times free cash flow is very aggressive.On the other hand, the favorite metric of many Snap longs is price to sales. There is no consistency thinking that people will value Snap eternally with a price to sales ratio. In the long term, people only pay for earnings. However, following the price to sales argument, in 2022, if Snap is earning $2,400 million of free cash flow and has the same margin that Facebook achieves, sales must be around $6,000 million. This is a 57% compounded annual growth of sales. I do not believe this history. Not even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after launching the iPhone could achieve such a sales growth.As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to discuss the business model, Instagram competence, or the operating losses. I do think these themes are very important, and I have also analyzed them on my own. But there are a lot of good articles already on that. I wanted to contribute with my analysis of the share-based compensation because it is crucial, and nobody is talking of this.I wanted to summarize clearly and directly the share-based compensation, but for a more serious understanding, I think you should read the SEC fillings I linked before, specifically the 68 pages of the S-8.Before ending, I would like to show a picture and pose an open question to anyone who wants to give his or her opinion:As an example, Robert Murphy earned a salary of $250,000 on 2016 for his work. On March 7, 2017, he sold 17 million of shares worth more than $350 million. That is more than 100 times his salary!Given these inputs and outputs: Do you think this is a conflict of interest between shareholders and directors? How can a board member get 100 times more money from a share-based compensation than from their salary?I am sorry for Snap shareholders. The massive share-based compensation of the first quarter was not a one-time event.After one or two years when shareholders ask themselves, where is my money, they should see Snap's directors' happiness."
4087676,101924,2017-07-14T04:10:18-04:00,"Snap Inc. has seen its stock fall below its pre-IPO value, thanks to poor financial results and a loss of confidence.Snap has failed to fix major problems such as competition from Facebook and Instagram as well as slowing user rate growth.The end of the lock-up period on July 29 could have a further negative impact on the price.Snap is in a great deal of trouble, and investors should absolutely stay away.","The Snap (SNAP) IPO has been the largest 2017 IPO by far, but it was surrounded by plenty of skepticism and controversy. But perhaps even the skeptics did not expect Snap’s value to fall below its initial IPO price of $17 this quickly, just four months after it debuted.Nevertheless, Snap's shares fell to $16.99 on Monday, and as of Wednesday morning are at just $15.47. MarketWatch reports that after reaching an initial high of $29, the stock has fallen 19 percent over the past three months compared to an S&P 500 gain of 3 percent.A successful Snap would be good for technology and social media, and it would be nice to say that Snap can rebound. But it is more likely that Snap could fall even farther than turn things around. Many of the problems which investors initially had with Snap loom bigger than ever and are joined by additional concerns which hold this company down.The more things change…The fundamental technical analysis of Snap before its IPO led to concerns about its lack of profitability and revenue growth. While Snap could point to high revenue growth, skeptics pointed out that the growth rate was slowing down, likely due to competition from Facebook (FB) and Instagram.If the growth rate slowed down enough, Snap could find itself in the same place that Twitter (TWTR) is today, with negative profitability and limited growth prospects. Snap dismissed these concerns as a blip caused by certain technological factors and asserted that it was not overly concerned about its competitors.Well, Snap definitely is concerned now. Facebook’s Instagram Stories surpassed Snapchat a while ago in terms of total users as Instagram Stories announced it had 250 million users in June compared to 166 million for Snapchat. Furthermore, it has been aping more of Snapchat’s features such as augmented reality lenses. Instagram has the benefit of a larger user base with more features which makes it easier for people to connect with one another on its website.The presence of this larger competitor is particularly ugly for Snap’s efforts to attract advertising dollars. Investors who were optimistic about Snap pointed to its immense potential to be an attractive advertising website, thanks to its largely millennial user base. But that potential is limited because if Snap piles on the advertisements too heavily, those millennial users will just flee to Instagram. Furthermore, Instagram is just as attractive an advertising ground because of its larger user base and because marketers have an easier time tracking advertisement effectiveness on Instagram.Snap is heavily unprofitable, its user base growth rate is declining, and a larger competitor is draining both users and advertising dollars away. Any one of these problems would be concerning. All three combined is potentially disastrous.A Lack of ConfidenceThe old problems listed above have created new ones as well. On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley (MS) slashed Snap’s price target from $28 to $16, and essentially downgraded its rating from “buy” to “hold.” This is particularly embarrassing because Morgan Stanley was one of Snap’s lead underwriters for its IPO. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak cited many of the concerns listed above, noting that it had overestimated “Snap's ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year.”This loss of confidence is a major cause behind Snap’s current share price collapse, but there is another reason this downgrade is so dangerous. Snap’s lock-up periods, which prevent insiders from selling off their stock right after an IPO, will begin expiring on July 29. The addition of hundreds of millions of shares at the least will further depress the price in the near term, especially if major underwriters like Morgan Stanley decide that now is the time to pull out.Stay AwayThere is absolutely no reason to consider Snap right now. Even if you are bold or crazy enough to think that Snap can turn things around with innovation and new policies, you should at least wait until the lock-up period expires and take advantage of millions of new shares entering the market and depressing the price even further.Snap had questions it needed to answer when it went public such as how it would compete with Facebook and become profitable. Even now, it has still not given an adequate answer beyond bleating “innovation.” Snap may have cratered a great deal in the past few months, but it may have not hit rock bottom and so investors should stay away."
4087739,101863,2017-07-14T10:34:13-04:00,"Snapchat's stock is plunging, its revenue growth is slowing, and even its gross margin is negative!The article presents Snapchat's two-fold problem and discusses if it can turn things around.I'll be upfront: I'm not too positive on SNAP, but one puzzling thing keeps me hanging on the edge.","Snapchat (SNAP) has been a source of pain for many retail investors ever since its IPO nearly five months ago. As the following graph shows, the stock has trailed both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq by a wide margin, and the decline has been relentless.SNAP data by YChartsWhat's driving the precipitous decline?The issue is two-fold:1. The company is not profitableIn its first quarterly earnings release, the company announced a net loss of $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion of which was related to stock-based compensation expense.More interestingly, however, the company's gross margin was also negative during the quarter (i.e. cost of revenue was higher than revenue, which is rare), and this was also true for the last-twelve-month period ended March 31. It's unclear to me, at this time, how Snapchat can grow profitably if even its gross margin is negative. Facebook's gross margin, for instance was more than 70% at the time of its IPO:FB Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsSo is Snapchat growing at a nosebleed rate? No. Snapchat's profitless revenue declined from $166 million in 4Q16 to $150 million in 1Q17. The company's average revenue per user was $0.90 in 1Q17, an increase of 181% YoY, but a decrease of 14% QoQ. Daily active users grew 5% QoQ and 36% YoY to 166 million in 1Q17. The growth in daily active users is encouraging, but it is nowhere near the level it needs to be to justify a $15 billion enterprise value.2. The company does not have a clear path to profitabilityIn addition to substantially increasing its growth rate, the company will need to also substantially expand it average revenue per user, and do so at a relatively low incremental cost of revenue, to achieve positive gross margin. Accomplishing these two goals simultaneously will be challenging because any action taken to increase revenue per user (introducing a subscription service, showing more ads to users, charging advertisers more etc.) would likely slow down the growth rate even further!What makes this seemingly insurmountable challenge even more difficult is that Snapchat is facing substantial competition from Instagram (FB).[Side note: can you believe Mark Zuckerburg bought Instagram for only $1 billion?!]Instagram Stories now has 250 million daily active users, up from 200 million in April, 150 million in January and 100 million in October after launching the Snapchat Stories clone in August. That compares to Snapchat’s total 166 million daily active users and Instagram’s total 700 million monthly users.Network effectNetwork effect is an important investment phenomenon whereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it. It makes very little sense to leave Facebook, for example, and join another up-and-coming social network, because all of your friends are at Facebook and not many people are at the other service. Other classic examples are the telephone (back in the day), Twitter (TWTR), Apple Store and iMessage (AAPL), Google's search engine and YouTube (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and so on.Can businesses with large network effects never be disrupted? Of course they can be, as Napster and Hotmail investors will tell ya, but it's just exponentially more difficult as the network effect serves as a valuable moat.Snapchat is trying to build its own ""network effect"" but Instagram already has a very large one, so it will be very difficult if at all possible, for Snapchat to establish itself as a profitable growth company while facing intense competition from Instagram.One puzzling thingSnapchat's growth has slowed down, not only it is not profitable but even its gross margin is negative, and it's facing tremendous competition from an established mega-cap company with probably the largest network effect today.So nobody would want to own SNAP, right? Wrong.The following table from Nasdaq shows that Snapchat's ownership includes some of the best long-term investors such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Coatue Management. One wonders...Readers should note, however, that the number of shares owned by these heavy hitters comprise only ~20% of the company's shares outstanding.Bottom LineI'll let the Snapchat story play out for now. Count me out.Premium ResearchSnapchat is not looking good, but it's looking awfully similar to how Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) looked when it IPO'd: no profits, limited gross margin, seemingly insurmountable challenges, and lots of promises. Tesla has become my primary investment. If you'd like to learn more about my investment strategy and have your questions answered promptly, please consider signing up for Tesla Forum.

4087431,74295,2017-07-13T05:48:15-04:00,"Snap is down below its IPO price on souring investor sentiment.The company has slowing growth and negligible revenues.Despite current challenges, Snap has a sizable base of daily active users and a young audience that it can monetize.I rate Snap a Hold on the drop.","This article is the 67th installment in a segment called ""Buy on the Drop?"" in which I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should ""buy on the drop"" or not. The recommendations are Sell, Hold, Speculative Buy, Buy, and Strong Buy.Formerly buoyed by analysts and firms with an interest in the stock, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is now down below its $17 IPO price and has investors wondering where the bottom is and whether this is a buying opportunity or the beginning of a deeper, longer slide. While Snap is currently seeing slowing user growth and has tiny revenues relative to its valuation, the company does have a substantial audience of daily active users that it can monetize in the future, offering potential upside down the line. I see too many pressures in the short term, and therefore see SNAP as a Sell on the drop for short-term investors. In contrast, I see some long-term potential if the company can monetize its DAUs, so I rate SNAP a Hold on the drop for long-term investors.SNAP data by YChartsSnap has very little intrinsic value at the moment due to its lack of financial results, but the potential for growth down the line is evidenced by the company's vast base of daily active users, up to 166 million in Q1. I'll divide this article up into two sections: the short-term picture and the long-term picture. Let's start with the former.Short termThe short-term picture for Snap is, in my opinion, exceedingly ugly. This is mainly a result of a very small revenue base, crushing stock-based compensation expenses, dilution following the expiration of the lockup period, and slowing user growth relative to past quarters and expectations. These factors are weighing on SNAP, which is down 50% from post-IPO highs, and will continue to weigh on the company and stock in the next few quarters.First, revenue for Q1 was a measly $150 million relative to Snap's $18 billion valuation, indicating the company still has a massive amount of work to do before it grows into its valuation. On the flip side, it also indicates Snap has plenty of room to fall further should growth disappoint, which is exactly what happened in the first quarter (which I'll discuss in a bit). The consensus analyst estimate for FY2017 revenue is $982 million, and for simplicity I'll just assume Snap earns $1 billion in revenue for the fiscal year. This would give a price-to-sales ratio of 18, which compares unfavorably to Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) P/S of 12 for this period, especially considering Facebook actually earns profits, which to an extent justifies the inflated ratio. Revenue will be a vital metric going forward because it will be the bellwether of progress in user growth and monetizing those users, and I think Snap has to demonstrate much better results on the top line to justify its current valuation.Second, stock-based compensation (""SBC"") expense, while necessary for growing tech companies, is absolutely crushing Snap at the moment. For Q1 alone, SBC totaled close to $2 billion, which was more than 13 times revenue for the quarter. This should give an idea of how substantial this expense is and how hard it will be for Snap to overcome this obstacle. Yes, SBC is vital in order to attract top talent and retain current employees, but it will continue to be a near-term pressure on the company every quarter for those that look at GAAP results. Additionally, considering that Snap's workforce is paid in stock and that stock is cratering, this could hurt morale, cause panic-selling, and reduce the incentive of employees to stay at the company. Lastly, this level of SBC is much higher than that at peers like Facebook, whose SBC expense in its most recent quarter was just $867 million despite expanding rapidly since its IPO:FB Stock Based Compensation (Quarterly) data by YChartsThis doesn't bode well for Snap's SBC in the future, and I am skeptical that the company will be able to stabilize the expense to the benefit of shareholders.Third, the upcoming expiration of the lockup period will increase dilution and likely lower share price in the short term. 711 million shares could be added to the share supply, which currently sits at just 188 million. This will likely put downward pressure on shares, as insiders might panic-sell due to the crashing stock price.Fourth, the growth of daily active users appears to be declining, which is very bad news for a stock like SNAP, whose valuation heavily relies on its expected growth. DAUs grew 36% YoY and 5% QoQ to 166 million, which is relatively strong growth but below expectations of 168 million. Additionally, average revenue per user (""ARPU"") grew 181% YoY to $0.90 but fell 14% QoQ, which I think is the more salient point here. Yes, Q4 is the holiday quarter where advertisers ramp up spending and ad buys, but Snap should be growing at a robust enough pace where cyclicality isn't a factor that hurts sequential revenue growth. Sequential revenue growth due to increase in number of users should be strong enough to at least offset the quarter-to-quarter decline due to holiday-derived revenue, but ARPU instead fell 14%. Snap will have to improve results on this front in order to justify a higher valuation.Ultimately, in the short term, I think the company is facing too many obstacles and pressures and isn't likely to see share price appreciation over the time frame. For those investors with a short-term investing horizon, I see SNAP as a Sell on the drop.Long termThe long-term picture for SNAP is more promising, in my opinion, due to the potential for monetization of DAUs and the potential for further DAU growth even if that growth slows. I'll come up with a hypothetical scenario to illustrate Snap's potential.With 166 million DAUs, if we assume DAUs grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% over the next 5 years, which I think is conservative considering the 36% growth of DAUs YoY in Q1, this comes out to 267 million DAUs. If we assume Snap reaches average annual ARPU of $2, which is conservative considering a peer like Facebook had an ARPU of $6.25 in its most recent quarter, the company would report Q1 2022 revenue of $534 million for an annual run rate of around $2.14 billion. Recall, this is a conservative estimate on both growth rate and ARPU, but still demonstrates how much Snap could eventually grow into a higher valuation.But here's the crux of a SNAP investment - it's pure speculation on the growth of the company going forward. The bear argument is very easy to make: just look at the company's financial statements and valuation metrics. The bull argument is much more expectations-based and relies on some rosy scenario that may or may not come to pass. At the very least, though, the long-term picture for SNAP looks much better than the short-term picture.For investors that like Snap's DAU base and think monetization will be effective going forward, the long-term potential for upside looks good. Because of this potential, I can see the argument for why holding onto shares for the long haul might make sense. At the same time, due to the bearish short-term outlook, I think there will be a better buy-in point for long-term investors, so buying now doesn't seem like the right play. For now, I rate SNAP a Hold on the drop for investors already with skin in the game.If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can do so by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page or by going to my author page.

4087288,39301,2017-07-12T13:33:49-04:00,"Snap Inc. tumbles on Tuesday’s session sending negative sentiment through the roof.However, the scope of gains from selling short are limited if we add broker margins.Day traders can find a narrow window to earn quick profits, though it becomes more difficult the longer the trade drags on.Hence, we’re taking a contrarian stance, and view the impending sell-off as an opportunity to buy at a steep discount.We still believe in the long-term merits of Snap Inc. and expect risk/reward to favor bulls once the stock price troughs.","With recent moves in Snap’s (SNAP) stock price, we’ve re-examined the charts, and it’s still unclear whether the short thesis carries enough merit (due mostly) because of margin expense. The stock is likely trending lower, but actual investment returns diminish if the stock gets choppy. Therefore, this trade is reliant on timing, and closing the trade prior to September seems like the best way to manage a short position.That being the case, we think there’s an opportunity to buy shares at a pretty steep discount here, assuming Snap Inc. can turn the tides on q/q DAU trends and is able to attract a more diverse installed base both demographically and geographically.The silver lining in all of this? The risk/reward tends to favor long-term investors once pricing falls below $15.The brokers make the most from the Snap tradeThe stock is trending lower, but mostly because big block holders may decide to unload SNAP shares following lock-up expiration. While we find efforts on improving the product experience to be noteworthy, and expectations of revenue growth more realistic following prior quarter earnings, we also acknowledge that the stock enters choppier territory following its recent move below $17.Source: TC2000The stock fell on the Tuesday session, with a solid red candle to indicate we’re not trading above $17 for a while longer. As I had mentioned in my prior interview on Cheddar TV, the stock likely hits $15 soon, and we’re awfully close.Clearly, we thought about the long-term consequences of owning Snap Inc. shares, but with the stock performing so poorly, we’re not looking to adjust our stance until we find a price level where the stock can rally from. Staying on the sidelines seems most practical currently. The most skilled day trader would need to time the trade to perfection to make actual returns.Investors are paying a massive premium to sell short Snap Inc. currently, with the New York Times recently reporting that the annualized margin expense for shorting Snap Inc. is currently approximately 70% to 80%. So, it’s not a long-term short position by any means, with brokerage slippage taking a decent chunk out of returns.Source: Cho’s Tech ResearchThe most realistic scenario: Snap’s stock price trends lower, but over a multi-month time frame. Though, investors would anticipate that the stock price will drop abruptly, thus the margin expense is inconsequential. But when computing the margin expense of the trade from the current cost basis, it becomes difficult to earn a profit if the trade duration stretches past September.If the stock price breaks below $10.00 by the beginning of August, the net realized return is approximately 25%. It gets better though, if, for example, we witness a prolonged downtrend in the stock chart with choppiness through earnings season, this trade could potentially earn a net negative realized return (depending on timing), or 4.35% in the second week of October (three-month duration), which is why we’re not eager to jump on this specific side of the trade, either.In fact, for all we know, Snap Inc. may have an expectation surprise that lifts the share price following the earnings report, whereas the share lock-up expiration puts downward pressure on the stock price concurrently. In that potential scenario, we’re seeing a heightened possibility of the share price regressing slowly via scheduled insider sales with the intermediate charts likely choppy rather than a smooth drop.Given the “guaranteed” winning plays we’ve seen this past year, and how quickly a specific position can get overcrowded, we’re not eager to jump on the bearish side of the trade. We still think the long-term merits of the social app, multi-year earnings ramp, efforts to innovate have differentiated the stock in comparison to other IPOs.Though we acknowledge the risk of getting in too early, we’re rapidly approaching the trough on the charts. This is where the long-term investor can secure the best possible cost basis without incurring added brokerage expense, and ride out the longer-term multiyear trend in the stock price.Therefore, if the multiyear long thesis pans out, then every near-term drop should be viewed as an opportunity. However, stock traders can play both sides of the trade; it’s just more difficult to earn profits if duration exceeds 90 days.Final thoughtsWe continue to reiterate our “Top Internet Idea” designation on Snap Inc., as we anticipate share lock-up to diminish the risk from the perspective of long-only investors and would add positive sentiment upon realizing that the scope of insider sales may be more limited than initially anticipated.Therefore, it’s better to trade against the broader thesis, as the contrarian thesis has outsized risk/reward relative to the near-term short trade, which is highly contingent on near-term timing.Though we acknowledge that there’s merit to shorting the stock, we think there are enough scenarios that could derail the bearish thesis over the next 60 days. As such, we continue to maintain our long-term target price of $58, though it may take longer to actualize. Snap’s path upwards looks as exciting as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) back in 2012, where the share price cratered to $7-$8 (split adjusted) before running higher on news, i.e., announced deals with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Carl Icahn involvement, and international expansion. The stock is now worth 15x as much (if not more).Therefore, we think there are legs to the long-term charts, though we acknowledge that the scope of gains is highly contingent on buying at a great cost basis. In this specific case, we’re looking forward to that inevitable “trough” in valuation where everyone should have bought the stock regardless of how idiotic the app may seem, or how bloated the price multiple seems.Cho's Investment Research is SA's premier research package that gives investors and traders an additional edge when investing into companies.

4087069,92586,2017-07-11T19:38:55-04:00,"Snap has retreated 27% since the beginning of June.I fear that the carnage is not over.In this article, I discuss the three key reasons why I stand behind my earlier decision to stay away from Snap.","Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) can't catch a break. After falling behind on usage to Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram and WhatsApp, the company's stock has retreated 27% since the beginning of June over a short period of only about six weeks. And I fear that the carnage is not over.(Credit: Windows Club)In this article, I briefly discuss the three key reasons why I stand behind my earlier decision to step aside and avoid this tricky (to say the least) young stock.1. Fundamentals vs. price: More downside than upsideBack in March, I argued that there was ""just too much risk involved in buying SNAP"". At the time, I concluded that the $1.00 or so in EPS that Snap Inc. had to produce to justify its stock price depended on a series of overly optimistic assumptions materializing.For example, under my best-case scenario, Snap had to produce 5% sequential user base growth, even though it already reached only 3% last quarter in a descending trend. Quarterly ARPU would need to improve nearly three-fold to $3.00, and the op margin for a company that currently produces negative gross profits would need to reach 30%.What seemed like a tall order earlier in the year now seems more unattainable than ever, in my view. Snap's competitive advantage (including its focus on one-on-one user interaction centered around the ""sharing of stories"") might have vanished more quickly than many expected. Instagram's Stories function has already reached 200 million daily users versus Snapchat's 158 million, while 175 million people use WhatsApp's Status on a daily basis. Facebook has even introduced a Snapchat-like function on its main platform, giving Snap's product a run for its money only a few months after the IPO.It is true that, compared to the $23 that shares used to trade at in March, the current stock price of $15.47 apiece is certainly more de-risked. Yet, I continue to find the uncertainties around future results too significant to consider a current-year EV/sales multiple of 15.2x attractive.2. Lock-up expiration approachingOver the next few weeks, a number of SNAP shares will reach the end of their lock-up periods. According to JPMorgan, 1.2 billion additional shares out of a total of 1.4 billion fully diluted will be available for sale between the end of July and August of this year.(Source: CNBC)Over the past three months, SNAP's most active trading day - also the one in which the stock price fell the sharpest - saw only 131 million shares change hands. I fear the impact of hundreds of millions of additional shares becoming available for sale in the market may be sizable as skeptical investors look to lock in potential gains before SNAP (possibly) depreciates further over the next several weeks.3. Expecting further downgradesSNAP is not necessarily a Street favorite among sell-side researchers, but it is still a fairly well-rated stock. According to Nasdaq, of the 26 analysts currently covering SNAP, only three have a Sell rating on the name, for a consensus price target of $22.50 (for 44% potential upside, see graph below).(Source: Nasdaq)The problem I see is that, as the IPO momentum cools down, shares can suffer from future downgrades. After underwriting firm Morgan Stanley changed its rating on SNAP from overweight to equal-weight this Tuesday, shares plunged more than 8% by the end of the trading session.Per my records, and using Tip Ranks as my source, a number of analysts have reiterated a price target of at least $20 on the stock in the past couple of months. That includes Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs, another of SNAP's underwriters, who has not published on the name since early May. It would not catch me by surprise if some of these analysts start to adjust their targets and recommendations following the recent weakness in share price - and certainly following Snap's next earnings release, in early August, should the company fail to deliver satisfactory results.ConclusionAs (1) competition catches up fast with Snap Inc., (2) a large number of previously locked-up shares flood the market, and (3) potential sell-side downgrades loom in the horizon, I grow colder by the day on SNAP. Even after the stock de-risked quite a bit over the past six weeks, I continue to find the uncertainties around the company's future performance significant enough to steer me away from the name.As with any other young tech stock, SNAP could bounce around and even find its way back up in the next weeks. But I find the odds stacked against it, given the negative short-term catalysts and the unappealing long-term prospects.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

4087641,99506,2017-07-13T22:59:02-04:00,"High single digits may not be the bottom of the stock chart for Snap. A failed business model is a failed business model at any price.For those who remember the hype and failed business models that were prevalent during the dot.com boom/bust cycle, Pets.com's infamous sock puppet became iconic.Our current bull market has presented us with our own version of an over-hyped and failing business model in Snap. Ghostface Chillah, meet Pets.com's sock puppet.","Coulda, Woulda, ShouldaSnap Inc.'s (SNAP) business model could have succeeded. Really. If only Snap would have been about seven years earlier with their incorporation and launch of the innovative, disappearing Snapchat message. This should have made Snap a social media powerhouse two years before the Facebook (FB) IPO occurred. And being first to market could have given Snap a global, greenfield opportunity. Being first to market oftentimes is so important in business. If Snap would have been first to market ahead of Facebook, then Snap should have secured their market share. Snap could have become a tech titan before Facebook did the same. In all candor, Snap's business model would have succeeded if they had just been about seven years earlier. Snap should have been about 7 years earlier with their business plan. If Snap had done this, then they coulda, woulda, shoulda become the champ. Just like Marlon Brando's character in On The Waterfront, Snap ""coulda been a contendah."" Sad that things were not different for Snap and Brando's character.Snap's stock is not looking like a champ these days. In fact, if Snap were a boxer then they might consider selling advertising space on the bottom of their shoes. These ads would become visible whenever Snap's stock gets knocked down. The chart below illustrates how frequent knockdowns have become for this stock:SNAP data by YChartsCharacter, Integrity, and Sound Judgement Matter For A CEOIn the beginning of the conceptual phase for Snap there was Reggie Brown, who coincidentally attended the same McCallie High School in Chattanooga as my son attended. Although Reggie was a few years ahead of my son and had graduated prior to my son arriving on the campus of this boarding school, I know the strong quality of the young men that McCallie produces. I believe that I have a general sense of who Reggie Brown was when he left McCallie to attend Stanford University. I believe that Reggie was a good person who was trusting and believed in the goodness, honor, and integrity of his fellow man. Unfortunately for Reggie, Evan Spiegel was one of his Stanford dormitory's residents. Spiegel's parents were both attorneys. 'Nuff said.Pictured in the photo above from left to right: Reggie Brown, Bobby Murphy, and Evan Spiegel. Notice Reggie's iconic creation that he named Ghostface Chillah on the cake. Spiegel would later say that Brown made no meaningful contributions to the company's startup. It was Reggie who conceived the idea of the disappearing chat message that became the foundation of the platform that the startup company was based upon.During conversation with some of his dorm mates on a given day, Reggie Brown conceived the idea of the disappearing chat message. Reggie then shared his idea with Evan Spiegel and they brought in Bobby Murphy to code the idea for this app. Reggie also later sketched and named Snap's iconic Ghostface Chillah. This L.A. Times article will communicate the timeline of these events and add context. But this Wikipedia on Snap will give you a greater insight into the character of Spiegel, or lack thereof. Scroll down to the sub-heading entitled, ""Controversy."" Notice how Spiegel attempted to mischaracterize Brown's contribution, trivialize Brown's role at the startup, and deny Brown's right to any ownership in the young venture.Only after it became clear that Spiegel was going to lose in the ensuing court battle that recognized Brown's rightful status as a co-founder of the company did Spiegel acknowledge Brown's claim. Only then did Spiegel compensate Brown for his contribution with nearly $158 million in settlement. Good for Reggie. But this situation should not have played out in this manner. Spiegel's questionable ethics, apparent lack of character, and poor judgement created this unfortunate situation. Spiegel's mishandling of this situation likely cost Snap a great deal more money to compensate Brown than could have been negotiated in an amicable agreement. Spiegel's choices to attempt to swindle Brown out of his interest in this startup caused rancor, drama, bad publicity, and it showed Spiegel in a very poor light. This is not the quality of character that people want to see in the CEO of a public company.It has begun to look like a pattern of misconduct that is emerging in Spiegel's mistreatment and mischaracterization of people and situations around him during his tenure at Snap. Anthony Pompliano has his own story to tell and a pending court case against Spiegel's company Snap. Noted short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters has reviewed the Pompliano case and the character of Pompliano. Block states that Pompliano is a ""very stand up guy. Very serious. Very honest.""Spiegel and Snap have attempted to assassinate Pompliano's character in the media just as they attempted to do to Reggie Brown. For those who wish to review and compare the Brown and Pompliano cases, it appears that the same unfortunate tactics that were used by Spiegel on Reggie Brown have also been used on Pompliano. Ethics, character, and sound judgement are important traits for a CEO of any company. Spiegel's conduct in these two instances appears to make him out to being highly questionable on each of these vital traits.And then there are the approximately twenty class action lawsuits pending that allege Spiegel and Snap's management, ""issued false and/or misleading information"" to investors during the IPO process, specifically on key metrics such as user growth or Daily Active Users. These class actions in conjunction with the Pompliano lawsuit could be crucial for Snap management and Spiegel himself as they allege fraud. If fraud was committed during the IPO process by any person or persons at Snap then they could be subject to an SEC inquiry. Fraud is an offense that is considered a criminal felony and can be prosecuted as such. If any individual is convicted of fraud, then they could receive a prison sentence in addition to financial penalties, censure, etc. It should be understood by investors in Snap that the developments in the Pompliano case and the multiple class actions may be monitored by regulators at the SEC.Investors should also understand that any contact to a publicly traded company from the SEC must immediately be reported to the public markets as a SEC inquiry. In past experience, I have seen the news announcement of an SEC inquiry cause a stock to halt trading mid-day and then gap down sharply upon re-opening after the news was determined to have had time to disseminate throughout the market. With today's technology it may not be necessary to halt a stock during trading hours. Perhaps the announcement of an SEC inquiry would create more of a flash crash event in which the stock simply trades down sharply in a matter of seconds as the news disseminates in the market. While no SEC inquiry has been reported by Snap at this time, and no SEC inquiry may ever occur, investors have the right to know that the existing lawsuits against Snap have implications that can significantly impact the price of the stock they own. Snap is a high-risk stock to own for a number of reasons and many of the newer investors in Snap with less experience in the markets have the right to be aware of these risks.Patent Infringement Lawsuit May Impact GeoFiltersFurthermore, just this week on July 11th yet another lawsuit has emerged in which UnitedCorp intends to enforce on patent infringement claims against Snap. The announcement of this lawsuit was overshadowed this week by the headline news of Morgan Stanley's (MS) downgrade of Snap. But if the claims in this lawsuit by UnitedCorp were to prevail, then this event has the potential to gut the Snapchat app of its important GeoFilters. This could negatively impact Snap's ability to deliver all of the features that its user base has come to know. This event could also negatively impact advertisers on the Snap platform and cause a disruption of commerce with some number of advertisers. Accordingly, UnitedCorp's patent infringement allegation against Snap is a significant lawsuit for the daily operation of Snap's most important product, the Snapchat platform. Again, investors have a right to be aware of these significant lawsuits and should be careful of those who would try to dismiss these lawsuits as trivial. These lawsuits may not be trivial and they may significantly impact the price of Snap shares.In truth, the pattern of conduct that has been shown by Spiegel and his company Snap in the short amount of time that this company has been in business raises many questions. The poor choices that have been made in the mishandling of numerous, important responsibilities required from the CEO at a publicly traded company point not only to inexperience but also a questionable character of Snap's young CEO Spiegel. The most glaring error by Spiegel may be the construction of a business model at Snap that continually posts staggering losses with no end to the bleeding of money in sight. As prominent as Spiegel's failing business model error has been, it may be eclipsed if the allegations of Snap management giving, ""false and/or misleading information"" during the IPO process are proven to be accurate.Other improper conduct includes the Q117 conference call debacle by Spiegel that prompted so many to question the young CEO's readiness, the strange acquisition of a failed drone maker, the high prices estimated to have been paid for the acquisitions of Placed and Zenly are all clearly questionable conduct that do not inspire confidence among investors. Perhaps the Q217 financial report will enable us to learn more about the specific prices paid for these acquisitions as Snap's lack of transparency towards shareholders continues. Snap does not provide the marketplace with forward guidance either. This on top of the fact that Snap has denied shareholders any voting rights as well.It is noteworthy that the estimated $300 million paid for Zenly may depend upon the GeoFilters that are now disputed in the UnitedCorp patent infringement lawsuit. If Snap were to lose this case this could render the Snap Map feature from the Zenly acquisition worthless while also severely damaging the company's advertising model. Snap's business model is already failing but if the patent infringement lawsuit against Snap is successful, then the loss of the GeoFilters feature could greatly hasten the company's demise.Investors in Snap should understand that CEO Spiegel may not be the best person to rescue Snap from the death spiral that it seems to be rapidly descending into at this time. But since Spiegel made sure that shareholders have zero voting rights, how would investors ever get rid of such a liability as an inexperienced CEO with poor judgment and questionable character? It may just be that investors will have to grin and bear it as they wait for young CEO Spiegel to mature. But will the market be so patient as shares are now in something close to a free-fall plunging 40% in value from their peak post-IPO just over 4 months ago?In retrospect, there were several very positive glory years for Snap in which they posted very exciting growth metrics. It was the strong growth metrics during recent years that enabled the company and its IPO underwriters to convince investors that Snap was a promising investment for the future. But the table below shows how sharp the rate of growth has decelerated for Snap revenues over the most recent quarterly reports including the estimates for the upcoming Q217 report:(*Estimize estimates)A key factor in the stock's continuing decline is Snap's sharp deceleration of growth as shown in column three in the table above. The pattern of sharp deceleration in the rate of growth becomes very apparent in the disappointing Q117 financial report that caused the stock to crash on May 10th. Upcoming on August 10th the company will deliver the crucial Q217 results. Estimates as shown in the table and chart above are for another quarter of sharply decelerating growth. If this rapidly slowing rate of growth is confirmed in the Q217 report, then the market will likely have no option but to revalue the company much lower. Snap's IPO priced the stock far too aggressively at $17 when perhaps a price of half that valuation would have been more appropriate. The market is currently in the beginning process of this devaluation of the Snap IPO. The market may devalue Snap down sharply to a more appropriate valuation after the Q217 results.Bearish calls for Snap to trade down to a single digit stock price are now emerging as an increasingly possible event. Pivotal Research has been one of the earliest bears calling for a $9 price target on Snap for a few months now. This week Seeking Alpha's respected author Bill Maurer also queried whether Snap could see single digits in this article.The dual lockup expiries in July and August may contribute to the sharp sell-off that is already underway in Snap shares.Who else might have had an idea that growth at Snap was about to sharply decelerate after the IPO? Nobody knows the tech landscape for their own company better than Snap's management. Spiegel and company must have known that their growth was slowing sharply as they had clear vision on multiple factors like the emerging threat from Facebook's Instagram. Spiegel and key employees had to have known that their own growth in key metrics was slowing prior to the IPO and that this deceleration would continue as Facebook continued to increase its competitive efforts.If Pompliano's allegations are true that Snap intentionally falsified user growth metrics to lure investors into the IPO, then this might help to explain in part why user growth disappointed in Q117, the first financial report after the IPO. And this slowing growth may continue into the upcoming Q217 report on August 10th. If Snap stumbles once again for a second consecutive quarter since coming public in March just four months ago, then the market is likely to punish this company's stock price much lower. In fact, the current sky-high valuation on this company's market cap could be cut in half by a market that has grown increasingly negative on failing IPOs like Snap and Blue Apron (APRN). Combine another disappointing quarterly report on August 10th sandwiched between two huge lockup expiries on July 31st and August 31st and quite possibly you would have the makings for an epic fail in the price of Snap shares.Spiegel and company were in the best position to see all of this negativity emerging for the valuation of their company just several months back prior to the IPO. They were smart enough to see how emerging competition would slow their growth in key metrics and crash Snap's valuation. And this may explain why they rushed their IPO to market before it was too late. For Spiegel and company the timing of dumping this IPO on the public investor was shrewd even though the company was not ready to come public at the valuation assigned during the IPO process. But Spiegel may have felt that the window of opportunity to IPO was closing as he saw the emerging competition rising. So maybe Snap's management rushed this IPO to market and did their best to make the growth metrics look attractive to investors when all may not have been as strong as indicated by Snap.But Spiegel was able to successfully bring this company to market and he reaped a multi-billion dollar windfall of wealth for himself. But what did the public investors get in return? Was Spiegel shrewd enough to over-hype the growth metrics during the IPO process to sell this IPO for an egregious valuation that has left naive public investors holding the bag? It is becoming increasingly clear that this may be the case as the stock has broken below its IPO price and nobody has any idea where the bottom is other than to safely say that single digits are not very far away any more.But what do single digits mean? $9 per share, $7 per share, lower? I would offer the following as one possible means to determine this stock's future price: A failed business model is a failed business model at any price. The translation is that investors will have to pick their own bottom price but it is probably safe to say that a single digit stock price is on the way for Snap shares and a future bounce higher should not be expected. Unless somebody is able to fix Snap's broken business model to adjust for the rising competition from several tech titans. And I certainly wouldn't put my confidence in Spiegel to be the one to achieve that Herculean feat. In fact, Snap's business model may be so flawed that it is simply not fixable in the face of rising competition from multiple major tech firms who all want to compete for the much sought-after millennial market that Snap depends upon for their survival.Why is Snap's business model not fixable? Because now here comes the rise of the anticipated competition that was likely foreseen by Snap management that prompted the premature IPO. Rapidly emerging competition from Facebook will continue to increase as one tech titan that wants Snap's millennial market share and is attacking hard on Snap's forward flank. Microsoft's (MSFT) launch of the newest version of Skype with some Snapchat-like features indicates rising competition on a different flank.But the largest emerging threat to Snap's survival may emerge from mighty Apple (AAPL) with the launch of AR Kit this fall. The Apple threat is the most severe threat of all to Snap because an estimated 70% of Snapchat users in North America are also iPhone owners. This will enable Apple to attack Snap from inside of its own user base where Snap is completely defenseless. This attack by Apple could be so devastating that it could turn Snap's growth negative. Whatever Facebook and Microsoft have not already crushed of Snap's business model by fall may be decimated by Apple's plan to take millennial market share from Snap via the AR Kit launch.Did Snap bulls really believe that these powerful tech titans would simply allow Snap to come out of nowhere and take away the most valuable demographic of millennials? No. The major tech companies will work diligently to take as much of the essential millennial demographic for themselves. Competition has only begun to ramp up to attack Snap's business model and this means slow growth for Snap at best, and negative growth at worst. In either case, mid-single digits are likely ahead for Snap's share price.The IPO was only a few months recent. Do you believe that Spiegel and company did not know about the emerging competition from these tech titans that wanted to compete for the same millennial market in which Snap had an early lead? Spiegel cashed out as much as he could during the IPO, married a super model, and went on an extended honeymoon vacation while investors have been getting devastated. Spiegel already has taken billions of dollars from investors for his personal compensation and he is on cloud nine with his new supermodel wife. All is good in Spiegel's life. But not so much for the hard-working, decent people who were naive enough to invest in Spiegel's over-hyped sales gimmick called the Snap IPO.This week we saw a sea-change in Wall Street's perception of Snap. The Morgan Stanley downgrade may have been a presage of a Twitter-like multi-year struggle to make the Snap business model solvent while the stock price may be in continual decline. Rarely do we see a lead underwriter downgrade one of its own issues so soon after the IPO but Morgan Stanley issued a mea culpa by saying, ""We were wrong"" regarding Snap's ability to monetize.In fact, CNBC's Cramer read the Morgan Stanley research report on Snap and called it an ""obituary."" And this comment by Cramer comes from an employee of CNBC whose parent company NBC Universal made a $500-million investment into Snap. Go figure.This shift in the characterization of how Wall Street views the future for Snap is now represented by the title of articles like, ""Dead Stock Walking: Snap, Inc. Has Nowhere To Go But Down.""Conclusion:There are not many good options for Snap as a public entity due to the failing business model. Let's be candid. In capitalism, there are winners and losers. Facebook is the winner here. Apple will win also with their much-heralded AR product, we already know this. Microsoft will find a place in the winner's circle also somehow. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is yet to be heard from but expect that tech titan to compete for millennial market share also at the expense of Snap. This intense level of emerging competition from major tech firms makes the future bottom on the stock chart for Snap somewhere in the low single digits. Perhaps literally a penny stock where it will just languish into obscurity over time as another footnote in the long list of tech companies that went bust.For those hoping a buyout will somehow rescue their unfortunate long position, stop hoping. Cut your losses. Learn from the experience. Move forward.Facebook and Google offered a few billion some years ago, but now Facebook has built Instagram into a better asset than Snapchat. And any other potential acquisitor would have to gut the failed Snap business model and start over from the ground up. Who would want to acquire the huge quarterly losses that have been increasing at Snap? An acquisition of a highly problematic company like Snap is the kind of deal that causes a CEO to be removed by the BOD at his company. Any acquisition of Snap is highly unlikely.The probable future for Snap includes disastrous quarterly financial reports of slow growth that will soon go negative, increasing expenses, and staggering losses as the IPO cash dwindles. Single digits are not that far away after Snap's significant losses this week. Expect more downside in July and August as the dual lockup expiries react accordingly to what may be another disappointing quarter of slow growth reported on August 10th.But high single digits is not the bottom for Snap. Morgan Stanley this week confirmed investors' worse fears by pushing out the future year when Snap will achieve profitability. In effect, MS confirmed the company's own statement that Snap may never achieve profitability. The business model coulda, woulda, shoulda worked except for one large problem: competition wants the same millennial market that Snap depends upon for survival.Snap and Blue Apron appear to be in a race by recent IPOs to the bottom of the stock chart. While it is not good for the free market and competition when tech titans like Amazon and Facebook can crush promising new companies like Snap and Blue Apron, the laws of the Wall Street jungle are tough. And Snap's share price will continue to reflect this reality into the future.A failed business model is a failed business model at any price. Pets.com sock puppet, meet Ghostface Chillah."
4087066,24849,2017-07-11T19:16:57-04:00,Shares hit new low after downgrade.User growth rate facing very tough comp.Will lockup expiration result in secondary?,"On Tuesday, shares of Snap (SNAP) hit a new public trading low, falling nearly 9% to $15.47 after a big downgrade from Morgan Stanley. With the research firm cutting its price target from $28 to $16, Snap shares easily lost hold of their $17 IPO price that they had been struggling to defend. Unfortunately, for investors, the situation could get much worse before it gets better.One of the reasons for the downgrade was weak Daily Active User (""DAU"") data the firm retrieved from a third party source. If you remember back around the time of Snap's IPO, I cited slowing DAU growth as a main reason for avoiding, or even going short, shares of the company. This was the chart I provided from the firm's S-1 filing.When the company reported Q1 results, the key DAU figure came in at 166 million versus Street estimates for 168 million, along with a revenue and earnings miss. Growth of 36% year over year was 12 percentage points below Q4 2016. Unfortunately, if you look at the chart below, the company added 15 million DAUs in Q1 2016 and then another 21 million in Q2.That gives us a very tough comparison period for the company's upcoming earnings report. Recently, analyst Mark Mahaney called for just 7 million adds in Q2, less than the Street's expectation for 10 million. Even if Snap matches the Street average, that's just 176 million, or 23% year-over-year growth. While it's harder to grow with larger base numbers, last year's Q2 period saw 65%, so this is a massive slowdown.There are also numerous concerns about the stock's upcoming lockup expiration, where hundreds of millions of shares will be able to be sold by insiders. In fact, as seen in the table below, JPMorgan research has the float surging from 180 million to almost 1.4 billion. It would not surprise me if we see a secondary offering from the company to allow insiders to sell a large block of shares, as we've seen from other tech companies post-IPO in recent years. That would add further selling pressure to shares.(Source: cnbc.com article discussing lockup expiration)After Tuesday's fall, Snap shares have lost almost 48.5% from their post-IPO high. Unfortunately, one analyst thinks it could get much worse, as he put a $9 price target on the stock after Q1 earnings. If the company's user growth continues to slow at an alarming rate, plus insiders begin to sell once the lockup expires, I could easily see a situation where shares eventually see a single-digit share price. There's a reason why in the company's first four months, short interest rose to more than 39 million shares, more than 20% of the current float. The number of shares short can easily surge once the float jumps in the coming months."
4087341,80135,2017-07-12T16:29:08-04:00,"We initiated with a Sell amid lagging active users.Stiff competition from Instagram, Status and Days also supported the Sell call.The stock can touch $10 going forward.Take a peek at our Snap research that was behind a paywall.","Click here for an easy-to-read version.You can read the initiation report on the link above. The highlights are rehashed below along with an updated valuation.First of all, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) was priced expensively on its IPO compared to the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). This would have been understandable if Snap shined in any of the key areas for an internet information provider that relies on a two-sided market. Snap didn't have the revenue base or the active users to support its multiple.Snap was priced at a 25x forward revenue on its IPO, while Facebook and Alibaba were priced at 19x and 12x respectively, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.On the active users' front, Snapchat lags behinds Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Only LinkedIn (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lower monthly active global users compared to Snapchat. See the attached report for details.Active Users Matter the Most""Active Users"" is the most important metric when it comes to valuation of brands like Instagram or Snapchat. These apps belong to a two-sided market. Success of a two-sided market depends on two sets of stakeholders. In the case of Instagram and Snapchat, these stakeholders are users and advertisers. A high number of users is the driving force to encourage advertisers' spending. That's why active users directly add to the top line of the company.Irrespective of the content a company is offering, a higher number of active users translates to a higher revenue figure. Advertisers, naturally, prefer platforms that offer extensive reach. All in all, ""Active Users"" is a key metric that can be used to value platforms operating in a two-sided market.As Snapchat failed to demonstrate a decent active user growth, revenue growth will halt as advertisers become reluctant to spend on its platform. This will eventually lead to destruction of value.The other problem for Snapchat is that Facebook is now offering comparable services through WhatsApp Status, Facebook Days and Instagram. And all these services have a higher number of active users than Snapchat (see the attached report). Further, advertisers will be more comfortable on Facebook's platform, as they can choose from interconnected services to market their products; ease of use plays a role for advertisers. They can simply sign up on Facebook as a one-stop shop for their advertising needs, while targeting different demographics through different Facebook brands. This indicates stiff competition and makes investment in Snap a difficult proposition.Revised ValuationOur original valuation put a price of ~$17 on the stock. However, as active users continue to disappoint, Snap has more room to fall. A revised valuation based on active users follows below.Instagram's value is used for multiple calculationAs Instagram operates in a two-sided market, an ""Active Users"" based metric can be used to value Snap. Further, Instagram is also a picture-intensive app and, hence, is a suitable proxy for Snap valuation. Note that a multiple based on Instagram is optimistic, given that Instagram is doing much better than Snap in terms of earnings and user growth. Therefore, using Instagram's value for calculating multiple will result in an optimistic price for Snap.U.S. mobile ad revenue is expected to grow at CAGR of 26.5% through 2020, according to BI Intelligence. Instagram is among the top-ranked apps in the U.S. Therefore, its revenue growth will be directly affected by U.S. mobile ad revenue growth going forward.Source: AppAnnieFor Instagram, a prudent proxy of 20% p.a. revenue growth during 2017-2022 is assumed for the market value calculation.Revenue of $2.81 billion is used as a starting point for Instagram's valuation as forecast by eMarketers. Cost of equity is expected to stay constant over the forecast period. According to eMarketer, Instagram will make up 10% of Facebook's revenue by the end of 2017. Therefore, 10% of Facebook's shareholders' equity is used for calculating cost of equity for Instagram. Facebook's most recent net margin is used to calculate the net income of Instagram. 1% growth is assumed in perpetuity.Focus Equity Estimates1 (0.6*420) Daily Active Users extrapolated based on the data from this sourceBased on a relative measure capturing active users, SNAP is still overvalued. Note that Instagram's multiple is used, which is a generous approach amid Instagram's seasoned management. Instagram also has the ability to charge a premium advertising price due to its higher reach compared to Snapchat.VerdictSNAP is a short sell, given stiff competition and a disappointing user growth leading to a price target of $12.Thesis RiskThe bear thesis on Snap is sensitive to the growth of active users. The value of Snap will increase if the company manages to post consistent users growth going forward. However, the chances of this happening are remote, as Facebook is providing comparable services through several interconnected brands, which is the key competitive advantage for Facebook.Supporting Documents"

Accordingly, Snap's chances of following more successful companies like Facebook and Twitter into the Broken IPO Club are high.","When a stock falls below its IPO price shortly after coming public it is known as a broken IPO. Broken IPOs are commonplace occurrences and most likely to occur when the IPO's valuation was priced too high. A typically negative catalyst for stocks to fall below their IPO price is the approach of the lockup expiry when a great deal of selling will put intense pressure upon the market and cause the recent IPO to decline below its IPO price.Snap, Inc. (SNAP) has an unusually large lockup expiry relative to the number of shares in the float as a result of the recent IPO. This may put additional pressure on the stock to the down side. The following graphic illustrates the large number of shares that will be available to sell on July 31st and August 31st for a total of 1.2 billion shares that will be free of any restrictions and may be sold into the open market. It is noteworthy that the 150-day lockup expiry will pertain to employees of the company who will almost certainly be highly motivated to sell at least a portion of their shares:Snap is experiencing staggering losses that have been increasing and the company has indicated that there may never be a pathway to profitability.The disconcerting graphic above is indicative of a failing business model.And this graphic below is confirmation of a failing business model:Below Ghostface Chillah expresses concern for a questionable business model that is delivering horribly scary results on a quarterly basis with no end in sight. It's okay Ghostface Chillah. You can take solace in the facts that A) you as a ghost are already dead, and B) you are just an animated character with no shares of SNAP to cause you pain. However, if you are a real live person who actually is long shares of SNAP in a brokerage account then you might consider the approaching lockup expiry as a reasonable catalyst to be afraid, be very afraid.Even much stronger companies that were profitable at the time of their IPO's have fallen below their IPO prices in the after market. Facebook (FB) is one example of a profitable company at IPO that fell below its IPO price. The Facebook IPO brought 421 million shares public on 5/18/12 priced at $38 per share for a market capitalization of $104 billion. Less than four months later on 9/04/12 Facebook traded at a low of $17.73. One of the great companies of our time that was profitable at the IPO lost more than half of its value from its $38 IPO price down to $17.73 as it approached its lockup expiry.In view of Facebook's experience as a broken IPO it may be reasonable to expect a company like Snap that is posting huge losses, has an unusually large lockup expiry, and is much later to market than Facebook to also become a broken IPO ahead of its lockup expiry on July 31st.Below is a chart that illustrates Facebook's sharp sell off that occurred after its IPO and prior to its lockup expiry. Facebook experienced more than a 50% decline in price during this time period. If Snap were to experience the same type of 50% sell off, then Snap's $17 IPO price would decline to about $8 per share prior to the completion of the two upcoming lockup expiries on July 31st and August 31st.FB data by YChartsKeep in mind that Facebook was profitable at the time of its IPO and had a greenfield opportunity globally. Snap is losing increasing amounts of money and has daunting competition steadily increasing from Facebook and others. The chances are high that Snap could become a broken IPO very soon. In fact, with the unusually large number of shares in Snap's expiry relative to the amount of shares in the float post IPO it would be reasonable to expect a decline in price below Snap's $17 IPO price. Even most reasonable bulls would concede at least this much.Longer term, it would be wonderful if Snap could emerge as a strong and vibrant competitor in the social media space as competition is good for the marketplace. But near term there is no doubt that both this company and its stock has increasing amounts of pressure upon it that is about to get worse in the near term as 1.2 billion shares are about to be available to sell into the open market.It is important to note that Snap has a very high short interest. This is significant because currently it is difficult to find shares available to sell short. Once newly available shares become available to sell short as a result of the lockup expiry it is likely that a significant percentage of the shares that are sold onto the open market will then also be sold short. This equates to the same shares being sold twice, once by the employee who sells into the open market and then a second time by a short seller who is now able to borrow these available shares. This makes the amount of downward pressure that will be brought to bear on the market for Snap shares much more intense. The chart below for Snap illustrates the growing short interest in this stock. Expect more shares to be sold short as the two lockup expiries take place:SNAP data by YChartsSnap's initial IPO range of $14-$16 was based upon the assumption that the company would deliver future growth at a rate that was far above most high-growth tech IPOs. The only way to support a $14-$16 IPO valuation that correlated to the fundamentals of Snap at the time of its IPO would be for the company to deliver hyper-growth far into the future.Unfortunately, Q117 clearly proved that growth was sharply decelerating and hyper-growth was NOT happening. This absence of the extremely rapid growth that was promised by Snap management during the IPO road show made clear that the $15 IPO mid-range price was way overvalued and no longer sustainable. No hyper-growth equals no hyper-growth valuation. It's just that simple. Q217 will confirm the absence of hyper-growth and the egregious IPO mid-range price of $15 will become a distant memory as Wall Street re-values Snap shares to a more appropriate level far below the IPO price of $15.Oh wait! Well Excuuuuse Me! The Snap IPO did not come to market priced at the egregious mid-range price of $15, did it? The price was further jacked up still higher by the avaricious Evan Spiegel and lead underwriters at the investment banking firm of P.T. Barnum and Company. They priced the Snap IPO at $17 with a market capitalization of about $20 billion. And a cult-like following of newbie investors were willing to pay any price that was asked of them and once again the marketplace became exhilarated by the Wall Street hype machine that ran this stock up to $29 per share within hours after trading commenced. After all, the syndicate issued their obligatory price targets well above the current market price didn't they? And certainly the Wall Street professionals in their expensive suits would not issue price targets along with fancy research reports unless they were honestly convinced in the legitimacy of these price targets... would they?For those of us who were in the market during the dot.com bubble, Snap is reminiscent of the boom/bust cycle of hype combined with failed business models. Pets.com anybody? The salesmen in the IPO underwriting syndicate were incentivized to bring Snap public at the highest price possible. And management at Snap had their own financial interests aligned in the same greed-driven scheme to pump up the price of this IPO before dumping it upon investors. Never mind that the valuation of the $17 IPO price and the corresponding market capitalization of $20 billion did not even remotely correlate to the underlying fundamentals of the company and the slowing growth that was becoming apparent in Q416 prior to the IPO.The overly greedy IPO valuation for Snap has left investors with a stock having a Price to Sales Ratio of about 40 while the company is posting large losses, and experiencing slowing growth in combination with rising costs. You do not have to be a Wharton graduate to ascertain this business model is failing currently.The graphics below illustrate that management timed this IPO perfectly for their own benefit and to the detriment of the public retail investor. And the approximately 20 pending class action lawsuits all allege that Snap management was keenly aware of this slowing growth during the IPO process but intentionally, ""issued false and misleading information"", to investors. Imagine that. Isn't that called fraud?Snap promised investors during the IPO road show that they would deliver hyper-growth but all evidence indicates that management was well aware that hyper-growth was not going to happen. But in return for Snap management's speaking the magic words during the IPO process the syndicate would foist their IPO stock upon an unsuspecting public at an egregious valuation. The syndicate managed to herd enough cats into the stable to sell the Snap IPO at an extremely high price of $17 with a lofty market capitalization of $20 billion. The Snap IPO was priced for perfection and hyper-growth because that is what Snap management promised. Clearly, Snap's performance since the IPO has delivered neither perfection nor hyper-growth.In fact, Snap has delivered sharply decelerating growth instead of ongoing hyper-growth. Snap's sharply decelerating growth is not what was promised during the IPO road show that enabled underwriters and management to foist a $17 IPO with a $20 billion market cap valuation upon unsuspecting investors. Please note the sharply decelerating rate of revenue growth in column three below:(*Estimize estimates)The table above and graphic below do not illustrate hyper-growth. Snap promised hyper-growth during the IPO road show. Snap's IPO price was based upon a valuation that represented hyper-growth. Snap's current valuation is unjustified and far too high.Approximately 20 class action lawsuits are now pending that allege Snap management provided, ""false and misleading"" information during the IPO process regarding Snap's rate of growth in key metrics, such as DAUs.Disappointing Q117 results proved this high growth rate did not exist. Accordingly, Snap's chances of seeing its stock price decline further to follow more successful companies like Facebook and Twitter (TWTR) into the Broken IPO Club are high. Below is a chart for Twitter that has also struggled with a problematic business model.TWTR data by YChartsBut compared to Snap's financial results Twitter looks wonderful. Snap's financial results and business model are so bad that they literally force the question regarding the company's ability to remain solvent in the future. Twitter now trades at a fraction of its IPO price. It is very difficult to justify a reason for Snap to remain above its extremely overvalued IPO price of $17 with two huge lockup expiries approaching on both July 31st and August 31st. Facebook fell below its IPO price and Twitter also fell below its IPO price. And both Facebook and Twitter were much stronger companies than Snap around the time of their IPOs:Possibly because there are so many newer, less experienced investors in this stock there currently exists a myth that the IPO price of $17 is some kind of support that this stock will not fall below. As is typical of many IPOs the underwriters and others have made initial efforts to support Snap shares successfully at $17 up until now. But past is not prologue and here are a few reasons why investors should not expect the $17 IPO price to continue to receive support:Summary: These are some of the reasons why investors should not expect the underwriters to make much effort to defend the $17 IPO price. Expect Snap to become just another broken IPO very soon.Conclusion: Snap shareholders should not be debating whether or not this stock will become another broken IPO like so many others that have come before. All evidence points towards Snap becoming just another broken IPO very soon and ahead of two lockup expiries totaling 1.2 billion shares. For investors who believe that this stock will somehow work out okay in the long-term, the real question is how can Snap's business model become sustainable?The risk/reward ratio for long shareholders here while the stock is still above the IPO price is not good. And if/when the stock falls below its IPO price those investors holding the bag should be prepared for a very long wait until Snap proves to the market that it can make its business model work. Once Twitter showed the market that its business model was not working the stock traded in one direction only and that was downwards.The recent discounting coupon scheme that was offered by Snap was a clear sign that Q217 sales did not go well. No rapid growth company needs to discount down there products so soon after promising hyper-growth during the IPO just a few weeks earlier. When sales are going well there is no need to discount or offer coupons. So expectations for Q217 revenues to exceed Q117 revenues by a sharp margin may be inflated and setup for another disappointment. In fact, as long as large competitors like Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft (MSFT) are competing for the millennial market share, then Snap's key metrics will be under pressure.Trader's Idea Flow believes that shares of Snap are extremely overvalued currently and that a single digit share price may be in the near future for this stock. We were long this stock on IPO day and took a 10% profit on day two. We then sold Snap short at close to $28. The dates shown on the Instablog links will serve as timestamps to document these trades. We have had success trading Snap both long and short. We expect to remain short at least through the upcoming expiries and the Q217 financial report expected in early August. But we always reserve the right to react accordingly to market conditions.Judging by Ghostface Chillah's reaction to recent market conditions at Snap along with the upcoming combination of two huge lockup expiries combined with what could be another disappointing Q217 financial report in August he is feeling a little emotional at the moment. However, he may be expressing the correct emotion at this time, which would be something in the neighborhood of panic..."

Apple must have a dominant market share position in the vital millennial demographic to maintain future growth.Apple will likely leverage its coming AR products for iPhones and iPads to increase Apple's millennial market share. This is a serious concern for Snap shareholders.Snap's slowing growth is currently being negatively impacted by constantly increasing competition from Facebook. The advent of additional competition from Apple could cause Snap's growth to stall or turn negative.,"Apple (AAPL) is about to contribute to the sharply decelerating growth at Snap, Inc. (SNAP). In fact, Apple may become the cause of Snap's growth to completely stall or even turn negative. This article will explain why this extremely negative event for Snap is entirely possible.What would be the implications of this event, if it were to occur, for the price of Snap shares? Morgan Stanley and Cowen & Co. both downgraded Snap last week after they helped to bring this company public just four months ago and Morgan Stanley was actually one of the lead underwriters. I have been in the market for 30 years and I cannot remember ever seeing the lead underwriter of any issue this large simply turning negative on a company so soon after the IPO and saying, ""We have been wrong.""When an event so extraordinary as this takes place, investors want to stand up and take notice. The lead underwriter generally has better access to information from the company than most other people covering the stock. So when Morgan Stanley issues a mea culpa so soon after the IPO and slashes its price target from $28 to $16, then beware: the other shoe is about to drop. The Morgan Stanley downgrade also issued a bear case price target for Snap shares of $7. Why? Exactly.The first shoe stomping on Snap's growth rate has been Facebook. This is a well-documented fact by now. But the other shoe to fall upon Snap's flagging growth rate may likely be the upcoming launch of Apple's AR products this fall for iPhones and iPads.Sharply Decelerating GrowthHere is one of several factors why Morgan's bear case may be accurate. Please note the sharp deceleration of revenue growth illustrated in column three of the table below:(*Estimize estimates)Competition from Facebook (FB) and its property Instagram have been steadily increasing over the last 11 months since August of 2016. This competition is likely to continue increasing as fast as Facebook can ramp up its full-scale attack on both Snap's market share and revenues. It appears that Facebook is making an all-out commitment to knock Snap out of the social media arena before the recent IPO can become a long-term threat to Facebook. Clearly, the Facebook strategy is now working as key metrics at Snap are rapidly slowing. The table above illustrates slowing growth most noticeably in the Q117 and Q217 (estimates) time frames. The Q217 Snap financial report will be made on August 10th after the market close.The Macro Environment For Social Media Has DeterioratedSome of Snap's growing problems are from macro issues like a saturated social media marketplace in the world's best markets that has been pressuring key metrics like average revenue per user and revenues while causing new customer acquisition and maintenance costs to increase. Shockingly, it actually costs Snap more than $1 in expenses to generate a $1 in revenue. This is rare to see and no company can remain solvent for long with this failing business model.Snap Is Running Out Of Feet In Which To Shoot ItselfOther problematic issues at Snap are self-inflicted due to incompetence and poor management. The important self-serve ad manager platform was supposed to be rolled out in early 2017. Now it appears the platform is delayed for about a year, maybe longer. Nobody really knows when this key product will be available. Our call to Venice Beach where Snap is headquartered was answered by Jeff Spicoli. Somebody will get back to us after the surfing championships and bonfire parties are over. While advertisers are leaving the platform, user growth is slowing, the stock price is plunging, and Wall Street analysts have turned negative on this company all that we can hear in the background during our calls to Venice Beach is, ""Surf's up!"", and, ""Cowabunga!"" Maybe Silicon Valley would have been a better choice for a Snap headquarters venue after all.Take The Money And RunThe subtitle for this section could refer to the likely mindset of CEO Spiegel. But this subtitle actually refers to the advertisers and publishers who are finding a number of reasons to depart from their prior business relationship with Snap. Included among these reasons is a poor return on investment or ROI on their ad dollar budgets with Snap. It is turning out that all of those younger people in the millennial demographic A) do not look at ads and B) do not have much discretionary income. Shocker on both counts. Anybody who was once in the same age group as millennials now are in could have probably guessed as much. No market research firm necessary here for this data point.Perhaps the worst news of all for Snap is that these departing ad publishers are taking their ad money and running over to Instagram. The highly professional social media ad experts at Facebook and Instagram are delivering ad products that are stronger, the UX is much better, and the market reach is far greater. It is kind of a no-brainer for ad publishers on which platform is best to spend their ad dollars. Facebook and Instagram win hands down. Jeff Spicoli (or is it Jeff Spiegel?) and company are not even a distant second place consideration for a growing number of advertisers and publishers.Increasingly Serious Legal ProblemsThen there are the growing number of increasingly serious lawsuits that allege issues ranging from fraud to patent infringement. And it appears that each of the lawsuits filed may have merit. The fraud allegations in the complaints of the class action lawsuits could possibly attract the attention of the SEC. And the patent infringement case brought by UnitedGroup could impact the crucial Snap GeoFilters feature. Either of these lawsuit issues could negatively impact Snap's chances for survival. They are both that serious and neither are priced in to the stock yet.No Tapping Out Of This Choke HoldThe following is a potentially devastating issue taken from the Morgan Stanley report last week. This issue has clearly not been priced into the stock yet either since it may be the coup de grace to the already failing business model at Snap. Really, this is nails in the coffin kind of stuff for Snap. Here is item #4 taken from Nowak's research report that identifies key problems at Snap:This key issue is one of the reasons why CNBC's Jim Cramer called the Morgan Stanley report an ""obituary"" for Snap. One of several new developments in the Facebook assault on Snap is the offering of free lens to advertisers as Zuckerberg and company are going straight for the jugular of Snap. This brilliant knockout strategy by the stronger, more experienced player Facebook is like a mixed martial arts choke hold on Snap's primary source of revenue. You can believe that Facebook will not be allowing Snap the safety net of tapping out of this choke hold. This kill shot on Snap is being made for keeps.Facebook Is Killing Snap, Apple Will Bury The RemainsSnap derives about 90% of its revenues from the North American market. Because Snap is experiencing increasing levels of competition in North America it's growth metrics have slowed. This slowing growth has caused a sharp decline in the value of Snap's stock price. The table below illustrates Snap's dependence upon the North American market for its corporate survival.North America is an affluent market that is becoming increasingly saturated as social media and other technology companies compete for the eyeballs of the vital millennial demographic. These millennial eyeballs have a finite amount of time that can be devoted to social media. Apparently, shopping for avocado toast is very time-consuming so social media minutes have to be budgeted into the daily schedule appropriately. Here is why these avocado toast eaters are so vitally important to every company in the world, including social media tech firms: The graphic below basically illustrates that everybody else is going to be dead soon and the world will be inherited by... you guessed it, the planet of the millennials era is upon us.But of course advertisers and social media tech firms have known that the millennial generation is ascendant for years. Because of this well-known fact competition has been steadily increasing in the affluent North American social media market for years. Now the most affluent social media markets globally are becoming increasingly saturated due to rising competition. This increasing level of competition in the saturated North American social media marketplace has contributed to the sharp deceleration of key growth metrics for Snap in recent quarters. This factor is also causing costs to rise for items like new customer acquisition, customer maintenance, and R&D spend to stay competitive. Revenue and user growth slowing down sharply and costs up is not a good business model for Snap.Facebook, Microsoft (MSFT), Twitter (TWTR), and Snap among others are all competing for the same saturated millennial demographic in North America where Snap derives almost all of its revenues. Into this already crowded marketplace now comes mighty Apple to claim its own segment of the millennial market share in social media to ensure its own place in the future. Unfortunately for Snap it is the low-hanging fruit for Apple to take market share from. Here is why:Now That Snap Has Set The iPhone Table, Apple Will Eat Market ShareApple must have a dominant market share position in the vital millennial demographic to maintain future growth. Augmented Reality or AR is the next frontier for business, marketing, entertainment, education, etc. Apple intends to be a dominant player in the future of each of these categories via its own AR products. Apple's AR Kit launches this fall as announced this June at WWDCGene Munster calls Apple's AR Kit, ""Revolutionary"", and, ""Light years ahead of anything else out there in AR."" The apps developed for hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads will leave competing AR products far behind. For a millennial generation eager to jump to the next hot thing this fall will be when that jump begins to take place. Apple's Messages may be one possible social media platform where developments in the product to showcase AR apps could take place. Be certain that Apple has a plan in motion to gain and retain the eyeballs of as many millennials as possible in the months ahead. Social media time is finite. Wouldn't you rather spend yours on the newest, coolest, most innovative AR apps that are designed to help Apple gain social media market share? For a great many millennials the answer will be a resounding, ""Yes!""But If Facebook Is Already Stalling Snap's Growth...The advent of Apple's AR products this fall means that in addition to the increasing damage that Facebook is doing to Snap's stalling growth metrics, now Apple will become the next emerging wave of competition for Snap's millennial market share. If Facebook's increasing competitive efforts are already causing such a sharp deceleration in the quarterly growth metrics at Snap, then what will happen to Snap's growth rate when Apple starts taking market share this fall? Hey, this article has been a little doom and gloomy for our friends the Snap bulls. Maybe some music would cheer them up. Well, I used to be a bartender during my college days and every night just before closing the DJ would play this song.ConclusionApple's plan may be to leverage the products that will result from AR Kit for iPhones and iPads to increase Apple's millennial market share in social media. This is a serious concern for Snap shareholders. Facebook competition has been increasing relentlessly over the past year. Now Zuckerberg and company are attacking the primary revenue stream for Snap by offering free competing lens products for advertisers.It is always hard to compete with free. But for a company such as Snap that is already posting staggering losses on a quarterly basis in a failed business model, it simply seems impossible to compete with the deep pockets at Facebook. And Facebook can afford to bleed Snap dry financially for as long as it takes. Unless Spiegel is bringing home some kind of a miracle from Fiji to save Snap, it just doesn't look very promising for the team from Venice Beach. Now we understand why Cramer called the Morgan Stanley report an ""obituary."" RIP Ghostface Chillah, we hardly knew ya.Wait! Hold on a doggone minute! We can't do Ghostface Chillah like that. After all, he is just collateral damage because of the actions of real live people who have screwed up at Snap headquarters. Ghostface Chillah deserves better. Let's get him dressed up and I hear they are hiring over at Instagram where he can get a new job as mascot. This is a nice step up for him to graduate to a winning company. Atta boy Ghostface Chillah. Looking good!If you would like to follow Trader's Idea Flow for future articles, then by all means hit the big orange Follow button at the top of this article.

In a nutshell, it allows users to see the location of their friends on a map, as well as the Snap stories in the specified area.Reception from news outlets has been critical, to put it nicely. ABC News, The Verge, and WIRED have all cited privacy related concerns. Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, has been quick to respond, reminding users that Snap Map is an opt-in service: location is turned off by default. Only time will tell whether or not the Snap Map feature will take off, but there are reasons to believe that it could be a positive driver for future user and revenue growth. The traditional sell-side ratios are not great.Yes, Snap is losing a lot of money right now ($2.2 billion for Q12017 although $2 billion of that was compensation costs tied to going public.) Yes, their Earnings Per Share (EPS) is an ugly -2.67. But Twitter has yet to post a positive EPS since their IPO in November 2013, and Facebook also posted a negative EPS for the first two quarters after going public. Facebook’s EPS looks great at nearly 4.0, but remember it was only 0.18 a little more than two years ago. Not to mention, Facebook went public eight years after its founding, versus only five for Snapchat. But underlying metrics are still strong.For a long term, buy and hold investor, there is plenty to be excited about with Snap. Maybe the most impressive statistic is how much time people are spending on the app. Source These metrics are extremely encouraging, especially considering that near-term revenue is going to depend heavily on advertising. A teenager or young adult’s attention is wanted by many, but often hard to come by. Not for Snapchat. A recent report found that 45% of 18-34 year olds in the United States are reached by Snapchat on any given day, which is 9x more than the average daily reach of the top-15 TV networks. Maybe even more impressive is the fact that 87% of Snapchat’s daily active users between 18-34 years old cannot be reached by ANY top-15 TV network. Snapchat has traditionally been “picky” when choosing companies to partner with, but the end results are impressive: the mobile app Acorns ran an app install campaign and saw a 300% increase in installs.The Positives of Snap MapThere have been a number of apps to help people find friends around their present location, as well as attempts to create a live feed of world news. But none have been as compelling as Snap Map. The feature fits perfectly with their existing product, and it offers functionality that may appeal to an older audience. Yes, it is nice to see a friend near you catching a live music event that you weren’t aware of so you head over. But what may be transcending is the ability to search and watch stories from all over the world. While the mainstream news has been berating Snapchat for privacy issues, others have started to discuss the possible implications of being able to watch a personal, live video from someone in say, Nigeria (there is a heat map function that shows popular areas.)SourceHow Snap Map Could Impact FinancialsSince SNAP stock went public at $24.00, the stock has traded lower; the price has been under $20.00 and as low as $17.00. While Snapchat is arguably the most popular social network for teenagers, traction with the older demographic has not yet taken off. Currently, 71% of all Snapchat users are under 34 years old with 45% being between the ages of 18-24 (source). A possible explanation for these numbers could be that Snapchat is an app to do fun things like take selfies, not read the news or stay up to date with current events like many users of Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) do (""Staying up to date with news and current events"" was the 2nd highest cited reason for using social media by this study.) But the search and heat map features of Snap Map could change all that, providing a real use case of value for those over the age of 34.Snapchat reported 166 million daily active users (DAU) in the first quarter of 2017, which was 36% higher than 2016Q1 (122 million.) If Snap Map can improve the growth rate of users by just 2% to 38%, and we also assume that revenue per user continues to grow by 73% then Snap Map could have a positive revenue impact of $356.67 million over the next year.In addition to the possibility of attracting an older demographic, Snap Map could also help global growth, which has been a concern of analysts in previous quarters. In Q4 2016, Snapchat's growth of DAU's in Europe was up 53% year-over-year (YoY) to 52 million and up 58% YoY to 39 million in the rest of the world (Everywhere outside of the US and Europe.) Snapchat previously blamed a buggy Android app for slower user growth in the rest of the world, and made significant improvements to their product in Q1 2017. The combination of a superior experience on Android devices (which are much more common outside of the U.S.) with the Snap Map world map search feature should leave little room to argue that global growth should pick up.Currently, almost half of Snap's revenue comes from advertisements in the ""Discover"" section of the application, which shows content curated from specific brands/media companies like Cosmopolitan, BuzzFeed and National Geographic. (Source)However, revenue from Live Story advertisements is projected to surpass Discover in 2018. The addition of Snap Maps could provide an entirely new revenue stream with a completely different demographic than who Discover and Live Stories attract. Just like Live Story ads, Snapchat may start to show advertisement snaps targeted around a particular area. This could help Snapchat garner a higher average revenue per user in North America specifically where the company has said it wants to focus (at least from an advertising perspective.) Currently, Snapchat only makes ~$2.15 per user in the North America, compared to $19.81 for Facebook. Expanding the number of ""ad streams"" could help Snap grow its advertising revenue without simply showing more and more ads in the Discover and Live Stories sections, similar to how Facebook can generate ad revenue from the news feed, games, pages, etc. How It Could Go All WrongOf course, Snap Map could completely backfire. BuzzFeed recently published a post that alludes to why users may not want to be sharing their location with friends. It's also possible that one terrible incident that was influenced by Snap Map could cause enough negative media attention that it loses steam. It is impossible to know how much was spent on the development of the new feature, but if it were to tank that would be the equivalent of a large write off on Snap's balance sheet. ConclusionNo new feature comes without risks. On the positive side, Snap Map really doesn't cannibalize any of Snapchat's existing revenue streams. Overall, Snap Map should help broaden Snapchat's user base to both adults over the age of 34 and males (70% of Snapchat users are female). It's questionable whether or not an increase in revenues alone will result in a substantial increase in EPS (Snap executives haven't been shy about admitting costs will continue to rise.) But, if Snap Map can help turn Snapchat's identity into more than a ""selfie share"" application it should, at minimum, help analysts and investors trust Spiegel's long-term strategy a bit more. Besides, profitability is not always necessary for strong stock price performance (see Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM))."

Though we can easily acknowledge that we cannot cover every equity theme, we believe that these insights will prove useful.Micron Inc. may have found support following Earnings AnnouncementMicron (MU) took a beating in the past couple of sessions following what has been unanimously perceived as a good quarterly report.Source: TC2000The stock bounced off the 50-Day Moving Average, and traded upwards on positive SIA (Semiconductor Industry Association) data, for the month of May. The SIA data (which we will discuss in more detail) implies positive read-through for NAND and DRAM specifically, which grew 48% and 60% y/y, respectively.Given the positive industry data points, and the stock trading at a depressed forward P/E multiple of 4.8x, one may wonder if now is an opportune time to pick up Micron shares.While we acknowledge that Micron’s multiple probably isn’t justified, and is undervalued. Investors must concede that the stock exhibits a lot of volatility precisely because it trades at a low-multiple, exhibited rapid sales/earnings growth following a cyclical trough. It’s the negative perception of cyclical stocks that drive valuation ranges, and it’s why we’re not surprised by the pull-back following its 240% rally from its 52-week low.We think investors should buy up shares opportunistically. We will reveal exclusive research on Micron to our premium research subscribers this week.Snap Inc. unveils new chat featuresSnap Inc. (SNAP) continues to add more features to Snapchat, as we move beyond the simplistic design interface that has made the app popular among millennials.Snapchat introduced “Paper Clips,” which allows users to share outbound links from the app. Of course, it’s worth noting that Snapchat introduced a preview function, so users don’t click on malicious links from spam accounts.The new feature may prompt speculation over affiliate links, and how it may impact Snap’s digital advertising model going forward. Furthermore, we expect that digital advertisers will spend more on “follower campaigns” given the residual value of sharing outbound links to followers on Snapchat.Snap also introduced backdrops and voice filters, which allows users to modify Snap Stories/Messages with new backdrops that are designed via the scissor functionality paired with voice mods that can be selected from a range of voices by clicking on the speaker icon.The new voice modification feature is the easiest to use out of the three, whereas Paper Clips (link sharing) may take a while to really take off. The new backdrop filter was incremental in nature, and is really targeted at hardcore Snap users.Overall, the recent update was more incremental, though it’s worth noting the amount of effort Snap Inc. puts into developing new functionality.We continue to reiterate our Top Pick Internet Pick designation on Snap Inc.SIA data read throughMay was a strong month for Semiconductors, as SIA updated its model to reflect 24% y/y growth on aggregate. The industry logged eleven consecutive months of y/y growth, but with growth rates accelerating into 2H’17 where seasonality contributes to better q/q compares. This suggests that the cyclical trough may be coming to an end, as growth was broadly distributed, as growth was inclusive of analog, logic and discrete growth as well.RBC Capital Markets provided a monthly data summary for the entire industry.Source: RBC Capital MarketsThe category that added most to May was memory and logic chips, which grew 54% and 16% y/y respectively.AMD (AMD) +8.56%, Micron +4.7%, STMicroelectronics (STM) +2.59%, Intel (INTC) +2.63%, ON Semiconductor (ON) +1.81%, and Cypress Semiconductors (CY) +1.65%.The data suggested that Intel and AMD may exhibit better industry tailwinds going into the second half of 2017. Therefore, industry expansion helps to offset the perceived weakness from declining MPU volumes, because of competition in the case of Intel.Future of advertising and televisionIn a Credit Suisse report released Wednesday morning, it was noted that TV networks are transitioning towards more advanced targeting methods for linear programming. Though, we find these efforts promising, it’s still nascent according to the report.Here was the key highlight:We find these developments to be more promising, though we acknowledge that they’re nascent and may not transition quite as successfully as industry insiders are anticipating. Replicating the digital ad-targeting model is difficult for standard broadcast television, with companies like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) likely to absorb more exclusive content and rebroadcast via their respective platforms.Comcast (CMCSA) could be more resilient in the face of cord-cutting, especially if new ad-tech offers useful insights that can help mitigate the declining subscriber pool over time.Global CIO survey provides insights on IT spending priorityA new IT survey was released by Deloitte, and the key takeaway suggests that there are further legs to cloud migration and modernization of IT infrastructure at various companies.Key highlights (summary from Wedbush Securities): 1) end-users are still under-investing, with current IT spend leaning towards modernization of legacy/core on-premise data centers. 2) investment priorities to shift away from legacy platforms (Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are big losers in this scenario). 3) Investment more concentrated in emerging tech like MLA, IoT, and process/robotic automation tied to the datacenter.Source: Wedbush SecuritiesThe key focus areas for IT spending over the next two years: 1) Analytics, 2) digital, 3) cloud computing, and 4) cyber security.Winners: Microsoft (MSFT), Accenture (ACN), Amazon (AMZN) and BlackBerry (BBRY).Losers (legacy providers): Oracle, IBM, HP Enterprise (HPE).Tech valuations under a microscope again…Source: BofAMLFANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL)) overweight relative to other tech stocks. It’s been noted that stocks that are overweight soon underperform relative to comparable indexes.Whereas FAANG inclusive of Adobe (ADBE), and Avago (AVGO) show an even higher weighting among investment managers.The stocks likely to exhibit the most beta are FANG stocks, though it was noted by Mark Mahaney on CNBC recently that there’s very little fundamental news that could diminish business fundamentals for 2H’17.Overall, we maintain our stance that the market is long overdue for a correction.Cho's Investment Research is SA's premier research package that gives investors and traders an additional edge when investing into companies.

4084558,61281,2017-06-28T12:10:20-04:00,"Snap is the stock that everyone loves to hate - and for good reasons.Beneath the image that the company is trying to present, there are long- and short-term strategies that could change the company around.Spectacles AR acceptance and short-term performance that relies on the content providers' deals could help the company recover.While Snap is far from being an attractive investment, currently, investors should keep it on their watchlist.","Investors have all the good reason to stay away from Snap (SNAP). The company has negative gross and EBITDA margins; it spent more than $2B on SBC in the last quarter, which is 14x than its Q1 revenues; its number of daily active users grow at a disappointing rate; the stock price is freefalling from its $28 peak; CEO Even Spiegel’s controversies (sleazy leaked emails, ‘Snap for rich people’, conference call controversy and more) and a lofty valuation of $20.4B that reflects a steep P/S ratio of 40.Under the current circumstances and valuation, I also believe that investors should stay away from Snapchat. However, I believe that in a longer-term view and after certain conditions are met, Snapchat could be an attractive investment.The AR Trend Cooling DownA couple of years ago, augmented reality and virtual reality were the hottest trends in technology, and every company that was looking to raise funds, improve its innovative image, or receive investors’ affection mentioned its AR/VR product or intent to develop a product in these niches. Since Facebook (FB) released its Oculus Rift and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) improved its Glass operation to run quietly and under the radar, the AR/VR trend has been slowly cooling down while other trends have attracted the hype.However, the Pokémon Go phenomena and the relatively successful pilot of Snapchat Spectacles might prove that there is consumer demand for AR products – they just need to be in the right place, at the right time, and in the right price range.Snap got it right where many AR and wearables companies got it wrong, and with 8M units sold worldwide, I consider Snap’s wearables test a success that could impact the business going forward.Spectacles As A Successful PilotAround the IPO, Snap was criticized for describing itself not as a social media network or instant messaging service but as a camera company looking to reinvent the camera as we know it. Such a strong statement was judged as a pretentious attempt by a company that many market participants don’t fully understand to revolutionize a basic retail product that has existed for centuries. However, the Spectacles release in November 2016 was only the first step in that direction.Snap’s Spectacles are a very basic wearable device that allows users to take videos from their point of view and store them internally, within the camera, and these videos could later be uploaded to Snapchat or directly synced with a Snapchat account on a paired device.Even though Snapchat’s Spectacles could potentially draw the same amount of criticism as the Google Glass did, the product's launch went relatively smoothly, and the device was even considered as a nice-to-have gadget for millennials. In my opinion, the product has three significant advantages:Short- and Long-term Growth CatalystsWith the successful introduction of Spectacles, Snap passed its first wearables test successfully, and that laid the ground for the second generation of Spectacles, which is expected to include more AR features. The second version will take Snap one step closer to its long-term vision of reinventing the camera, and will strengthen the company’s attempt to position itself as a social media or IM service.Delivering a successful AR-reached smart glasses that will be widely adopted is a sensitive and delicate process that giants like Google tried and failed. If Snap will succeed to mimic the advantages of the first version of Spectacles i.e. easy and straightforward to use, affordable and value added to users, the Spectacles AR version could be a real game-changer for the company.Also, the success of Spectacles AR could reignite the AR development market that cooled down and recover the hype around the technology in a way that could help many other AR companies in their business. If Spectacles AR succeeds, it might be the trigger that the AR industry needs to accelerate the AR ecosystem that will support all the companies involved.At the same time, Snap is leveraging its user base demographics, which includes mostly users under the age of 25 that many content providers and advertisers want to reach. Snap’s deals with Time Warner (TWX) and NBCUniversal are the latest examples of this effort that could potentially increase revenues in the short term. Also, as part of the company’s effort to improve short-term performance, Snap offers discounts to advertisers to avoid another earnings miss as happened in Q1, which drove a 20% drop in stock price.SummaryRight now, Snap is one of the stocks that investors love to hate, and for all the good reasons – the lofty valuations, disappointing growth rates, and controversial CEO. However, beneath the image that the company tries to adopt of a young, careless, me-focused and some would say arrogant, there is a real long-term business strategy that is slowly tested and implemented to shift the company away from being an IM service to a photo/video-taking service.I believe that the direction the company is taking is right with AR Spectacles on the roadmap and additional deals with content providers.Under the current circumstances and the unreasonable price-to-sales ratio of 40, Snap is still far away from being an attractive opportunity. However, the company is moving in the right direction, which I believe will take some time before the market will see significant improvement in financials and KPIs from Snap. Snap should definitely be on investors' radar and should be considered once P/S ratio passes the 30 line down towards 25."

Although it’s easy to imagine this volatility being caused by casual Millennial investors hopping on and off the train at the slightest jolt, the reality is that there is little consensus regarding the future of the company among novice and seasoned investors alike, and this high level of uncertainty, coupled with some rough fundamentals, has caused intense volatility in the share price.SNAP data by YChartsAs I stated in my previous article, the greatest challenge facing the analyst who attempts to value Snap by poring over its financials, or evaluating user trends, or attempting divination regarding the future of Spectacles, is to properly assign an identity to the young company, to discern what its vision and strategy look like in the long term. Is it a social media company, deriving most of its revenue from advertising and the monetization of user behavior? Is it a camera company, using its social media platform as a launchpad for hardware development and innovation in the camera sector? CEO Evan Spiegel has done little to clarify these lingering questions. And now, with the recent news of a significant agreement with Time Warner (TWX), another identity obfuscation is thrown into the mix, that of an original video content entertainment platform, partnered with a large telecom company with plenty of experience and capital to assist it.This article will address two main ideas regarding the company, so that any potential investors/short-sharks have eyes wide open regarding the opaque future of SNAP. First, we will investigate SNAP’s disappointing earnings, revenue, and gross profit figures in Q1, and why they weren’t surprising (notwithstanding the somewhat absurd $2 billion IPO write-off). In regard to this point, I’ll also explain why I believe gross margins won’t improve much in the near future (as SNAP exists today) and explore the theory that this isn’t news to Snap’s leadership. Second, we will try to assign motives and vision to somewhat confusing decisions by management and what they mean for the company moving forward, including the significance of this recent deal with TW.Rough, but Unsurprising, Quarterly ResultsSnap’s recent 10-Q shocked observers for good reason when it revealed a 2 billion dollar expense related to IPO costs, mainly consisting of “stock-based compensation”. They were also, less justifiably, shocked by some of Snap’s other important metrics. DAU growth missed consensus by 2 million, although the actual 5% QoQ growth from 158 million to 166 million was greater than the previous quarter’s growth of 3%. In my opinion, the consensus DAU figure of 168 million was irresponsible and seemed somewhat arbitrarily reached, based on the preceding trend for the metric. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the 5% growth, a roughly two-thirds increase QoQ, following a period of rapid decline in user growth. The disappointment regarding revenue was a bit more understandable. Revenue shrunk by ~10% QoQ, compared to consensus estimates of a ~4.5% shrink. This is a difficult figure for a young, rapidly growing company to publish but could be interpreted as a bit of a blip, and the recent TW deal should ameliorate some fears regarding revenue growth security in the future.Prior to the publication of Snap’s Q1 results, I noticed a lot of bulls pointing to increasingly sexy gross margins as a harbinger of future profitability. Snap achieved gross profitability for the first time in Q4 2016, following a trend of steadily improving margins in previous quarters due in great part to rapid revenue increase. This trend did not continue in Q1 2017. COGS growth, while lower than the previous quarters, remained positive while revenue shrunk about 10%. The shrink in revenue, as I said, was tough to predict, disappointing, and perhaps should not seriously convict the company, given its impressive monetization over the past couple years. On the other hand, COGS growth was predictable and will continue to cling to revenue for better or worse in the current revenue structure, in which hosting costs, mostly paid to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud, increase almost in lock-step with increase in revenue.Strange BedfellowsIn my previous article, I mentioned that I see SNAP’s five-year partnership with Google, in which the company commits to spend at least 400 million per year, or 150 million per quarter (Q1 ’17 COGS was 163 million, for reference) on data hosting and other Cloud services, as a virtual guarantor that gross margins, given the company’s current revenue makeup, will not get much better. The marginal hosting costs of additional revenue, driven by user engagement and increasingly data-expensive gimmicks to keep those users engaged, such as filters and the new Snap Maps, will remain prohibitively high.I assume with some confidence that the executives that negotiated this partnership know far more than I do about their business and were equally aware of the red flags regarding the deal. It is essentially an expensive long-term lease, with both a high minimum fixed and substantial marginal cost and one with a healthy five-year, minimum $2 billion commitment. In lieu of investing, at least partially, in their own data hosting infrastructure, they’ve chosen a paradigm of not only heavy payments to a near-direct competitor but also a complete reliance on said competitor for the health and fluidity of their regular business operations. As the 10-Q astutely puts it:It goes on to list the many actions Google could take, ostensibly legally, to seriously harm Snap, such as:Looking AheadIn the pantheon of “Bad Deals”, this one seems the stuff of nightmares, the kind that would scare Donald Trump right out of what I imagine to be an apnea-ridden slumber. So, why was it agreed to? I believe it was agreed to in the interest of keeping the company flexible, agile, and to reap the benefits of Google's extensive analytics services. If Snap were to invest in its own hosting infrastructure, it could feasibly lower the marginal cost of its Snapchat advertising-based revenue (basically its only revenue source right now), but the initial investment would be very large, and the company would become more or less married to the platform as its most significant revenue producer. I feel confident postulating that Snap’s main priority, more than short-term profitability, share price, or advertising margin growth, is agility and innovation. The company wants to keep innovating and diversifying, occupying new markets in which it is uniquely qualified to maintain a significant share thereof.The five-year bondage to - er, partnership with - Google Cloud could actually be very advantageous if we view Snap and Snapchat with this lens: the latter is essentially the former’s in-house think-tank, with significant goodwill, access to cash, and, most importantly, a treasure trove of user behavior to utilize in the development of new products and a new company image. The Cloud agreement brings with it the incredible algorithms and user data analysis that has contributed so much to Google’s success, making Snapchat a perfect Product Testing Department and cash generator for Snap’s future ventures. I do not believe that Snap wants to be synonymous with Snapchat five years from now, even less so than Google, or Alphabet, could be appropriately termed a search engine company.So, what does this future Snap look like? That is a tough question to answer. It self-identifies as a camera company, with Spectacles as its first venture into the camera hardware space. Although I believe its title misses the mark, this CNBC article informs that Spectacles generated a relatively small $8 million of revenue in Q1 of this year, or ~61,000 units, but that is still an impressive figure, given the fact that total sales in 2016 were 30,000 units. Spectacles presents an opportunity for Snap to change the nature of the media-sharing space and a more difficult niche for Instagram (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)) to shamelessly copy its way into. Time will tell how much Spectacles catches on, but it’s worth paying attention to, if for no other reason than Snap arguably considers it more worthy of capital investment than its current principal revenue generator.Time Warner AgreementThe recently announced TWC deal warrants consideration as well and, at the very least, guarantees SNAP an increased revenue stream. Time Warner will partner with Snap to release original content from its many media properties, such as HBO and Warner Brothers. The deal is valued at $100 million, spent over the next two years, although some important details remain unclear, such as how advertising revenue will be split and how much this projection depends on viewership numbers. The partnership, in my opinion, reflects a short-term diversification strategy on Snap’s part and an attempt by Time Warner to tap into a younger audience that likes little screens better than the big ones in their living rooms. I do not think Snap intends to try to pursue this business model into the long term; its aspirations are greater than that. However, one interesting potential consequence is the greater direct competition with Google’s YouTube, as this strikes me as a service that is more similar to what that platform provides. In time, more details will emerge regarding the deal, and we will see how appropriate the $100 million figure was in terms of real economic benefit to Snap.ConclusionSnap’s story is going to be fun to watch, and stressful for the invested viewer, for the same reason that Lost was. I believe it will be a totally different show from season to season, and the success of the protagonist is far from guaranteed. In five years, assuming the company survives and thrives, it will be unrecognizable from the company it is today. Its survival depends on it. For this reason, I believe it is unwise to liken the company to a young Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), or even a young Facebook. Twitter’s hamartia has been to pretty much remain unchanged since its inception, and Facebook’s diversification strategy is to gobble up or copy other innovative companies. Snap seeks to remain one. To make a long-term investment in Snap is to make a short-term investment in Snapchat and predict that it will evolve into something much greater. To short the company in the long term is to assume that it will drown in its own ambition as it neglects significant cost-reducing investment related to its current main revenue machine, in the interest of new and untested products that ultimately fail. I am not short or long Snap (although I’m volatility-bullish), but in its leadership, I see boldness, a focus on innovation, and an eye towards the future, perhaps at the expense of the present."
4083719,94846,2017-06-25T05:15:22-04:00,"Snap’s shares rose up 2.08% during early trading hours on Thursday after the firm announced its new location-based feature.Recently, Snap-Time Warner deal had given a slight boost to the company’s shares.With its recent announcements, Snap may be clearly addressing the elephant in the room.","After going public, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) may have found an obsessive rival in Instagram. Facebook's Instagram has been blatantly copying Snap's key features and the attempts have only become relentless and unapologetic.After a dull performance in its first quarterly earnings report this year, on being asked about Instagram's Parent company Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Snap CEO Evan Spiegel had said: ""If you want to be a creative company, you have to be comfortable with the fact that people will copy your stuff. Everyone will develop a camera strategy. Just because Yahoo has a search box, it doesn't mean they're Google.""Amidst competition, Snap is trying its best to fight back Instagram by introducing fresh features for its users. Very recently, Snap announced Snap Map - a feature that allows Snap users to 'look at the map of their friend' location. Termed as ""stalkerish"" (by Wired) the application allows users to click on location-based pins to see posts from that location. Though the shares of Snap did not act immediately to the good news, they eventually started to move rapidly.According to TechCrunch, the new feature has become possible through Snap's recent acquisition Zenly, a French startup that makes social maps. Bloomberg reported that people close to the matter opine that Snap could pay as much as $200 million in cash plus additional stock awards. Snap had been in the news after its IPO for its poor performance and its shares had even hit its IPO price of $17.But this may not be the only activity that could bring some good news to Snap investors.On Monday, Snap got a fresh revenue ad stream through Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). The global partnership announced pushed Snap's stock about a dollar above from its IPO price of $17. According to The Wall Street Journal, Ellen DeGeneres and Samantha Bee could be a part of this deal. Even though the companies are yet to disclose additional information, a report by TechCrunch pointed out that the deal could well be valued at $100 million across two years. So far Snap has worked with major media companies that include NBC, EXPN, BBC and Discovery Networks.Photo:Snap Inc., Venice Beach,CARecently, Snap made life simpler for teen job applicants looking to work at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) - at least in the US. The Golden Arches aims to reach out younger millennials- a demographic which is the largest user of Snap. According to Statista, 81% of US teens said they use Snapchat every month, compared to 79% for Instagram.Earlier this month, Snap confirmed with TechCrunch that it had acquired a startup called Placed- that would help in tracking the offline success of digital ad campaigns. Placed has partner platforms like PayPal and Pandora attached with it. The association would boost the confidence of advertisers that use Snap as a primary advertising platform. Like Zenly, Placed is said to run independently.The acquisitions by Snap are not surprising since the 'camera company' has been quite clear about its strategy to monetize advertising.In Snap's S-1, the firm mentioned:""Our strategy is to invest in product innovation and take risks to improve our camera platform. We do this in an effort to drive user engagement, which we can then monetize through advertising. We use the revenue we generate to fund future product innovation to grow our business.""Advertisers that use platforms like Snap and Facebook only fuel more growth since they work around user driven models (users are the products).Snapchat currently airs one show of Time Warner and by the end it is expected to air three shows per day. The company provides its advertisers with variety of options that include purchasing Snap Ads, Sponsored Lenses and Geofilters. The video Ads displayed on Snap play for up to 10 seconds giving users the choice to swipe up to see more. Snap generates substantially all of its revenues by offering various advertising products on Snapchat. These include Snap Ads, which are vertical full screen video advertisements, and Sponsored Creative Tools, which include Geofilters and Lenses.According to TechCrunch, the first advertiser to run Sponsored World Lens will be Warner Bros. for promoting a new ad for the joint MGM and WB film ""Everything, Everything."" Netflix and Dunkin' Donuts plan to run World Lens ads in the future, according to the report.But interestingly, even with strong brands like Time Warner and BBC, Snap will continue to face stiff competition from Instagram and the progress of Instagram will only lower the stock price of Snap.This week, Snap's obvious rival, Facebook in its blog post stated that the stories section on Instagram touched as many as 250 million daily active users as of June. The announcement itself led to a dip of 3.4% in Snap's stock price. As of May this year, Snap had as many as 166 daily active users which is a little more than half of that on Instagram this month.Daily Active Users are one of the most important parameters that capture the growth of companies like Snap and Instagram. Recently, Instagram updated its feature that allowed live videos to disappear. Instagram users can now replay live videos even after the broadcasting is over. The new update aligns with Facebook's strategy to engage online audience on a daily basis.However, when it comes to advertisements, Instagram is surely not lagging behind. Some major names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Ikea, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), NFL and Audi have their name attached to Instagram for advertisement.With more active users on a daily basis, major brands have an additional channel to market their product and connect with a demographic that prefers to stay more online than offline.In such cases, a growing user base is a key factor that lures many major brands to advertise on platforms like Snap and Instagram. In such cases, for long-term investors of both Snap and Facebook, the competition between these two platforms may only look stronger and get tighter."
4083255,101421,2017-06-22T12:24:47-04:00,"Snap has acquired location technology company Zenly, according to a report in TechCrunch.Zenly has created an opt-in social sharing app that enables users to see where their friends and family are located.The deal makes perfect sense for Snap, and should bolster its offerings to advertisers with location-aware context about users.","Quick TakeSocial application company Snap (SNAP) has acquired location app company Zenly for between $250 million and $350 million, according to a report in TechCrunch.Zenly has created an app that enables opt-in social sharing of location between users and currently has a small but growing user base.The deal makes perfect sense for Snap since the system will directly build out its advertising offerings based on location and user intent.Target CompanyParis, France-based Zenly was founded in 2015 to make it easy for users to know where their friends and family are located.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Antoine Martin, who has been working on the project since 2011.Below is an interview video of Zenly’s CEO about location sharing:(Source: TechCrunch)The company raised $35 million in two rounds of investment from private investors including top-tier firm Benchmark.Zenly’s app apparently has had 4 million downloads, mostly from Europe and Asia, which isn’t much compared to more widely-used apps which can reach hundreds of millions.Acquisition Terms and RationaleThe report indicated a price paid of $250 million to $350 million, with most of the consideration paid in cash along with some stock.Snap hasn’t confirmed the deal, nor has it filed an 8-K, which would be required if the transaction caused a material change of financial condition.According to its current 10-Q, as of March 31, 2017, Snap had $3.2 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities. The company had $306 million in total liabilities.If the purchase amount range is accurate, Snap would have ample financial resources to pay for the acquisition without financial stress.The acquisition rationale for Snap is that the app enables users to share their location with their friends and family; the app therefore encourages users to message each other to find what they are doing and potentially make plans for an activity.Since Snap apparently closed the deal in late May, it may have already integrated the mapping system into its own app that it launched yesterday, which it calls Snap Map.A significant rationale for the addition is that beyond fostering friends and family connections, which is important, the app enables Snap to target location-based advertising to its daily active user base, which equaled 158 million in December 2016, according to its S-1 filing.Additionally, since the system encourages users to communicate through in-app, Snap will be able to better understand user behaviors based on location, generating a more complete profile of each user’s typical daily activities and locations. This knowledge will be used to help advertisers more tightly focus their offerings to users based on greater context of what each user is doing and where.Imagine a teenager seeing her friend nearby on the Snap Map; she texts her to meet at a frozen yogurt shop in between their two locations. Snap could then serve an advertisement for a competing yogurt shop to both persons before the two arrive at their originally-intended location, suggesting that they ‘try something new’ along with a $1 off digital coupon.It isn’t difficult to see the advertising opportunities that now combine location and knowledge of user intent.I view the deal a definite positive for Snap. It is well within Snap’s core offering and should provide significant upside to advertisers and Snap’s topline revenue potential.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

(NYSE: SNAP):The stock has gone down following its high-profile IPO. I've thought about purchasing shares as a trade, but I just didn't put it on my watchlist.But now something has rekindled my interest. That something is news concerning major media conglomerate Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) and its intent to develop content for Snap. The idea of Time Warner doing this intrigues me.It should come as no surprise that the market was bearish on Snap. In a big sense, it was simply another messaging technology trying to differentiate itself in a crowded field of communication apps. And then one has to consider Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and its Instagram asset. Snap is currently at a disadvantage compared to those two social media giants.To get a great idea of the comparison between Snap and Facebook, you can read this useful article by Seeking Alpha contributor Earnings Forecast Focus; it lays out the uphill battle Snap's business model faces.Fair enough. But here's where speculation enters the picture: what is Snap going to look like in the future? Will it be as dependent on its current way of doing things?To me, the answer is no, and I cite Time Warner's interest in the platform as evidence. This is a good development for Snap. Time Warner knows the value of content, and it wants to ensure that its content reaches the desired younger audience. That demographic spends a lot of time on mobile and on Snapchat. But one can only go so far with messaging systems; eventually, the platform becomes stale and needs direction. Original content can help fix that.Time Warner is aware that the television screen isn't the only screen out there. Snapchat is one solution to part of the puzzle that is the wandering viewer of the streaming age: there are all kinds of platforms out there showing all kinds of content and running on various technologies. Standing out is difficult. Time Warner can change that. In fact, it was mentioned in the linked news item above that HBO hypothetically might even be part of the mix in terms of program development. That would be a very strong endorsement for Snap if that happens.However, let me use this Hollywood Reporter article to highlight something about the current situation. Actually, two things: first, Snap has had content on its platform before, and second, the content is obviously of short duration, not much longer than five minutes. From one angle, that's a fine beginning, an evolutionary step in the right direction. But for me, I'm hoping the company starts to pivot its business model toward something else; something more meaningful.What I'm thinking is this: As time goes on, Snap needs to consider what it is and what it wants to be. The conclusion should be obvious (it's obvious to me, anyway): the goal should be an evolution toward that of a media company. The messaging technology should, over time, fade a little into the background at least in the sense that it should be looked at more as an eventual marketing tool for original content. Content should be the focus of the company, and Snap should be one of many platforms upon which that content is distributed. Snap is more like an idea incubator from which intellectual properties can be birthed into existence. It's similar to my feelings about Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) - yes, Twitter has perfected short-form communication, but its best advantage is its ability to market, not to make money off itself as it exists now. Therefore, Snap is the kind of business that should think about expanding its investment in content - in movies, episodic series, etc.I'm not buying the stock yet until I see some clear strategic vision outlined for the company that is hopefully different from its current one. From a fundamental/financial perspective, Snap is also just not there right now - see this news item and Richard Ashton's piece. However, I do think it is worth repeating - it might be wise to pay more attention to the company if it does decide to broaden its corporate mission statement. Partnering with Time Warner has made me think a little differently about Snap."
4081896,102771,2017-06-16T06:41:02-04:00,"Snap's stock is facing pressure from slowing DAU growth and the expiration of the IPO lock-out period.
        The company is facing another major problem: International Expansion.
        Snap's margins are much lower than its competitors. And these competitors will be better able to compete in less lucrative regions in the world.","The market cap of Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) has fallen significantly in the time after its almost $30 billion IPO. Most bearish observers cite concerns about slowing daily active user growth, lack of a competitive moat, and the eventual lock-up expiration that may lead to institutional selling.However, while these concerns are valid, Snap may have an even bigger problem. The company's business model is reliant on third-party digital infrastructure. And this may restrict it from international expansion because its margins are simply too low to compete in regions outside North America and Western Europe. I am reconsidering my previously bullish remarks on the company in light of these and other concerns.Lack of Differentiation and Why it's a Problem.Having downloaded and used the Snapchat application, I can't help but notice a lack of differentiation over similar businesses like WhapsApp and Instagram. This problem has been noted before, but it wasn't a big concern to me and other observers who assumed the company would continue to grow fast enough to reach potential users before the copycats reached these users. As Snap's DAU growth rate continues to decline, this is looking unlikely.Snap has a problem with international adoption. International growth is important because it is unclear how much more room Snap has for growth in markets that are already developed. From an advertiser's perspective, the business is a good tool for reaching the teen demographic - but eventually, most of Snap's growth in its core markets will have to come from older, less lucrative users. Advertisers may be able to get a better ROI from more interactive platforms like Facebook and Youtube for these users. The problem is that if Snap wants more teens it will have to look overseas - and if it does this, its cash burn will explode.Snap's International FailureSNAP Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsSnap will have a hard time expanding overseas because of its poor gross margins. One of the main reasons why Snap's gross margins are so poor is because, unlike Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap relies on third party infrastructure to run its operations. This means that while its competitors can capitalize their hosting expenses and eventually save money, Snap's hosting will be a cost of generating revenue, hurting the company's margins and probably ending up more expensive over the long-run.Because Snap's margins are so low, expanding into international segments with less revenue per user may never become viable. It is hard to see any realistic scenario where Snap could generate gross profit from users in a place like India when its margins are already so low in the United States. This is not a new problem. In a lawsuit, an ex-employee alleges that the company is not interested in expanding to ""poor"" nations like India and Spain. The suit also claims management said that the app is ""only for rich people"". If these allegations are true, they can be explained by the seeming unprofitability of Snap's business model in those markets.Source""Rest of World"" growth had already stalled in the fourth quarter of 2016. This chart shows Snap's quarterly DAUs but it reports the growth rate as a YoY percentage, potentially misleading observers. If Snap doesn't take over the international market, competitors like Facebook will be able to copy its product and then use Snap's ideas to take even more international market share. This means that, by the time Snap eventually moves overseas, it could have little or no competitive advantage left.ConclusionSnap Inc's market cap has declined significantly, and there is a good reason for this trend. The company lacks a moat, and this problem will be exacerbated by its inability to grow faster than its competition in poorer regions of the world due to its unusually high costs of doing business. The stock may face continued selling until it fixes the serious flaws in its current business model."
4085202,39301,2017-06-30T16:45:56-04:00,"Snap Inc. introduced “Snap Map” this past week, which has very interesting social implications.Furthermore, the digital advertising opportunity has effectively expanded without needing to stuff more ads within the story feed.We think this furthers the relevance of Snap Inc., mostly as a function of fueling testosterone levels and pheromones among teenagers.While this too sparks controversy among privacy skeptics, there are many who would trade privacy in favor of social functionality.We think this new feature is a win-win-win for users, advertisers and even shareholders.","Snap Inc. (SNAP) introduced a new geolocation feature, which is referred to as “Snap Map.” Though it has no immediate impact on financial performance, it suggests that development will take a different path going forward.Initially, skepticism has arisen from this new feature, as the map plots where your friends are, which has invoked suspicion of potential abuse.Source: Snap Inc.However, upon using the new functionality, it’s worth noting that very few have moved to adopt the feature. The privacy opt-in or ghost mode helps to adhere to Snapchat’s privacy-first mantra.Though it’s also a practical feature for those who know how to use it appropriately, and have actual friends on Snapchat. Therefore, it’s still additive to the user experience.What are the near-term implications?It’s all about digital advertising dollars and positioning the app to be more intuitive for digital marketers in need of more contextual clues on where consumers are spending the bulk of their time with friends, i.e. advertisers can pinpoint where clusters of friends would likely go, and can position ads when appropriate to take purchase intent away from competing companies.Imagine you’re at Starbucks, your friends know the exact location and meet you there with some help via Snap Map. Upon everyone arriving, the app notifies you of a nearby event that may lead to a concert venue, menu specials, or one-time sales promotions at your favorite retailer (Whole Foods, Men’s Wearhouse, Victoria's Secret, Chipotle, and so forth).This may help bring awareness to nearby products and services, which is a promising direction.We think the digital advertising opportunity here is quite interesting, as it signals the potential of a digital advertising billboard that can follow you where your friends go, and its why we think it fills some holes in its advertising proposition. Though many question the ability to target based on conventional geographical segmentation techniques we think the perception of these issues can be overcome.The lack of profile information makes it difficult to target based on age, interests, gender, race, and so forth. We think this is somewhat intentional to guard privacy. The furthest they’ve gotten on personalization is via the introduction of Bitmoji, which is a cartoon avatar that helps represent your digital identity on Snapchat.In a sense, Snapchat can address some of these clues with MLA (machine learning algorithms), so it can identify gender and various contextual clues from videos/photos. Again, the privacy skeptics will likely voice their opinions, but it has done little to deter usage in the past, as Facebook (FB) has continued to show how passé the anti-advertising/privacy establishment has become.While Facebook does map the interactions of people, and has introduced some location functionality in the past, the implementation has been poor, and very few people are active enough on Facebook to really take advantage of it.Though in the case of Snapchat, it’s a more personalized network map that helps you understand where your various friendship circles are located. In a sense, it wouldn’t even be surprising if Snap Inc. became the preferred dating app of our generation supplanting Tinder for good.Though we can acknowledge the appeal of swiping photos to the side, you’d probably have more success running into your high school sweet heart at a bakery nearby, or messaging your prospective lover via snap message once you know they’re home. This type of behavior could be construed as opportunistic, though the thoughts will likely cross the minds of millennials across the United States.Heck, it may cause social tension among users, but for juvenile reasons. Since many within our Seeking Alpha audience are much older, we must take on the perspective of teenagers. In this sense, we see teenagers interacting differently with each other, as they recognize who’s “most popular” or which “group of friends” are the “in” crowd. Think back to high school drama, but with visual evidence to back this up. You will soon recognize as a teenager that your friends are socializing with other people in another group, creating jealously or animosity.Pretty soon Rebecca will whine, because Scott’s spending more time with Jessica. Love triangles with evidence to back this up? Wow, teenagers are going to love this. Snapchat’s latest feature adds further ammunition to high school/college drama, which creates a nice “lock-in” effect that effectively reduces the relevance of competing social apps.In this sense, the advertising opportunity is mystically hidden from users as they’re busy figuring out what’s going on with their friends, while advertisers figure out a way to steer Scott into taking Jessica to their latest event special. Snap Inc. might as well acquire Groupon, so it can hand out discounts to teenagers who “actually” need them (allowance money only goes so far).Thanks Spiegel, you’ve just made socializing more dynamic if not dramatic in the 21 st century. We have no choice but to like the direction your development team is taking here. If it adds controversy to the lives of users, and has meaningful social impact, it’s a job well done.Final thoughtsSmall developments like these take a while to snowball. It wasn’t immediately apparent that Snap’s Story functionality would be a hit when it was released, but it soon became the biggest revenue contributor to Snapchat, and helped spark debate over Snapchat’s ability to overtake Facebook’s coveted story feed.But, with Snap Map we think there’s even more evidence that teenagers won’t tune out even if it’s to their own benefit. Social apps should be designed to heighten social engagement, and in this case, we give them an A+ grade.Snap Inc. has surfaced the inner stalker tendencies of younger millennials and has amped it up.

4080365,76115,2017-06-09T12:40:00-04:00,"The rally after the steep decline following Snap's earnings seems to have been a dead cat bounce.The latest from Nomura says DAUs are tracking lower than the year-ago quarter - less growth from a growth company is not good.With other near-term pressures coming, this isn't the time to invest, nor speculate, on Snap.","It looked like hope was renewed for Snap (NYSE:SNAP) when the stock retraced much of its decline after its less-than-stellar earnings. But it seems this was nothing more than a dead cat bounce - reality is setting back in. Reality is the struggle to find more users and keep them. Reality is the impending share lock-up expiration. Reality is the fickle demographic using the app. And reality is the lack of meaningful acquisitions. It's time to snap out of the warm fuzzies with Snap.Hey, Users, Where You Going?After a report this week from Nomura saying DAUs are on a declining rate, the market reacted in the only way it should have - down. It's obvious for one simple reason: it's the only metric the stock is propped up on. It's not revenue, it's not profit because there is none, and it's not management because it isn't doing anything spectacular. The only hope Snap has is its users, right now. If those users are not joining and interacting with the app at a high enough rate before profits and meaningful financials kick in, then the party is over before it even started. Let's talk about this more in a minute.That's A Wall Of...Discussing users alone excludes other market pressures outside of company's operations which play a role in share price - lock-up expiration being one of those items. Some contend this won't play any major role for Snap because it has held itself above IPO price of $17 since going public. But Snap isn't immune to every IPO's problem - shares flooding the market 90 to 180 days afterward.With Snap, the lock-up allows a considerable amount of shares to become eligible for the open market - 84% of all shares outstanding to be precise. This is very similar to Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) lock-up expiration when 82% of shares became trade worthy. Twitter's fate wasn't so good heading into the lock-up if one remembers.TWTR data by YChartsFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) wasn't any different except it saw a relief rally after the lock-up. Snap isn't greater than Facebook, I think even moderate bears can agree - and I'll get into this shortly - so I don't see how Snap can overcome these huge market forces. Of course, Facebook had other business forces to contend with like mobile monetization, so even more reason Snap won't be able to escape the downward pressure as it, too, clearly has business issues to overcome.FB data by YChartsWhy fight the tide going out? There's no reason unless you plan on sitting on dead money for another three months.If you're wondering about the year-long lock-up, which some investors saw as their saving grace and a tick in the good management column, well, you can consider it window dressing. The year-long lock-up only deals with 50M shares, which pales in comparison to the 1.2B shares ready to be set free in a few short months.Back To The Business EndLet's talk more about the users who are seemingly joining at lower and lower rates as the months go by. Just who are these users? Great question. The users Snap primarily deals with are between the ages of 13 and 24.That's 60% - who are probably the most fickle age group we know. Facebook bears for some time early on had a mantra about teens ""fleeing"" the platform. They considered this to be a huge problem and the reason you should've sold Facebook.This was in full parade in late 2014 - I remember it well. I vehemently contended it didn't matter until I saw an impact to revenue and profit growth.Now, let's review the only ""stats"" which matter:FB Net Income (TTM) data by YChartsSo ""fleeing teens"" never impacted Facebook's financials. Truly interesting.If this age group is fickle and they don't change the course of revenue and profit, then what good is it for Snapchat? The company will deal with all the baggage but get little out of them. This isn't to say having teens causes profits to decline - I'm not drawing a line connecting those two thoughts - but I am saying if you have a majority demographic changing opinions of your app on a whim while also struggling to get ad revenue, then you have put yourself in a conundrum.Since this demographic makes up 60% of Snap's user base, if they leave, advertisers will commit less money. So Snap can't follow Facebook's ""supposed"" footsteps and let teens leave because Snap's demographics are nothing like Facebook's - in fact they are opposite.No Real AcquisitionsFacebook came charging into its IPO with a deal for Instagram already on the hook. This brought Facebook from a one website pony to a multi-faceted holding company. Snap is still just Snapchat. Sure, it has acquired a few small companies in the meantime, but these acquisitions are trying to bolster the one app, Snapchat. If you combine slowing DAUs with no alternative property, then all the acquisitions used to enhance advertising and app stickiness won't matter. It's like bringing in more food to a party when the guests are leaving through the front door - it's a waste of money and now the food goes bad.If Snap wants to remain relevant, it has to surround itself with other apps people are using. Twitter did this with Vine and Periscope (though it has other management issues holding the stock back), and Facebook has done this quite well with Instagram and WhatsApp.Just Snap Out Of It AlreadyThere's a lot of negative catalysts and downward market pressure already here and more coming Snap's way in the next quarter or so. Why pretend everything is grand and put money into a stock whose business hasn't proven it has what it takes to grow revenue without overspending to bring it in?I don't see Snap even as speculation worthy; there's nothing more than volatility to play with in this stock. Management hasn't proven it's capable of real financial growth and, with DAUs slowing to a crawl, it's going to be even harder to overcome those doubts. In the meantime, I expect shares to continue their decline.If management began to bolster user growth, acquired other platforms to diversify and showed it could sustain growth in the added platforms, then I would upgrade Snap to initial position worthy. Otherwise, it's time to snap out of it - and the bullish delusion.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Snap as well as other social media and tech companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4081016,102757,2017-06-13T07:19:59-04:00,Investors have been comparing Snap's IPO and opportunity to that of Facebook.This comparison is off base for multiple reasons.Facebook's strategy is very simple: spend more money.Facebook generates $3.8 billion in free cash flow per quarter while Snap has a total cash balance of $3.3 billion and a negative free cash flow.,"Thesis Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is perhaps the most exciting IPO of this year. It has all the classic ingredients: Tech stock, no profits, good story. ""Buy SNAP now if you missed Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)"" seems to be the narrative. There are many differences between Facebook and SNAP that do not justify this comparison. In the following article, I will highlight why this is the case and why SNAP will not be able to compete with Facebook on a level that justifies a $22 billion market cap.Introduction Relaying Snap's mission statement will illustrate what I mean by good story: ""We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way that people live and communicate.""I am instantly skeptical when I hear mission statements talking about ""reinventing"" common goods. But, perhaps, I'm just a grumpy skeptic. To me, SNAP's mission statement should read something like this: ""Selling as many adds as possible through our camera app.""No profits, but plenty of cashOf course, most investors don't care about ""short-term"" profits when it comes to promising tech stocks. I mean that in the most sincere way. Most investors will often forego short-term profits if the company is attempting to accelerate growth and dominate its market. This behavior is most common in tech stocks and we're seeing it now again with Snap.Investors don't need to worry about the company running out of cash as a result. The company has about $3.3 billion in cash and short-term investments (bonds). The free cash flow sits at a negative $173 million as of 2Q17. So, assuming that SNAP does not accelerate its cash burn, the company has enough money for the next 18 quarters or 4.5 years or so. Although, I do expect the company to accelerate its cash burn a bit in the name of growth. How much exactly is hard to tell given that we only have two quarters of historical data plus the fact that the company does not provide any guidance:FacebookPutting SNAP's cash position differently, SNAP's total war chest is about the 6/7th of Facebook's quarterly free cash flow. This alone is already a serious competitive disadvantage. And since I believe that SNAP does not have any economic moat, Facebook should be able to outcompete SNAP by simply investing more. Let me explicitly state that I don't use economic moat and competitive advantage interchangeably. A competitive advantage is ""softer"" than an economic moat. I consider an economic moat to be a sustainable competitive advantage. In the case of Facebook, simply having more money is not a very strong competitive advantage. In the case of Snap, having a slightly better app is not a strong competitive advantage either. Examples of an economic moat would be customer switching costs, network economics or cost advantages. Examples of mistaken moats are things like great products and great management. Of course, having great products and management certainly brings an advantage.Why IS SNAP's app better than Instagram? The apps are quite different. Instagram is more of a social status app. The app has its own kind of celebrity: social influencers. Most of the content that is posted on Instagram is actually being posted by celebrities and social media influencers. While influencers also post content on Snapchat, the app is not influencer-focused.But, even though most content doesn't come from regular users, the celebrity stories are definitely being watched. From the above-linked New York Magazine story:In any case, the result is that Snapchat has a higher user engagement. Snapchat users spend an average of 25 to 30 minutes on the app per day, while user activity on Instagram hovers around 15 minutes a day. Keep in mind that this does not explicitly relate to Instagram Stories. The fact that Snapchat has better engagement is a common argument used to justify an investment in Snap. I don't believe that Snap's lead in user engagement will remain. Facebook's user engagement numbers are growing as well and Facebook's Snapchat copy-cat (Instagram Stories) is a lot younger than Snapchat.More money beats slightly better product The proof is in the pudding. It is already widely known that Instagram has surpassed Snapchat in user size. Sure, Snap has lots of exciting AR/VR they could possibly explore. Nothing is stopping Facebook from throwing another billion dollars in the next copycat effort. It is clearly working. Facebook does not need to innovate. It has money. Snap is basically Facebook's R&D lab. This article does a good job explaining how Facebook is becoming faster and faster at cloning Snapchat features.Another big difference between Snap's IPO and Facebook's IPO is that Facebook barely had any competition. Facebook had surpassed MySpace in terms of user base as early as 2008 and the company IPO'd in 2012. That is vastly different from competing against the most dominant player in the space that generates free cash flow the size of your war chest in a mere quarter.ConclusionSnap is not the same as Facebook and their IPO story was vastly different. Facebook was already the leader in its space when it IPO'd and didn't have any noticeable competition. Snap is taking on Goliath, and while it might have a superior app right now, it doesn't have anything that Facebook can't copy. Until Snap creates something that Facebook can't copy, there's no reason to put a dime in the company. Facebook knows it can copy anything Snap creates and is copying Snap's features faster and faster. The strategy might not be pretty or ""cool"", but is definitely effective judging by the fact that Instagram stories is already bigger than Snapchat."
4081566,103112,2017-06-14T21:14:36-04:00,Lock-up expirations of pre-IPO shares start this July.Competition is aggressively taking Snap’s market share.Trading ideas are discussed.,"Source: lightspeed.comSummaryI'll be the first to admit, I don't understand Snap (NYSE: SNAP) - not their vision nor their valuation. I have traded options - both bullish and bearish - on the stock and made a fair amount of money. However, I see no value in owning this stock in the short term.CompetitionOne of the biggest problems I see with Snapchat is they are an app - or a part of an app - more like functionality that you would like to see in a larger app. There are few barriers to entry. As noted recently, users apparently feel the way I do as app downloads for Snapchat fell by 22% on a year-over-year basis and by 40% on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Why? Competition. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) essentially created Snapchat features on their Instagram platform and has attracted over 200 million users; Snap has 166 million DAUs (Daily Active Users). Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has built something similar on Skype. However, Snap is not taking their app and going home - they recently announced that they are collaborating with McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) to show video ads of restaurant employees discussing the benefits of working at McDonald's and they continue to fight for DAUs.In my opinion, the best thing for Snap creators would have been to develop the app and let one of the big players in the space buy them for an 'awesome' price (e.g. Facebook paid $1 billion to acquire Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014). Rather now, the big players will continue to aggressively take market share and drive Snap out of existence.In addition to the above-mentioned competition, marketers have yet to embrace Snapchat. According to a recent report by the Social Media Examiner, just 7% of marketers used Snapchat in the 1Q17 vs. 94% for Facebook.Source: statista.comLock-up ExpirationMost initial public offerings [IPO] have a lock-up period ranging anywhere from 90 to 180 days after the IPO date. During that time, anyone who had access to the stock before it traded on a public exchange is restricted from selling his or her shares. This generally gives the public investing community some assurance that when they buy the stock insiders selling their shares won't overrun the shares outstanding. However, once the lockout period is over, insiders can sell their shares on the public market.The upcoming lock-up expiration will allow insiders (pre-IPO investors) the ability to unload their shares. JPMorgan (JPM) says an additional 1.2 billion Snap shares will become available for sale by the end of July. This is a massive potential earnings per share dilution - estimated at 84% of stock outstanding.Snap went public on March 2, 2017, at $17. Shown below are the expiration dates related to the lock-up. Numbers are in millions.Source: JPMorganIf these shares are sold into the market at too fast a pace, stock prices are likely to take a hit and would be a further negative for existing shareholders. When lock-ups expire, the agreed upon price can act as a ceiling for the shares even if positive news is seen in the long term.The stock is trading at $17.85 (market cap of $21.1B) and close to its all-time low of $17.56. The key point is what will the insiders do when the lock-up expiration occurs? If they see what apparently most everyone else sees, they will probably dump their stock - or a good portion of it - thus creating downward pressure on the stock.Shown below are the top institutional and executive holders of the stock.Source: fidelity.comFundamentalsThere is not much positive to say here - another reason for not owning the stock. For the quarter ending in March, Snap reported $150 million in revenue vs. consensus of $158 million. The company had a loss of $2.31 a share vs. analyst estimates of a loss of $0.20 a share. DAUs for the quarter came in at 166 million vs. 167.3 million expected.Trade ThoughtsWith 28% of the float in short positions, it is risky to short this stock. A large move up in price should see the stock soar in price as the shorts are squeezed. In addition, the premiums to buy puts are huge - for e.g., buying the August 18 puts would cost you $2.18 - the stock would have to drop an additional 12% to just break even. Longer term, one might see if the ceiling mentioned above holds true and sell bear call spreads above the ceiling to collect the option premium. For now, I will watch from the sidelines.SummarySnap's business model is suspect. I don't buy the hype as a standalone app when others in the space can create what Snap does with additional functionality in their own apps. I suspect the stock will be volatile until after the lock-up period is over. No trade recommendation is made.Additional DisclosureThank you for your time in reading the above article.

4080445,22148,2017-06-09T16:02:45-04:00,Snap faces lock-up expirations of pre-IPO shares over the summer.Whether VC firms and executives are willing to dump shares far below the highs is a crucial signal for any recent IPO.The numbers suggest insiders will rush to unload more shares.,"Over the last week, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has run into multiple headwinds. The market is increasingly concerned with the daily active user (DAU) growth and a sudden reminder about lock-up expirations that happens with every IPO.The stock hit a low below $18 today and near the all-time low. At a market cap of $25 billion, are these concerns reasons to avoid Snap on this dip?As with most IPOs, a lock-up expiration with pre-IPO shares occurs typically six months or 180 days after the IPO pricing. In some cases with large IPOs, multiple expiration dates exist.In the case of Snap, the company went public on March 2 of this year at $17. The six-month period hits on August 31, and according to the S-1/A, the social network has the following shares unlocking during the next few months:The key to the lock-up expirations is the size of shares being unlocked and whether or not insiders dump shares. Too much emphasis is on the expiration dates forcing the related stock down, but insiders not intending to sell turns into a bullish signal.A couple of prime examples of insiders dumping shares as a key signal to get out were Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Similar to Snap, these were hot IPOs trading off the highs heading into lock-up expiration when insiders quickly dumped shares.In the case of Fitbit, the company filed to sell roughly 10% of the outstanding shares in a follow-on offering prior to the 180-day lockup. The fitness tracking company allowed insiders to dump 2.3 million shares prior to the lock-up restriction in exchange for an additional 90-day lockup on remaining shares.The secondary caused the shares to crash from $40 to the offering price of $29, yet insiders went ahead with dumping over 16 million shares while the company cut the shares in the offering by 4 million. The stock now trades in the $5s after an 18-month period of disappointing results following what was a great 2015 holiday season when the follow-on offering took place.In the case of Twilio, the cloud communications company completed a secondary last October where insiders dumped roughly 7.4 million shares at a price of $40. Similar to Fitbit, selling stockholders rushed shares out prior to the 180-day lockup and sold far below the recent highs as the stock topped $70.Twilio now trades at roughly $25 after disappointing guidance following the loss of business from top customer Uber (Private:UBER). The stock didn't reach the lows until a couple of insiders made purchases in the $23s that signaled the possible lows.With 1.4 billion shares outstanding, Snap still has a $25 billion valuation heading into the lock-up expirations. Analysts only forecast revenues approaching $1 billion this year and possibly $2 billion in 2018, so the valuation is very stretched considering the DAU concerns reinforced by the data from Nomura Instinet.A key indication for a stock is whether insiders dump shares and not the actual expiration amounts and dates. The numbers are supportive of insiders such as the VCs dumping shares. One reason to turn constructive on the stock is if the VCs and other insiders don't actually dump shares by August.The key VCs are Benchmark Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners that control a combined 94 million Class A shares and 109 million Class B shares. These VCs sold 15.3 million shares at the IPO price of $17 along with roughly 42.3 million shares from the three largest insiders including the CEO who dumped 16.0 million shares.Source: Snap S-1/AThe key investor takeaway is that the valuation still above the IPO price suggests insiders are likely to dump more shares along with the upcoming lock-up expirations. Since the IPO, my investment thesis has long held that Snap was overvalued, but my opinion would see a constructive change if the insiders hold onto their shares."
4079868,86896,2017-06-08T08:26:14-04:00,"Snap Inc.'s stock has had a rough ride since the IPO.
        With some analysts pointing to another quarter of diminishing user growth, it seems unlikely that the company will find profitability in Q2.
        Until User growth finds some legs, it's likely that the stock price will continue to suffer.","Snap inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the company behind Snapchat, has been a brutal reminder about the silliness of some tech stocks. It's a prime example of ""Twitter fever"". My reference is obviously to the overvalued Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) IPO that has yielded zippo profits to anyone. The trend has carried on to Snap inc. The psychology behind this social media craze just doesn't add up to me. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)? That's a home run. The idea that it could be replicated with every social media app since just boggles my mind.Today (6/7/2017) JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) lowered their price target for Snap's 2017. The stock consequently fell 3.98%. Justified? I certainly think so. The company started out at nearly $30 a share, and lost over $2 billion in its first earnings release as a public company. You would think that the company would want to show a strong opening after its IPO to keep investors coming. Instead shareholders saw a nice diluted loss of $2.31 a share. If most of this had gone toward marketing/business expansion, it would be different. However, the majority of the money went toward compensation expenses.Hey, Evan Spiegel absolutely should get $750 million for taking his company public. He had an idea, and capitalized on it. Investors need to question how much further that idea can actually go. I question whether Spiegel is the one to run the show. When you look at his life, money has never really been a problem. No envy here. Good for him. But it doesn't always make for the best CEO's. It seems that Spiegel is more of a tech/idea guy. That's awesome when you need to make a product, but what about when you need to profit from it?Social Media stocks are all about advertising revenue. To grow that revenue you need more users. Snapchat's user growth is slowing. For many quarters, Snapchat was enjoying the luxury of double digit Daily Active User growth. Last fall, it all came abruptly down to 7% growth in Q3'16. That's quite the shift from over 17% in Q2'16. It wasn't a one-time thing either. The fourth quarter of 2016 brought a fallout to 3.2% growth, with 5% in Q1'17, things haven't improved much. So what gives? The answer is Facebook .Back in 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion. Since doing so, it has turned the photo sharing app (similar in nature to a hybrid of snapchat/twitter) into a deadly weapon. It is no coincidence that Snap's user growth fallout occurred at the same time as the introduction of Instagram stories. App popularity can shift on a dime, and as of now it currently rests in Instagrams favor. The competitor has over 700 million users. Snapchat hasn't even crossed the 200 million barrier. It's worth noting that Snapchat stories hit that number in less than six months. This is what I don't like about social media stocks. It's too easy for them to be replicated.Now some analysts are projecting the second quarter could very well continue the trend of slowing user growth. App download data shows a 22% thus far in the second quarter. That certainly doesn't bode well for what we'll see in Q2 results. Without strong user increases, I don't see how the company will increase revenue. Since they're not profitable, sales growth is crucial.For shareholders all of this should mean a great deal. They bought into a company that has a direct competitor that has taken the legs right out from under them. Facebook's Instagram is winning the war. Whether or not it will continue is yet to be seen. What can be seen is the brutal battle in Snap's future. They'll have to spend a great deal of money to out-market, out-develop, and generally outmaneuver their competitors. Their model has been copied, and is bringing in far more user growth and therefore advertising revenue. I would expect Snap's stock price to continue suffering until the tables are turned. If in fact that will ever happen.I personally am quite critical of these types of stocks. Twitter has repeatedly failed to find profits, despite having double the users of Snap. With that in mind, I tend to think there are better places to put your money than social media stocks."
4079248,101421,2017-06-06T14:17:05-04:00,"Recently IPO'd technology company Snap has acquired Placed for a reported $125 million to $200 million.Placed has developed location-based advertising analytics that help advertisers attribute offline consumer actions with online advertisements.The deal is part of a Snap strategy to continue building out its attribution tools, so it can attract and retain the advertisers critical to its business model.","Quick TakeConsumer digital company Snap (SNAP) has acquired marketing attribution technology company Placed, according to a report in GeekWire and confirmed by a Placed blog post.Placed has developed a suite of tools that infers user actions based on a number of different variables such as location. The company says it ‘is the only independent provider of directly-measured location insights, analyzing billions of locations from its opt-in audience.’It appears Snap is acquiring Placed at a decent price, especially when compared to location tech company Foursquare.I view the transaction as a positive for Snap as it continues to build out its advertising attribution capabilities which are a necessity for attracting and retaining the advertisers that drive the company’s revenue model.Target CompanySeattle, Washington-based Placed was founded in 2011 to provide marketers with mobile advertising information in order to properly attribute actions with advertisements.Management is headed by founder David Shim, who was previously Director, Operations at Quantcast, a well-known audience insight and advertising analytics firm.Below is a graphic about Placed’s technology process:(Source: Placed)The company has developed a large group of partners comprised of agencies, publishers, demand side platforms, advertising networks and out-of-home media companies.Placed raised disclosed financing of $13.4 million in three rounds from investors including Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group, Two Sigma Ventures and Shane Atchison, with its most recent funding announced in June 2014.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company has disclosed the price or terms of the deal.Various media outlets have stated the price paid was either $125 million or ‘more than $200 million.’The difference in price may be the result of contingent earn-outs. The upfront price paid may have been $125 million with potential performance earn-outs pushing the amount over $200 million.Snap hasn’t made a confirmatory statement nor has it filed an 8-K which would be required if the transaction caused a material change in financial condition, so I assume the deal was not material to Snap’s $24 billion market cap.As of March 31, 2017, Snap had $3.2 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities, against total liabilities of $306.3 million, so it would appear it has ample resources to make the buy without undue financial strain.Snap is likely acquiring Placed in order to bolster its toolset for advertisers since the majority of its revenues come from advertisements.The company generated $58.7 million revenue in 2015, but that amount jumped to $405 million in 2016 and is shooting for nearly $1 billion in 2017. So, its advertising ramp has only recently begun and advertisers are no doubt hankering for more precise data on their campaigns.The Snap platform is so new to many advertisers that without clear attribution tools it may be hamstrung in its efforts to bring more advertisers onto the system.With the deal for Placed, Snap adds an important aspect to helping advertisers learn, refine and optimize their campaigns, resulting in potentially greater spend on the platform.Placed will continue to operate as a standalone entity in Seattle, although Snap has recently expanded its footprint there, so will likely incorporate Placed into its internal organization over time.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4079552,69905,2017-06-07T12:33:47-04:00,2017 Q1 saw its revenue increase 286% YoY.The company still has huge losses.This stock is very much overvalued.,"Investment ThesisWith so much chat about Snap (NYSE:SNAP), I was eager to research further. I summarize my findings in this article.This article has the following layout: business overview, interpretation of its financials, valuation, and lastly, I will point out some investment risks.Business OverviewSnap is a camera company. Its mission statement is that it believes that reinventing the camera represents an opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate.Its 2017 Q1 results were impressive. Its revenue grew at 286% YoY, which is remarkable. The company was able to increase its Average Revenue Per User, or ARPU from $0.32 to $0.90 as of 2017 Q1. This brings up two key points. Firstly, that there is demand for its product, very strong demand indeed. Secondly, that the company has pricing power. These are similar on the surface but are actually quite different.Allow me to explain via a brief example. I have a need for a Cloud but I would not pay Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for Google Drive. I would just use one of its competitors for free. Snap, on the other hand was able to increase its ARPU by nearly three times. Which is extraordinary.Hockey stick graphsSource: 2017 Q1; 10qOn a superficial analysis of Snap, many shareholders highlight how Snap's ARPU is increasing year over year, which I will concede to be true. But these wonderful hockey stick graphs fail to address the slightly more pertinent information in the table below.Source: Snap 10-QIn 2017 Q1, Snap had huge losses of $2.2B. This was primarily because of its stock-based compensation. This amounted to $1.1B and this amount should moderate going forward. Nevertheless, a more significant concern to this author is its recurring expense coming from how it sources its revenue. As it currently stands, its payments to third party partners for hosting its products add up to more than its revenue brings in. Cost of revenue was $163m versus actual revenue which was $150m. So far, I struggle to see a viable economic business model in this IPO.IPOsSource: Cityfalcon.com; Yahoo! FinanceI got the figure above from a very interesting article which puts recent IPOs in perspective (I highly recommend the article to readers). It highlights that recent tech IPOs are cheaper in the 6 months post-IPO. Incredible. (Alphabet was the exception).Additionally, another source that comments on IPO investment failures, backed by statistics, that I recommend to shareholders is the book by renowned value investor, David Dreman, 1998 edition of Contrarian Investment Strategies.Valuation RelativeSource: morningstar.comAs a value investor, I like to see how a stock trades on a P/Sales ratio relative to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) as a starting point of what my capital could purchase elsewhere. Snap trades at 46 times compared with the S&P 500 which trades at 2 times. This tells me that a lot of optimism is already priced in to Snap. It could double its P/S ratio to 100 times or its revenue could continue to grow at 40% a year for the next several years, which I personally would not wish to bet on either event happening.DCF ValuationObviously, since Snapchat has never generated cash flows, it becomes impossible to forecast future cash flows that Snapchat might eventually generate. From an academic point of view, one can use different financial models to forecast its future FCF, but I personally find these to be unrealistic since the company does not have a track record of generating cash and any assumptions about its future cash flow capabilities are guesswork, at the moment.Investment RisksMy concern here primarily relates to competitors. How long until another, as of yet unknown company is able to source enough capital to become a serious threat to Snapchat. Or will Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which targets some of the similar markets really quit in its attempts to create a competing app to Snap's? Facebook, after all, does not lack the financial resources to encroach on Snap's market. In the event that a competitor was able to displace some of Snap's current demand, its pricing power would immediately weaken and with it its potential cash flow generation capabilities.Furthermore, currently Snapchat has very strong market share. However, millennials which the company targets are renown for being fickle. Snapchat to a large extent works off a network effect, whereby more users bring in more users. However, if the company's app loses its appeal, it would stand to lose its market share, and it could also see its revenue growth slowdown (or even fall) and with it its share price.ConclusionMy expertise lies in valuing cash-generating companies and not speculating on wonderful stories. So I cannot see why anyone would want to pay $23B for a company with no history of generating any cash and huge losses. My hope in writing this article is to add some perspective so that its shareholders might read about a different and objective review of what they own. There are many different ways to invest in the stock market. In this article, I have attempted to highlight the way I think about investing, with some small hope that it will, at least momentarily, make readers think about probably for about 10 seconds.Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions.

4080226,21136,2017-06-09T06:39:59-04:00,"Snap Inc. has three lockup period expirations, with the first two scheduled for July 31, 2017, and Aug. 31, 2017.Currently eighty-seven percent of the company's total shares outstanding are restricted from sale.We predict company insiders and VC investors will be eager to sell their holdings once restrictions are lifted; the flood of available shares could drag Snap's price down.Snap’s shares have fallen significantly following disappointing earnings, but we expect shares to fall even further with these upcoming events.We recommend investors consider selling or shorting shares ahead of the first July 31, 2017 expiration event to take advantage of likely declines.","Event Overview: Snap's Three Lockup Period ExpirationsSnap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) shares are down significantly over the last month, after the company reported disappointing first quarter earnings. We expect shares will drop even more this summer with its upcoming lock-up period expirations.Snap Inc. has three different lockup expiration periods, including a 150-day lockup expiration on July 31, 2017, a 180-day lockup expiration on Aug. 31, 2017, and a one-year lockup expiration on March 2, 2018. Currently 87.4% of Snaps 1.43B shares are restricted from sale under these restrictions. These shares are held by fourteen senior executive and directors and well as several major VC firms (shown below).Given the stock's recent disappointing performance, we predict company insiders and VC investors are eagerly awaiting the lock-up expiration for their opportunity to dump shares and cash in on gains. Despite the recent tumble, shares are still up 10.9% from its IPO price (market close 6/8). We expect further downslide around the July 31, 2017 and the August 31, 2017 dates as more shares become available for public sale.The company's first, and largest, lock-up period expires on July 31, 2017. At that time, an additional 844M shares currently restricted will be available for sale on the public market. This represents 59% of the total shares outstanding. These shares are held by fourteen senior executives and directors, as well as several notable VC investors (shown below) who we predict will be eager to sell shares. (S-1/A)On August 31, 2017, an additional 358M shares will be available for sale, representing 25% of the total shares outstanding. The shares are held by certain security holders, including its IRA, its standard form of option agreement, and its standard form of restricted stock unit agreement.Snap Inc. has an additional lock-up expiration on 50M shares (3.4% of total shares outstanding) which is set to expire one year after the offering (3.2.18). However, the restriction on these shares is not binding, and Snap Inc. reserves the right to waive any of these lock-up agreements before the period expires.(S-1/A)We reviewed Snap Inc. ahead of its IPO on our IPO Insights Platform. At the time, we recommend investors avoid the deal given the slowdown in growth, huge net losses, and high competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).We now see even more reason to be bearish on the stock given the approaching events that could put enormous pressure on share price. The stock has fallen significantly following the run-up on its first day of trading, and we predict it has much further to fall.SNAP's Early Market PerformanceWith much hype and excitement surrounding the deal, Snap's shares skyrocketed on its first day of trading. The company went public on 3.1.17, pricing its shares at $17, above its initial price range. Shares then jumped 44% on its first day of trading, finishing the day at $24.48. The share price reached a high of $27.09 per share on March 3, 2017, before plunging to $21.44 on March 7, 2017. Since then, shares have continued to slides, taking another significant dip after reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings (summarized below). Currently shares trade at $18.85 (Close 6/8).Business SummarySnap Inc. is the creator of the disappearing messaging app, Snapchat launched in 2011. Today, the company has 158M daily active users on its app who send a 2.5 billion snaps each day. In September 2016, the company began selling camera-equipped sunglasses called Spectacles. The sunglasses created much hype at the beginning as the company restricted supply to only pop-up locations in select cities. However, interest has since waned, and the company says it has not generated a significant portion of revenue from the sunglasses.The company is based in Venice, California and generated $404.5M in revenue in 2016, compared to $58.7M in 2015. Net losses are large, even by start-up standards. Net loss was $514.6M and $372.9M in 2016 and 2015, respectively.Management teamEvan Spiegel is co-founded Snap Inc., and now serves as CEO. He launched the company along with his co-founder Robert Murphy, when they were students on Stanford University. Robert Murphy serves as the company's chief technology officer.Financial Performance & First Quarter ReportThe company reported first-quarter earnings on 5.10. It reported an EPS of ($2.31) well below analyst estimate of ($0.19) and revenue of $149.65M, also well below analysts' estimate of $157.98M. It increased daily active users by 8M, reaching a total of 166M, but analysts expectations were for an increase to 168M. At the same time, net losses ballooned to $2.2B, largely due to a stock-based compensation expense. Given that much of Snap's value lies on expectations for continued explosive growth, these signs of slowdown are a significant concern for investors. In response, the stock dropped 20% after earnings reports.(Company Website)Conclusion: Sell or Short Shares Ahead of 7.31 EventWe were bearish on Snap Inc. ahead of its IPO and are even more so now, going into the summer lock-up expirations.Despite its recent tumble post disappointing earnings, Snap's stock is still up 24% from its IPO price. It appears highly overvalued relative to Facebook, and the technology industry in general.With more shares becoming available for sale, we expect to see heavy selling activity.We recommend investors consider selling or shorting shares before insiders have the opportunity to do so once restrictions are lifted. As discussed in previous articles, our firm has found abnormal negative returns in a window of time, ideally (-11, 9) days surrounding the event day (0).

4080187,39301,2017-06-09T07:00:00-04:00,"Snap Inc. sells off following analyst consensus estimate revisions and discrepancies in mobile app download data.Long-term trends in usage/monetization growth are unlikely to change by much, but lumpiness in figures does alter expectations on revenue/earnings, thus contributing to negative sentiment.Instead, we look at long-term growth drivers when emphasizing our stance on Snap Inc., which have not changed by much, but are unlikely to materialize in the next quarter.Therefore, we’re expecting the shares to trade lower on perceived risks, but when comparing our assumptions to other analysts, Snap Inc. can narrowly beat consensus estimates.As such, we’re not changing our stance, as we like the underlying business/growth narrative and still see a path to $58 (our price target) in the next 12 months.","Beware of the impending short cover rally on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the potential downside scenario from a higher share float following the expiration of lock-up seems already priced in. As of right now, Snap Inc.'s total percentage of shares short has increased to 28%.Given the discrepancy in total shares short, there's a decent likelihood the stock could rally on seemingly minor news, or slight improvements in expected earnings/sales as we progress through the year.In very few cases will you see total shares short as a percentage reach these levels. However, when the position unwinds, the stock will appreciate quite substantially over a narrow timeframe. Of course, prior to reaching that bullish inflection we're likely to trade lower, perhaps hovering closer to $15 per share.Why we continue to like Snap Inc.When compared to other large-cap peers, we generally believe the heightened bearishness isn't well warranted despite some negative data point pertaining to short interest/download data.Of course, we can acknowledge that it will take time for Snap Inc.'s DAU figures to inflect meaningfully higher, but upon doing so, the stock will likely reverse course and move higher on substantial volume.Source: Cho's Tech ResearchGiven the relatively minor penetration rate into the global installed base of smartphones, there's a lot of upside potential. This isn't a scenario where Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) growth comes at the detriment of Snap Inc., but rather both applications are more likely to co-exist alongside each other, with Snapchat retaining a niche among more savvy internet users, who have a preference towards privacy and video-based interactions.Given Snap Inc.'s relative internet/mobile penetration when compared to Facebook, we believe there's meaningful room for growth. As illustrated in the above table, Snap Inc.'s mobile penetration percentage is 3.79% (at the end of FY'16). We believe Snap Inc. can reach a mobile penetration figure of 8.15% by the year 2020. By then the global installed base of mobile smartphone users is expected to reach 5.8 billion, according to estimates by Credit Suisse (CS).This implies that Snap Inc.'s growth rate is contingent on the number of available mobile smartphone users, and its ability to convert a small portion of them. In this case, we're estimating that Snap Inc. would only need to convert 8.15% percent of the global installed base of smartphone users to reach our long-term sales/earnings targets.Therefore, Snap Inc.'s DAU growth should trend in line with its historical penetration rate, and the growth in smartphone users on global aggregate. When modeling our projections using these inputs, we believe Snap Inc. has a path towards growing its mobile DAUs to a figure above 472 million by FY'20.Source: Cho's Tech ResearchAs such, we anticipate Snap Inc.'s DAU figures to grow in line with its historical trend line. The stock likely appreciates based on usage/user growth with time spent on the application likely exceeding competing apps (given enough time).We generally view the negative narrative pertaining to saturation of certain user demos or the potential inflection in near-term downloads to be short-sighted, as near-term data points likely remain lumpy, but not indicative of long-term trends in DAU growth/expansion.Source: Barclays AmericaFrom what we can understand, Snap Inc. has expanded its presence internationally (mostly Europe). This really isn't that surprising, as ad-rates in Europe while lagging that of the USA also has the largest internet population outside of the United States and when excluding China. Therefore, we find efforts to expand into Europe a near-term driver to usage/monetization growth. However, as illustrated in the above graph from Ross Sandler over at Barclays, the ramp-up in monetization from expanding into new geographies doesn't immediately impact sales/earnings in the immediate quarters.This is because the DAU/ARPU rate in Europe is $0.76 currently, which compares to $5.83 in the United States and $0.23 in ROW (rest of world), according to Goldman Sachs (GS) data. Therefore, the incremental user contribution doesn't directly translate into immediate revenues, as the platform needs to scale its efforts to appease advertisers in these new markets with the introduction of analytics, features, and conversion metrics that are deemed reliable.Of course, this type of ramp-up will take longer to materialize. Though, we're certain that the long-term trajectory in monetization, user adoption, usage growth sounds promising. Therefore, we're patiently optimistic and wouldn't rely on near-term data to substantiate a multi-year bearish case. In fact, we're waiting for near-term headwinds as opportunities for investors to accumulate a position at a better cost basis.Consensus expectation beatable?That being the case, the near-term risks to valuation likely takes the share price lower. But upon doing further due diligence, we wouldn't join the short side of the trade as borrowing costs have increased and the trade seems overcrowded.There's much more upside when moving to a longer holding period. The fundamental thesis of buying ahead of an unexpected inflection in top/bottom line growth rates has not changed. Of course, we acknowledge that we're more optimistic on the long-term trajectory, but anticipate historical trends in internet penetration/usage growth to re-emerge given enough time.We generally think the stock is underappreciated in this environment despite the perceived risk of share lock-up.In a note released to client of JPMorgan Investment Bank, Doug Anmuth revised his estimates lower on June 5th, 2017:Snap Inc.'s revenue estimates for FY'17 were revised lower to $933 million from $1 billion, implying 144% y/y sales growth. Whereas hardware revenue or Spectacles revenue was revised lower from $118.9 million to $55.8 million.That being the case, our figures on revenue were far more conservative when compared to consensus expectations coming out of the IPO, as we estimated advertising revenue of $897 million with Spectacles contribution not included.But, when estimating contribution of 500k to 1 million Spectacle units, or appx. $65 million to $130 million to total consolidated revenue, we estimate revenue contribution of $97.5 million from Spectacles or at the midpoint of a reasonable unit shipment range.This brings our consolidated revenue figure to $994.5 million, which is just $2.5 million above current consensus estimates of $992 million.We don't need much contribution from Spectacles to reach consensus estimate figures, but we do need 750k spectacle units at an ASP of $130 to narrowly beat consensus expectations. Furthermore, our estimates on digital advertising revenue are at the low end of the range, as we already anticipate that ad-load won't increase materially and pricing to trend slightly lower, with heightened ad-load increases slightly offsetting the impact from reduced pricing.Weighing in on near-term price volatilityTherefore, we're less concerned by a miss on earnings/sales results. As current consensus estimates seem just narrowly beatable when pertaining to FY'17 revenue, though dil. EPS figures could disappoint. However, we haven't shifted to a profit-driven investment narrative, so we're not expecting bottom line misses to materially affect expectations in the near term. Though improvements in hosting costs adds incrementally to gross margins over the near term, and could alter expectations on cash burn given enough time.Source: TC 2000The stock likely trends lower to $15 per share, though volume is not very high following the recent sell-off. We owe this to the lack of available shares to short, and the heightened cost of selling on margin. As such, we don't anticipate the stock to trade much lower on heightened short interest, but to trade lower on perceived risks of share lock-up.As noted in our prior research note, we mentioned that there was a discrepancy in block holders:As such, we're wary of near-term price action and can acknowledge that the stock could trade lower on perception of heightened risk. But, given the composition of shares following lock-up expiration, we're not expecting the actual share float to improve by much.Therefore, we think the stock is attractively valued at levels below or near $15. We may need to wait until Q1'18 to see a pattern of stabilization when pertaining to sell-side expectations and execution on DAU growth. Though, when looking extremely closely at the consensus figure, we think it's narrowly beatable assuming management can execute on key areas of the business.Final thoughtsWe continue to have conviction in the long-term investment narrative when pertaining to Snap Inc. However, we can acknowledge that near-term price volatility likely takes the stock price lower before a meaningful pattern of price recovery emerges.Given the near absence of positive news it's hard to remain optimistic on Snap Inc. But, when looking constructively at long-term trends in usage/penetration and underlying appeal of the mobile app, we're maintaining our top pick designation on Snap Inc. (North America Internet stocks).We reassert our $58 price target, as we believe FY'18 results will inflect meaningfully higher as we anticipate the roll-out of new self-serve functionality and digital advertising data to drive an influx of advertising dollars. Furthermore, we're certain that usage growth among millennials and penetration into non-millennial demos will contribute to DAU figures over the foreseeable three-years. Hence we expect DAU growth to be the main driver of stock price performance when we roll into FY'18.About Cho's Technology ResearchCho's Technology Research is SA's premier technology research package that gives investors and traders an additional edge when investing into tech companies.

4078980,86776,2017-06-05T18:29:23-04:00,"Snap doesn't see itself as a social network in the same way that Facebook does.Snap identified a number of frictions that prevented millennials, most particularly, from engaging with their friends online via existing social networks.Snap turned an online social meeting spot for any ""friend"" to share content about ""friends"" into a private place for communicating with those they know and trust.","We've all heard the phrase ""don't reinvent the wheel"" - a metaphor for not wasting time perfecting a perfectly good idea that's stood the test of time, and for which improvements would add no material value. Wheels, to take the metaphor in its most literal sense, haven't been reinvented over the last thousands of years - they're still round - but they have been refined and improved continually.But that hasn't stopped innovators from trying.Remember back in 2013 when someone did, literally, try to reinvent the wheel and make them square? They never got traction - ha ha - proving the metaphor has merit, especially when taken literally.So I'm here to suggest that the best strategy for payments and commerce innovators may be not to reinvent the wheel - so not to fundamentally change something so much that it is a totally new invention - but to take a look at something much more fundamental and use modern tools and technologies to make it better.Refine, not reinvent.And I'd like to use the company founded by Miranda Kerr's new husband, Evan Spiegel, to make my point.Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has been beaten about the head and shoulders ever since it reported its first quarterly earnings a little less than 30 days ago. Following the news that its revenues failed to meet Wall Street's expectations ($149.6 million versus $159 million), that user growth has slowed (8 million new users representing 36 percent growth versus 52 percent growth) and that it would post a $2.2 billion loss (in part, due to a $750 million payout to Ms. Kerr's husband), the stock dropped 20 percent.The company that crushed its first day of trading on March 2, 2017, by closing at a 44 percent premium over its opening share price, has recovered from its post-earnings plunge. While still off its post-IPO high, Snap's market cap today is $25 billion.Not bad for a company that's younger than my border collie, Annie (she'll be seven next week), and just started selling advertising in 2014.So, before we write it off, 90 days after its IPO, remember that Facebook hit the skids shortly after its IPO in 2012 - and has recovered - so well that its market cap today is $445 billion.But I'll leave the stock market pundits to handicap Snap's stock performance. My interest in Snap was to dig into the business by looking at its S-1 (isn't that what all of you guys do on summer weekends?) to observe how innovative companies, like Snap, get off the ground.I started by asking a few avid Snap users how they would describe Snap - and why they like it.Nearly all of them said the same thing: Snap is a social network - and I like it because all of my friends use it.I found that fascinating because that's not - at all - how Snap describes its business.In fact, observing how traditional social networks operated is what prompted Snap's founders to create something different. Yes, Snap is about giving friends a place to share updates about what they are doing. And attracting and scaling a networked user base of friends is critical to monetizing its platform. But Snap doesn't see itself as a social network in the same way that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) does.Snap, on page one of its S-1 - and quite clearly on their website - describes itself as a ""camera company.""As in ""Snap Inc. is a camera company.""Period. Full stop.Here's the rest of Snap's stated mission.""We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate.Our products empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together.""Yes, they used the word ""reinvent"" but sit tight for another few hundred words, please.When I mentioned the camera mission statement to the avid Snap users I spoke with, I got a lot of scrunched up, puzzled faces in response.Of course, they use Snap to send pictures to their friends - but thinking of Snap as a camera company?That did not at all compute.The Camera Part of the Snap StoryThe first camera was invented in 1816 by a Frenchman, Nicéphore Niépce, whose wooden box could produce a picture that took a very long time to develop. Snapping pics of people or anything else in those days required hiring a photographer, having him come to a location and get his gear and his subjects ready and then processing those photos for in order to get a single picture.It would take nearly 100 years for George Eastman to turn the camera into a consumer product that produced a ""snapshot"" - a picture Kodak described as capturing a spontaneous moment in life. The Brownie camera that he first launched in 1900 - and which remained popular well into the 1960s - put that opportunity into the hands of consumers for the first time.But as Snap notes in their S-1, taking a picture in the early days of the camera was anything but an opportunity to capture a spontaneous moment.To do that, the camera needed to be within arm's reach every minute of every day, loaded and ready for action - which nine times out of 10, it wasn't. And since capturing moments in pictures was a novelty, people wanted to keep all the pictures they took.So, they had to be perfect.That meant that snapshots became a series of highly posed, ""say cheese"" moments painstakingly staged by moms and dads and aunts and uncles and grandmoms and granddads while on family vacation, at birthday parties, at the holiday dinner table, graduations, first communions, baseball games, weddings and reunions - you name it.I'm sure you have hundreds of them to prove my point.Taking those pictures also was pricey. The cost of the camera, the film and developing the film made picture-taking expensive, which also made holding on to all of those pictures a priority.So, before the smartphone hit the scene, just like the very early days of the camera, photos were taken to record moments worthy of being memorable - moments that were also mostly planned and posed.The camera, now a standard feature on every smartphone, has become, Snap's founders say, the starting point for smartphone-centric products, since they can be used to convey much more than the written word. Images provide context, convey emotion and, they say, give friends the best opportunity to share something in the moment. The smartphones that are always with consumers today can finally enable the spontaneity that George Eastman envisioned 117 years ago.Millennials, more than any other generation, have embraced that notion with both thumbs. It's been estimated that millennials will take more than 25,000 selfies in their lifetime, and they spend about an hour each week working toward that goal. Snap's user base - 62 percent of whom are between the ages of 18 and 35 - create 2.5 billion Snaps each day and use a number of creative tools to enhance how those Snaps look before they're shared with their friends.So, did Snap reinvent the camera, or how friends use their smartphone cameras to communicate with each other?The Trusted Communication Part of the Snap StoryTalking face-to-face with friends is an honest and authentic exchange of feelings and emotions between trusted parties - without being judged. Friends feel comfortable saying things to each other that they'd probably never say to strangers or want others to know they've said. Friends also trust each other to keep conversations private - knowing that the spoken word once uttered, disappears and can never be recovered.Snap's founders, in their S-1, state that today's social networks have thrown the notion of trusted, private conversations between friends to the wind. They believe that since social networks were founded on the notion of permission-less, viral sharing and creating a permanent record of the words or photos posted that are intended to be shared, they could never be a place for the authentic exchange of feelings between people.What those networks offer instead, Snap says, is a collection of posts that position people the way they want to be seen. So, instead of authentic posts and expressions, social network users get a carefully curated look at the person who's posting - or no posts at all.""Making deletion the default and permanence an option"" is how Snap would recast the notion of a place where trusted friends could share their most honest of feelings - and do it using pictures that provide a rich context as a backdrop. Knowing that messages would disappear within seconds of opening them, Snap said, would encourage a free exchange of photos without fear of reprisal, being judged or being perfect, since they were being sent between trusted friends.At the beginning, Snap's disappearing message format was seen as a magnet for sexters who would find the disappearing format ideal. But Snap's founders say theirs was a solution to a problem that consumers didn't know they had but that they had gleaned after asking 18 to 24-year-olds what they liked and didn't like about the existing social networks they used.What they learned was that everyone loved sharing photos, but no one loved the inability to remove a photo of themselves that someone else might post of them that they didn't want posted.So Snap set out to get the most self-photographed generation in history on board by creating a trusted place where friends could share their most authentic feelings and thoughts by sharing photos. In other words, replicating how those private exchanges happened in the physical world - but inside of an app and using photos and a couple of words to do it.But wait a second - how original is this?Well, it isn't, as Snap's founders readily admit. For about 125 years, the main ""social network"" was the telephone network. People used the phone to communicate with friends. By and large, people expected that their conversations would be private (the big problem was party lines where noisy neighbors could try to listen) and would disappear once they hung up. But, generally, people didn't worry about being recorded, unless they were caught up in really bad stuff that got a private detective or the government on their case.And, before the telephone, telegraph messages and private letters were pretty private too.So Snap took the ""old way of doing things,"" which everyone seemed pretty happy with, and just made it better. It didn't reinvent the notion of people communicating privately between friends without a record of that conversation, they just made it better by using new technology and tools that consumers were already using to communicate with each other.And in doing so, they pointed to a feature of existing social networks originally viewed as a virtue - but that soon became a vice and source of friction: sharing user-generated content without their permission.The Making Money Part of the Snap StorySnap admitted when it started that it had no idea how it would make money. So, it did what most consumer-facing, two-sided platforms do - build up a user base. Snap also admitted it was slow going at first, given the newness of their idea. But once Snap got a critical base of users, they began to play around with a number of monetization strategies - something that its latest earnings report shows is obviously still a work in progress.Snap makes money through advertising, having long abandoned its initial thought of charging users to add ""premium"" filters to their photos. When presented with that option, consumers simply didn't use them and also stopped using Snap to send photos to friends. Bad idea when the idea is to create a network of friends.Today, Snap makes money when publishers pay them to reach their users. That ad revenue comes in many flavors and has evolved over the years. It now includes Sponsored Creative Tools, Stories and Snap Ads, which include a video strategy that was initially met with resistance by advertisers.But here again Snap decided to adopt something that worked really well in the physical world: television advertising.TV advertising is really effective. The ads are generally entertaining - that's the only way to keep people from getting up to raid the fridge - and people hate them a whole lot less than online ads, which have gotten creepy and intrusive.So, this camera company that's not a social network has worked to recreate ""TV advertising"" on mobile devices.Snap recognized that all eyeballs were shifting away from television and desktop to a mobile-first environment - a shift that was more pronounced in the 18 to 24 demographic, who Nielsen reported spend 35 percent less time watching any television at all in any given month than that same age group did in 2010.Snap also recognized that consumers - even millennials - liked watching video ads as long as they were funny and creative. That meant that advertisers had a product that consumers, even millennials, liked but didn't have an audience to show it to despite their massive ad spend in the television segment.Snap approached advertisers with their story of millennial engagement, and advertisers bought in, but balked at the idea that they'd have to reformat those ads for a vertical format.Snap held its ground, proving through tests that consumers viewing video in a vertical format meant more consumers watching ads through to the end. Holding a phone vertically is the most natural way to consume content. And it also held its ground on the type of content that it allowed publishers to put on its platform. You'd be hard pressed to find ""fake news"" on Snap.But did Snap really reinvent TV advertising? Or simply give advertisers a new place for consumers to consume the ads they were already creating?The What You Can Learn Part of the Snap StoryPerhaps you think I'm parsing words, and one (wo)man's reinvent is another (wo)man's refine - and that investors pay more for companies that reinvent instead of refining.Point taken.But call it what you wish.Snap didn't invent a new camera - OK, there are those video specs which no one seems too enthusiastic about - but they identified a number of frictions that prevented millennials, most particularly, from engaging with their friends online via existing social networks.Creating that experience was about replicating the things that friends valued most when communicating face-to-face: privacy, non-permanence and the ability to be authentic and honest in what was said - and use a better wheel, called the mobile device, to make it better.Doing that allowed them to refine a better wheel for advertisers too - the ability to create entertaining TV-style advertising that consumers always enjoyed watching but just didn't anymore since they are abandoning television.Ironically, by doing all of this, they really did reinvent the notion of the modern day social network - turning an online social meeting spot for any ""friend"" to share content about ""friends"" into a private place for communicating with those they know and trust, in much the same way as they would if they were together face-to-face.What can payments and commerce innovators learn from this?Well, that reinventing something doesn't always mean that consumers will like it or that it will end up creating the outcome for which you had originally hoped. Sometimes reinvention creates more friction, which may be what happened with social networks, and maybe what happened with mobile payment schemes that were as fast as cards but couldn't be used at as many places.Sometimes the best future is starting with the best of the past and making it better. Which is what Snap believes it's doing with ephemeral communications and TV-like advertising.At about the same time that George Eastman was showing the world what a camera could do, most of the people who bought those cameras went into their favorite store and bought it from a salesperson who knew their name and just put it on their tab. They walked out, camera in hand, bill to be settled later. They had the nirvana of payments experiences way back then.Some might have even gone home and called their friends to tell them what they just bought.Without leaving a trace."
4078179,101693,2017-06-01T16:40:30-04:00,"The markets are at all-time highs.Snap is grossly overvalued.Although valuation from Snap's financials is challenging, we can use Twitter as a benchmark.Going long Snap at these levels doesn't compensate any investor for the risks he/she assumes.Shorting the stock is not practical, but using derivatives can be a good alternative.","Recently, the stock market hit all-time highs. Both the PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) and S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) have performed remarkably well the last few months. I attribute this in great part to President Trump's expected tax cuts and investments in infrastructure, defense, etc.The last few weeks, we've seen the Trump rally slow down. After all, it went up in the hope of such policies taking effect, and it makes sense it now will wait to see them take place. I don't want to make this a political article, but it has become clear that this will take longer than initially expected.On top of that, we have added risks of Trump's tweets, OPEC not living up to their agreement, North Korea testing nuclear missiles, Russia's alleged influence in the 2016 election, rate hikes, etc.(Source: Trump at G7 Summit - credit Reuters)All in all, the market should take a breather from the Trump rally. Earnings were good, but not stellar and in the case of Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), they were terrible. So you have to ask yourself: What are the catalysts to take this market higher? What are the incentives to bring it lower?In my opinion, the good stuff we see down the road, the market has already priced in. But the many risks we know of at this moment seem to be ignored. Almost as if nothing could go wrong in the world. And this feeling has contaminated SNAP's valuation as well, just take a look at its valuation metrics:How do you justify this valuation? Is SNAP going to grow so much (and so fast) that it makes sense to pay such a premium? I don't think so.TAKE A LOOK AT TWITTERAlthough Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) and SNAP are completely different businesses, they both sell ads and depend on their user base to make money. But the point is, Twitter after a few years of having its IPO is already seeing its growth slowdown and it has barely reached $3 billion in revenues.So SNAP to justify its current valuation has to grow more and faster than TWTR did, and even then it would probably deserve a little bit more of a discount from its current price.(Source: Company 10-Qs / Elaboration: Seeking Alpha Author Kwan-Chen Ma)I loved this graphic by Kwan-Chen Ma because it points out the biggest problem with SNAP's valuation, it's almost impossible for it to increase its revenues at the pace required for it to be profitable as an investment. DAUs (Daily Active Users) are already growing just in single digits since late 2016.Let's just think about this exercise; say SNAP grows faster than TWTR did regarding revenues. In this case, TWTR went from $660 million in revenues to $2.53 billion (2013-2016). That is a 57% annual growth rate for sales, which is good, but still the stock crashed because it had baked into its valuation even better growth.Now, in the case of SNAP, we have $400 million in revenues for 2016 and say in the next three years it outgrows TWTR by twofold. So that would mean that by 2019, it would have sales of $5 billion, which translates to a 96% annual growth rate for sales.And we know now what multiple pays the market for TWTR after its astounding growth of 57%:So, let's just see what SNAP would be worth if we use this data as inputs and come up with a proportional valuation for it in 3 years from now.(Source: Author's elaboration)That is your best-case scenario in my view, which is good. But you can probably achieve similar returns with less exposure to volatility with a simple value investment approach and a buy and hold strategy (a topic for another article).Now let's look at your ""realistic"" scenario. I put it in quotes because I'm still really generous here since SNAP's direct competitor is the behemoth Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Assume that despite fighting against Mark Zuckerberg for ad revenue, SNAP manages to grow just as much as Twitter did.(Source: Author's elaboration)As you can see, the results are pretty bad, you'd lose some cash every year and eventually, 31% of your investment in 3 years. But let's look at the worst scenario; say it only achieves 75% of what Twitter did.(Source: Author's elaboration)In this case, you'd get killed by going long Snap, and that's just assuming it doesn't quite perform as good as Twitter did since its IPO. You'd lose almost 60% of your investment (Twitter also got a 60% drop from its highs). As I said, this might happen because unlike Twitter, Snap is competing directly with Facebook.So let's put it all together and get a better idea of what investing in SNAP means:(Source: Author's elaboration)In the table above, I present the weighted average of each scenario by its probability of occurrence. Naturally, this likelihood of occurrence is discretionary. For this exercise, I gave it a 33% chance to each scenario.Of course, you can play around with the probability of occurrence for each situation and come up with a different expectancy for investing in SNAP. However, I'd argue given its risks and opportunities, it's fair to give it 33% to each.However, we can count on the market to give us its opinion, for that we should look at SNAP's options and implied volatility. From that data, we can construct a normal distribution for SNAP stock by 2019. The results might surprise longs that are waiting for this stock to hit $50 a share by next year:(Source: Author's elaboration based on the implied probabilities of SNAP's options market)Options are useful for calculating probabilities. As you can see, my best and worst scenario align relatively close with the market's implied expectations. Incidentally, if you follow the same methodology, you can calculate the odds of Snap's stock reaching $50 or more by next year (2018) to be just 6.45%The expected values derived from the implied volatility of the stock validate my valuation model, but more importantly, it reveals that the market is indeed expecting that at best SNAP can just double the sales of TWTR. This is why it prices SNAP's IV in such a way that the normal distribution of possible future prices resembles my predicted values of each scenario.(Source: Author's elaboration based on Snap's options implied volatility)DEBUNKING THE BEST-CASE SCENARIOAs it has been pointed out above in the article, the market is implying a valuation by 2019 projecting that by that year, snap will have twice the revenue that Twitter has now. I will argue that such a proposition is irrational since DAUs' growth rate is already slowing down and will inevitably have a negative impact on Snap's revenue going forward.(Source: Snap's Quarterly Report / Author's elaboration)From here, we can calculate how many DAUs are to be expected by 2019. With that data, we can multiply it by the ARPU of a benchmark. In this case, I've chosen Snap's current ARPU (which should increase) and also Facebook's and Twitter's.(Source: Twitter's and Facebook's ARPU/Author's elaboration)Furthermore, using those projected revenues for Snap by 2019, we can also infer what Snap's market capitalization will be from different Price/Sales multiples. I'll go ahead and continue using Facebook's and Twitter's as benchmarks.(Source: Author's elaboration)It's evident from the figure above that the market is pricing that Snap will perform much better than Twitter did concerning revenue growth. In fact, it has to carry out a very similar feat to Facebook and become a behemoth itself to justify its current valuation.This, in my opinion, is just plain irrational. Facebook is in direct competition for advertising revenue with Snap. Facebook has every competitive advantage you can think of, and Snap has almost none. Facebook can copy Snap, has enough cash to cut prices and halt Snap's ARPU growth, has enough capital to buy new companies and technologies to intensify competition, etc.And what happens if indeed Mark Zuckerberg makes his mission to drive Snap out of business? Obviously, Snap's costs are going to rise, and revenues slow down. As a consequence, ARPUs should slow down too. Let me translate that scenario into numbers for you.(Source: Author's elaboration)As you can see, Snap's valuation hinges on the following suppositions:Any of these factors goes wrong, and Snap will soon see its share price cut.In fact, I think Twitter has more of a moat than Snap since Facebook can just steal whatever Snap is doing. So it wouldn't be that crazy to assume that FB is going to end up completely halting any future growth Snap can gain. As shown earlier, growth is already showing some signs of slowing down due to competition with Facebook (Instagram stories being a prime example).How can it possibly perform any better than Twitter while competing directly with Facebook? I think it can't because of the reasons listed above. Its current price is due in part to a dull IPO season and pure animal spirits. But, fair value and stock prices eventually meet. Often violently.On the other side, if you were to sell the stock, you'd have a 10-cent profit per dollar invested (sold) as I calculated earlier. In a way, this is what the IPO underwriters did if you think about it. Pretty good deal for them. How can you get that too? Read on.TAKING IT FROM THERE(Source: Facebook's, Twitter's, Instagram's and Snapchat's logos)What do you do with all of this information?If you just sit on the sidelines, I wouldn't blame you; volatility on stocks like SNAP can be very dangerous for both the long and short side.However, if you're feeling a little adventurous and practice proper risk management, you can bet on SNAP's downside by selling calls. I'd argue that you can get some free premium by selling OTM calls with three weeks until expiration, and if the worst happens and the stock rises, you would be net short on an excellent entry plus some cash from the options sold. Not too bad.If you sold a few calls (less than 1% of your portfolio) betting that the stock won't break $22.30 a share and anything below that is profit. Look up the Jun 16 '17 21.50 Calls, you'd get about $0.60 in premium, and worst-case scenario, you get to be short the stock with a $22.10 entry point, which is decent from a technical analysis perspective.You could also do a Bear-Call Spread, which would limit your downside and your upside. Personally, since we would be talking about a small exposure, you'd be OK with just shorting the calls.Why those calls? Because they give you just enough credit and the expiration is not that far away, although at the end of the day, it's up to your risk tolerance.(Source: www.stockcharts.com/Author's elaboration)As you can see, it'd be a nice short entry point at those levels. Since the exposure is somewhat limited, you could easily average down your cost basis and sell some more calls if I needed it. All up to a maximum exposure of about 2-3% in the portfolio, this is reasonably manageable.As a strategy, every factor aligns well for such a trade. Macroeconomic data is sluggish and turning negative, the market is at an all-time high, Snap's valuation is grossly generous, and from a technical standpoint, your short entry would be ideal.In any case, I wouldn't recommend having a big exposure to SNAP. It can be a wild ride, up or down. But dabbling into some short calls could be very nice for those who can tolerate the additional risk.IS SNAP ANY GOOD?Yes. It's a great company with excellent growth prospects in the future. We all know that. This topic has been explored many times in the past already. But in my view, it's grossly overvalued. These sorts of valuations are somewhat reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. After all, it hasn't produced a dime in profits either.As I've pointed out earlier, even if everything went as expected with SNAP, your compensation would only be about 15% return per year. Is that enough for the inherent risks of speculative tech stocks while the market is at all-time highs?I'll leave that to you.Naturally, if you think Snap Inc. is going to become the next Facebook, then this stock is for you. I went ahead and calculated your expected annual return to be about 43% for the next three years. Such returns would be incredible. Although, given the intense competitive pressure and risks Snap is currently facing, you have to be smoking a lot of hopium to believe that.ELEVATOR PITCH/CONCLUSIONEven if SNAP's business model is sound, you've got to worry about:I hope you found the article interesting, and if you have any questions, I'd love to hear your take on it.I wish everyone, regardless of bias, the best of luck."
4078145,101429,2017-06-01T14:41:19-04:00,"Mary Meeker's Annual Internet Trends Report was released on Wednesday, and presents several insights on Snapchat's current and future standing.While the app is strong in user engagement and content, it suffers in providing adequate analytical metrics to advertisers.Snapchat is the beneficiary of positive macro trends taking place in the advertising industry.","Although I have covered Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) extensively, this is the first post-IPO article I've written on Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP). I've held back to research the company, see varying viewpoints, and await new data on the company. As of this Wednesday, we now possess new data on Snapchat and its future prospects, courtesy of Mary Meeker's annual Internet Trends Report. Amongst the 355 slides in her report, I've gleaned four useful insights that apply specifically to Snapchat. Here are my key takeaways:1. Engagement is strong and getting stronger.In 2016, we learned that the average Snapchat user was spending 25-30 minutes on the app. Founder and CEO Evan Spiegel revealed this statistic at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference to woo investors. Keeping his motive in mind, I'm assuming the figure was closer to 25 than 30. If I had to guess, the stat probably hovered around 27 minutes. From Meeker's report, the 2017 figure is now exactly at 30 minutes. This would indicate a healthy 11.1% increase in engagement YoY.At 30 minutes a day, Snapchat's level of engagement is impressive given the shorter nature of its content. Snapchat leads Instagram (21 minutes), but continues to trail Facebook (50) in this metric. Advertising revenues for companies like Snapchat and Facebook have three drivers of growth; increase in users, pricing, and ad load. Snapchat's growing engagement directly benefits its ability to increase ad load, and thus revenues.Meeker discusses the gamification of different industries, and notes that Snapchat has even had success in gamifying their ads. A Snap Gatorade ad game was well-received, garnering an average of 196 seconds in playing time. For advertisers, this level of engagement is highly desired and could be expanded as a way of delivering ads.2. Original content is starting to rival TVSnapchat's investment in original content is receiving a noticeable amount of viewers. Original ""shows"" such as Phone Swap and Second Chance brought in 10 million and 8 million viewers, respectively. These are numbers that rival and even surpass average TV programming. These types of numbers are key to luring in big brands for advertising deals.As a caveat, it should be noted that video views on social media are typically tallied rather liberally. Many digital platforms count a ""view"" as any time spent watching the content, however brief that time may be. Still the numbers are impressive and further display Snap's robust engagement metrics.3. ROI Measurement ToolsThis is a weak spot for Snap, but could also be viewed as opportunity for growth. Meeker's report finds that the number one challenge digital marketers face is ROI Measurement. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook have been two of the best at delivering campaign performance metrics, which is part of the reason they generated 85% of the growth in digital advertising this year.Several digital marketers have made it known that they are unsatisfied with Snapchat's current analytical offerings. Many ROI metrics need to be manually computed, which is inconvenient and comes at a large time cost. There are third party applications that track analytics, but these services are subscription-based and expensive.Snapchat is currently not doing enough to provide ROI metrics, but this presents a growth opportunity if the issue is resolved.Putting it in ContextSnapchat is performing well in regards to its level of user engagement. However, this represents just one pillar of revenue growth. User growth has slowed dramatically, especially for a company that still has a relatively small base of users. Snap isn't getting a boost in growth from pricing power either, we saw that they began offering discounts to advertisers earlier in May. Most disappointing in Snap's recent earnings report was the 14% decline in ARPU to $0.90. Although Q4 is a larger spending period for advertisers than Q1 typically is, as a young and ""quickly growing"" company, Snap should not be seeing a Q/Q ARPU decline as large as 14%.For comparison, Facebook saw a quarterly decline of 13% in ARPU in the same period. While not a huge improvement, a large portion of Facebook's new users are located in less lucrative ad markets, which contributed toward the decline (Asia Pacific's ARPU for Q4 16 was $2.07, while the United States and Canada generated $19.81 per user).One of the positive signs from Meeker's report is that Snap is set to benefit from macro trends in the advertising market. From 2016 to 2021, researchers expect advertising spend to more than double. Mobile advertising will see a favorable bump, collecting 70% of the online spend compared to its current 48% share. Facebook has already noted that ad load on its core product will cease to significantly grow. This will drive up demand for Facebook ads, and subsequently prices. Snapchat could stand to benefit from advertisers who are driven away by Facebook's price increases.ConclusionAt Snap's current valuation, I would not recommend the stock to investors. The potential is certainly there as evidenced by healthy engagement and positive macro trends, but Snapchat must first fix its user growth and ROI measurement tools before I take a more serious look at the company. In my opinion there are simply better investment opportunities out there.Feel free to head over to my profile and give me a follow while you're there!Author's Note: I encourage you to follow me as I cover a wide variety of current topics, with a special interest in the technology, retail, and entertainment industries."

To this end, during Q1 the company continued to increase sales and marketing expense. The investment topped $56 million, up from $47 million in the previous quarter. For comparison, the Q1'16 spend was $13 million. During the first quarter conference call Spiegel positioned the issue as follows:Company detractors, including Seeking Alpha contributors that recommend that the stock should be shorted point to flattening user growth, competitive pressure from Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram and a high price-to-sales ratio. To best determine which camp is right, it is necessary to decide where revenue growth is going. However, there is a large amount of noise in the revenue numbers such as the Olympics in Q3'16, the general seasonality of advertising businesses and the acceleration and cementing of the sales plan. Following the Q2 conference call, likely held in August, one can better evaluate if revenue growth is accelerating. Waiting through August also offers insight into how the stock will trade as the majority of the lock-ups end.-Source: Q1 2017 Earnings ReportRevenuesWhile useful to look at average revenue per user data, one must recall that these statistics are primarily a function of total sales. Growth in revenues and average revenues are driven by sales rather user growth or ad load limits. Consider the following definitions from Snap:In fact, ad service against engagement is likely low, especially outside the U.S. On the Q1 earnings call Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer forwarded the following:Source: Q1 2017 Earnings ReportSo with engagement high and ad load low, the prime revenue factor is the quality of the ad products and how well Snap can measure and market a differentiated advertiser ROI. For those who have not used Snapchat or purchased advertising, the following links provide an interesting introduction to basic product offerings and measurement tools: Snapchat.com/ads & Snapchat.com/ads/measurement.If one attempts to remove the Q3 Olympics bump and fourth quarter seasonality, a $25-$30 million quarterly increase in revenues appears average. Extrapolating would put Q2 revenues at $177 million. And additional gains should come from three factors:Note that analyst revenue predictions range from $154 to $216 million with a $193 million average.Quick Word On CostsHeadlines following the Q1 earnings report focused the company's $2.2 billion loss. Though only included in unadjusted earnings, about $2.0 billion of the headline loss came from recognition of stock-based compensation. CFO Drew Vollero outlined the large reduction in SBC expenses going forward:TakeawaySnapchat displays robust engagement and relatively low ad load. If Snap does have a better mousetrap, we will begin to see advertisers follow a clearer path in the August report. For the growth story to remain intact, revenues should reach a quarterly record near $185 million with approximately 173 million DAU yielding a $1.07 ARPU."
4078135,20683,2017-06-01T14:13:24-04:00,"Identifying a bubble is not the same as quantifying one.Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Company defined a bubble as a ""two standard deviation"" occurrence.The problem with the two standard deviation story? A financial blob can get even larger before it bursts.","When an asset class (e.g., stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, collectibles, etc.) skyrockets in price - when it surges higher without sufficient economic reason - a bubble develops. Technology stocks in the late 1990s. Housing in the mid-2000s. When the asset class inevitably nose-dives? The balloon implodes.Speculative silliness has not been difficult for me to spot. As a national talk radio personality in the late 1990s, I warned stock investors not to get carried away by dot-com madness. A ""New Economy?"" More like a new catchphrase. As a financial blogger with a popular web site in the mid-2000s, I cautioned readers not to get caught up in property price insanity. Forty percent more to own than rent? Absurd.Of course, identifying a bubble is not the same as quantifying one. If the identification is going to have meaning, there needs to be a way to measure the magnitude of a financial blister.With respect to market-based securities, at least, Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Company (GMO) researched 40 bubbles and discovered that prices surpassed two standard deviations on each occasion. More telling, asset prices reverted back to long-term averages in every circumstance. Based on their research, the money management firm defined a bubble as a ""two standard deviation"" occurrence.The problem with the two standard deviation story? A financial blob can get even larger before it bursts. Or it may act more like an unsightly cyst, biding time and waiting for something or someone to drain it.Perhaps not surprisingly, GMO's Jeremy Grantham has started to doubt his own understanding of stock market bubbles. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he described the current environment as ""decently different"" from other 2-sigma events. His reasoning? An absence of euphoria.Granted, my dentist isn't asking me about plopping a big chunk of his Rollover IRA dollars into Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP). That said, investor equity allocation at 67.5% is near other speculative tops of 70% at a time when stock valuations are two standard deviations above the mean.Aren't GMO's original findings (i.e., two standard deviations) powerful enough on their own? Might an investor want to take a little less risk when traditional valuations are pushing rarefied air? Or should one ignore the mathematical signs until anecdotal evidence of frenzy appear?Keep in mind, it's not as if jubilation has been missing altogether. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Survey hit a 15-year high in February (114.8). Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) - often called the ""fear gauge"" - has been registering 21st century lows. The upbeat consumer, the lack of fear via the VIX (10) and the elevated investor allocation to stock (67.5%) may be a bit more euphoric than Grantham recognizes.Here's another reason to rethink the whole euphoria notion: real estate. For the 4th straight year, Gallup found that Americans strongly favor real estate over competing long-term investments (i.e., savings/CDs, gold, bonds, stocks/mutual funds). That lines up relatively well with clients whom I speak with regularly. Indeed, anecdotally speaking, more people are talking about their real estate net worth than their 401k balances.So if euphoria were the key element in speculative balloons, wouldn't soaring property values alongside giddy investors imply a foamy real estate market? The evidence, however, suggests otherwise.Consider inflation-adjusted housing via the S&P/Case Shiller Home Price Index. The ""real"" property bubble that escalated out of control in the mid-2000s and that preceded the prior recession (12/07-5/09) exists in stark contrast to current conditions.Another way to look at the data is to compare nominal home prices to nominal household income (median). The average ratio for the quarter century that preceded the parabolic housing boom (2001-2006) was 2.4. At the 2006 top? 4.0. Here in 2017, with the Home Price Index at 186.95 (x 1000) and median household income at $59,361 (April), the ratio is 3.1. A strong case can be made that home prices are overvalued. Nevertheless, prices remain far below the ""bubblicious"" peak in 2006.Sure, there's the senselessness of Silicon Valley in San Jose and there's a boom in job friendly Texas. Wolf Richter demonstrates the changes between the housing bubble of mid-2000 and housing prices today in Dallas in the chart below. And while the data is NOT adjusted for inflation, adjusting for the real value of dollars (17%) still would not justify the price surge occurring in some areas of the country. What's more, Richter wonders aloud if a housing bubble only exists when an inflation-adjusted point that destroyed the financial system has been surpassed.Overvalued real estate or bubbly real estate, I believe that U.S. stocks have far more in common with champagne. If the long-term average valuation (PE10) for the stock market is 16.5, then today's PE10 of 29.5 represents two standard deviations. The two-sigma event can be seen across several other important indicators, including price-to-sales (P/S) as well as market cap-to-GDP (a.k.a. ""The Warren Buffett Indicator."")Moreover, there's plenty of stock market euphoria in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google/Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Those who have dared to bet against their unstoppable rise have been mutilated. How does GMO's Grantham square the apparent unconstrained ardor for ""FANG"" stocks?Without question, the stock market is more worrisome than real estate. Nearly one-third of Russell 2000 companies have posted negative earnings for the last 12 months. Meanwhile, even the notion that larger corporations are remarkably profitable is flawed. S&P 500 GAAP earnings per share came in at $100.4 in the first quarter of 2017. The S&P 500 trades at 2420. Yet S&P 500 GAAP earnings were slightly better at $100.85 three years ago at this time, and the index traded at 1960.In essence, the S&P 500 has risen 23.5% over three years from an elevated P/E of 19.4 to a stratospheric P/E of 24.5 on zero earnings growth. And that is not indicative of euphoria? Perhaps one would like to point to interest rates. The 10-year yield was roughly 2.5% at this point in 2014; the 10-year yield is approximately 2.25% now. Clearly, there is no meaningful differences in stimulus to suggest ultra-low borrowing costs justify the ascent.Truthfully, corporate debt is an issue that deserves more attention as well. The current corporate-debt-to-GDP ratio at 45%-plus sits near the same record high leverage that preceded the three previous recessions. Equally worth of note, corporate capacity to meet its interest payments continues to fade. The fact that declining interest coverage ratios preceded the last two recessions, alongside Fed withdrawal of monetary stimulus, hardly paints a pretty picture going forward.Even members of the Federal Reserve Open market Committee see trouble on the horizon. Recent meeting minutes revealed the members sense that ""equity prices are quite high relative to standard valuation measures."" Yes, quite. Not that they'd call it a bubble or even dream about pricking its surface for fear of causing a stampede for the exits.Perhaps most vexing is the reality that, over longer periods of time, financial assets cannot grow up and above economic growth indefinitely. Neither can debt. Yet both the growth rate for credit (a.k.a. debt) as well as the growth rate for key financial assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) have far surpassed the expansion of our economy via our gross domestic product (GDP). And it simply will not last.The fact that I have had a lower allocation to stock (50%) than normal (70%), as well as a higher allocation to cash equivalents (25%) than normal (0%-5%), has been trying since the beginning of 2015 (12/18/2014). Far more so since the election, of course. Prior to the election, the S&P 500 suffered two 10%-plus corrections and failed to make price progress over a 22-month period (12/19/2014-10/18/2016).Nevertheless, there are times when waiting for future opportunities in cash and/or preserving capital are more critical than shorter-term victories. As Tom Petty sang, ""The waiting is the hardest part."" It may very well be. Yet ultimately, patience pays out some of the best dividends that investing has to offer.Disclosure: Gary Gordon, MS, CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial, Inc., a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC.

        If SNAP can earn the trust of advertisers, investors will have no choice but to buy.","Shares of Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), the parent of popular messaging app Snapchat, have surged as much as 25% since falling to its post-earnings low of $17.59. Arguments were made that the 24% decline Snap suffered following its first-ever earnings report earlier this month was an overreaction.But the bears are now proclaiming the recent bounce in SNAP stock, which puts the shares at 25% above their IPO price, is even more of an overreaction. This is because the shares are also well above the company's price-book ratio of $17.6. But few high-growth companies are trading at their book value. From my vantage point, SNAP stock, which is now above its 50-day moving average, is heading back to $24 per share, closing the gap it created on the first-quarter earnings disappointment.How social media companies should be valued has long-been an issue for analysts. There's no question Snap must continue to prove its mettle in the social media space before staking a claim in the advertising market currently dominated by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). They're going to have to put up some extraordinary growth numbers over the next couple of years in order to justify their current valuation and support multiple expansion.That's going to be a tall order, given that Snap CEO Evan Spiegel faces fierce competition from Facebook, which has ""flattered"" Snap by ""modeling"" some of Snapchat's features into its own products. In that regard, I give Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tons of credit. It's no different than the intense ""admiration"" Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Bill Gates had for each other's products at the dawn of the computer age.And in case you haven't noticed, both Apple and Microsoft are doing pretty okay today. While I won't predict SNAP will be around for five decades, the idea that it is a dead company after one quarter goes far beyond idiotic. I expect SNAP, despite its high and arguably expensive valuation, to follow the early paths of Facebook. After the first quarter earnings dip, which was borne on exaggerated expectations, SNAP should demonstrate that it has a viable business model that can garner enough of the advertising market to make the current Facebook/Alphabet duopoly less of a thing.To that end, SNAP has begun to flex some muscle by getting aggressive with its advertising and getting revenue moving in the right direction. SNAP is reportedly offering ad buyers discount coupons and incentive to help get ad revenue up, according to Digiday. SNAP is giving a discount of about 10% percent, which isn't a huge discounts, but advertisers who are looking to attract users are under the age of 34, are poised to take the plunge. At the same time, SNAP could be pressuring Facebook to lower its own prices.Dididay's report notes that these 10% off promotions began in the middle of May and are expected to run through mid-June, which is when Snap's second quarter comes to a close. And what better way for the market to value SNAP as it does Facebook than to show that it can get revenues and earnings growth accelerating again.In short, the drubbing SNAP took after the company reported first quarter earnings results that showed that SNAP has a long way to go to earn the market's trust. But if SNAP can earn the trust of advertisers, investors will have no choice but to buy. As such I expect SNAP stock to reclaim $24 per share by the time the company announces second quarter results."
4076377,102603,2017-05-25T06:52:21-04:00,Snapchat has a Twitter problem.Which is a combo of quickly slowing user adoption.Coupled with advertisers that can't wrap their heads around the potential returns (ROI) of using the platform.,"Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) has not fared well since its IPO - or at least not how many investors expected. The stock came out hot, but quickly regressed after a poor earnings report.Of course, the big question becomes, does this represent a buying opportunity or is it a signal of worse things to come?The IPO EffectSince the IPO, SNAP's shares have fallen from a from nearly $30 to hovering around $20 today. However, we have seen this before with other IPOs, and it could be the ""norm"" these days. That brings about a bigger question, why does anyone bother investing in IPOs?More often than not, in recent times - (Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) anyone?), the share price trajectory is downward after peaking in the months following the IPO. This comes as valuations are ridiculously high and the growth projections become unrealistically astronomical.This has been played out many times, to the point that investors should start catching on to the IPO fallacy. Sure, there are exceptions - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is probably one of the most famous. So how do you tell which companies might actually be a keeper, when Wall Street is hyping the latest and greatest?Or, specifically related to SNAP, how do you decide if this is the beginning of a continued selloff - being the next Twitter - or an excellent buying opportunity?Snap's IPO report should've been a telltale for many investors, as even the owners could foresee great risk. For instance, it was clearly noted that a drop off in user growth could affect revenue - which is exactly what happened. Since SNAP is a growth stock, analysts have slammed it for lack of growth.So, perhaps, it's useful to remember that the stock market was created using old school values. In other words, companies which offer good products or services and have smart management are likely to succeed. And so are the investors who buy stock in them. Let's stack SNAP up against that criteria.It's understandable that investors could be lured to a company with a product that is so popular and innovative. Yet, before risking hard-earned cash, dig deep to understand whether the market is understanding growth, or is a stock seemingly cheap for a reason.Does it fill a need?Snapchat gained enormous popularity because there was no other product available at the time which offered the same features. However, a crucial fundamental component is fending off competition. Since Facebook-owned Instagram now offers pretty much all of the features Snapchat does, and more, how does that affect Snapchat's future?The fact that Instagram has become such a massive competition in a relatively short period means that SNAP management needs to be more skilled than ever.But is management skilled enough to make/keep its company successful?One of the most important responsibilities of any management team is to figure out a way to create customer loyalty. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) kept their formula secret so customers couldn't get the same drink anywhere else. Uber, on the other hand, has abused its clients and drivers so much that both will switch, if convenient.The drop in Snapchat's user growth seems to indicate that fewer Instagram users are switching over because there is simply no need to. As well, it's just not appealing to a braider audience. The core demographic of Snapchat users - teens and 20s - is notoriously fickle, which is a combination for continued disappointment in user growth for Snapchat.The sliver lining: Can it be profitably monetized?This was a lot easier to answer before the existence of the internet. One of the biggest problems digital companies faced for many years was how to monetize their services, because so many of them were offered for free and ads could be easily blocked.Once more, Snapchat's demographic is working against it. Even though the company has excelled at targeting a very hard to reach demographic, users of that age simply do not have a lot of disposable income. That means some advertisers won't see the use in even giving Snapchat a chance. As well, tracking ROI on Snapchat for advertisers is nearly impossible.Bottom LineIt's hard to imagine a scenario, especially given how things have faired since is IPO, where Snap could make a long-term comeback. Even if the company manages to create a new, wildly popular feature, chances are Instagram or other apps could replicate it. And, in the meantime, Snapchat's current user base could very well outgrow it. At this point, there seems to be more factors working against SNAP, than for it.Although most of the $2.2 billion the company lost in the last quarter was for a non-cash, one-time charge, the all-important user growth numbers seem to ""bear"" that out. I want to see more from Snapchat in how to convince (1) new users to give Snapchat a chance (2) advertisers to try out the platform and give them a tangible way to track just how well the ads do - two things that Twitter failed at, hence the reason their stock price has steadily fallen from nearly $70 a share to the mid-teens - where it appears stuck. Snapchat looks to be more like the next Twitter than the next Facebook."
4076329,50452,2017-05-25T00:25:04-04:00,"A report by Digiday is claiming that SNAP Inc. is offering strong incentives to advertisers in order to boost revenues in time for Q2 earnings.
        This is troublesome for investors because it signals more trouble to come in Q2 earnings, and hurts margins in the process.
        SNAP Inc. still needs to answer to the challenge of stiff competition from Facebook, specifically in the form of Instagram.
        This seems like an act of desperation - something a start up such as SNAP Inc. should not be acting on this early in the game.","Early Wednesday evening, Digiday published a report on Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP). This report found here, claims that Snap Inc. is offering incentives such as bonuses, credits, and discounts in order to book ad buys carried out in Q2. This is being interpreted as an effort to boost revenues in Q2 - a response to an ugly Q1 earnings report that sank shares 20% upon news of the quarter breaking. This is troublesome for investors for a number of reasons. The Digiday report pushed shares of Snap Inc. 1.12% lower in after hours trading. Investors should be cautious after this report, as Q2 could represent more of the same pain investors felt in Q1.From the article:The first and most obvious ""red flag"" about this, is that it either acknowledges that second quarter figures are on track for another disappointment, or that management is lacking confidence to the point of intervening with these aggressive tactics. The timing of these incentives - being built around getting revenues billed out in time to be captured in the second quarter, is a give away that SNAP is still having trouble ""getting things off of the ground"" and running.To recap, SNAP Inc. had a terrible first quarter as a publicly traded company. Earnings missed by $2.12 per share, revenue missed by $8.33M, and user data metrics were below expectations across the board. This has no doubt placed a lot of pressure on SNAP inc. to perform in the near future. A start up such as SNAP is growing, and will not likely be profitable in the early going, but the earnings miss was huge, and money is being lost at an increasing rate. If SNAP continues to burn cash at this rate, another equity offering could eventually be on the table.Additionally, the aggressive push to discount revenues will hurt in the long run as SNAP risks establishing pricing precedents at lower than desired prices. We don't know the degree of discounting, or the ratio of total revenues being discounted because it has reportedly varied on a ""case by case"" basis. However a start up company that is losing money can ill afford to further contract margins. Ad revenue per user in Q1 was already down from last quarter.At the end of the day, this move smells of desperation on SNAP's behalf. The social media start up must still figure out the challenge of Facebook (NYSE: FB) touting similar services to users. First with Instagram Stories, and secondly with its own ""stories"" feature on its news feed. The onus is on SNAP Inc. to both grow, and become profitable. The presence of an established competitor in Facebook successfully offering a competing product is ominous for SNAP. Facebook owned Instagram by the way, has already surpassed Snapchat in daily active users. This was accomplished in a short span of roughly 8 months. It is hard to take SNAP's act of desperation to boost revenues in Q2 as a positive takeaway for investors.If you liked this article, please find my profile icon at the top of this page, and hit the ""Follow"" button.

4074474,94846,2017-05-18T15:15:20-04:00,"Snap had a lukewarm performance after its IPO.With Instagram copying most of Snap's features, the company faces stiff competition. Instagram recently introduced AR features for its users.In the long-term, Snap would need to look beyond its current demographic and introduce Instagram-proof features to retain its product exclusivity.","This year, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) went public.Result: Its closing price was 44% above its initial value of $17.In Snap's S-1, the firm had mentioned:But the following months generated little growth for the camera company.In its first quarterly earnings report, Snap recorded a net loss of $2.2 billion, which as it mentioned was attributed to the stock-based compensation related to its February IPO.After the first earnings report, many analysts compared Snap's poor post-IPO performance to that of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). As the largest tech IPO in the US history, Facebook arrived as a public company in 2012 with an offering price of $38 per share in the markets. It went on to raise $16 billion in that offering but the stock soon fell as it opened with share prices crashing more than 50% over the following months. Today Facebook has a whopping 1.97 billion monthly active users. with current stock price trading way above its IPO price.But the concern should not only be limited to the lukewarm performance of Snap. Here are the good, the bad and the ugly scenarios for Snap investors:The Good: AR Ad revenues and Target DemographicAugmented Reality (or AR) is the next big thing and with most companies like Facebook and Apple introducing AR features, AR ads could soon be revolutionizing the traditional revenue streams for mobile apps.AR ads can impeccably create an authentic connection between the real and the virtual worlds. Snap generates substantially all of its revenues by offering various advertising products on Snapchat. These include Snap Ads, which are vertical full screen video advertisements, and Sponsored Creative Tools, which include Geofilters and Lenses.In Snap's S-1, the firm mentioned:Sponsored Geofilters allows user interaction with an advertiser's brand by enabling stylized brand promotion to be overlapped on a Snap. Snap's branded geofilters alone costs anywhere from $250,000 to $750,000 (subject to the date, geographical coverage, and reach). (For non- Snap users - Geofilters are digital stickers that Snapchat users overlay on photos and videos they post on the social messaging network).Sponsored Lenses allows users to interact with an advertiser's brand by enabling branded interactive experiences. Snapchat's First Sponsored Lens had starred 'Peanuts' and a Stream of Candy Corn and the campaign reportedly were priced at $750,000 for just 24 hours on Halloween, according to Ad week. This year, Snap took its augmented reality to next level with World Lenses and Audience lens. World lens allowed advertisers to create an environment of floating 2D or 3D objects and other interactive content.According to TechCrunch, the first advertiser to run Sponsored World Lens will be Warner Bros. for promoting a new ad for the joint MGM and WB film ""Everything, Everything."" Netflix and Dunkin Donuts plan to run World Lens ads in the future, according to the report.Ad revenues generated from such ads become even more significant if they are focused one of the most sought after demographic - the Millennials.As of spring 2017, Statista reported that Snapchat was the most important network for US teens and ranked ahead of other platforms like Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. According to Snap, an average user spends 30 minutes with Snapchat every day, up from 25 to 30 minutes during the fourth quarter of 2016. Everyday Snap users create more than a total of 3 billion Snaps with 166 million daily users opening the app on an average of 18 times per day.Going by this data provided it maintains its largest advertisers and keeps its user engaged, Snap may be looking towards generating big numbers in revenues especially,The Bad: User GrowthBut the bad part of the good news is that for ad revenues Snap needs to look beyond Millennials since revenue generation is closely connected to the user growth and that may not be looking too impressive for Snap if it remains focused on the younger users. To many, the user growth graph of Snap closely resembles the path of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). After its IPO Twitter witnessed a slow user growth and even recorded a decline in its fourth quarter of 2015. The stagnant user growth of Twitter remains one of its biggest challenges. It raised the monthly active users to 319 million, which is a drop when compared to its competitors.Snap's daily user base has merely grown 5% from the previous quarter reaching 166 million. This number is below Instagram's daily active users of 200 million that use Instagram stories and way below Facebook's average daily active users of 1.28 billion. On April 26th 2017, Instagram announced that its community had more than 700 million Instagrammers, with the last 100 million joining ""faster than ever"".Snapchat has a relatively unique user base, with 35% of Snapchat's users in the US not on Facebook and 46% not using Instagram. But even with its devoted Millennials, the total number comparatively stands small in front of Instagram or Facebook. Scale is a powerful competitive advantage since more users a firm has, the more valuable the platform is.The bad part of the Snap-Instagram saga is that competitor Instagram has an extensive active user network of its parent company Facebook, that is both loyal and growing.The Ugly: Product ExclusivityAfter Snap's IPO talks, its rival Instagram had started introducing features at an alarming rate to its existing platform. But the twist here is that is that Snap's most innovative features are appearing to not look exclusive or distinctive. In August 2016, Instagram added a new feature after launching its ""Stories"" section in August 2016. According to TechCrunch, after Instagram Stories was launched, Snapchat's growth sank 82%.Image Source: InstagramTo stay ahead of the curve, Snap has added series of extensions to its existing products. It introduced a search feature for stories on its messaging platform, Snap Chat calling it Stories in Search which allowed users to search through 1 million stories. In another recent announcement, it added 'limitless snaps' which made changes to creative tools by adding Magic Eraser and setting the viewing timer to infinity.But its direct competitor, Instagram, has been strategically and aggressively positioning itself and unapologetically introducing features that resembles that of Snap's. After hosting series of new features like stories, live video and disappearing messages in Direct, Instagram's most recent feature reflects Facebook's future course towards augmented reality. The integration of Facebook and Instagram is matter of convenience for users, allowing them to upload and share Instagram stories, photos and filters on Facebook. The introduction of the eight filters in Instagram comes after Snap's added AR features last month to World Lens allowing users to paint the world with new 3D experiences.According to Instagram's VP of Product Kevin Weil, this is the way the tech industry works.On being asked about Snap at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York, Kevin Weil said, ""If we're being honest with ourselves, this is the way the tech industry works and frankly, it's how all industries work. Kudos to Snapchat for being the first to Stories, but it's a format and it's going to be adopted widely across a lot of different platforms.""After a dull performance in its quarterly earnings report this year, when Snap CEO Evan Spiegel was asked about Instagram's parent company, Facebook, he said: ""If you want to be a creative company, you have to be comfortable with the fact that people will copy your stuff. Everyone will develop a camera strategy. Just because Yahoo has a search box, it doesn't mean they're Google.""But the truth is that Snap is neither Yahoo nor Google.For a strong performance in markets, Snap would need to prove that it has the potential to innovate features that are tougher to duplicate (Instagram proof) and are backed by patents."
4076845,39301,2017-05-26T12:22:29-04:00,"Growth thesis hinges on product introductions, inventory growth from new users, and sustained consumption growth.Competitive threats seem overstated, as Snap Inc. addresses competition via the development of new features, which is a winning strategy.Furthermore, we anticipate share lock-up expiration to have minimal impact on total float, as the bulk of block holders have very limited incentive to sell shares.We want to add emphasis that early stage VC funds aren’t looking to liquidate, and would not liquidate shares of Snap Inc. absent of extraordinary circumstances.Furthermore, we anticipate shares to trade higher on low volumes, as investors are looking to accumulate given discrepancy in supply/demand and low likelihood of share float increasing by much.","Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) remains my top pick for North America Internet currently, and while the recent stock price momentum helps to reassert the case, we generally view Snap Inc. as a multi-year holding, and expect much greater upside from tech-focused developments internally than what the current consensus expects.We've stressed the discrepancies of Snap Inc.'s IPO and how it may trade differently from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), despite both offerings occurring at different points in the market cycle. Many believed (incorrectly) the Snap Inc.'s IPO will experience a similar drop like Facebook. But, with Snap Inc. still $5 above its IPO price of $17, we're 30% positive from the initial offering price, which is already a positive sign. Especially when taking into consideration Facebook fell approximately 50% from its initial offering price over the 3 months following its IPO.Substantial divergence in price performance between the two IPOs goes ignored despite an 80% net-differential in actual performance. The bears are retreating, as we're more likely to witness a substantial rally in Snap Inc.'s stock price assuming broad market volatility remains limited.Weighing in on key investment themesThe stock seems expensive when viewing valuation in isolation. The value premium attached to Snap Inc. seems justified from our view as the numerous levers to revenue/user growth when executed correctly adds enough shareholder value to warrant its TTM (trailing twelve-month) sales multiple of 45.8x.Yeah, we know Snap's valuation seems insane, but the surface level metrics disregard the underlying growth potential, and cost leverage of a social media model that generates the bulk of its content from users on the platform, as opposed to third-party publishers. Many have prognosticated doom from a valuation standpoint, but we still believe the market hasn't priced the stock correctly, as the growth thesis hinges on a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)-like scenario of ad-load increases, as opposed to sustained DAU ramp on heightened usage growth.We believe the current monetization view is fundamentally wrong, as social networks tend to have a multiplicative factor of content creation that's entirely different from a publisher dependent network like Facebook.We believe the value of Snap stories will increase in direct proportion to the number of user additions, as content feeds will populate with more user-generated content, increasing the likelihood of usage growth. Furthermore, Snapchat's onboarding process has been simplified allowing for instant content curation upon porting over contacts from iOS or Android.At our 207 million projected DAU figure for FY'17, the amount of content in the feed is set to grow disproportionately (probably 50% y/y), which increases ad unit inventory even absent of ad load increases. Furthermore, usage growth is directly proportionate to the inclusion of more user-generated content, building a sort of flywheel of momentum for monetization even absent of ad load increases.So, we're more interested in where Snap Inc. can execute on platform specific ad-bidding and number of tools made available for its self-serve platform, as opposed to inventory management. The inventory will manage itself based on the availability of user-generated content.Furthermore, moving to harvest viewership at this current juncture may prove premature. Efforts to increase ad load in its current state could diminish adoption, or tune out users from over-clutter, so we view this scenario as less desirable. Also, we think the risk of this occurring is quite low as management communicated technological development and usage growth as its primary growth levers currently.Efforts to improve monetization should stem from improved click-through rates, ad-recall, or brand uplift substantiating more premium pricing for its mid-roll ads. Furthermore, Snap Inc. can increase available inventory by opening space in other areas of the application, as opposed to shoving more ads between Snap stories.So, inventory increases likely occurs incrementally and done via the introduction of new ad units. So, inventory creation should be a function of practical value creation for advertisers, such as in the search bar where promoted Snap accounts can earn higher placement thus increasing the awareness of publishers on Snapchat. This would be a useful ad feature that also adds inventory without the risk of over-cluttering the story feed.The value of internal tech-development should not be underestimated from a value framework, though many will openly criticize Snap Inc.'s features as being replicable. Yeah, some features have certainly been replicated, but keep in mind, there's a limit to what Instagram can copy in functionality, whereas there's no upper limit to the number of features Snap Inc. can develop internally.Snap Inc. has been the most innovative company when pertaining specifically to social apps and functionality. There's been more ""ah-ha"" moments with Snap Inc.'s product roadmap over the past 12 months than what we've seen from Instagram over the past three years. Perhaps more changes were made to Snapchat in the past two years than all the combined changes made to Twitter over the past five years.We're liking how product-focused Snap Inc. has been relative to its incumbents. Furthermore, we're certain that if Snap Inc. focuses on the core user experience first, the monetization will take care of itself given enough time. Snap Inc. will keep innovating, because competing is usually a loser's game anyway.Share lock-up risk overly exaggeratedFurthermore, we're seeing less anxiety pertaining to share lock-up expiration. Keep in mind, the lock-up period for Snap Inc. is set 12 months following the IPO date, as 55 million shares were already sold from offering stakeholders and 200 million shares were sold as a part of the capital raise. Roughly, 1/4th of the shares offered or 50 million of class A common stock purchased at the IPO is subject to a separate lock-up period that expires February of 2018.Furthermore, I don't think Evan Spiegel or Bobby Murphy will sell any of their founder shares, as the voting privileges conferred decreases any likelihood of a hostile takeover, and would require a separate security offering.Furthermore, the two co-founders own 44.8% of Snap Inc.'s total share outstanding with the remaining owned via Snap Inc.'s initial investors, employees, and other block holders (underwriters of the Snap Inc. IPO). The restricted period for insiders extends 120 days following the IPO, which implies June 27th, 2017 is the day worth marking on the calendar. The remaining shares due for lock-up expiration, which is estimated at 1.2 billion shares, according to J.P. Morgan likely won't trade on the market for quite a while following lock-up, as VC funds who participated aren't looking for liquidity.Therefore, 84% of the total share outstanding made available following the restricted period won't hit the market, as the rate of turnover from insiders has remained relatively stable, and we haven't seen any indications that the VC firms invested into Snap Inc. will look to exit their positions, as most VC funds exit/liquidate their holdings at the end of a 10-year window, where funds are locked-up via a gate provision, so the general partners of the VC fund can deploy capital over an initial 3-year vesting phase, and investment yields are compounded over a 7-year span. At the end of 10 years, VC funds are usually given 1 to 3 years following the initial 10 years to liquidate assets.So, there's very little incentive for any participating fund to liquidate the fund and return capital to the limited partners, as many of the funding rounds leading up to the IPO came from a series of funds that are only three to five years' old. So, we don't anticipate there to be this huge windfall of sales, or profit harvesting, because VC funds aren't going to re-deploy the capital from selling the shares, because the 10-year life of a typical VC fund restricts the managers from re-deploying capital, as the vesting phase has already passed for Snap's participating funds.Furthermore, performance fees are easier to justify following the IPO, as a publicly traded stock's NAV (net asset value) contribution to a fund is directly quantifiable, and given the sheer scale of Snap Inc.'s contribution to a managed VC portfolio, the managers would be demonstrating egregious incompetence to sell assets and return capital to the limited partners.I mean, if you had a cost basis of a couple of pennies compared to today's stock price, and the stock price doubled again in the next year or two, the original cost basis of a couple of pennies is worth many thousand percentages more than the original cost of entering the position, i.e. power law relationship.There's zero incentive for any of the participating funds to ever liquidate their positions in Snap Inc. until the eventual wind-down of the funds, which is still a 2020 to 2022 time frame where limited partners can demand some sort of liquidation event from the fund, which is another drawn out process that takes a couple of more years, as the remaining companies in the portfolio will either IPO or pursue a strategic exit via an acquisition.Therefore, there's no real basis to anticipate any of the VC block holders will ever sell shares any time soon. Many have ignorantly mentioned that these funds are looking to liquidate, but VC funds don't trade assets; they carry assets until they're told to sell those assets by their investors, and that's an eventuality that won't occur for many years.Recent stock price momentumThe stock jumped by almost 7% on near non-existent news. The market continues to trend higher, so we're guessing investors were eager to get back into the battered stock following what has been a bad Q1'17 earnings report. If the market isn't going to drop this week, perhaps it's not a bad idea to own the beta champion of 2017.Source: TC 2000The stock traded upwards on very little volume, which suggests a pattern of accumulation of shares as opposed to a short cover rally, which tends to contribute more to share turnover due to the nature of the transaction.Furthermore, the stock traded above the 20-day and 50-day moving average. It's like the resistance area never existed to begin with, which yet again, suggests that the stock is long overdue for a rally. If equities don't pull back in the summer months, Snap will continue to pop higher even with the modest impact of share lock-up, as the added liquidity does little in the face of overwhelming demand. On the day of IPO, it's worth noting that the stock was oversubscribed by 12 times, which means that there was enough market liquidity to absorb 2.4 billion shares, which compares to Snap Inc.'s total share outstanding of 1.18 billion.The current float is 482.4 million, not a whole lot, as it's representative of 40% of total share outstanding. Of course, when the lock-up expires, we're not anticipating the co-founders to sell their stakes, and in limited instances, some of the earlier stage VCs may liquidate small positions, so they can fund a later-stage round for a different portfolio company.But again, the remaining 60% of shares coming back onto the market won't trade on the market, as a decent chunk is accounted for among the various participating block holders, and there's really no incentive for either the co-founders or early stage investors to liquidate a chunk of their shares.This implies that aside from the employees holding stock options, there's not much added float coming from this event.Final thoughtsWe continue to like the underlying investment thesis of Snap Inc. and view the recent pullback as one of the few windows remaining to buy shares at a pretty steep discount. The perception of volatility following the lock-up may impact shares negatively, but it's really a perception issue, as opposed to a practical issue of too much supply hitting the market on the day of lock-up.As such, we reiterate our top pick designation for Snap Inc. and $58.57 price target as well.About Cho's Technology ResearchCho's Technology Research is SA's premier technology research package that gives investors and traders an additional edge when investing into tech companies.

In the only quarterly report available, Snap barely missed Q1 revenue, daily active users (DAU), and the earnings; met the average revenue per user (ARPU). As it is fully expected that an IPO company will not see profit soon, the near miss of revenue was reacted harshly because it is related to the slowdown in DAU. Therefore, it is safe to assume that Snap shareholders are more concerned with the long-term growth prospect in revenue. In the social media industry, revenue is jointly determined by the ARPU and DAU. For example, a 5% growth in DAU, coupled with an 8% growth in ARPU, would result in a 13% growth in revenue.So, for SNAP's valuation, I choose a framework which focuses on future revenue growth. The revenue-based, Sales Franchise Value Model (""SFV"") is presented below as Equation (1):The logic behind the SFV is that the revenue multiple, or price to sales ratio (P/S), is determined jointly by the future growth in revenue and improvement in profitability. Based on Equation (1), the key factor to determine the current fair P/S ratio is the annual revenue growth rate for the current year, 2017. For the future P/S ratio, the relevant revenue growth rate is for the next year, 2018. To estimate the future revenue growth, simple math requires estimating both the growth in DAU and ARPU for each time period.(Source: Company 10-Qs)For the baseline case, the actual growth rate for the quarterly average daily active users for the past four trailing quarters is computed (Figure 2) with the Q1 growth rate around 7.64%. To my surprise, Snap's DAU growth has already been showing signs of declines into single digits since late 2016. The decline has been attributed to Instagram's launch of a similar ""Stories"" product. However, the real concern is that Delmondo has shown the decreasing DAU growth even before the Instagram's Stories launch. Similarly, SNAP displays the same disturbing trend in ARPU, an important measure for its ability to monetize the users. This could be also caused by the steep competition from Instagram's fight for users.More importantly, the level of competition quickly rises to a different order as soon as Snap joins the fight with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for advertising dollars. Historically, Snap has been a significant underperformer in ARPU compared to peers, as the peers regularly produce ARPUs somewhere between $5 and $8. While briefly hitting $1.05 in Q4 2016, Snap's Q1 ARPU went back down to $0.90. This is the basis for the next 12-month ARPU estimates which are more likely between $0.90 and $1.00.However, reflecting the confidence level of guidance changes in valuation is much trickier. The risk level of the forecast is usually reflected in the level of the discount rate, k, in Equation (1). An intuitive interpretation of an ""x%"" discount rate is that market will shave x% off the fair value to adjust for the uncertainty of the forecast. Throughout this study, I used the discount rate, 11%, which was the discount rate prevailing around Snap's Q1 announcement.In short, in Table 1, the 12-month P/S ratio by 2018 under various scenarios of DAU growth and ARPU are computed with Equation (1). Given the estimates that quarterly DAU will most likely grow somewhere between 7% and 8% in next 12-month period, along with the ARPU between $0.90 and $1.00, the fair P/S should be between 19 and 24 (in red). Specifically, my best SFV estimates for SNAP's P/S ratio should come down from the current 45 to 19 or 21 within 12 months.2. Peer AnalysisAlternatively, SNAP's P/S may be compared with its peers. However, the selection of the relevant peer and time point requires further care. The comparison is only meaningful if the peer has a similar business model and in a similar risk environment. For the first reason, I select Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for their obvious similarities in their social media business models to Snap's. For the second reason, I use the one-year period after each stock's IPO, as it is not sensible to compare the three-month old Snap to a five-year old Facebook, a six-year old LinkedIn, or a three-year old Twitter if using the current time point. The logic of using the same post-IPO period is based on the premise that newly IPO stocks should have faced similar risks.Therefore, in Figure 1, the revenue multiples for the four stocks are ""lined up"" relative to its respective IPO timeline. Clearly, Snap has been clearly in a different ""camp"" than Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. SNAP's price to sales ratios have been ranging between 40 and 50, while the other three stocks were between 10 and 20. SNAP is traded twice as expensive as the peer at the same time after the IPOs.The disparity seems even more alarming, considering that on virtually every fundamental front, the peers have been better than where SNAP is now. Three months after IPOs, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter all had a higher DAU and ARPU than Snap; all three companies were already or near profitable. So, it stands to reason that, at a minimum, SNAP's P/S ratio should be cut in half to a level closer to the peer's. Coupled with the Street's estimate that Snap's 2018 revenue will double, then SNAP's 2018 price target should stay the same at around the current $20.3. Compared to InstagramIn addition to the peer analysis at a common historical point, another obvious comparison can be made between SNAP and its current archenemy, Instagram. A simple examination will easily reveal the relative valuation between the two close competitors. Statista has estimated that Instagram's revenue will grow from $1.095 billion to $9.511 billion from 2015 to 2021 (Table 2). Even with Instagram's wide range of private valuation between $20 billion to $50 billion, it would be equivalent to an effective P/S ratio between 5.26 and 18.26, a much more reasonable and similar order with the other big three. This is yet another piece of evidence suggesting that SNAP's price to sales should come down significantly in line with others.CaveatsAs usual, even the best quantitative metrics may not include all qualitative and risk considerations. In above valuations, the pricing of the following factors has not been included.Dual-Class Share Structure DiscountBut to protect ""founders' visions,"" the 230 million shares sold in the IPO have no voting rights. With over 88% of the voting rights, Spiegel and Murphy practically have complete control of the company. One clever move is that Snap has instituted the dual class share structure at day 1 of IPO. Because Snap is still on its honeymoon with the shareholders, they would give the founders the full benefit of doubt.In contrast, with almost 10 years in public eyes, it did cost Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) CEO Kevin Frank 10-15% to establish the same dual-class share structure in 2016. Currently, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is still in court to fight for his.Lock-Up ExpirationThough, one thing is real. There is an inevitable negative impact from the lock-up expiration on the near horizon. It is estimated that close to one quarter of the 1.18 billion shares outstanding may be freed up from lock-up option by the end of year, and some shares may be sold in late August. Close to 100 million out of the 230 million IPO shares are held by executives and VC firms which are known to ""jump ship"" as early as they can. Academic study has shown that there will be a negative market impact in the order of -5% two months leading into the expiration of the lock-up option. For the immediate same-day selloff effect, it is estimated that the selling of 100 million shares, equivalent to three days of the average daily volume, may amount to a negative price impact of 5-8%.CautionsAlthough SNAP's relative valuation, or P/S ratio, should come down to one half of the current level, it is not necessarily suggesting that SNAP is overvalued by 50%. As the Street has estimated that Snap's 2018 revenue will double, it will easily offset the simultaneous drop in revenue multiple and leave the stock price at the current level."
4073890,102101,2017-05-16T18:21:45-04:00,Short-term speculators can only be right for so long.Long-term investors have to lower risk premiums to break even.This will drive more multiples expansion as management jostles to make a competitive ad engine.I forecast upward expansion in key valuation ratios driving price action towards more upside.,"Source: shemazingAfter the last earnings report, the popular opinion that Snap’s (SNAP) valuation was a bubble was validated for short-term bearish speculators who profited off short-term bullish bets. The near-term narrative is as diluted as that. Long bulls who can’t stomach short unmet projections by analysts will continue to hand off their bets to short-term bears who are in this for the quick money.While a growing percentage of future gains have been carried forward and handed over to VCs who cashed out after the IPO, short-term price movements will continue to be meaningless to investors who are in this for the long term as management recruits the needed talent to build a competitive ad API that will attract media buyers while tweaking the Snapchat app to accelerate DAU growth.While short-term speculators aren’t bothered about the amount of OPEX required to catch up with Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), long-term investors should be increasingly coming to the reality that Snap has to carve out a niche for itself while building a moat that will be impenetrable by its biggest rivals.So far, that hasn’t been the story. Facebook has leveraged Instagram as a weapon to attack Snap on all innovative fronts, and it's increasingly clear that Snap won’t get out of this battle easily without making big sacrifices.Source: Simply Wall StSo, when investors grow skeptical at large cash burns, the idea of taking on Facebook and other giants like Google and Twitter for market share in the ad space needs to be juxtaposed against alternative breakeven scenarios before investors decide to raise their risk premium by expanding valuation multiples in the short term in sacrifice for long-term gains.The leading indicators of investor’s willingness to expand valuation multiples will stem from sustainable growth in short-term revenue and profit drivers.Profit drivers like reduced OPEX and lower capital expenditure can be overlooked on a short-term given the need to gain market share while simultaneously building a competitive moat around that.Hence, profit ratios below the gross margin line such as operating margin, EPS, and FCF growth will not be accretive to share price actions.Also, the popular narrative of soft growth in DAU will no longer be supportive of the volume leg of revenue assuming Revenue = price x volume. Where price is driven by ARPU and volume is driven by DAU.Therefore, I’m projecting softer contribution of DAU to revenue in the short term, putting more pressure on ARPU to uphold the bullish Street revenue projections of ~$1 billion in FY'2017 and ~2.4 billion in FY’2018.Those lofty numbers are looking more unconvincing with every passing quarter, and management has to accelerate projects that will drive more users and advertisers to Snapchat.For now, management is touting the ad load of 30 minutes per session for every user to support the DAU leg of revenue.According to the last CC:This is similar to the catalyst that is upholding Twitter’s DAU narrative as Snap can get to double ad inventory by doubling ad load rather than double DAU.The only downside here is the effect on user experience, which drives the growth of internet surfers installing ad blockers. However, I do not see Snap getting affected much given that most Snap ads come in interactive formats which blend perfectly into the entire user experience in assets like geofilters and lenses which drive a significant portion of Snap’s premium ad inventory.As Snap develops a better API, I expect more advertisers to bid for its premium ad inventory with more competition in ad auction driving long-term APRU growth.Therefore, the only weakness I see in the business model and short-term price action is the deceleration in MAU growth which is trending in a pattern akin to Twitter’s. This might strengthen the narrative that Facebook is indeed eating Snap’s lunch as Instagram has recorded a faster growth in usage of some of the assets it cloned from Snap.ValuationOn a short term, the popular sentiment that Snap is another GoPro (GPRO) or Pets.com will continue to drive the huge short positions by bearish speculators. On the other hand, short-term bullish speculators will continue to offload their bets at the hint of softer numbers in growth drivers like ARPU and DAU. This behavior will be upheld as we draw closer to the lock-up expiration dates. This will lead to a supply/demand mismatch in support of the bearish narrative, hence I’m projecting more downside erasing post Q1’17 earnings rally as we head into Q2’17.However, as management develops a more competitive ad engine, I am anticipating a faster adoption of Snap as a medium for advertisers to target millennials and older age cohorts.This means investors have to expand valuation multiples as they demand a lower risk premium to drive valuation multiples while providing more capital for management to spend on R&D and talents required to build a competitive ad business."
4077025,103131,2017-05-28T02:22:17-04:00,Snapchat had a disappointing Q1 report.Facebook has a platform based model that is not like Snapchat.Snapchat's data does not have the predictive power that Facebook has.Instagram and WhatsApp have already surpassed Snapchat in Daily Average Users.Snapchat is overvalued in relation to its peer group.,"Q1 RecapThe narrative behind the Q1 results of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) included increased partnerships, lower customer acquisition costs for advertisers, and bettering tools for advertisers such as the recently launched API and auction platform. SNAP reported a $2.2B loss that included $1.3B in unrecognized stock based compensation expense. The cash position increased to $3.2B following the IPO that will help finance the heavy R&D that the company will require moving forward. SNAP reported a 286% yoy increase in sales of $149.6M which missed expectations by about $8M.However, sales and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) were down over 10% from the prior quarter which was attributed to seasonality. SNAP's primary cost of revenue includes hosting costs which was cut by 12% from the prior quarter due to new contracts that were negotiated with Google and Amazon cloud offerings. Operating expenses increased 18% because of an increase in new hires in the sales and engineering department. Reported G&A was almost eight times reported sales and total SG&A was almost 15 times the reported sales. The large SG&A expenses were the reason behind the large reported loss. Although there was a large loss, the company will benefit from the tax loss carry forward.As for engagement, SNAP had 166 million Daily Active Users (DAU) and larger penetration in acquiring users abroad. Snapchat's yoy growth rate slipped from 48% to 36% from the prior quarter. Finally, it had increased success in automating its ad platforms with over 20% of Snap Ad impressions programmed through its API.Source: TechcrunchIPO & Investor ProfileSNAP felt the expected surge over its offering price as it was one of the biggest and most anticipated tech IPOs. Many hurried to open positions because they wanted to have a part of something that could potentially be the next big Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). However, a large percentage of investors are not the millennials and youth that comprise the fundamental user base. Therefore, they do not fully understand how users interact with the app. It is easy to get bullish on a new Tech IPO that has been extremely popular. Nevertheless, investors must understand the fundamentals of the service and how its target demographic interacts with it.Source: Chicago TribuneFacebook's Platform ModelThe biggest difference between SNAP and FB is that Facebook is a large platform, not just an app. Facebook has a wide array of different uses that it offers and serves as an umbrella with its varied lines of businesses such as WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. Furthermore, Facebook is used to stay in touch with friends, acquire business relationships, play games, easily open accounts in other platforms, create social and event groups, voice opinions, and is even used as a news outlet. Although it can be said that SNAP has some of the same uses, they are not as widely used as they are on the Facebook platform. It has come to a point where very young and old people are creating accounts and people are even creating accounts for their pets. With almost 2B monthly users, it has become taboo for one to not have a Facebook account. Although Facebook is in a much later stage in its development, the platform that it has offers a diversified stream of growth due to its many different service offerings.One could argue that SNAP can experience a similar transformation with time, but SNAP's model is to offer a specialized and personalized contact with friends. The appeal of its ability to provide a private experience is what differentiated the service. This appeal cannot be sustained if the company decides to massively open the service to a platform based model with many different uses. An example of this was the launch of Snapcash. Although it is still offered on the app, it has not received a lot of attention and its use is far from widespread among SNAP users. This example demonstrates SNAP's inability to successfully integrate different uses into its service.Snapchat's AdvertisingCurrently, about 95% of SNAP's revenue is derived from mobile advertising. Its business model is highly dependent on an increasing user base. However, its user growth has been somewhat disappointing given where the company is in its life cycle. The bulk of engagement stems from developed countries and SNAP has been ineffective in growing users in the rest of the world. Management claims that the struggle in growing users in the rest of the world is a result of connectivity and expensive broadband cell service. The recent quarters have shown a large decline in the pace of user growth and SNAP must implement innovative outreach efforts to combat that.Source: Q1 Investor PresentationIt is important to examine the market segment that SNAP targets. Currently, about 60% of the SNAP's DAU come from users that are below the age of 25 and 23% below the age of 18. This could pose an issue because the older age demographic has a higher propensity for spending based on their level of discretionary income. They do have an impressive reach of young users, but the young users are not the ones that equate to a high ARPU. This fact detracts advertisers and SNAP must learn to increase the average age of its DAU to create better quality ad opportunities for its partners. Furthermore, SNAP depends on its users to swipe up on advertisements to increase revenue. However, it is far too easy for users to ignore the advertisements and continue to use the app to send snap updates to their friends. Snapchat's user demographic is currently too narrow and must be addressed by management.Source:StatistaOne of the biggest things that makes advertisers love social media advertising is the abundance of information and intel that they can obtain about user behavior. Targeted advertising is a large degree of magnitude more effective than traditional advertising and is what has made companies like Facebook so successful. Snapchat targets advertisements based on the information the app has gathered on how users interact with the app. Much of this consists on what sort of media or advertisements triggered a user to swipe up or what kind of filters have been used by that user. Additionally, SNAP focuses on geolocation to target advertisements. However, SNAP does not have the quality of information that Facebook and Twitter offer. This is specifically due to the fact that keywords are fundamental to social media marketing. Social Media marketers know that the highest value of paid advertisements is derived from effective keyword analysis that drives user behavior. SNAP focuses on pictures and videos that lack the abundance of keywords and dialogue that Facebook and Twitter hold. Although SNAP has a feature to add texts to snaps, it does not have near the predictive power of all the dialogue from Facebook and Twitter.Furthermore, SNAP lacks in the quality of interaction that users have with advertisements. SNAP allows users to share content and swipe up to learn more about what is being advertised. There is not a feature where users can comment and like content. Overall, this means that the data derived from SNAP users has less predictive power compared to Twitter and Facebook. Thus, SNAP advertisements are less effective in targeting users. Recently, SNAP has been offering companies that have not used its advertising discounts on new media to be featured on the app. This campaign could be effective in increasing partnerships and advertising business, but does SNAP really need to offer discounts to do it?The Instagram ProblemIt is no question that Instagram is a dangerous threat to SNAP's business and could be the largest reason for the company's long term growth trajectory not coming into fruition. Recently, Instagram has been adding features that mimic the same ones that SNAP has been known for. The rollout of Instagram Stories was the biggest threat to SNAP. Also, Instagram now has a feature where you can take pictures and videos and directly send them to your followers or create a new group where they can be sent.In its newest update, Instagram is introducing face filters just like the ones that can be used in Snapchat. With higher DAU and implementation of these new changes, Instagram has taken away most of the things that made SNAP a differentiated service. Furthermore, with the aid of the powerhouse that is Facebook, Instagram has the ability to keep up with new features that will be offered from SNAP and integrate its software with the umbrella of all services offered under the Facebook platform. Currently Instagram Stories' 200M DAU and WhatsApp's 175M beat SNAP's 166M DAU. Additionally, Instagram's 700M monthly users demonstrates that the platform has a large ecosystem of users that will be able to continue the growth in its Instagram Stories engagement.Public Comps ValuationTo conduct the public comps valuation analysis, six companies were chosen based on their similar characteristics and all data was derived from FactSet. The companies in the peer group include: FB, TWTR, MTCH, WB, OTCPK:TCEHY, LN.Source: Author created image using data from FactSetIt can be seen that on a basis of Book Value, SNAP has a lower multiple in relation to its peer group. However, its sales multiples are almost four times the peer group average. The 1st quartile represents the bear case scenario and the 3rd quartile represents the bull case scenario. The sales multiples suggest that the market expects a large amount of growth in sales in relation to its current market value. Despite the fact, SNAP is grossly overvalued in comparison to this peer group from a public comps standpoint.On a separate note, SNAP currently finances 100% through equity. This means that SNAP's cost of capital is high because it is equal to its cost of equity. Although this intuitively seems like a negative point, this also implies that SNAP's cost of capital can only go down with the introduction of debt in the future.ConclusionWhile there might be a lot of opportunities with SNAP going forward, there are currently very few signs of anything tangible that signals that this stock will experience the same success as Facebook. Because of this, investors should consider holding off on buying SNAP until the catalysts begin to become more clear. This stock could very well experience the same fate as TWTR in terms of missing the long term projections that were expected of it. The threat of Instagram taking away the market share of advertising from SNAP presents a large problem that the company needs to learn how to overcome. As Warren Buffett would say, SNAP does not have the economic moat to fight off its competitors to be worth the premium that investors are currently paying.Supporting Documents"
4073978,41741,2017-05-17T04:58:14-04:00,"Snapchat needs an activist investor, but it’ll likely never get one.However, it does have a host of new hedge fund owners - activists included.Still, that won’t fix Snapchat’s user growth issue and continue attacks from Instagram.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is the relatively new social media company that's been stuck in the $20 to $24 a share in the past few months since its IPO. But competition has come for Snap, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s Instagram hitting 200 million daily active users. Has Facebook already killed Snapchat before the it had a chance?Snapchat has some 160 million daily users, which is still a solid number. However, Instagram has mastered the art of copying Snapchat features and doing so effectively. It has Stories and Filters. Still, one key is that the two aren't mutually exclusive. In most cases, users will be on both Snapchat and Instagram. However, Snapchat has a scalability problem. Users know more people on Instagram, thanks to the fact that you can leverage your Facebook network. As well, it's easier to find and follow people. Plus, more people are going to see your story on Instagram. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) also tried to take social media market share from Facebook and failed. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has been unsuccessful and by all accounts Snapchat will fail as well.Snapchat's recent earnings showed that user growth is slowing, and so the big question is: where does the camera company pivot to start making money? If they continue the current course, I fear it'll end up like Twitter - which has seen a stalled user base, despite having wasted time and money on trying to grow users, and meanwhile hasn't figured out a steady revenue generator. For Snapchat, a revenue avenue that's somewhat insulated from the likes of Instagram might include entering the video market, by hosting premium and paid content on its Discover channel. Then of course, there's their push into augmented reality, as they try and experiment with filter and lens ads that have an AR spin.The thing about Snapchat is that it has a unique shareholder base. Many Millennials bought Snapchat as their first ever stock purchase. Granted, this is the opposite of what they should be doing when it comes to making their first investment, but it could also lead to a 'sour' taste in many Millennial investors proverbial mouths if Snapchat ends up like Twitter, or worse, like MySpace.The silver lining.Millennial investors buying into Snapchat have some decent company, with some of the big name hedge funds buying shares of Snapchat in the first quarter. Granted, there's a 45-day delay on these holdings, there's at least some promise that a few of these funds are in the stock for the interim. Of note, Dan Loeb's Third Point bought 2.3 million shares, JANA Partners owns 550,000 shares, and Ken Griffin's Citadel Advisors, David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Steve Cohen's Point72 all own modest stakes. The secret hope is that perhaps one of the activist investors owning shares - Third Point or JANA - will push Snapchat to improve its corporate governance. The founders are heavily entrenched, as all public investors own non-voting shares. They have virtually no say in who's on the board of directors, the corporate strategy or whether to sell the company. Thus, an activist pushing for change at Snapchat is unlikely, and they're in the stock, likely, just looking to ride the IPO wave higher. However, Millennial investors and other public investors should make an attempt to better understand exactly what they own (and their rights) by investing in non-voting Snapchat shares.In the end.Snapchat's recent earnings showed just how interesting it is to have a disappearing message company public. Its core user base is highly fickle (just ask teen retailers that are now bankrupt - i.e. Rue21, Aeropostale, PacSun, etc.) and the relatively stickiness of Snapchat just isn't there. Its user base has little income, being mostly sub-24 years old, and so Snapchat will have a tough time monetizing them directly. Instead, the hope is that advertisers will be interested in reaching this population. Yet, tracking ROI for ads is still impossible. My worry is that, like with Twitter, where it has a solid user base, advertisers just won't be able to figure out how to best use it, and thus won't invest marketing dollars over the long-term in the platform."
4073419,24473,2017-05-15T16:27:12-04:00,"Snap reported revenue of $150M in Q1, up 286% from $39M in Q1 2016, a notable deceleration from Q4's 406% year-over-year growth rate.Normalized gross margin during the quarter was weak at ~0%, although improving dramatically year-over-year (from -95% in Q1 2016).When Facebook was the same size as Snap it had a gross margin over 70%, Snap is lagging significantly behind this margin trajectory.Should investors be concerned that Snap's valuation comps are Facebook, Google and Twitter which have significantly more profitable margin structures?Snap needs to improve its gross margin dramatically in the coming quarters or its valuation and bull case will suffer.","Snap Q1 2017 Financial AnalysisSnap (NYSE:SNAP) reported Q1 2017 revenue last week of $150M, up 286% year over year. The growth is impressive, but it's important to remember Snap didn't start ""meaningfully monetizing"" its platform until 2015. As the company has ramped its ad load significantly over the past 12-18 months, the market was expecting this type of growth.In fact, after taking a closer look, Snap's growth revenue growth rate appears to be decelerating at a rapid clip. In Q4 2016 Snap reported year-over-year revenue growth of 406%.Perhaps the most interesting part of the report was Snap's profitability, or lack thereof. Gross profit in the quarter was -$14M (gross margin of -9%), an improvement from gross profit of -$37M in Q1 2016 (gross margin of -95%), but still in the red.Although one may argue that Snap is growing quickly, and the business model is still very immature, this lack of gross profit is concerning for several reasons.Not The Same Margin Structure As Facebook, Twitter Or Google (At Least Not Yet)Unlike many of the companies that it's often compared to, Snap is not selling its ads at a profit.To put things in context, in 2009 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported revenue of $777M (well below the current ~$1B revenue consensus for Snap's 2017 revenue), and was able to post gross margins of 71%, and operating margins of 34%. In short, Facebook was very, very profitable when it was at a $1B revenue run-rate.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also was highly profitable when it was operating at a $1B revenue run-rate. In 2003, the company reported revenue of $961M, while posting gross margins of 87% and operating margins of 36%.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was far less profitable (and still is) than Facebook or Google, but still was miles ahead of Snap when it was the same size. In 2014 (when it posted $1.4B in revenue), Twitter reported gross margins of 68%, and operating margins of -38%.This massive disparity in profitability for Snap relative to its social networking peers is worrisome.Snap is valued at a very lofty price/sales multiple, and its business model is frequently compared to Facebook, Twitter and Google's despite being structurally less profitable.If the market begins to perceive that Snap will never be able to earn the same operating margins on its revenue, its price/sales multiple will be forced to trade at a steep discount to other, more profitable companies in the space.Gross Margin Deep DiveIn Q1 Snap's reported cost of revenue skewed higher due to the one-time nature of recognizing restricted stock options (RSUs) in connection with its IPO. If we adjust for this expense, we can attempt at normalizing Q1's gross margin.According to the company's 10Q filing, $19.6M of its $164M in cost of revenue was due to stock based compensation. The bulk of this was related one-time RSUs in connection with the IPO, which we need to back out. If we assume that $15M of the $19.6M were one time in nature, we arrive at a normalized cost of revenue of $148.4M, almost exactly inline with revenue of $149.6M.Per these calculations, my estimate for Snap's normalized gross margin during Q1 is ~0%, or breakeven.Scaling Hosting Costs Worry MeThe biggest reason behind Snap's bloated cost structure is outsized data storage costs. Snapchat's users require massive amounts of data to be able to send, receive and augment Snaps. This is the driving force behind Snap's multi-billion dollar commitments to AWS and Google Cloud.In the company's Q1 2017 slide presentation Snap breaks down its hosting cost per DAU (Daily Active User), and it doesn't look pretty.Although the company is touting that ""lower contract pricing"" is offsetting ""cost increases from more users and growing engagement"" the opposite seems to be the case. Hosting costs per DAU rose 15% year-over-year (from $0.52 to $0.60) during Q1.Snap goes into more detail about the nature of these expenses in the Risk Factors section of its recently filed 10Q, and I didn't find it too comforting.As the company continues to drive higher engagement within its platform, and launches new features that increase bandwidth consumption, it seems logical that hosting costs per DAU may continue to climb year-over-year. This appears to be the structural inefficiency weighing down Snap's gross margin.ValuationAt a current share price of ~$20, with a fully diluted share count of 1.432B, Snap's market capitalization is $28.6B.The consensus for Snap's 2017 revenue remains at $1B. This puts the 2017 price/sales multiple at 28.6X. Even with Snap's projected 2017 growth rate of 147%, this feels really pricey.If Snap cannot make dramatic improvements in its gross margin in the coming quarters, its price/sales multiple could contract dramatically. Facebook trades at a 2017 price/sales multiple of 11.4X, and the company is wildly profitable (operating margins of 45% in 2016).How much longer will the market allow Snap to trade a premium to Facebook, despite its diverging gross margin structure?Conclusion: High Risk, High RewardI still believe there is a bull case for Snap that could allow for a valuation of $50B-plus, on the back of 300M DAUs contributing $20/revenue/user/year, in 2020.However, an important part of this thesis is rapidly improving gross margins that allow for the company to achieve positive earnings and cash flow. If these margin improvements do not materialize, then neither will this bull case.Going forward, investors should be carefully watching Snap's hosting cost per DAU and gross profit to determine the trajectory of the company's long-term margin structure."
4073186,21798,2017-05-15T07:01:16-04:00,"Snap doesn’t have an advantage for either software or hardware.Snap’s expenses are too high and there is no path to profitability.The stock is overvalued even on a forward looking basis.With the stock price poised to fall, investors can make money by shorting the stock.","As an investor, I typically look for clear cases of companies that are likely to be successful on the long side. That means companies that are likely to achieve increases in revenue and earnings and those with reasonable valuations. However, occasionally I find cases where it would make sense to invest on the short side, betting that the company’s stock will drop in price. Currently, I see Snap Inc. (SNAP) as a company that is likely to experience a declining stock price. I think the stock is likely to decline as a result of having no advantage for the company’s products, a lofty expense structure, and a valuation that is too high. Add in negative price pressure from the lock-up expiration and you have a great recipe for a short case. No Product or User Growth AdvantageSnap calls itself a camera company. However, the company’s flagship product is the Snapchat application, which is software. Snap earns most of its money through ad revenue from the Snapchat app. I don’t see much advantage to this app since Facebook (FB) has similar features on its apps and significantly more users than Snapchat.Snapchat’s 166 million daily active users [DAU] is overshadowed by Facebook’s, 1.28 billion DAUs, 1.94 billion monthly active users, Instagram’s 700 million DAUs, and WhatsApp’s 1.2 billion monthly active users. Facebook’s ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp and their dominate amount of users gives them a strong advantage to attract advertising dollars. I do acknowledge that Snap will attract some advertising revenue. Advertisers can target their marketing efforts to the Millennials and Generation Z. However, I don’t think Snap will ever attract nearly the amount of ad revenue that Facebook has. It would take Snap seven years to reach 1 billion DAUs and ten years to reach 2 billion DAUs at an annual user growth rate of 30%. Frankly, I don’t think Snap will be able to sustain such a high growth rate. Snap’s user growth rate has been declining since Q2 2016. It is possible that Snap’s user growth rate may fizzle out the way Twitter’s (TWTR) user growth has. Twitter’s DAU growth rate only averaged 1.17% for the past 5 quarters. Twitter doesn’t have much of a product advantage either. You can share thoughts, pictures, and videos just as easily on Facebook’s apps than you can on Twitter. Since Snap doesn’t have a product advantage with Snapchat, I think the company’s user growth rate will also continue to slow down and eventually fizzle out, putting a damper on revenue growth. Snap doesn’t have an advantage in hardware either. The company’s Spectacles (sunglasses that record videos) product only earned $8.3 million in revenue for Q1. That was only 5.5% of Snap’s Q1 revenue. Furthermore only 5 million snaps were recorded in Q1 from Spectacles, which was a fraction of the company’s total snaps of 3 billion for the quarter. If Spectacles was a strong seller, any hardware company such as Apple (AAPL) or Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) could easily produce a similar product and take significant market share away from Snap. There are already other manufacturers producing sunglasses with cameras. Just do a web search for sunglasses with cameras and you’ll see a variety of offers from numerous companies including Luxottica Group (LUX), who owns the Oakley brand. Image source: reddit.com Heading: created by author via memedad.comNo Profits on the HorizonAnother reason that I think Snap is a clear short is the company’s high expense structure. Just compare the company’s Q1 revenue to the expenses and you will want to short the stock. Data source: Snap’s 10-Q for Q1 2017Every line item under costs and expenses is higher than Snap’s revenue. Even if three out of four line items were eliminated, Snap would still lose money. How can the company ever make money with these high costs/expenses? If the cost of revenue is higher than actual revenue, the business is not sustainable. The cost of revenue is comprised mostly of hosting costs and revenue share expenses. If hosting costs are high, then Snap needs to eliminate revenue sharing to at least show a glimmer of hope that the company can become profitable. Another problem for Snap is that operating expenses are extremely high in relation to revenue. So, even if Snap eliminated revenue sharing, they would still be highly challenged to turn a profit.Research & development costs are over 5X more than Snap’s revenue. The sales and marketing is about 1.5X higher than revenue. Then, the real killer is general and administrative expenses which are 7.8X higher than revenue. It is difficult to see how Snap will become profitable with every cost/expense line item exceeding actual revenue. Snap’s cost structure is just too high. Snap experienced operating losses since it began commercial operations in 2011. The company doesn’t have a clear path to profitability. Snap acknowledged in the recent 10-Q report that the company may never achieve or maintain profitability. It doesn’t make sense to invest in a business with such high costs/expenses and without a clear plan to achieve sustainable profitability.High ValuationSince Snap is not yet profitable, I valued the company based on revenue. Snap’s forward EV/Revenue is 10.7 based on expected revenue for 2018. As a comparison, Facebook is trading 27% below that level with a forward EV/Revenue of 7.84. Twitter (TWTR) is trading 57% below Snap with a forward EV/Revenue of 4.56. Since Snap calls itself a camera company, we can compare them to GoPro (GPRO) which is trading 93% below Snap with a forward EV/Revenue of 0.76. So, even when looking forward, accounting for Snap’s revenue growth, the stock is valued too high. The high valuation is likely to turn most new investors away from the stock and cause current owners to sell it. ConclusionSnap doesn’t have a competitive advantage for either software or hardware. Competitors who are profitable with better resources can easily take advertising revenue and overall market share away from Snap. Spectacles also has plenty of existing competition and other large companies could create camera sunglasses if they chose to. So, it is likely that Snap’s rate of revenue growth will slow down each year going forward. Although Snap is currently growing revenue, the company’s costs and expenses are too high. Every individual expense line item exceeds the company’s revenue. As a result, profitability is nowhere in sight for Snap. This is likely to put downward pressure on the stock price.When investors see Snap’s overvaluation and no path to profitability, short sellers are likely to continue piling in, while current stockholders sell their positions. The selling is likely to accelerate when lockup expiration takes place on August 29, 2017. All of this is a perfect storm for a falling stock price and a shorting opportunity."
4073131,39161,2017-05-15T01:19:03-04:00,"Snap's 20% drop on the Q1 '17 earnings ""miss"" was an overreaction.I believe the company is still in a favorable competitive position compared to its peers.Snap's patent portfolio highlights a future in Augmented Reality and Live Events.Future growth drivers will be its advertising and TV partnerships, future iterations of its hardware (Spectacles), and the evolution of ""Snap Search"".","IntroductionDespite trading at a 50% discount to Facebook (FB) on a P/DAU metric, I believe Snap is in a better competitive position. This is due to the strength of Snapchat's messaging network, its camera, and the unique way users browse bite-sized 3-10 second content on the app. Facebook, may try to push the importance of the camera or messaging features in its app portfolio, but users ultimately use Facebook and Instagram due to their algorithmic news feeds, and any use of their cameras or messaging features are a byproduct of the use of their news feeds. For this reason, I do not believe that Facebook will be able to move its apps away from a news feed model to truly challenge Snapchat.Q1 2017 Earnings OverviewSnap reported earnings after the market closed on Wednesday, May 10th. Revenue missed consensus estimates by $8 million, EPS missed by $0.01, DAUs (Daily Active Users) came in 2 million lower than estimated, and subsequently ARPU (average revenue per user) came in below estimates (I have seen some reports that consensus estimates were $0.90, which would be in line). While earnings came in slightly below expectations and I expected the price to drop a little when I saw the numbers, the 20%+ decrease was an overreaction, as nothing reported materially changed Snap's long-term outlook.Source: Thomson Reuters, MarketWatchUser growth of 8 million DAUs (5.1%) began accelerating quarter over quarter as shown below, continuing the momentum that picked up to end Q4 that I had previously pointed out. Further, engagement continued to increase as users sent an average of 18 snaps per day compared to 16 back in Q3 '16 (the quarter that Instagram stories launched and supposedly began killing Snapchat), and average time spent in the app increased to north of 30 minutes, compared to the 25-30 minutes stated in the S-1. This goes to further support my thesis that Facebook, specifically Instagram, is not actually killing Snapchat.Source: SNAP SEC filingsRevenue did decline QoQ; however, management stated on page 73 of the S-1 that they expected Q1 '17 revenue to decline compared to Q4 '16. Additionally, the consensus analyst estimates varied between the 10 firms that participated in Snap's IPO underwriting and the nine firms that did not. The average estimate of analysts affiliated with the 10 underwriting firms estimated average revenue of $138.4mm, which was $30mm below the $168.4mm estimated by the nine non-underwriters, and $11.2mm below actual results. Technically, Snap outperformed the estimates of the analysts most familiar with its business model. Q1 is typically the weakest quarter in the advertising industry, with Q4 being the strongest, so nothing here is surprising.What was surprising was that hosting costs decreased quarter over quarter due to favorable changes in the hosting mix of AWS and Google Cloud. While ARPU declined QoQ (again, as expected), the drop in hosting costs almost completely offset the drop in ARPU and kept the raw product margin per user positive for the third consecutive quarter. A common misconception related to Snap's business model is that it loses more money with each new user. This is untrue, as the graph below shows that it is not new users that are driving Snap's losses.Source: SNAP SEC Filings; 2015 Hosting Costs estimated at 80% of COGSSnap's losses continued to grow QoQ, a central pillar of the short thesis. Snap reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $188.2mm, which compared unfavorably to average analyst estimates of $180.7mm. The losses are explained, however, by the continued ramp up of employees as shown in the table and chart below. Snap's employee count has grown by almost 400% since Q4 '15, and the company is consistently losing less per employee. CFO Drew Vollero noted on the call that 90% of the new hires in Q1 '17 were in engineering and sales, which totals 451 employees. The investment in these areas makes sense as advertising and hardware will drive revenue growth and profitability going forward, and it is unrealistic to expect all of the employees added in the last few quarters to make an immediate, material impact to Snap's business. It is kind of hard to get upset about the $7.5mm EBITDA miss when in reality, there is no way to predict exactly how fast Snap will be able to find and hire the right employees. If anything, it shows Snap is moving ahead of schedule by finding them faster than originally planned.Source: SNAP SEC filingsSource: SNAP SEC filings; Employee count from mix of news articles, SEC filings, and author estimatesA Look Into Snap's Augmented Reality & Live Event AmbitionsA recent post by CB Insights highlights some of Snap's key recent patents. A few are related to its core messaging feature, but I wanted to touch on the patents specifically related to Snap's augmented reality (AR) and Live Events strategy and how it gives us a preview into what management is planning.Automated Content CreationSnap applied for two patents related to the automation of its Live Stories product in December of 2014. The first was titled, Gallery of messages from individuals with a shared interest (#9385983). The patent is related to using machine learning to automate the selection of content used in Snap's ""Live Stories"" product, which ultimately evolved into Snap Search. Snap also applied for patent #0160182875 titled, 'Gallery of Videos Set to an Audio Time Line,' essentially a process for to create digital audio fingerprints. Acoustic fingerprinting is common in digital content, and Snap's patent relates to piecing together short videos of live events recorded by users, avoiding redundancies, to create full streams of live events from multiple human perspectives.In May of 2015, Snap applied for patent #9396354, 'Apparatus and method for automated privacy protection in distributed images.' Essentially, the patent was a method for running facial recognition on images and blurring out the faces of users based on their in-app privacy selections. This plays right into Snap's search and live events strategies, as users are uploading an increasing amount of music festival, concert, and sporting event content on the platform. Users are able to opt-out of certain features in the app, and the tech automates the process of user's privacy selections.Snap has historically used human editors to manually sift through video content to piece together its Live Stories; however, Snap Search uses these machine learning, image recognition, and acoustic/voice recognition techniques to create ""Stories"" based on nearly everything. Previously, the content on Snapchat available to users was limited to what their friends were sharing, or what publically available Live Stories were being pushed to each user by Snapchat. Now, however, the depth of content on Snapchat becomes as deep as whatever the world is sharing at that moment in time. Snapchat has created a whole new medium of content by combining the infinite rabbit-holes of videos on YouTube with the live, real-time feel of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). I believe the next step here is to eventually allow users to record videos longer than 10 seconds, which would further compete directly with Twitter's dominance of breaking news.Augmented Reality and its Advertising PossibilitiesThe most interesting patent Snap has applied for, 'Image-Based Tracking in Augmented Reality Systems' (#20170124713), is related to superimposing life-like, moving digital objects over real world surroundings. The patent covers images either taken on a phone-based app or on AR glasses, of which the picture in the patent looks very similar to Snapchat's Spectacles, its Google Glass clone. The filing date was from August of 2015, a full 14 months before Spectacles launched in November of 2016.According to investors who attended Snap's IPO road show, CEO Evan Spiegel revealed that Snap would be capable of building three-dimensional maps of real-world places like Universal Studios or the Harry Potter theme park. While we do not really know if or when Snap will launch any kind of application of this 3D mapping tech, I think it plays in with how Snap's strategy continues to evolve.Snap also applied for a patent titled, 'Object recognition based photo filters' (#2016112299) in January of 2015. This patent intersects in both AR and Live Events, as it is related to analyzing the contents of a message and suggesting tailored photo filters depending on objects in the message.Snap also provided images showing commercial application of the patent. In the example below, the camera identifies a coffee cup and triggers a brand's sponsored filter.These go alongside the patent Snap recently purchased from Israeli startup Mobli for $7.7mm. The patent, 'Methods and systems of providing visual content editing functions' (#9459778) relates to storing images on the server side, not within an application. The press mentioned this being related to Snap's Geofilters (as well as Geofilters being 90% of Snap's revenue, which is incorrect), but I think it also intersects with Snap's AR ambitions and its recently announced self-serve ad platform. Storing hundreds, thousands, and eventually millions of objects uses a lot of data. Not only does storing these in the cloud vs. within the Snapchat app greatly reduce the size of the app, but it will allow objects purchased by advertisers to immediately show up in-app without needing to wait for Snapchat to push an update to its users.Spectacles: The Intersection of AR and Live EventsSnap reported that sales of Spectacles grew over 82% quarter over quarter. While not material to current revenue, Spectacles remains part of the long-term strategy and I believe they will be an important driver of both revenue and increased engagement going forward.Source: Management comments on Q1 '17 Earnings CallThe first version of the product, launched to test the market in November of 2016, solved a problem for nearly every Millennial or Gen Z who has attended a concert - standing with your hands above your head holding your phone to record a video. Spectacles also solved a problem for Snap - making it more likely that these types of videos would be uploaded to Snapchat, increasing the nodes in its messaging network and adding to the amount of live event content uploaded to the platform. Spectacles open up a whole new world of mass adoption of first-person video recordings, AR advertising capabilities, and new revenue streams to nearly every commercial event provider (concerts, sporting events, etc.). Spectacles currently only records video, and the improvements on its flaws and the capabilities of the subsequent iterations of the product will be key (360 video, overlaying images within the glasses, etc.). Similar to how the iPod did one thing well (play music) before the iPhone was introduced; I believe that future iterations of Spectacles will be much more than a simple video camera.ConclusionAt this point in its life cycle, trying to value Snap using traditional valuation metrics based on its historical performance is pointless. The company is going to look completely different in 3-5 years. Snap is sitting on an underused goldmine of user data, as it has barely scratched the surface related to using Google Cloud's image/video/voice/text recognition capabilities or its pre-built machine learning models to analyze the massive amount of messages sent over its platform.Snap is creating an automated ad buying network similar to Facebook and Google, helping the largest corporate advertisers in the world by creating innovative new ad products that blend in with content, fighting their fake news/ad placement problems (a.k.a. advertising supply chain problem), and helping them reach a demographic that cannot be reached anywhere else. Snap has helped solve viewership problems for, and created content partnerships with, nearly every major digital media company and TV network. And a Nielsen study showed that these partnerships are boosting viewers on their partners other platforms - hard to be said about all of the original content planned by the other tech companies. I also still think Snap is in a position to use the TV-style data profiles it has created on its users to create an automated ad buying network for all of the TV networks to plug in to (similar to Google AdSense), as they transition from cable TV to their own individual streaming apps.Snap has created the first AR glasses that people are actually excited about buying, and its patents show some very interesting future applications that it has been planning years in advance. It also, to my knowledge, processes more individual images/videos messages than any other messaging network, which provides Snap a ton of untapped user data opportunities. This critical mass of messaging users also allowed them to crowd source all of the videos sent over the platform to essentially become a combination of Twitter/YouTube.And to be clear, I do not think Facebook will be able to effectively copy Snap's stories search feature. The amount of actual content being posted to Instagram Stories by every day users, not celebrities and social media influencers, is much lower than on Snapchat, and the style of the content uploaded has a much more polished feel to it that does not fit in with the Search product works anyways. The reception of Facebook Stories, Messenger Day, and WhatsApp Statuses has been relatively underwhelming, and I just do not think that Facebook will be able to generate enough content for the product to work effectively on its platforms, at least in the markets where it competes with Snapchat (the only ones that matter right now).I am willing to throw in the towel on Snap if there is something that materially changes my mind in the future, but this earnings report did not do so. When looking at both engagement levels and user growth, both metrics are still increasing. Snap is still in the exact same favorable competitive position it was at 3:59 on May 10th, it is just trading at an even steeper discount to Facebook. Based on a value of $136/DAU (compared to approximately $170/DAU before earnings), Snap continues to trade at a discount to Facebook's $300+/DAU (difficult to determine based on Facebook owning multiple apps, but more details here). While I do not expect Snap to immediately trade up to $40+ to fall in line, I do think that there will be a steady appreciation over the next few years as the market comes to realize Snap's superior ad products and competitive positioning."

Control of the board says it all.Shareholder frustration just beginning. Jack Dorsey part-time CEO.","ThesisSnap (NYSE:SNAP) may be a great asset like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is, but performs poorly as an investment and public company. Management may not want to invest the next 5-10 years of its life working to please Wall Street investors. Taking control of the board speaks volumes about whether it is inclined to appease outside interests. Analysis of valuation and risks for shareholders.SNAPFinancial Media Analysis: Now that Snap is a public company, it's going to hunker down to please Wall Street investors. It's going to grow the company, monetize it, and work really hard to make the stock go higher. Unfortunately, I disagree.Control: Co-Founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy each own about 18% of Snap, but have voting shares that give them control over the board.Board Control: They have board control, so I don't believe that they are focused on pleasing Wall Street. I don't think they are going to run the company by worrying about outside interests from investors and this decision confirms that. This is a much more telling decision than people realize.TwitterInvesting legend Bill Miller says it's ""insane"" for Twitter to have a part-time CEOThe case of Twitter is very important to consider: Jack Dorsey doesn't even work at Twitter full-time and he's the CEO. The situation at SNAP could easily mirror the shareholder disappointment we have seen in Twitter.MotivationThe average S&P 500 CEO made $13.1 million in total compensation last year. By contrast, Evan Spiegel is worth $4B, probably as much as the last 100 CEOs who have appeared on CNBC combined.Jack Dorsey: After Twitter went public, Jack Dorsey lost interest in the company and left to run Square (NYSE:SQ). In my opinion, he has shown minimal interest in pleasing Wall Street or shareholders. Snap's management made sure to gain control of the board before going public. So, the board and shareholders have minimal power as to the way SNAP is run.Unique asset: My guess is that Snap will be run much like Twitter. A great asset that the owners run as they see fit: with minimal interest in earnings, Wall Street, or shareholders. For shareholders at Twitter, there is not much they can do to change this situation. It is what it is.Shareholder Frustrations at TwitterEvery frustrated Twitter shareholder can tell you how they could make Twitter better. They could monetize it, charge advertisers and/ or heavy users, and focus on making money. This would hurt the company, but make shareholders and Wall Street happy. And nothing has happened to change the situation. The investment has been incredibly frustrating to shareholders.TwitterWhy hasn't this happened? Because Jack Dorsey and management aren't really focused on these issues. And there is very little urgency from Twitter. Since the IPO, Twitter employees are incredibly wealthy, as is Jack Dorsey. In my opinion, there isn't an urgency to make shareholders money.Great Asset: I think Twitter is a great asset and the shares could be worth $80 with management that was focused on monetizing the asset. But that is not reality. I accept this situation. I like Twitter as an asset, but I accept the fact that shareholders in Twitter most likely cannot make money. Unfortunately, I believe this will also be the case with Snapchat.SNAP 5 Day Price Returns (Daily) data by YChartsCashing OutIncredible level of compensation paid to SNAP founders and management.Earnings: Nothing in the earnings can justify the current valuation.ValuationsSNAP Market Cap data by YChartsValuations:Snapchat will only be profitable to the extent that management is focused on profits and the stock price.SNAP Market Cap data by YChartsTWTR 3 Year Price Returns (Daily) data by YChartsStrategic IssuesFacebook has been willing to do anything possible to monetize its platform (and upset users) with ads as well as selling private customer data. Wall Street likes it. Customers dislike it. And shareholders have done incredibly well.With Twitter, we see very much the opposite. It has been reticent to monetize the site, charge advertisers, or implement any changes that would increase earnings and please Wall Street. I believe that Snap will follow the lead from Twitter.SNAP: I think management will focus on making the app better, but not necessarily more profitable. This may wind up frustrating today's shareholders.ConclusionI think the valuation for SNAP is extreme. However, the issue for investors to consider is what management's motivation is as a public company to increase earnings and please investors. I think we will see the same frustrations from SNAP shareholders that we have seen from Twitter shareholders. Snap and Twitter may be great assets, that don't make money for shareholders.Follow for more analysis"
4072643,39301,2017-05-12T11:34:36-04:00,"Snap Inc.’s headline figures weren’t very flattering, but the qualitative metrics were still promising given gross margin improvements and ARPU expansion.Furthermore, Snap Inc. remains our top pick for North America Internet, as we view the competition is coming thesis as being flawed, and expectation risk diminished.We’re maintaining our positive stance considering self-serve ad platform introduction, reduction in AWS and Google Cloud service contract costs, and foreign expansion.Snap Inc. fell below $20, and is likely to drop slightly further (perhaps $15), which is where we view near-term support.We maintain our high conviction buy recommendation, and reiterate our $58.57 price target on Snap Inc.","Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) remains our most promising pick in the Internet space notwithstanding the discrepancy in price action following the Q1'17 earnings report. That being the case, the DAU figures fell slightly short of expectations, but we expect the platform to move towards mainstream adoption given the release of new features like ""search,"" and improvement in onboarding tutorials that teaches initial users the various functionalities of Snapchat.As such, we're expecting DAU growth to accelerate notwithstanding the broadly shared sentiment of diminished expectations on revenue/user growth. Furthermore, the ARPU figures were promising, and we're not expecting Snap Inc.'s revenue narrative to be entirely dependent on user monetization.Snap Inc. reported revenue of $149 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $(188.243) million. The GAAP EBITDA figure is a bit inflated in terms of a perceived negative financial impact, as stock-based compensation totaled to $1.992 billion, which is in-line with expectations from the consensus. We're expecting SBC to remain a GAAP earnings headwind, as we have forecasted $2.3 billion in stock-based compensation.Maintaining expectations following Q1'17 resultsComing out of the earnings report the expectation for revenue growth remains elevated. Because we haven't built our quarterly earnings model, we're not in a situation to forecast next quarter's revenue, or non-GAAP dil. EPS.However, we remain constructive on the underlying investment narrative, and view the recent pullback as an attractive entry point for investors wanting to capitalize on the fastest growing mobile social network.For FY'17, we've forecasted revenue of $897 million and non-GAAP dil. EPS of ($1.71). This compares to consensus estimates of $1.03 billion and non-GAAP dil. EPS of $(0.51). We're far more conservative than the current consensus figures, but expect much more upside in terms of revenue/earnings over the long term.We value Snap Inc. via a discounted multiple framework (68x FY'20 non-GAAP dil. EPS), and have assigned a price target of $58.57 using a 20% discount rate (comparable to venture capital models). We expect $2.14 in terms of non-GAAP dil. EPS by FY'20, which is contingent on Snap Inc. growing its installed base of users to 472 million, and ARPU to $15.80 implying FY'20 revenue of $7.47 billion.Furthermore, we're not stating that price recovery is imminent. However, we do believe the recent quarter reset expectations to a point where Snap Inc.'s management can utilize near-term revenue levers to meet consensus expectations. Furthermore, upon reviewing investment bank research notes, expectations on revenue hovers at appx. $1 billion, but based on our global mobile installed base model, and smartphone penetration model, we maintain the stance that DAUs are the primary lever by which Snap Inc. can reasonably ramp revenue without relying on ad-load or increases to ad CPMs (cost per thousand impressions).Key highlights from the quarterly earnings reportSnap Inc. delivered figures that missed expectations by $8.33 million. The Q1'17 GAAP EPS figure doesn't conform with consensus models, and until we build our quarterly non-GAAP dil. EPS figures, it's difficult to articulate comparisons from Q1'17. However, we plan on releasing our quarterly revenue/dil. EPS model to our premium research subscribers first.Notwithstanding, Snap Inc. referenced the adoption of premium digital advertising from top-tier brands like Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), Hollister Co. and L'Oreal (OTCPK:LRLCY). The implications in terms of ARPU should result in heightened ad-unit utilization and diminished expectation on overnight sales/earnings improvements to core operating results, as Snap Inc. is developing back-end technology to improve monetization rather than heightened ad-load.Notwithstanding the hype from the Snap Inc. ""bear camp"" where competition is touted, and expectations on DAU expansion too conservative or unreasonable, we're expecting back half acceleration in terms of mobile DAUs, and anticipate this trajectory to sustain from a multi-year framework.Also, Snap Inc.'s CFO, Drew Vollero reduced infrastructure cost, or cloud service contract costs between Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services:Given Snap's hyper scale datacenter utilization, both AWS and Google Cloud must build out infrastructure ahead of forecasted utilization. Hence, the service contracts represent a significant portion of gross/operating costs, but become less substantial over a multi-year framework, and with the announced reductions of 12% compared to prior year, we expect gross profit figures to perform better than initial expectations. We have yet to model the COGs via the amended wholesale contract, but expect cloud service contract costs to be comparable to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) at a $5 billion+ revenue run rate, which implies gross margins of 80%-90%.Furthermore, we're not expecting COGs to ramp beyond our implied forecasts unless if Snap Inc. were to miraculously grow its DAU figures above 1 billion, and video compression tech lags datacenter utilization in the foreseeable five years. In other words, there's plenty of upside in terms of gross margins, and we don't expect Snap Inc.'s financial trajectory to worsen, but rather improve on the expectations of reasonable cost ramp paired with OpEx increases that are trending below our implied forecast. As such, we're planning on revising our model to account for a more conservative ramp on OpEx due to the unexpected usage of cost levers.The commentary on ad load conforms to our ARPU model considering Imran Kahn's comments from the earnings conference call:As such, we maintain our stance on ARPUs, but may adjust higher on more visible evidence of heightened ad unit utilization, and introduction of new ad units.Should investors buy Snap Inc. now?Source: TC2000The stock fell 21.45% in the span of a single session; given the lack of identifiable support/resistance levels, the technical indicators aren't very useful. However, if we had to make a guess as to where near-term support is, we think $15 is a good area, and we don't anticipate the stock to trend much further below $20 by the end of the year.However, there's no denying the heightened short interest (approximately 8% of current shares outstanding), but we're extremely skeptical that investors should position themselves ahead of further declines. Clearly, the stock has taken a nose dive, but we're not expecting missed execution to continue for much longer, as we believe the fundamental narrative remains solid.As such, we're still maintaining our long-term price target.Final thoughtsWe're optimistic on international expansion, as foreign geographic revenue contribution doubled from 7% to 14%. Snap Inc. isn't as dependent on foreign expansion as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but we remain constructive on international contribution as we expect adoption/network effect to take hold over the next couple of quarters, which increases the emphasis on DAU growth as opposed to monetization.Furthermore, we saw promising indications from the report when pertaining to Snap Inc.'s self-serve platform, which was released just last week. We think foreign contribution, introduction of new ad-tech, and diminished expectations on FY'17 results are supportive of our original investment thesis.As such, we maintain our high conviction buy recommendation and $58.57 price target.About Cho's Technology ResearchCho's Technology Research is SA's premier technology research package that gives investors and traders an additional edge when investing into tech companies.

4073301,101887,2017-05-15T12:03:03-04:00,Snap is trading like Facebook did after its IPO.A look at how Facebook bottomed as analysts were falling over themselves to downgrade it.Snap is a speculative stock. Where will speculators likely step in?,"Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are two very different companies. Comparing the them on fundamentals doesn't really work.That said, a company and a stock are two very different things too. Stocks are driven by sentiment and positioning as well as fundamentals.Consequently, stocks can behave in very similar ways when certain conditions are present. This is evident in SNAP and FB. Despite the differences in the companies, the stock action following their IPOs is remarkably similar:Both stocks sold off heavily soon after the IPO, found support, but broke down again following their first earnings release.The question is, what drivers make these two stocks act so similarly, and could the similarities continue?When IPOs Go WrongI still remember the Facebook IPO. Bears (like me) quite smugly thought ""I told you so"" when we saw prices crash from $45 down to the $17s. FB was too hyped, too overvalued, and the IPO was little more than a way to fleece investors.In case you forgot the details of the IPO saga, this CNN article ""Facebook IPO: What the %$#! happened?"" will refresh your memory. The title says it all really.Facebook was valued at $104bn, which many thought crazy. It was, after all, 100 times trailing earnings. Even worse, there were some signs of slowing growth. This CNN analyst gave us ""5 reasons not to like Facebook's IPO,"" including slowing growth, rising expenses, and falling sales.And he wasn't ""wrong"" to report this, perhaps just short sighted.Source: Facebook Annual Report 2012With all the doubts aired before the IPO, and with the stock price plunging, Facebook's first quarterly earnings as a public company were a sucker punch. Q2 reported EPS of -$0.08, when estimates were $0.09, causing a gap to new lows.It all looked a bit hopeless, and very few people anticipated what would come next.A little over a month later, FB bottomed and never looked back.Snap!Snap IPO'd at $17 in March and was up 44% on the first day of trading before collapsing in the same way as Facebook. The $28bn valuation was again the main concern in relation to revenues, with slowing user growth and competition from Facebook contributing to the woes.Concerns were amplified on Snap's first earnings release. A large bottom line miss, lower than expected revenues and slower user growth caused the stock to sell off 20%.I can certainly see why investors are disappointed and why sentiment is at rock bottom. But things always look bad at the lows.As analysts are downgrading left right and center I wonder if they are being myopic.Facebook missed bottom line estimates for its first three earnings as a publicly trade company. It posted losses in its first two earnings. Analysts were busy downgrading and slashing price forecasts, even when prices were reversing right under their noses.This is from Venture Beat from August 31st 2012:What I love about that article is that Facebook bottomed the very next session. And it wasn't because of earnings or a fundamental change; they came later. Quite simply, the stock price got low enough for investors to take a gamble on the future.Snapchat is a similar gamble. That is why fundamentals may take a back seat for now and the stock may bottom on extreme positioning and sentiment.Trading StrategySpeculators use techniques like technical analysis and measured moves to get an idea when cycles of selling or buying are likely to conclude.Facebook made a measured move (more on this here) from the post IPO high and projected a low at $15.86. I have observed price often reverses slightly early at the 90% projection, and this was the case with FB as it bottomed a few cents below this measurement.A similar measured move in SNAP projects a low of $13.85, with a 90% measurement at $14.91.I expect SNAP to bottom in this region in the next 1-3 months.Whether any recovery is as impressive as Facebook's remains to be seen. Sentiment and positioning can take a stock only so far without fundamental justification. The idea here is to buy low before the improvements and the upgrades arrive. If you wait for the herd you could be buying 100% higher.ConclusionsAnalyzing SNAP on current fundamentals is very difficult and I suspect many are making the same mistakes they did with Facebook at the 2012 lows. Certainly the sentiment and positioning must be similar as this is reflected in the price patterns.Using Facebook and price cycles as a guide I believe SNAP can bottom in the $13.85-$14.91 region as speculators step in to buy."
4072275,73185,2017-05-11T14:37:14-04:00,"Bullish FB, bearish SNAP has been our stance for some time now.SNAP's Q1 numbers seem to support that stance, as it is becoming increasingly clear that FB's copycat efforts are stalling SNAP's growth.SNAP remains richly valued, and the stock could head significantly lower.","We haven't been all that secretive about our bullish Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), bearish Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stance since FB launched Instagram Stories in August of 2016.The argument has been pretty simple. Everything that makes Snapchat popular is easily replicable (ephemeral messaging, Stories, filters, etc.). Facebook will play copycat, leverage its unparalleled size across four major apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, each of which have at least four times the number of users as Snapchat), and ultimately consolidate the social media demographic.After all, with Instagram becoming more and more Snapchat-like day by day, the list of reasons for a user to have both the photo-centric social media apps continues to shrink.It looks like the numbers are supporting our thesis (so far). SNAP's first earnings report as a publicly traded company was everything a bear hoped for and everything a bull feared. For all the hype they received, Spectacles have largely been a flop, and the prospects of a hardware business have grown more bleak. That leaves Snap's current value as roughly equivalent to the value of the Snapchat social media app, but growth there continues to underwhelm.Snapchat only added 8 million daily active users in the quarter. That compares to 5 million last quarter and 5 million the quarter before, so it looks like Snapchat is settling into an era of 5-8 million new DAUs per quarter. When Facebook was Snap's size, it was adding 9 million new DAUs per quarter in North America alone. Snapchat is adding about 3 million new DAUs per quarter in North America.ARPU growth is also underwhelming as global ARPU, North America ARPU, and Europe ARPU all declined sequentially from Q4. It is not terribly bullish that a company so young in its ARPU growth cycle (only $1.81 in North America versus $17.07 for Facebook) is already experiencing cyclical growth.Overall, revenues came up short of expectations, and expenses were out of control. Losses were wider than expected, and management didn't do much to soothe the concerns of disappointed investors on the conference call.The result: SNAP's stock shed about a fourth of its value in just a few minutes. The stock has rebounded a little bit in trading on Thursday, 5/11, but remains down about 20%.SNAP data by YChartsIn our opinion, the market isn't overreacting. In fact, it may be under-reacting. SNAP stock remains too richly valued.The important correlation for investors to focus on here is that Snap's troubles began as soon as Facebook began playing copycat. Facebook really started the copycat game with the roll-out of Instagram Stories in August. Around that time, Snap's user growth started to slow, and growth of 21 million new DAUs in 2Q16 slowed to 10 million new DAUs in 3Q16.Facebook accelerated its copycat efforts over the next several months, rolling out Facebook Day, Messenger Day, WhatsApp Status, and buffing out Instagram to incorporate almost all of Snapchat's signature features. At the same time, Snapchat's user growth continued to slow in Q4 to 5 million new DAUs. DAU growth is now stabilizing around a pedestrian mid-to-high single-digit level.A cross-examination of the numbers is actually quite shocking. In under a year, Instagram Stories has 20% more users than Snapchat. In just a few months, WhatsApp Status has 5% more users than Snapchat. We bet that those numbers will just grow over time.At the end of the day, we don't really know what sort of sustainable value Snap has as a company. With stalled user base growth, a flopping hardware business, and intense competition from a much, much bigger competitor, being long SNAP stock is risky even if the valuation was somewhat realistic. Instead, SNAP stock continues to sport a rich valuation at somewhere around 20 times this year's aggressive sales estimate.All in all, we only see further downside ahead for SNAP's stock."
4072667,103048,2017-05-12T13:17:00-04:00,Snap has burned through an enormous amount of cash this quarter.Snap does seem to have built up a brand name and still does have features that Instagram and FB don't seem to have.It is a fairly long road before Snap achieves profitability.Facebook is imitating Snapchat successfully and stealing daily active users.Snapchat reported a net $2 billion loss for this quarter.,"Over the past couple years, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has been the poster child for millennial social media. Snapchat was made by a few teenagers who made their dream a reality. The company has been somewhat successful in terms of users with over 166 million daily users. It was riding on a lot of hype when it first had its IPO and not a lot of substance. Hype can cause a stock to rise substantially, but the raw numbers which were reported this Wednesday gave shareholders a dose of reality. People who bought in during Snapchat's IPO are down over 30 percent today. Needless to say, the earnings did not live up to expectations.Snapchat reported first quarter earnings on May 10 and reported an EPS loss $0.20 (adj) falling below analyst expectations of $0.16 (adj). Revenue came in at $149.6 million, falling way below analyst expectations of $159 million. The market also was not impressed with user growth and how fast Snap was burning through cash.When we saw Snapchat's earnings, we saw everything. We saw the truth. We did not see a profitable and thriving company which many investors, particularly millennial investors, thought it was when they bought shares during its IPO. What we saw was quite the opposite. We saw Snapchat miss on almost every single metric.Snapchat shares dropped over 20 percent from $22 to around $18 after first quarter results were announced. Evan Spiegel, the CEO of Snapchat, saw his net worth drop by over $1.2 billion after earnings.A Cash Guzzling MachineOne big reason for this massive quarter miss was the expenses Snapchat had this quarter. It had a net loss of over $2 billion. Now to be fair, it does claim that much of it is due to stock-based expenses. And, it would be OK if that was the only metric showing increased expenses. The adjusted EBITDA showed a loss of $188 million, which is a 100% increase from 2016. That is an increase at an absurd rate. One has to wonder what Snapchat is spending all this cash on.Additionally, this is not the only cost that we saw increase at a rapid rate. The cost of revenue for SNAP more than doubled to $175 million from last year.All of these statistics highlight one major thing. Cash flow is a major problem for SNAP, and with the earnings we saw, I can't see it being resolved anytime soon. This, combined with the fact that SNAP burns cash at a terribly fast rate, is only asking for trouble.Source: Simply Wall StFacebook DebacleEvan Spiegel, the CEO of Snap, said that ""just because Yahoo has a search box doesn't mean they're Google"", when asked about if Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is a threat or not. Now, I'm a little confused how he can say this when Instagram's daily story users have surpassed the amount of daily Snapchat users. While Snapchat sits under 200 million daily users, Instagram story users have surpassed 200 million daily users. The comparison is apples and oranges; it is not the same thing at all. Just like Yahoo (YHOO), if Snapchat fails to innovate and appeal to people in a stand-out way, it will lose a considerable amount of users to Facebook. Snapchat is currently fighting an uphill battle against the social media juggernaut, Facebook. Not only does Facebook have a much more experienced management, but it already has a strong daily active user base and cash position.Facebook has forced Snapchat into a position where Snapchat needs to innovate, not Facebook. Facebook can just imitate all of Snapchat's features like it has been doing so far. The CEO of Instagram, Kevin Systrom, even admitted in an interview that Instagram stories is just an imitation of Snapchat stories. Snapchat needs to somehow stand out from Instagram, but that is growing harder and harder with each passing Instagram update. Instagram already has imitated its video and image filters, added live streaming, and also added Facebook stories. In this game of back and forth between Facebook and Snapchat, Facebook can outlast Snapchat. Make no mistake, while Facebook is imitating Snapchat, Snapchat is the company playing catch up. Instagram recently surpassed 700 million viewers while Snapchat reported that it had 161 million viewers for the first quarter. While this is not a bad starting point for Snapchat, the user growth trend for Snapchat paints a bad picture.(Source)User growth for Snapchat has slowed down significantly ever since Instagram stories was launched. There is no doubt that this decline in user growth correlates with Instagram stories' surge in users. Instagram stories alone is used by over 200 million people daily. Snapchat only has around 160 million users. Snapchat had 158 million active users in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 166 million users for this quarter. This was a quarter of dismal growth compared to Instagram's rapid growth.Another thing shareholders need to keep in mind is that Snapchat is making no money currently. Snap reported a net loss of $2 billion this quarter. With the company missing analyst expectations by nearly $10 million, it becomes ever more apparent that Snapchat needs to find a way to start making money or cut down on expenses.What is Snapchat innovating right now, you may ask? Well, it is making camera spectacles, which will hopefully help bring in more revenue, right? Wrong, the company has sold around 96,000 spectacles since they were launched two quarters ago and has only brought in $12.5 million of revenue for the company. Less than 1 percent of all snaps came from their spectacles. Who would have guessed that selling a product like the Google Glass (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which flopped, in vending machines scattered around the country was a bad idea?Conclusion: With rising expenses, horrible operating cash flow, and shrinking user growth, it is hard to somehow justify owning Snapchat stock. Unless Snapchat starts out-innovating Facebook, it is hard to see it come out on top versus the social media giant. For now, that does not look like it is going to happen anytime soon. The first quarter earnings for Snapchat was just one of many red flags, this red flag, though, was felt the most by shareholders. I would give Snapchat a strong sell rating right now."
4072461,48431,2017-05-11T22:27:54-04:00,Snap's Murphy and Spiegel have the power.Shareholder rights law firms investigate Snap for securities violations.Amazon's Echo Show is watching you.,"Rethink Technology business briefs for May 11, 2017.Snap's Murphy and Spiegel have the powerSource: SnapSnap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) reported earnings for its first post-IPO quarter after the bell yesterday, and today the stock plunged about 21%. The company posted a GAAP net loss of $2.211 billion on revenue of $149.6 million. How do you lose that much money that fast?It's easy. The two key founding officers, CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Robert Murphy, simply give themselves 200+ million shares apiece of their own recently IPO'd company. Snap listed stock-based compensation expense of $1.992 billion. I presume that $1.99 billion included the share distributions to all of the Snap officers.But you can't say they didn't warn everyone. They filed the necessary SEC Form 3 disclosures right on March 1, 2017. Murphy received 107.3 million shares of Class A stock and 107.9 million shares of Series FP Preferred Stock. Spiegel received 101 million shares of Class A stock and 107.9 million shares of Series FP Preferred Stock. When I first saw the numbers, I had to count the decimal places just to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was seeing.Well, as they say, greed is good, and this pair is the goodest. But there is an implication here, which is that these guys aren't particularly interested in making a go of it. Even excluding SBC, the company had a non-GAAP EBITDA of -$188 million and Free Cash Flow of -$173 million.Gross margin is a negative 9.1% with cost of revenue at $163.358 million. Snap reported that Daily Active Users (DAUs) grew to 166 million in Q1, a 36% y/y increase. Average revenue per user (ARPU) was up 181% y/y to $0.9. This is good growth, but sequentially not so hot. DAUs increased only 5% q/q, and ARPU actually decreased 14% q/q. Anyone can see where this treadmill is going.TechCrunch has pointed out that Snap's sole hardware product, Spectacles, probably only sold about 64,000 pairs in Q1. Snap is fundamentally a social media company, competing with the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). It is already looking like the next GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), only sooner and steeper.Shareholder rights law firms investigate Snap for securities violationsOnly a day has gone by since the earnings report, and already three different (by my count) law firms are starting investigations of Snap for securities violations. These are Goldberg Law PC, Khang & Khang LLP, and Johnson & Weaver LLP.Johnson & Weaver's statement is typical of the concerns:Amazon's Echo Show is watching youSource: AmazonThe Echo Show is Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) more capable version of the two-year old Echo smart speaker. It has a small 7-inch touchscreen and a video camera and offers voice interaction through Amazon's Alexa AI.I generally consider all these types of interactive AI devices pretty interesting, although not all that useful. And there are obvious privacy concerns with a device that's always listening for your voice commands.Or, in the case of Show, watching for you to make an appearance. The WSJ points out that the camera, needed for video calling, also serves as a motion detector so that Show will activate when you enter the camera's field of view. That means the camera is always on, with some software running inside Show that analyzes the video for motion. Whereas the Echo smart speaker only activates when the ""wake word"" is spoken, Show activates whenever someone comes into view.The image processing is all local to the device, so there's no transmission of video over the Internet until you make a call, but it does raise the concern that the devices could be hacked, allowing a virtual intruder video access to your home. You can always turn off the camera and microphone, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the device.Amazon assures us that it understands how important privacy and security are to customers, and I don't doubt its sincerity. If everything works as intended, I'm sure privacy and security are respected. It's when things don't work as intended that I worry."
4072412,101924,2017-05-11T19:22:56-04:00,"Snap had a disastrous 2017 1Q earnings report, which saw its stock price fall by over 20 percent, thanks to lower-than-expected revenue and user growth.Snap's growth is seriously impacted by competition from Facebook, and investors should be seriously concerned about whether CEO Spiegel is up to this job.The company is a major innovator and has further monetization potential, but it's unclear what its innovation goals are, and investors should stay away.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has been one of the most talked about stocks of 2017, with analysts all over the place on its future prospects. And the company's disastrous 2017 1Q results have caused those debates to sprout up all over again, with price estimates ranging from a pitiful $9 per share to a bullish high $20s. This is hardly surprising, as Snap saw user and revenue growth fail to meet expectations and the company continues to hemorrhage money like there is no tomorrow.The poor earnings report saw the stock on Wednesday crash by over 20 percent, from $23 to $18 per share. There is no denying that Snap is very interesting and investors should not overreact on one earnings report. But this earnings report makes clear that the fundamental issues which many investors had with Snap before its IPO are not going to go away. In fact, some of those problems - like Snap's path to profitability and the concerns surrounding CEO Evan Spiegel - are more apparent than ever.This is not a time to jump in on a stock at a bargain price. This is a time to stay away from Snap.Growth and LeadershipThe fundamental problem which investors had with Snap going into its IPO was that the company was massively unprofitable, but its growth indicators like revenue and users were slowing down in the face of competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Spiegel and Snap's backers tried to brush these worries aside by stating that it was a temporary blip, but this latest earning report and the disappointing user growth belies that claim. Instagram Stories surpassed Snapchat's total users in April, and Mark Zuckerberg's announced major ambitions with web design in the same month were interpreted by many as a direct shot at Snapchat.So what is Snapchat's plan to deal with competition from Facebook? Your guess is as good as mine. In Evan Spiegel's first conference call, he brushed off Facebook by stating that it was the Yahoo to his Google and said that advertisers would eventually see the benefits which Snapchat had to offer. It is possible that Spiegel is trying to give a calm portrayal to ease nervous investors, but it also looks he may be out of touch.Spiegel himself is, in fact, another pre-IPO concern about Snap that has not been alleviated. Spiegel and his allies control the overwhelming majority of shares, as Snap only dealt out non-voting shares in its IPO. This allows him to do whatever he wishes without the involvement of shareholders, and investors have wondered whether he has the experience and temperament to lead Snap through the difficult periods which every company has. Snap faces a serious threat in Facebook competition, and yet Spiegel is far too blasé about how to deal with it.Innovation - to what end?Snap optimists are claiming that while these 1Q results are disappointing, it should not take away from Snapchat's potential. Morgan Stanley, a major initial investor in Snap, said Snapchat's ""success going forward... will come down to its ability to continue innovating and improving its user offerings, engagement and ad product suite.""It is true that Snap is a highly innovative company, with forays into wearables and mobile advertising among other fields. But once again, the ugly ghost of Facebook rears its head. As advertising competition gets more intense, Snapchat faces problems on how to distinguish itself from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) or Facebook for those precious dollars.Snap wants to claim that its advantages are its millennial-heavy demographic and mobile advertising. However, I remain skeptical about how much Snapchat can extract from millennials before they head to Instagram, and Facebook and Google already have a strong presence in mobile.Snap's growth is slowing down, and it is hard to see just how the company will pick that growth up again. Innovation is not a magic word which will fix that problem.Too many problemsSnap is not doomed, but it faced real, tough questions before its IPO and still has not given satisfactory answers for many of them. How much trust can investors really place in Spiegel? What is Snap's path to profitability? Will it be able to sustain high user and revenue growth in the face of competition from Facebook?Until Snap can recover user growth or show that it has a plan beyond hoping user growth will turn itself around, investors should look elsewhere. Investors who already have Snap, however, may want to consider holding for now, as the stock does have potential if the right decisions are made, but understand that Snap carries a lot of risk."
4072067,86896,2017-05-11T04:50:30-04:00,"The Snapchat app lacks the advertising space of Facebook without corrupting its appeal.Earnings were underwhelming, while executives basically cash in on snapchat, running up IPO expenses.While iffy earnings are understandable in a newer public company, the slowing user growth is a bad sign.","Snap inc. (NYSE:SNAP) was a flawed concept from the beginning. In terms of making money, social media is all about advertising. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) manages to pull it off because their platform allows space for ads. When you scroll through the website stalking your friends vs. actually hanging out with them, you're exposed to ads for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) the entire time. The Snapchat app lacks the opportunity for advertising. With simple, short videos, the only way to advertise on a large scale would be to start inputting ads between viewings. This is the exact thing that everyone now hates about Youtube.Just think about it. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has an arguably much stronger platform for advertising revenue. As you scroll through, you're exposed to all those ""sponsored"" tweets. Companies can have their own Twitter accounts to push their initiatives. CEO's can get the word out. And then there's the retweets. Theoretically it's a great asset for exposure. In spite of this, Twitter has failed to make money over and over again. The template for Snap is far less ad friendly. How then, are they to succeed while Twitter continually struggles to do so?FinancialsFor the first quarter, Snap reported a 286% increase in revenue year over year for a grand total of $149.64 million. Ironically the company reported a loss of over $2.2 billion in net income. It is worth noting that a lot of the losses came from compensation expenses. Without them, the losses would have been more like $200 million. All of this amounted to $2.31 loss per share.Sales and marketing expenses grew by 1300% to obtain that 286% increase in revenue. The $219.73 million in sales and marketing expenses are nearly 50% higher than the company's overall revenue. I could see forgiving this figure as the company tries to ramp up its business; but only if the number of users increased exponentially. These users would represent future potential earnings from more ad exposure. Unfortunately, Snap's daily user growth was only 5% from Q4'16. Year over year, user growth is 36%. That might seem good, but when you compare it to the 53% user growth that Snap acquired in the Q1'16, it's not as encouraging.Competitors, thin market spaceRegardless of the revenue growth, I see Snap struggling in the future. The business market that it operates in is very tough. You have three companies with similar products. Facebook has instagram. Then there's Twitter, and Snapchat. While Twitter is slightly different, instagram is incredibly similar in format. You post pictures and videos (that don't disappear) with small text underneath. It also already outpaces Snapchat in users. I suspect this is because the pictures you take time to make don't vanish into nothing.Facebook is taking strides to ensure that instagram is more appealing than Snapchat. Things like instagram stories makes Snapchat virtually unnecessary. For most people, its more preferable to have more features in less social mediums. That is what Facebook is doing. When you factor in its superior marketing power, it's tough to see Snap growing into a monster success. I'll be covering Snap Inc. as things progress, but based on the slowing user growth, this one seems to already be facing limited upside."
4072202,102306,2017-05-11T12:01:30-04:00,Bloomberg consensus DAU estimates were 168 million; 3 large brokers had 166 million or lower.Decelerating user growth Y/Y continued but DAUs accelerated Q/Q.We thought SNAP would pull more levers on ARPU; they didn’t.,"Apparently ,when we are wrong with Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP), we are very wrong. In our preview, we said that we thought average revenue per user would continue to perform well and that, if Snapchat really hit the ball out of the park, they may get to 170 million daily active users (DAU). This was on the upside of our estimates and would have implied an impressive acceleration on a Q/Q basis. As it happened, ARPU was $0.90, down from $1.05 sequentially and DAUs were 166 million, up from 158 million sequentially.Although the ARPU was disappointing to us, we think the DAU growth was more or less in line. Indeed, we look at the improvement favorably because it suggests an acceleration from the relatively slower growth in Q4. In Q4, DAUs grew only 5 million sequentially; in Q1, DAUs grew by 8 million. While the Y/Y growth rate continued to fall, this was more a function of the compounding impact of the weak Q4 than a weak Q1.The problem is, DAUs appear to be the primary driver for the stock. Bloomberg consensus estimated 168 million DAUs. We think this framed the quarter in a starkly different light than it should have been framed. Bloomberg averaged estimates from Aegis, Cantor Fitzgerald, Susquehanna, Monness Crespi, RBC, and Cowen.With Monness Crespi's 173 million estimate skewing the average up, we think that the ""consensus"" was overly aggressive and not a good reflection of actual sentiment on the estimate. Indeed, we were able to get our hands on three top-tier reports, which all suggested a lower hurdle for SNAP. Merrill Lynch had 166m, JPMorgan had 166m and Morgan Stanley's number was just 164m.Unfortunately, the trading algorithms picked up on the aggressive estimates, drove the stock down, and with the free float of only a small percentage of the shares outstanding, the stock is currently down ~20%.Our view is that the numbers do not change the story for SNAP. This quarter was full of distractions - management and employees looking for houses and guessing how much money they are going to be worth and doing road shows for the investment banks. We think management performed adequately on the call (and better than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in its first quarter as a public company).We think there are some parallels to be drawn between Snap and Facebook. Prior to FB's first quarter, the stock had already fallen from its IPO price of $38 to $26.84. After reporting earnings, the stock fell to $23.70 and continued to soften over the next two months to a closing low of $17.73. Nearly five years later, the shares are $150.The point here is not to say that SNAP will follow FB's script but rather to suggest that the first quarters after an IPO are not great indicators for the subsequent success of the firm or the share price. We think management is doing the right things and we continue to hold the stock. Our bullishness was clearly misplaced in the short term but the fundamental thesis, which we (try to) separate from just gazing at a chart, remains intact.(Source for quotations given at the end of the video)"
4071907,22148,2017-05-10T17:45:08-04:00,"Snap reported highly disappointing Q1 numbers.The stock was priced for perfection, setting up shareholders for failure.Avoid any temptation to buy this dip.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is trading down 25% in after-hours trading after reporting an expected ugly quarter. The market though apparently 'hoped' the new social stock could nonetheless impress.Even at $17.25, Snap is worth in excess of $20 billion. Is there any reason to own the stock on this dip?The headlines reported that Snap produced a $2.2 billion loss on $150 million in revenues. The huge loss included a massive $2.0 billion charge for stock-based compensation. The bigger issue was that revenues missed analyst targets of $158 million.Still, the market can get past missing estimates with 286% revenue growth. The problem though is that Snap doubled the losses in the process.The cleanest figure provided by the social company is the adjusted EBITDA number. Snap lost $188 million this year after losing $93 million last Q1.These numbers show no leverage in the system and no legitimate path to profits. Snap has to triple revenues with minimal cost increases to reach breakeven EBITDA.Quarterly expenses were over $350 million with $163 million coming from costs of revenues. Any company with a negative profit margin just isn't investable.This scenario doesn't seem likely with minimal user growth. Snap saw DAUs grow to 166 million during Q1, up 5% sequentially for the quarter.The user growth slightly re-accelerated from the minimal 5 million users added sequentially in Q4. The market can't reach pie in the sky multiples without users doubling and tripling over the next few years and this pace is only suggesting 20% growth.The revenue miss has to question the $2 billion target for 2018 and the valuation is still too high. With around 1.3 billion diluted shares outstanding, Snap has a market value near $23 billion. The stock trades at 11x 2018 sales estimates which is extremely high for a company with no legitimate path to near-term profits.The key investor takeaway is that my warning that Snap investors weren't going to like the story was ignored. The stock rallied into earnings despite clear evidence that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was stealing users via copied products such as Instagram Stories.Snap remains uninvestable burning $173 million in cash during the quarter while trading at a premium valuation and facing extreme competition from the market leader."

""What other kind of lesson is there?""- Stephen O'Connor, ""Here Comes Another Lesson""Man must suffer to be wise.- Aeschylus, ""Agamemnon""Finding The Right FilterSnap, Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the parent of the social network Snapchat, is famous for such innovative image filters as the vomit rainbow (pictured above), and the flower crown. After Snap missed on pretty much everything Wednesday, perhaps the most fitting image shared on social media was this Crying Michael Jordan with a Snapchat flower crown:Now that the dust has settled, let's consider three lessons. Two of these, relating to big gaps down, are similar to other recent tech stocks we've looked at, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) (Twilio's Tumble) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) (Crash Protection Kicks In); the first, though, is unique to Snap.Three Lessons From SNAP's Slide1. Know What You're Up AgainstSnap longs were up against Mark Zuckerberg, the greatest entrepreneur of his generation, and, as CEO of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the head of one half of the Internet advertising duopoly. It's probably not news to any reader that Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and Facebook dominate Internet advertising, but the extent to which they do may be surprising to some. As Jason Kint of Digital Content Next pointed out at the end of last year, an astonishing 99% of the growth in ad revenues year over year from 3Q 2015 to 3Q 2016 was captured by Facebook and Google.But wait - it gets worse. Year over year in Q4, Google and Facebook captured 115% of all the growth in ad revenues:While it's possible that Snapchat can eventually innovate its way into a profitable piece of the Internet ad space, it's got to contend with Facebook copying its ideas.Maybe the best case for Snap would be if Facebook and Google decided to leave a little of the Internet advertising business on the table for it (and perhaps Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) - to effectively prop up enough competition to stave off the antitrust sentiment we mentioned in a previous article about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN):In any case, owning a stock like Snap is especially risky. Let's look at how two approaches to limiting risk would have worked this week, stop orders and hedging.2. Stop Orders Don't Protect You When A Stock Gaps DownAs with the Twilio miss last week, and the Yelp fiasco earlier this week, the 5-day chart of Snap below offers yet another dramatic example of a gap down after a bad quarter.If you had a stop order or a limit sell order to sell your SNAP shares at, say, $20, you wouldn't have gotten out at $20 on Thursday, because the stock never traded at that price then. You would have been down ~21%.2. Hedging Still Limits Your Risk When Stocks Gap DownHere's an example with an optimal collar hedge on SNAP as of Tuesday's close.The May 10th Optimal Collar Hedge:As of May 10th's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 1,000 shares of SNAP against a greater than 16% drop by late October while not capping an investor's upside at less than 11% by the end of that time period (screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iOS app).As you can see at the bottom of the second screen capture above, the net cost of this hedge was negative, meaning you would have collected $200 when opening it (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls). This was the highest-cap hedge available with negative or zero cost over that time frame on Wednesday.The point of this hedge was that the investor could tolerate a decline of 16%, but no more than that. Let's see where you'd be had you hedged then and held since.How The May 10th Collar Responded To SNAP's DropHere's an updated quote on the put leg as of Thursday's close:And here is an updated quote on the call leg:How That Hedge Snapped Snap's SlideSNAP closed at $22.98 on Wednesday, May 10th. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $22,980 in SNAP shares plus $1,850 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call leg, he would have needed to pay $2,050 to do that. So, his net position value on May 10th was ($22,980 + $1,850) - $2,050 = $22,780.SNAP closed at $18.05 on Thursday, May 11th, down about 21% from its closing price on May 10th. The investor's shares were worth $18,050 as of 5/11, his put options were worth $3,700, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $550, using the midpoint of the spread in both cases. So ($18,050 + $3,700) - $550 = $21,200. $21,200 represents a 6.9% drop from $18,050.More Protection Than PromisedSo, although SNAP had dropped by about 21% at the time of the calculations above, and the hedge was designed to limit an investor to a loss of no more than 16%, he would actually have been down 6.9% on his combined net hedge plus underlying stock position by this point. This is another example of the impact of time value on a hedge designed to protect based on its intrinsic value alone."

On an SBC-adjusted basis, net loss of $0.23/share compares unfavorably to consensus loss of $0.19.Source: Company reportsThe terrible headline numbers mask a slight improvement in DAU (daily active users), which was up 5% sequentially and reversed a growth deceleration trend that had started to take form last year (DAU was up only 3% sequentially last quarter vs. 7% in 3Q16). Remember, from one of my previous articles, that this level of growth is what I project would be necessary, on average, for the company to produce $1 in EPS by 2020 and justify a stock price in the low $20s by then. This, however, might have been the only piece of slightly positive news to come out of Snap's earnings release.I was very negatively surprised to see the sharp sequential decline in ARPU (average revenue per user) this quarter, to $0.90 from $1.05 in 4Q16. I understand that seasonality might play a role, as the company has exited the 2016 holiday quarter. But keep in mind that ARPU in fact grew by 3% in 1Q16, which makes this quarter's 14% drop seem a bit concerning.Snap might still be in the early innings of its monetization efforts, considering the company made its first ad dollar as recently as 2014. But to reach the $3 ARPU that I believe is needed to prove the Snap business model viable and the stock price justifiable, it looks to me like there is quite a bit of work yet to be done.Elsewhere on the earnings report, GAAP gross margin of -9% is better than the -12% achieved in 2016 but is still not something that the company might want to brag about. Hosting cost of $0.60 per DAU continues to look very high to me (+15% YOY), considering the modest $0.90 in ARPU. I doubt, however, that investors will care as much about profitability this early in the game, especially since Snap seems to have a lot of work to do on the user growth and monetization fronts first.My takeawaysSnap missed its first chance to reward investors who, despite the company's sizable historic losses and uncertainties going forward, chose to give this young tech incumbent a shot. The company continues to be a wild card, and investing in the stock today has become an even riskier proposition, in my view.In the short term, I expect SNAP to bounce around rather frantically. Traders looking to make a buck on the swings will likely fuel the volatility. But looking further out in the future, 1Q17 results served to push the company farther away, and not closer to, what I believe it needs to produce to justify the current stock price. The minimal level of confidence I had in Snap earlier this year has hit rock-bottom tonight.To reiterate my previous opinion, I believe investors looking for a great internet company to put their money in could give Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) some consideration. If anything, SNAP might be better suited for speculating at this point.Note from the author: I invite you to follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

These reports are always highly volatile as the market has to gauge the accuracy of analyst estimates and the quality of management forecasts not knowing historical trends.The stock has jumped back to $22.50 despite news that Instagram Stories is stealing the thunder from Snapchat. The good numbers from Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) helped the sector stock, but many questions remain with the upcoming quarterly report.The number that matters the most when Snap releases Q1 results on May 10 is the DAUs. As my previous research highlighted, the biggest issue when the company went public back in March was the startling slowdown in user growth.The social platform only saw Q4 users grow sequentially to 158 million, up 5 million or 3.3% from the prior quarter. The introduction of Instagram Stories by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in October and the recent revelation that the copy cat version reached 200 million users were a bad sign.As a review, Snap reported the following results for the prior quarterly periods. The massive losses combined with the slower user growth are a huge problem.The market will love the possibility of revenue growth in the 300% range, but one will want to note that costs are likely to grow at an absolute number in excess of the revenue gains. With 1.2 billion shares outstanding used in the loss calculation, analysts are forecasting a net loss in excess of $200 million following only a $170 million loss in Q4.The average analyst estimates further highlight the potential volatility after Q1 earnings. Analysts forecast an average loss of $0.19 per share with a high estimate of $0.06 per share and a low estimate of $0.61 per share.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe range is massive considering 1.2 billion shares outstanding. The scary part is that the average revenue estimate is only $158 million and each $0.10 per share loss amounts to $150 million. Snap quickly reports a loss double revenue estimates at those numbers.Ultimately, the key is Q2 guidance. Analysts forecast a nearly $50 million sequential revenue increase and a rather large reduction in the forecasted EPS loss.The $27 billion stock valuation is hard to justify even with Snap hitting the $2.06 billion revenue target in 2018. Any signs the company misses those estimates and the stock tanks fast.The story gets scary with the signs that user growth is stalling. The average analyst estimate is for a $600 million loss this year. While Snap can definitely improve monetization, the social site needs to grow users in order to break even.Canaccord Genuity placed the following ARPU targets per year on North American users:The per user revenue growth is insane considering analyst Michael Graham suggests that Facebook only grew approximately 50% annually during the peak growth years.The key investor takeaway is that Snap must show a re-acceleration in user growth following a weak Q4. Doubling the sequential DAU addition to 10 million is an absolute must for the initial trading of the stock following earnings.Ultimately though, Snap must show to the market how the company can ever reach a profitable future with these massive expenses. Either way, expect any post-earnings rally to be short-lived."

For investors, it will be a report to remember, but not in a good way. The company disappointed on many fronts, sending shares to their lowest point since the stock started trading.Revenues in the first quarter grew 286% over the prior-year period, coming in just under $150 million. While that growth is lovely, the street was looking for almost $158 million, so this is a sizable miss. Daily active users, a key metric for all social media type companies, came in at 166 million, also short of expectations for 168 million. The company also announced a staggering $2.2 billion net loss thanks to $2 billion in stock-based compensation impacts from the IPO.When I first covered the name around the time of the IPO, one of my biggest concerns was that the company had high cash burn, more than $1 billion in the past two years. Things actually got worse in Q1 2017, with the company reporting free cash flow of negative $173 million, compared to $105 million in the year-ago period. The company does have a lot of cash now thanks to the IPO, more than $3.2 billion, but if it keeps burning through it, we'll see debt or equity markets tapped again.In the after-hours session, Snap shares have fallen more than 24% to trade just below the $17.50 mark. This eclipses the previous trading low of $18.90 by well over a dollar and marks a substantial drop from the early trading high of $29.44.

(NYSE:SNAP) expected to release its 1Q 2017 earnings after market close on 10 May 2017, there has been plenty of speculation as to whether the firm will meet, beat or disappoint expectations. But, as we discussed this past Monday on Cheddar's Opening Bell, this earnings release, while it may be its first, is not likely to be its most important, at least from a revenue/earnings perspective.1Q is never greatCall it the holiday bump, but looking at rivals Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as guidance, we're not expecting revenue growth. Facebook reported $8.03b, a +49.3% increase y/y but a decline $770m from the prior quarter. Twitter, meanwhile, reported a y/y decline of -7.8% on revenues of $548m, a drop from the prior quarter of $717m.Snap enjoyed strong growth in 2016, particularly in the North American market, where revenue increase sequentially q/q from 1Q 2016 of $35.9m to 2Q 2016 of $65.2, 3Q 2016 of $114.8, and 4Q 2016 of $145.4.From a regional perspective in Q4 2016, North America accounted for $145.4m, or 87.7% of Snap's total 4Q 2016 revenue, while Europe and Rest of World accounted for $14.7m (8.9%) and $5.66m (3.4%), respectively.Looking to 1Q 2017, consensus revenue estimates range around $158-$160m, a decline from 4Q 2016 revenue of $166m. Given the relative weakness of this quarter, we would not be surprised to see a slight miss on consensus to the $156-$158m range (but would not be surprised to see it on the higher end, particularly if Snap is successful in leveraging IPO buzz into broader ""testing"" by new advertisers).The Users MatterThe more important metric for Snap is the DAU, or daily active users (it counted 158m DAU in 4Q 2016). In contrast to the breakdown of revenue, North America only accounted for 68m DAU (42.8%) in 4Q 2016, with Europe and Rest of World accounting for 52m (32.7%) and 39m (24.5%), respectively. When comparing the regional revenue against DAU numbers, the significance of North American users becomes clear.For comparison, these numbers are not far off from Facebook, which generates around 75% of its revenue from North America, which represents less than a third of its total active users.With the media hype surrounding Snap's IPO, we certainly expect Snap to have increased its DAU count during 1Q 2017, but we're also concerned about the limited demographic focus of Snap's Snapchat and the increasingly strong competition from Facebook's Instagram (and potentially WhatsApp and Messenger).Consensus estimates for DAU growth in 1Q 2017 are around 6%, or the addition of 9.5m users. Given the ongoing heat from Facebook and Snap's high saturation of its core demographics, we would not be surprised to see new users in the 7m-9m (4% - 6%) range.We also would be inclined to discount any significant, or unexpected, increase in DAUs or revenue until 2Q results are released (to balance any increases generated by the hype of Snap's IPO).Key will be the mix of North American vs Europe/Rest of World. We're less concerned with Europe/ROW expansion at this point, believing the North American market has significantly higher ARPU potential over the next 12-18 months.Our 1Q 2017 Earnings FocusSnap is a young company by many measures, still evolving its video and advertising/revenue models. While 1Q 2017 will be important, we do not believe this quarter will, or should, define the company. Beyond the key DAU numbers, we're watching three key areas in the results and earnings call that we believe set the stage for future growth:1) Focus = Camera + Media Consumption + Lifestyle: Snap bills itself as a camera company, but we believe this implies more of a ""lifestyle"" focus, something we'd like to see expanded. As the camera becomes less of a product and more of a feature, Snap needs to bring in other feature elements (beyond its current AR initiatives) that build on this focus. We believe its expansion of video, both as an advertising medium and a content consumption medium, is in the right direction.Snap's Discover offering already has over 40 content partners (including CNN, Vogue, New York Times, Vox, Mashable, Comedy Central, MTV, and The Economist), and it is expanding its video line aggressively. This includes a strong dose of video and similar consumable content from partners such as Snap shareholder NBCUniversal (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Food Network/HGTV, ESPN, Turner Broadcasting, and the NFL. All of this feeds the lifestyle aspect of Snap - partners that tailor or create content geared towards Snap's core demographic.More importantly, Facebook, through its combination of offerings, is also driving towards that ""all-in-one"" lifestyle focus, though towards a decidedly older demographic.2) Demographic Expansion: Snap currently has a 71% adoption rate in the 18-24yr old US market, while its adoption rate in the 25-34yr old US market is only 37%. More than just DAU growth, we need to see an increase in that older demographic to feel comfortable with Snap's ability to monetize its ad/discovery platform across a larger number of users. This goes hand-in-hand with expansion of its DAU numbers in the North American market.3) ARPU (Average Revenue per User): Snap's performance ultimately comes down to improvements in its revenue and earnings. Its ARPU number, as reported for FY 2016, lagged significantly behind Facebook ($2.56 to $22.52, respectively). While ARPU in 1Q 2017 may not meet expectations, we're very interested in any changes in the composition of revenue contribution and signs that, at least in the US market, ARPU has a path to move forward.Included in our look at ARPU will be the breakdown of revenue from Discover (both fixed and video content), Live Stories, Lenses, and Geofilters (we're not looking at ""Snaptacles"" at all right now).For additional perspective on Snap's upcoming earnings, Here's an expanded dive into Snap's challenges, with Fred McClimans, Samadhi's Head of Research, from Cheddar's Opening Bell at the NYSE (Monday, May 8, 2017). We'll also be breaking down the results, and Snap's progress, after the earnings call.For more Samadhi insights, check out our Perspectives on Tech offering in the Seeking Alpha Marketplace."

This net addition of 5M DAUs was the slowest absolute growth in users since mid 2014. Many have been left wondering whether the success of Instagram Stories was the culprit.On a percentage basis, the 48% growth rate appears to be the slowest in Snapchat's entire history.From a long-term prospective, DAU growth is a critical metric to justifying Snap's current valuation.According to my calculations, Snapchat will need to scale to 300M DAUs by 2020 to be able to justify buying in at today's valuation.If the company's year over year user growth rate falls below 40%, this optimistic future is in dire straights. Let's play this out.If Snapchat grows its user base by 40% this year, it will end 2017 with 221M DAUs. If the DAU growth rate slows to 30% in 2018, then they will end the following year with 287M DAUs, scaling past the 300M mark at some point late 2019.In this scenario, by generating $20/user/year in revenue, Snap will be operating at a $6B revenue run-rate, enough to potentially justify a $50B valuation (assuming a ~8X P/S valuation), or about 2X upside from today's prices. To keep the faith in this scenario alive, Snap desperately needs to prove to the street that it still has a strong runway for growth.In Q4 '16, Snap only added 5M net new DAUs (growing its base from 153M to 158M sequentially). To get to 221M DAU's (40% growth), they will need to add 63M net new DAUs in 2017, or an average of about 16M per quarter.In short, Snap will need to triple its quarterly net new DAU rate (of 5M in Q4 '16) to keep its bull-case intact.Google Trends Data Is WorryingFor what it's worth, Google Trends data doesn't seem to indicate Snap is having too much success in the battle against Instagram. The term Instagram Stories remains far higher in search popularity than Snap Stories since it was launched in mid 2016.Taking a step back, Snapchat's popularity as a whole seems to be lagging as well. The app's search popularity on Google has leveled off with Pinterest, and remains far behind both Instagram and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).FinancialsIn terms of financials, the consensus revenue estimate for Q1 is $158.1M. This would represent growth of 307% year over year, but a decline of 5% sequentially. Although there is some seasonality in Snap's business to account for the sequential decline, this is notable because it would be the first time since 2014 (or when we have data) where Snap's quarterly revenue declined quarter over quarter.Snap is still such a young company that I believe it's more important to focus on the company's user-base growth and engagement, rather than financials in the near term.After raising $3B+ in an IPO, Snap has several quarters to invest heavily in growing its business before profitability becomes too much of an issue. That being said, one thing analyst's are likely to be watching closely is Snap's gross margin, as it will be an indication of company's long-term operating margin potential.Snap's gross margin was negative in 2016, but showed some promise by squeaking out a positive result in Q4 2016. This trend will need to continue if Snap is ever going to be cash flow positive.If the company cannot convince investors that its operating margin structure has as much potential as Facebook's in the long-term, then Snap's lofty price/sales multiple will likely contract, as a result.ConclusionA lot is riding on Snap's first quarter as a public company.Scrutiny of new IPO's is always intense, and in this case the effect is magnified by the nature of Instagram/Facebook's attempts to directly take users from Snapchat.If Snap cannot prove that its user base is growing at 40%, then the bull-case of Snap reaching 300M DAUs by 2020 will quickly fall into jeopardy."
4070682,103017,2017-05-08T13:18:59-04:00,Can Snap successfully attract the largely untapped age group of 35 -55.Does Snap want to attract the largely untapped age group of 35 - 55.Potential dis-economies of scale.Ad model effectiveness.Augmented reality and the Zuckerberg threat.,"In my previous Snapchat article (NYSE:SNAP) I pointed out that Snapchat's 35 and older user base was relatively small and that they are going to have trouble attracting and getting similar engagement from this older age group. This got me thinking about the ""what if"" scenario where that age group really did start using Snapchat in a significant way. It wasn't hard for me to imagine that transition on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) or Instagram as I predicted early on that the mothers of the world would use those platforms as the modern day photo album to catalog photos and videos of birthdays, family vacations and everything in-between. Little did I know that it would turn into the biggest and most passive aggressive game of one-upmanship from middle aged women mankind has ever seen while also becoming the virtual knitting circle they go to and gossip about their children's teachers and plan birthday parties. Let's face it, Facebook is as useful as it is addictive. It's a multi-purpose platform that serves as an endless virtual photo album, a news aggregator, and the most efficient way to socialize and stay connected to the most amount of people with the least amount of effort. I, like many others before me have managed to escape the virtual cult and deleted my account only to make my inevitable return. As we shamefully re-enter, Zuckerberg hands us our old familiar hooded Celtic robe and our old goblet (our previous Facebook account, just the way we left it several months back) and says in his soft nerdy voice ""I knew you'd be back""I can envision a scenario where a large percentage of the ""35 plus"" age group is dabbling in Snapchat, maybe even becoming daily active users ((DAUs)) but they won't replicate the voracious Snapchat apatite like the teenagers who will send a blank Snap of a brick wall to their friends just to keep a 156 day Snap-streak alive. Don't believe me? Just ask the teenagers in your family about their longest snap-streak and let me know in the comments section. I think I once hit a streak of 3 days, not impressive, I know. And like the teenager's infatuation with Snapchat the middle-aged adults all over the country have the same level of infatuation with Facebook.But still, I wanted to explore the ""what if"" scenario more. Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Cho (who I respect as an analyst but think his bullishness on Snap is unwarranted at this stage in Snap's evolution) takes the view that the 35 - 55 age group is coming to Snapchat ""in droves"", he sees this as a bullish sign for the stock (you can check out his article here). He displays a graph (source JPMorgan) that shows a 301% y/y growth albeit the graph indicates the growth is actually decelerating. This year-over-year growth percentage of 301% is a bit misleading as we don't know the nominal base it's being calculated on. Understanding the nominal base would paint us a much clearer picture.Next question, if the older generation is in fact, actually coming to Snapchat in droves is this a good thing? Snap's main competitive advantage is that it's still considered ""cool"" by teenagers and they can generally post freely without worry that a parent or teacher could see their mischievous behavior. If we use history as our guide, trends that our parents adopt quickly become ""un-cool"". I discussed this scenario with a friend who has a few decades of professional investment experience in the tech sector, this person summed it up nicely by saying that it would be the ""kiss of death"" for Snapchat. Snapchat, you might be damned if you do and damned if you don't in this situation.What does this amount to on a net basis? Is snap going to lose a teenager for every mom or dad that signs up? No, I think DAUs will continue to grow slowly but I'll be paying attention to the engagement metrics, ""time spent in app"", ""times opened app daily"", and ""snaps created daily by users"". Snap did recently add a feature to allow users to block certain other users from viewing their story, this tells me they are aware of this risk also. This ""adult-blocker"" (I'll coin that phrase) feature might be what saves Snap from an early demise.Dis-Economies of Scale?Something that caught my eye from Snap's S-1 filing was the incredibly low average revenue per user (ARPU) in the other two categories that weren't North America. In the ""rest of the world"" category the ARPU in the most recent quarter was $0.15 (compared to $0.28 in ""Europe"" and $2.15 in ""North America""), combine that with the high cost associated with cloud computing data storage and it immediately makes me wonder what the average cost per user is. I'm not sure if it's material but, is Snap losing money on every new user from some of the low value markets around the world? More importantly, will user growth in these regions drag down this closely watched ARPU metric at a time when analysts and investors are expecting this metric to increase 10x along with a 2x increase in DAUs?Ad Model EffectivenessI've been a Snapchat user since early 2013 and Snapchat started showing ads on it's platform at the end of 2014, I have yet to watch a single ad on Snapchat for more than a second as they make it very easy to skip with just the tap of a finger. Does anybody actually watch these? Is it always going to be this easy to skip them? maybe not but with the short attention spans of their core age group engagement could decrease if they stopped allowing us to skip ads. On the flip side they might be able to charge a premium for the ads that are watched in their entirety or even halfway through as they could feel fairly certain the viewer was engaged with the ad. What about a pay-to-skip option? I'd be happy to pay a few dollars a month to avoid ads if they didn't allow us to skip them so easily but I think I'm in the minority of people that would pay for this and it could open the door for competitors (Zuckerberg or newcomers) to offer an ad free version. To illustrate this point , users even refused to pay for Snapchat's most successful product ""Lenses"", the feature that turns you into a little dog face that licks the screen. A fun and silly feature that is constantly used but hardly anyone was willing to pay for it so they quickly made it free to use.Augmented Reality And The Zuckerberg ThreatIn my previous article on Snap I discuss in length how significant a problem it is to have Mark Zuckerberg as your main competitor. In the weeks following my article, Zuck had announced that Instagram's feature ""Stories"" (a copycat product of Snap's core product) has surpassed Snapchat's daily active user count with 200 million vs. Snap's last reported count in February of 161 million. An out of character move for Zuckerberg that appeared to be a direct shot across the bow of Snap. Instagram's Stories, which was released in August of 2016 has been a major concern for Snapchat and now we know why. If that wasn't bad enough a few weeks later at Facebook's F8 conference Zuckerberg told the world he is shifting his focus to augmented reality, virtual reality, and video communications. He went on and on about features and products that sounded eerily similar to Snapchat's, if you squinted your eyes just enough you could have easily mistaken it for a Snapchat conference lead by Evan Spiegel. Also, Zuckerberg said he would be open sourcing his augmented reality software development, a stark contrast to Snap's commitment to keep that work in house. Historically opensource software products and tools are better and more on the cutting edge of innovation with the downside of not being able to profit off them. In the early 2000's there was a big debate on open source software where Microsoft was openly anti-opensource and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) was very pro opensource. The product innovation that followed should help paint the picture here for anyone that doesn't already know how that decade ended for those two tech giants. Zuckerberg could be taking a page from Bezos', the CEO of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), book on this one and sacrifice the ability to monetize the AR software on the front-end but provide a better user experience and capitalize on the back-end as the user spends more time on the Facebook platform.On a positive note, I was intrigued to see that Evan Spiegel hasn't sold and doesn't intend to sell a single share of SNAP. That indicates to me that he might have a surprise for us, that surprise could be more rhetoric about the future of Snapchat or real substance pertaining to the present but in this market it doesn't really matter. Rhetoric effectively sold to the masses is worth considerably more in terms of market capitalization. Don't believe me just take a look at Jim Chanos, the famous short seller, He's been shorting Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) for years based on the fundamentals and in that time Tesla has been on an upward tear as the market isn't valuing it on traditional fundamental metrics, right now Elon has been given immunity from the investment community as Telsa is being valued on a different set of metrics and the future vision that Elon has sold to investors. If Spiegel can do the same Snap's share price can certainly go higher.ConclusionI'm not bearish and I'm not bullish, in fact I'm looking for reasons to go long SNAP since shorting at these levels doesn't make much sense, your upside is capped and your downside is unlimited, never mind the type of market that we're in, the high cost of borrowing shares and the small share float. The asymmetric opportunity will be to the upside if it ever presents itself and that's how I like to invest. The Snapchat short sellers keep citing a weak business model but what they fail to realize that the business model can evolve quickly. Believe it or not, amazon.com used to be an online book store and Just last week ""Snapchat TV"" was announced, not a huge surprise right now (as I talked about this in my previous article) but 18 months ago nobody saw this coming and 18 months from now there can be several more products we couldn't anticipate.Q1 Earnings Release and Conference CallSnap's Q1 earnings release and conference call will be held on May 10th after market close. I would normally expect a few quarters of good numbers and news pre-packaged and ready for delivery after such a high profile IPO but in this case I'm not so sure if they can meet investors high expectations. Either way I think the real fireworks will come during Q & A and management's forecasts.What I'll Be Looking For In The Upcoming Call"
4071180,102306,2017-05-09T13:50:12-04:00,A Barron’s story suggested that user growth is at a standstill.Revenue expectations imply dramatically decelerating user growth.Why a Snapchat user is worth more than a Twitter or Facebook user.Why the numbers matter less than the messengers.,"Ahead of the first ever public release of Snap Inc.'s (NYSE:SNAP) quarterly results, Vice President Andrew Hall and Senior Equity Analyst Ben Nye preview SNAP's quarter. The video below takes a deep dive into Snapchat's history and what expectations are from the Street going forward. The biggest takeaway from it is that Hall and Nye have profoundly differing opinions relative to the Street. (The video can also be found as a podcast on iTunes.)First, although our authors have tremendous respect for Barron's Tiernan Ray, we take issue with the tech blogger's paragraph in his tech winners and losers piece. Ray writes:Admittedly, there has been slowing quarter-over-quarter daily active user (DAU) growth at SNAP. End of quarter DAUs increased 5% and 4% in Q4 and Q3 of 2016, down from +14% in Q2 and +18% in Q1. However, even if this represents an ongoing run rate, a compound growth rate of 20%+ is quite impressive. With the Rest-of-World (ROW) and European regions relatively under-penetrated, Hall and Nye think there is significant upside to these numbers.At the end of Q4 2016, there were just 69 million users in North America, 53 million in the more populous Europe and only 39 million in the rest of the world (ROW). This compares to the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) monthly active user (MAU) count of 1,936 million worldwide with 234 million in North America, 354 million in Europe and 1,348 million in the rest of the world (includes ROW and Asia Pacific), as of Q1 2017.In short, Hall and Nye see a lot of running room.Perhaps more important than the daily active user growth, however, is the growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). In Q4 2016, FB earned $4.83 worldwide per monthly active user with a staggering $19.81 in the US & Canada. By contrast, SNAP earned just $1.05 worldwide with only $2.15 in North America. This is a massive discrepancy and one the duo thinks will close. In fact, Nye thinks that ultimately a Snapchat daily active user will be worth more than a FB monthly active user. His reasoning is as follows:As such, Hall thinks that ARPU will dramatically exceed analyst expectations over the medium term.Finally, Nye concludes by saying that although there will be a lot of talk around the SNAP numbers, the story drives the stock. The numbers, of course, inform the story, but management's discipline and ability to execute are a more important ingredient in his view. A story shift where analysts feel they can rely on management not to destroy price targets could result in a better Street opinion of the stock and a higher valuation."
4063563,41741,2017-04-19T20:31:47-04:00,"Snap has a lot of headwinds.These include its sub-optimal corporate governance, competitive pressures, rising expenses and unproven ability to reward advertisers.But is all the bad news already baked in?","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) had a good first couple days, but now things are unraveling. Shares have gone from nearly $29 a share to just around $23 a share. Investors may have gotten ahead of themselves, paying nearly 60x sales for a company without any profits. It appears many of the investors piling into Snap are doing so out of their love for the product. The target Snap audience is less than 30 years old.Robinhood, the mobile trading app that's popular among millennials, saw a 50% jump in trading activity on Snap's debut, with more than 40% of those trading on that day buying up shares. On Robinhood, the median age of Snap shareholders is 26 years old - the same age as founder Evan Spiegel.This is a product that's got a lot of attention fast. But just as fast as these fad products come, they can be gone. Investors (millennials) have seen what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares have done and couldn't resist Snap.Part of Snap's issue, and why it's operating in a very different environment than Facebook or Amazon when they came public, is competition.More competition, more problemsFacebook is taking Snap head on, in more than one way. It has launched Facebook Camera, now allowing users to post short videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours and appear at the top of their friend's newsfeeds. A near exact clone of Snapchat Stories.Facebook has also rolled out features similar to Snapchat Stories on its other platforms, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. Users and advertisers are now spending more time with Facebook and Instagram, moving away from Snapchat. Facebook boasts 1.8 billion active users. Putting its new Stories feature at the top of all those users' feeds was an easy way to spur usage and convince many to simply abandon Snapchat.And a bull thesis that's quickly become a bear thesisSnap does have its place, where it can cater to a unique audience that taps into a market advertisers are hot to get a hold of - the 18-34 year olds who are checking into the app nearly 20 times a day.Snap has over 150 million users. However, consider that Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) still has over 300 million, but that hasn't translated into any real profits. The same fate is likely in store for Snap. It lost $514 million in 2016, only bringing in $404 million in revenue. This follows a loss of $372 million in 2015.Marketers just haven't figured out Twitter, nor have they figured out Snapchat. The biggest issue for Snap is convincing advertisers that there is value in the platform. For now, advertisers can't seem to find the ""value"" in Snapchat.That is, a study by Ad Age has found that advertisers are less interested in Snapchat than other services like Instagram and Facebook. Ad Age surveyed some 1,600 marketers, with less than 40% saying they were interested in advertising on Snapchat. There just isn't a viable return on investment for most ad companies, and that could get even worse as user engagement continues to fall. In that same Ad Age survey, Snapchat was ranked next to last, in front of only AOL, in terms of return on investment.Facebook and its Instagram platform are the ones attracting the ad dollars. Tracking the return on investment is next to impossible for Snap - there's no click-through and no opportunity for tracking links or direct impact on purchase or sign-ups.Instagram will continue to eat Snap's lunchIn just eight months, Instagram Stories has over 200 million users. That easily tops the 160 million users that's taken Snap five years to cultivate. And it's coming for more of Snap's lunch, rolling out features that match Snapchat Stories - such as stickers and geofilters. Facebook's ability to fluidly and easily take market share is very bad news for Snap. If users are on Facebook more than Snap, and are watching more videos at Facebook versus Snap, then it'll be Facebook that continues to get the advertising dollars. It's going to be tough to see a social network be able to steal advertising dollars from Facebook.Snap succeeded with a niche group and product, but as soon as it started to gain traction, Facebook leveraged its massive social presence to basically steal market share right back. Between Facebook and Instagram (which it purchased in 2012), it's hard to see how Snap thrives. It'll likely end up like Twitter and trade in no man's land for a while.Then there's the voting rights issues.Snap has issued a ton of non-voting shares, which will help keep activist investors away, but should also keep certain retail and institutional investors away. Snap founders will still control over 90% of the votes. Going along with that is the fact that company management is very inexperienced.The long termSnap is already thinking about iteration, as it's calling itself ""a camera company"" - not a disappearing message company, nor a social networking one. We've seen this before, with GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) not wanting to be defined as a camera company, and instead, calling itself a social network.For now, Snap is still a social networking company of sorts. Its foray into camera devices with Spectacles is still unproven. Snap is rather intent on shifting the narrative away from being a social media company, yet, that will likely end up just as GoPro.In the end, figuring out how to bring in ad dollars to a disappearing message service will prove difficult. However, selling $130 sunglasses - Spectacles - that only take video (no pictures) is a far stretch from iteration. We've seen smart glasses before, and it appears millennials aren't taking a liking to Snap's attempt. They have said walking around with Spectacles is weird. A product that's uncool likely won't catch on.Never fear, Snap is also looking to develop drones - again, a similar path (and likely just as unfruitful) as GoPro. The latter has already had to recall its own drones.The long-term opportunity, given serious competition, just isn't there for Snap. The answer for Snap's future likely coincides with the five (of nine) research firms that have a ""Sell"" rating on the stock. There will be increasing pressure for Snap at a time when advertisers still haven't figured out the value proposition of the platform. From my end, as an investor, I still haven't figured out the value proposition of the stock."
4064688,102101,2017-04-24T15:56:05-04:00,"Uncertainty in earnings and revenue forecasts continues to raise Snap's volatility.I present a number of catalysts that I consider mispriced into Snap's valuation.Regardless of an earnings miss, short-term catalysts have the potential of neutralizing and overshooting bearish valuations.","Heading into earnings, uncertainty about Snap’s (NYSE:SNAP) firmness to uphold its lofty growth narrative continues to cast a gloomy shadow over the stock. As recent price action has indicated, more market survey and macro trends are giving shorts the upper hand given the recent multiples compression we have witnessed. However, regardless of the earnings outcome, some catalysts which are not necessarily true are either being priced into or excluded from Snap’s valuation.How do these catalysts intersect to shape Snap’s valuation?True but overlooked catalystsIn my previous article, I highlighted Snap’s ability to make revenue from its daily ad inventory akin to a Superbowl advertiser’s payday. Given the premium nature of ad formats and assets like Geofilters and Lenses, every new advertiser onboarded has the opportunity of making a significant impact in its daily revenue. It’s all about carving out a niche, provided Snap isn’t running out of ad load. Therefore, the goalpost will continue to shift towards the lofty revenue forecast as more advertisers attempt to achieve the virality currently enjoyed by their competitors who are taking advantage of customizable assets like Geofilters and Lenses to engage customers, increase LTV (life term value), push prospects further down the conversion funnel while onboarding new users.Source: TechcrunchThe bearishness in the idea of a significant sales contribution from Snap Spectacles stems from the unexpected failure of its forerunner a.k.a Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Glasses. While Google Glasses retailed at a much higher price point above $1,000 per pair, Snap Spectacles are retailing for a much lower and affordable price point at $130. The market has largely overlooked the possible success of this AR technology. However, interest level among millennials keeps growing, and recent trends created by the popular Pokémon Go sensation will further support the widespread traction of AR technologies considering its newness.Source: eMarketerA 1% market adoption of Snap’s 158 million DAU puts potential revenue contribution at over $200 million in FY’17. Considering projected ad revenue of $770 million, going by eMarketer’s estimates, hitting the sales figure from Spectacles or a reasonable run rate within conservative estimates could lead to the $1 billion in FY’17 revenue, which gave a share price hovering around $25 post-IPO.Given the lofty IPO valuation and the euphoria that ensued, regardless of the awareness of the overvaluation of the equity market and the warnings that pointed towards another Twitter-like (NYSE:TWTR) ending for the social media site, Snap investors are clearly in this for a longer period than shorts will be willing to exercise their patience for.Source: Fortune.comAnd if the price action post-Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) IPO is a precursor to trading confidence, given the strange sell-off that ensued after the social media giant went public, investors might be hesitant to offload large bullish bets early enough.The optimism on the part of longs can be justified in the opportunities that abound in future tech trends such as AR and VR, the growing TAM of the digital marketing industry, which is accommodative of new market entrants with solid IPs, and the overall younger audience cohorts who are anticipated to mature into adults with a larger purchasing power.This will uphold the premium-priced inventory, though this is under the assumption that competition doesn’t erode the pricing edge inherent in Snap’s business model.True but mispriced catalystsSource: recode.comOptimistic revenue projections for 2017 stand at $1 billion. At an estimated 158 million DAUs, the market is pricing an ARPU of $6.32. For comparison, FB currently logs approx. $4 in ARPU. While investors might not be overly concerned about the numbers, it would fall drastically should Snap fail to hit its lofty revenue projections. This will be a leading indicator/driver of more multiples compression as investors pare down their exposure to earnings volatility.With MAU/DAU growth indicative of sluggish near-term momentum, investors might be overlooking an early indicator of a drop in forecasted APRU. Remember, falling ARPU is a leading indicator of earnings volatility towards a downside in price action.SNAP PS Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsThe $1 billion projected revenue alongside the loftier numbers in FY'18 ($2 billion) is based on Snap upholding its premium ad inventory while growing ad load and attracting top advertisers to bid for its ad slots. In the absence of lofty valuation multiples, any one-off mega deal will tilt the risk-reward towards more upsides as the market is thirsty for news on the attractiveness and demand level of Snap’s ad inventory. However, its lofty valuation might have priced in such news, though recent price decline might lead to a larger short squeeze in the aftermath of such positive news.Source: Yahoo FinanceWith research agencies like eMarketer revising its revenue forecast for FY'17 to $770 million and in the absence of a confirmation of strong demand for Snap’s premium ad slots, longs might be in for some shocking earnings sell-off when the drivers for soft earnings are scrutinized in the next conference call.While advertisers will always test a new platform for opportunities of generating superior ROI, it isn’t indicative that they will stick or rotate budget from incumbents like Facebook or Google to every new platform. The ability to achieve superior ROAS is driven by the purchasing power of the target audience and the modesty in the pricing of an advertiser’s ad inventory.Given its premium ad slots, Snap has to come up with an intelligent ad API which is capable of leveraging data from its users to generate ROI-positive campaigns for its advertisers.Most advertisers will only be content with impressions and click-based campaigns for so long. As soon as push gets to shove and the need to breakeven keeps growing, they won’t hesitate to rotate their budget into more intelligent and data-driven platforms.Leading indicators of an advertisement company’s ability to generate ROI-positive campaigns include the volume of data available for mining, the sophistication of its AI algorithm, indicated by its ability to abstract and create drone-precision bidding, and targeting options for advertisers.Compared to Facebook and Google, Snapchat is still in its infancy in terms of data processed and the sophistication and learning curve of its ad algorithm. This won’t be supportive of the anticipated budget rotation towards Snap from FB and GOOGL.Source: cnet.comI believe the short thesis that Facebook will eat Snap’s lunch is a bit shaky. While Facebook has attempted to mimic Snap in the past, its inability to pull a successful replica rests on the virality-creating capabilities of the Snap app. I believe it’s about the art and not the science. Though recent engagement level with some replica features of Snap in Instagram stories suggest Snap might be losing market share, it hasn’t indicated any mix shift in the audience base from Snap to Instagram.Virality is created by art and design. Instagram earned its virality for a different reason which isn’t related to disappearing content. I don’t see the platform kicking off the second wave of virality off features from Snap.One of the best short ideas on Snap is the under-representation of the male gender on the platform. From celebrities to brands, the larger population of Snap users produce content that aligns more with the feminine gender. Safe DJ Khaled, the most popular Snap celebrities, and influencers who play a big role in the level of engagement on the platform are female.The site also consists of a large number of female-targeted brands. The few male brands on the platform are more driven towards the sport-affinity cohort. Entertainment and news brands/content provide the best cohort of more even representation of male and female users.In addition, some Snap assets are more ubiquitous amongst females with an emphasis on beauty and facial upliftment.Source: businessinsiderThis upholds the skeptical view that Snap might end up another feminine fad just like Pinterest. I believe this discounted skew in gender representation is being misrepresented in Snap’s valuation given the MAU stagnancy of a similar platform in Pinterest, which has a similar gender representation distortion.ConclusionWhile the factors towards more downsize are strongly represented, investors should be careful of aggressive short bets as heavy downsize jolts being priced in as these negative catalysts unfold will only intensify the resultant euphoria that will ensue in the event that Snap hits, nearly hits, or surpasses some of its lofty revenue, DAU, ARPU, and FCF projections.If you like my article and would like to stay up-to-date on the next one, you can click the ""Follow"" button next to my profile or share with friends."
4064241,60531,2017-04-21T15:36:14-04:00,,"Editor’s Note: This article originally appeared in the April 2017 issue of Asia Asset Management.With Less Accountability to Shareholders Comes Greater RiskInvestors bought shares in Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, despite a high valuation, slowing user growth, and governance criticism from fund managers - red flags that could embolden other unprofitable start-ups to do the same. Snap is setting a dangerous precedent and it represents a setback for investor protection and corporate governance.In an era when investors are demanding the highest standards of governance at public companies, Snap’s recent listing poses an interesting question: How far are shareholders willing to chase gains in exchange for their votes?Not very far, it seems, if the company’s share price is any indication. Snap opened at US$24 a share on 2 March, but despite a pop of 44% on the first day of trading, the shares dropped 17% to below $20 a week after its $3.4 billion public listing. Media reports have also disclosed a number of sell ratings on the stock, highlighting analysts’ views that the company’s valuation may be too high for an operation waiting to turn a profit.Snap made history by being the first company that issued non-voting shares in its initial public offering (IPO). While other tech companies listed and traded in the US have shares with no voting rights (e.g., Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), Snap was the first and only one to have offered only non-voting shares at the time of its IPO. By doing so, Snap implemented a dual-class share structure where founders retain super-voting shares, while denying IPO shareholders voting rights.According to regulatory filings, the founders of the camera company with the vanishing message app Snapchat are keeping a 22.4% stake each in Class C shares; shares that have 10 votes each and give the founders 88.5% of voting power in the company. “Mr. [Evan] Spiegel and Mr. [Robert] Murphy, and potentially either one of them alone, have the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election, removal, and replacement of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. If Mr. Spiegel’s or Mr. Murphy’s employment with us is terminated, they will continue to have the ability to exercise the same,” Snap says in the filings.With less accountability to shareholders comes greater risk: Can this be the standard for other large IPOs?Voting RightsAt CFA Institute, we believe shareholders should have the right to vote. A one-share, one-vote standard offers better investor protection than uneven or non-existent voting rights; in particular, the potential to hold directors accountable is a right of critical importance.The current Snap share structure gives its founders control and voting power that are disproportionate to their shareholding and disenfranchises other shareholders. Without the power to vote, holders of Snap shares have limited ways of influencing management and the direction of the company.This is an issue that some investors are willing to overlook in an environment of rising share prices. But when sentiment turns, shareholders are left with an instrument that has neither voting rights nor coupon in a company that, in this instance, has yet to demonstrate a track record in making profits or paying a dividend.Large pension funds and asset managers in the US, including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), have reacted strongly against Snap’s decision to issue only non-voting shares. They denounced the move as damaging from the perspectives of corporate governance and investor protection.Yet, Snap can’t be completely ignored by the market. Given its size, Snap could be included in a number of stock indices, forcing index trackers and other passive funds to acquire the stock to avoid deviating from such indices and benchmarks. That said, S&P Dow Jones Indices require a track record of profitability, one of several criteria factored for before inclusion. FTSE and Russell indices weigh investor feedback when considering inclusion. And according to a recent article from Reuters, the MSCI USA index is facing pressure from institutional investors to exclude new no-vote companies. CFA Institute would welcome this development.Going public as a controlled company with a dual-class unequal voting rights structure is not new or an assurance for long-term success. Some companies that lack effective accountability to owners soar for a time, but others crash and burn. Others pursue misguided strategies for far too long.E-commerce marketplace Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and mobile game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) are examples of technology companies that went public with a dual-class share structure, facing challenges including governance concerns. Their share prices have tumbled since their IPOs despite the so-called “long-termism” that dual-class structures are supposed to offer. On the other hand, technology behemoths, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have thrived under a one-share one-vote structure.Investor ProtectionCurrently in Asia, discussions about dual-class share listings are high on the agenda. In Hong Kong, where the culture of retail investor participation is more pronounced than in other developed markets, investor protection is being given appropriate consideration and weight. Dual-share structures are currently banned in the city, as they are in Singapore where conversations around allowing dual-class share listings have been revived.E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding’s (NYSE:BABA) 2014 decision to list in New York - rather than its more intuitive home of Hong Kong - sparked a debate on whether governance structures that give certain persons voting power or other rights disproportionate to their shareholding should be allowed when seeking listing in Hong Kong.This led to a public consultation where the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) concluded in 2015 that a one-share, one-vote standard should prevail. However, the exchange also said that a weighted voting right structure that includes a dual-share class standard should be allowed for certain companies, in certain circumstances, and with certain safeguards. It is reported that SEHK plans to consult the market again, but this time on the launch of a third board where dual-class shareholding structure can be explored.Singapore is confronted with similar challenges, and the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) is consulting the market on whether dual-class structures should be allowed, and if so, what safeguards should be put in place. In a recent survey, the majority (60%) of respondents to a CFA Singapore Society member survey rejected the idea of dual-class share structures for listed companies there.Interestingly, however, an equal number of respondents said they would acquire shares in companies with dual-class share structures as those who would avoid them. They all agree, however, that safeguards should be put in place to protect investors. Stay tuned: The SGX consultation closes on 17 April.While exchanges and regulators consider what they stand to gain by allowing the next Alibaba or Snap to list in their cities, they should also consider what they stand to lose. More specifically, there is real risk that promoters will shift assets out of already listed companies, or take them private and re-list them in newly listed vehicles with extraordinary share structures. That could materially impact the markets, as well as other metrics and rankings.There is merit in the argument that given the culture of technology companies and the nature of private equity participation in these companies, promoters of such companies may have very low levels of equity by the time they list, and this is not desirable. Rather than allowing dual-class share structures, exchanges and regulators should explore alternative measures to make a financial centre more attractive for local technology stock listings.Companies select listing venues based on many factors, including liquidity, valuation, investor access, peer group comparison, and regulatory requirements. From both a competitive and a corporate governance standpoint, it is important to consider the long-term reputational consequences for the market and what truly makes a market unique, rather than succumbing to the short-term seductions of attracting a larger number of new listings that may expose investors to undue corporate governance risks."
4062400,94846,2017-04-13T18:16:11-04:00,"Instagram has over 200 million users who add ""stories"" to their profile.Snap had 160 million active users ahead of its IPO.Instagram is aggressively adding features to its app, closely resembling Snap's unique features.The biggest strength for Instagram is its backing from Facebook, which could potentially threaten Snap's future value and existing user base.","In April 2012, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) acquired 18-month-old Instagram, which had only 30 million users and no revenue. At that time, $1 billion worth of deal seemed too big for a small startup like Instagram.But years later, the photo filter app boasts of having more than 600 million users and is proving to be a strong growth engine. Instagram is giving stiff competition to market debutant Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Shares of Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, fell 1.2% at $19.97, after Instagram announced its Snapchat-like Stories app has more daily users - as many as 200 million daily active users.In 2013, FB offered SNAP a whopping $3 billion in an acquisition offer, which was eventually rejected by Snap. Now, after Snap's IPO from February 2017, Facebook's Instagram could be its biggest threat. Snap opened up at $24, up 41% from its initial public offering price of $17 per share, but over a period of time, got hit by a ""sell"" rating.While Instagram may be considered an aggressive competitor for Snap, for Instagram this competition may not be as rough. Clearly, the photo filter app has a big advantage: Facebook's existing and loyal user base which keeps growing. Over a period of time, Facebook has acquired more than 50 companies including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, all of which currently engage a huge audience through innovative features and user-friendly technology.To compete in markets, social media companies are bound to introduce new features and unique concepts to retain their active user base, in addition to attracting new ones. Hence, a number of monthly active users (MAUs) become of utmost importance to determine the strength and value of a company.Facebook has 1.86 billion monthly active users on an average as of December 2016. In April 2017, Facebook's third platform, Messenger crossed 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs), and this does not include any of FB's other apps like WhatsApp, which (while we're on the subject) also hit the same 1.2 billion MAU mark in February 2017. While there may be overlaps, it is evident that Facebook remains the strongest company in the social media industry.By connecting its users through its acquired platforms, Facebook is gaining a larger audience.Instagram is trying to tap an audience that is addicted to features unique only to Snap in order to grow its active user base. But while these new features have always existed on Snap, for many Instagram users, such features could potentially mean using one app instead of two. Snap may feel the competition in the form of falling monthly active user base and slow revenue growth.Recently, Instagram introduced a feature that allows users to pin selfie stickers and text along with reducing the size of such stickers. In August 2016, Instagram added a new feature after launching its ""Stories"" section in August 2016. According to TechCrunch, after Instagram Stories was launched, Snapchat's growth sank 82%.Instagram Stories reportedly hit 200 million users that use its ""Stories"" feature, surpassing the total of 160 million daily active users reported by Snap ahead of its February IPO. This means as many as one third of total Instagram's 600 million users now apply ""Stories"" in their profile. Not only this, Instagram has introduced many other features that have always existed on Snap. This includes ""filters"" section introduced by Instagram in March 2016 and AR stickers in April 2017, which already existed on Snap since July 2014 and April 2016, respectively.Though Facebook does not disclose how much Instagram generates, in a report released in 2016, Credit Suisse estimated that Instagram's revenue could reach $6.4 billion in 2017, and alone could bring in a stunning $12 billion by 2021. With Snap's first earnings call next month, it will be interesting to note whether the company has seen an increase in its user growth and revenues, and if so, whether this growth is strong enough to eclipse Instagram.A slow growth in MAU would mean a significant impact on Snap's future as it competes with Instagram for user retention and market dominance. For Snap to stay strong in markets, the company would need to prove that it has a thriving business model that can generate promising returns for investors through its strong financial performance."
4063795,39301,2017-04-20T13:32:00-04:00,"Snap remains the top pick among post-millennial internet users, and should be viewed as a killer app.The network effect of Instagram or Facebook has diminished in usability/usefulness with content skewing toward publishers as opposed to the average internet user.Given the availability of highly engaging content, and a number of levers to improve sales/margins, we would avoid shorting Snap Inc.Instead, the recent pullback should be bought as the stock trades primarily on growth rather than earnings/valuation.Given these factors, we reiterate our positive stance on Snap Inc. and believe it will be a top performer among Internet stocks this year.","Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) managed to drop even further. Though we acknowledge some of the risks, we still like the stock at its current valuation. Much of the concerns cited by bears isn't well substantiated, and the potential upside from monetizing the current installed base of users and attaching more users is not fully priced into shares.Furthermore, we believe there's too much risk when selling short Snap Inc. going into the company's current earnings announcement as there's plenty of growth levers to pull. Because growth is priced at a premium, rather than earnings, we believe the broad spectrum of bullish scenarios will diminish uncertainty and reassert the momentum thesis given enough time.Recent survey data was promising and reasserted the bullish case favoring Snap bulls. We believe conventional price action following the IPO will differ quite significantly in this case, as the mobile ad ecosystem is far more mature, and onboarding of users will stabilize following weakness in sequential DAU additions.Weighing the survey dataSource: PiperJaffray Taking Stock With TeensThe survey respondents were 16-years-old on average, and were born following the millennial generation, which has a date of birth cut-off date between 1993 or 1995. Therefore, when reviewing this survey data, we must keep in mind that these younger users are more sophisticated internet users, as they belong to an age cohort that grew up with the internet, i.e. post-millennial, or often defined as generation Z.We believe the recent survey data reasserts a high likelihood of younger internet users will age-into the Snapchat user experience and ecosystem, while there are practical use cases for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger and Instagram. The combined feature-set of Snapchat was rated higher than the competing social platforms from the most forward-thinking generation. I.E. there's more credibility in watching the behavior signals from younger internet users, because they're more sophisticated in general and adopt features based upon merit as they are less susceptible to advertising, or pre-existing social channels.Recent survey data suggests that the post-millennial generation likes Snapchat by a 1.69 factor when compared to its nearest competitor, Instagram. The younger generation rated Snapchat their favorite app at 39% versus 23% when compared to Instagram, according to PJC survey data. We believe the younger base will age into Snap Inc. as opposed to Instagram or other social media apps. Though Snap has yet to take any timeshare away from its competitors, we view this eventuality as a matter of time.Why is Snap Inc so appealing to the younger age cohorts?We should anticipate adoption to expand among more internet users because the most reliable forward leaning indicator of mass market adoption are younger generational cohorts. We believe the younger cohorts are generally the initial adopters, with the remaining base of internet users following in the footsteps of more savvy internet celebrities that skew younger. Because various media influencers have adopted Snapchat, and are making various efforts to publish content on the platform, we're expecting an inflection in both social influencers and usage among non-celebrities to also increase.Source: Barclays America ResearchKeep in mind, the number of content producers and content consumers is far more balanced on Snapchat. It reminds us of a time when Facebook was in its initial stages of ramping up its global audience base in 2007 or 2008, where people shared more personal stories and would interact within a more enclosed social network that's mostly inclusive of friends and family.However, these days Facebook's content production is done primarily via publishers and various other social influencers. The number of events requiring the average user to update their status to announce major life events has diminished, and the degree to which users are engaged has declined.Ross Sandler from Barclays (he no longer works at Deutsche Bank) mentioned in his Snap Inc. coverage initiation some salient points that shouldn't be ignored.Here were the key highlights from his research note:The analysis is really on point, and quite frankly, I've been worried about the media-centric shift Facebook has transitioned toward given the various negative reports from various news agencies and the continued emphasis on news/event driven coverage as opposed to social interaction among narrower social circles that are inclusive of friends and family.Furthermore, Ross mentioned that the differentiating factor to Snapchat's success is the aggregated content contribution from the average Snapchat user. In other words, over 60% of Snap Inc's installed base publishes content on a regular basis, which has sustained a social experience that's more natural and replicative of real world interactions that gets further enhanced with technology/software.The downside to the Snap Inc. thesis is the scope of advertising and whether publishers will take the microphone away from the average user. We think this is unlikely to occur, given Snap Inc's patience with monetizing the current installed base and continued experimentation of new digital ad formats. We believe that Snap Inc. can maintain a more intimate social experience, while improving ad-monetization via campaigns that are less intrusive and more targeted. Furthermore, given the initial data points we're working with, we think Snapchat is more likely to reach mass market adoption than any other app prior to it, with the exclusion of Facebook and Alphabet owned social properties (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and so forth).But what about Instagram, it's a mighty competitor, right?The issue with Instagram is its low frequency of published content and competition among users to generate the highest number of likes and social engagements. In other words, the social experience on Instagram has devolved from making meaningful social interactions to who can populate their feed with the most attention-grabbing content, amass a following, which showcases a person's ""social currency.""Instagram penalizes those with fewer followers and less engagement, while incentivizing the creation of content to a minority of publishers that have the means to optimize visuals, story creation, and so forth. Hence, we don't view Instagram's value proposition as being more significant to the day-to-day user looking to regularly interact with closer friends or smaller network nodes. Instagram is certainly Pinterest on steroids, with a large user base, and an encyclopedia of photos to admire. It's not going away, but it's certainly not the most socially engaging platform either.Source: Seeking AlphaAlso, one of my readers surfaced a very good point. Instagram's engagement is more minimal due to the nature in which the content is consumed. Facebook has attempted to address this by introducing video content and various other features that mimic Snapchat's key features. We don't think this is all that effective, because it would imply that these new features result in similar behavior/sharing patterns among the broad base of users, which is unlikely to occur. Furthermore, once a broad base of users has adapted to a specific usage pattern on a social network, this pattern is unlikely to change even upon the introduction of new features that could increase app engagement.Instagram's efforts to be more Snapchat-like is in response to the differences in engagement between both platforms. It reminds us of Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) effort to stir some excitement following its NFL licensing deal, which utterly failed.Creating new software features or content is easy, but getting users to change their pattern of behavior at Instagram's current scale is impossible. Hence, the rate of adoption for ""Stories"" among Instagram's social elite was high, but the rate of usage among casual users - low. Instagram is more of an alternative TV-set than an actual network where people go to interact and share personal stories (divulging personal details).In other words, friends are on Snapchat, whereas your favorite celebrity is killing it on Instagram.What about advertising?This is where every analyst concedes, as the ARPU ramp of Snapchat is more likely to ramp quicker than in the case of Facebook as the digital ad ecosystem for mobile monetization is well-established, and CPMs for video as opposed to banner is much higher. Hence, there's a long runway for heightened monetization.The data supplied from Mark Mahaney over at RBC Capital Markets confirms that Snap's usage metrics is comparable to Facebook and Google Sites. Hence, the engagement rate on Snap Inc. already is comparable to larger social platforms, or internet utilities like Search. We must acknowledge that the minutes spent per user was much higher on Snapchat, at 25-30 minutes when compared to Instagram at 7 minutes and Twitter at 2 minutes. As such, we anticipate more opportunities to increase ad load, as Snap Inc. is nowhere near optimal ad allocation per user, or per session.Source: RBC Capital MarketsFurthermore, it's worth noting that the willingness to spend more ad dollars on Snapchat has increased. Though, efforts are still somewhat experimental, the excitement among digital ad-agencies is trending higher, not lower.Given the various efforts to introduce new geo filters, tags and less intrusive ad-units we think Snapchat is taking the right approach with regard to monetization. Furthermore, the introduction of features that better optimize targeting and increases in older/younger demos will increase the value proposition to advertisers over time. Hence, we're in the early stages of growth, and it's quite compelling folks.Source: RBC Capital MarketsThe survey illustrates that 39% of advertisers plan to increase spend. Now, this is contingent on Snap's willingness to increase ad load or through organic growth because DAU expansion/time spent per user increases the aggregate volume of servable impressions. In other words, demand remains stable, but forecasting available supply remains difficult.Furthermore, we haven't seen Snapchat introduce advertising that's more localized to small/medium businesses. Hence, the variables to growth are numerous. It's difficult to anticipate, which suggests Snap's management will pursue first.Snap's management could increase its ad buyer pool by opening a self-serve platform. This would increase the addressable base of advertisers putting upward pressure on CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) or CPEs (cost per engagements). However, the other alternative is to increase the number of ad units displayed per user session, increasing ad load. Another situation, not accounted for, is the monetization of Snap's search functionality, which expands capacity to display ads in different areas of the mobile app, as opposed to the story feed.The other growth driver? The adoption rate among new users and whether Snap Inc. makes a concentrated effort to expand into the emerging market. This is contingent on network bandwidth and whether the emerging markets can develop a denser mobile network, and low-end smartphone refresh drives functionality to a point where Snapchat's features become usable. We believe emerging market mobile users would adopt a service like this, though anticipating that eureka moment where users from the EM catch onto Snapchat remains difficult.The emerging market is more of a 10-year narrative, and we'll be watching Snap Inc.'s efforts to expand into some of these markets closely. Currently, management is concentrating its efforts on the top 10 advertising markets, i.e. markets where digital ad spend is much higher.Of course, we believe this makes sense for the immediate five-year timeframe, though we imagine the technological landscape shifting in favor of emerging markets over the same timeframe. Hence, we would not be surprised at all if Snap's strategy were to shift and move toward global mass market, as opposed to a concentrated effort into the top 10 internet geographies.Final thoughtsThe market prices in a high premium for rapid growth companies rather than earnings (value driven events). For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a company that never rewards shareholders with earnings and always reinvests cash into operations and capex. Hence, it would not surprise us if Snap's valuation were to trade upwards on revenue CAGR expansion, as opposed to margin expansion.We think Snap Inc. should and will make a reasonable effort to break-even in the next two fiscal years, but also invest as much cash necessary to introduce new features, launch new apps, and improve back-end monetization.Furthermore, we believe the growth narrative is far more believable when compared to other tech IPOs as there's much less uncertainty. The scope of the opportunity is well defined, perception of risk less severe, and blue sky scenarios bountiful. Hence, we continue to pound the table on Snap because it's one of the most enticing momentum/growth stock we've come across since Facebook, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.Snap Inc. remains on our top pick list, and we reiterate our 12-month $58.57 price target.We value Snap by assigning a multiple of 69x dil.

4062033,103017,2017-04-12T14:16:00-04:00,User growth and revenue per user growth are crucial for Snap's current valuation and I believe Snap is near peak user growth.Current valuation doesn't properly discount the risks and uncertainties.The current float size is creating artificial demand.Snap's business model is still in its infancy and has a few options for pivoting and diversifying its income.,"SNAP data by YChartsI believe that Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is near peak user growth and the majority of future growth will come from the other low value markets around the world. Weak growth, combined with the IPO lockup expiration in August, could create a lot of downward pressure on the share price.Snap defines a daily active user (DAU) as a registered Snap user who opens the Snapchat application at least once during a defined 24-hour period, which is fair. What's impressive and noteworthy is that Snap claims their DAUs visit Snapchat more than 18 times a day and spend an average of 25 to 30 minutes on it. They also claim that more than 60% of their DAUs aren't just shadow lurkers like myself, they actually create snaps.Two things to note about these charts above (from Snap's S-1 filing), first is the quarter over quarter flat line in DAUs in the ""Rest of World"" bar chart. Second is the slowing quarter over quarter growth rates in the North American and European markets.Snap claims their largest age group of users are 18 - 24 which make up 36% of their U.S. DAUs, the next largest age group is 25 - 34 at 27% of DAUs, followed by age group 13 - 17 which makes up 22% of DAUs. Add that all up and we have 85% of their U.S. DAUs are between the ages of 13 and 34. As of Q4 2016 they had 68 million daily active users in North America (also including Mexico and the Caribbean). Now only Snapchat knows how many of those DAUs are in Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean but I'm willing to bet U.S. users outweigh all of them. According the U.S. Census Bureau the population growth between 1980 - 2010 was 82,199,733 (it doesn't distinguish from immigration, emigration and babies born so I'm staying conservative and assuming immigration had a net effect of 0 and this data consists solely of babies born. Today those people are between the ages of 7 - 37). If we removed ages 7 -12 and 35 - 37 that would be nine different ages and leave us with the same data set as Snap's measured age group of 13 - 34 which comprise 85% of U.S. DAUs. removing 9 ages from our data set is equivalent to 30% so if we subtract 30% from our 82,199,733 we get an approximate population within the 13 - 34 age group of 57,539,814. Again, we don't know exactly how many of its ""North American"" DAUs are from the U.S. and the other regions, but the point I'm trying to make is that Snapchat's high dollar advertising market is rather saturated. Just how valuable is the North American market you say? Here are a few more charts from their S-1 filing.North America is clearly the sweet spot with an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $2.15 which Snap defines as quarterly revenue divided by the average Daily Active Users. Quite a lead on the European market of $0.28 and ""Rest of World"" at $0.15. Combined we have an ARPU of $1.05If Snapchat does manage to significantly grow its user base it may also increase its costs (although probably not incrementally). Currently Snapchat has committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years and 1 billion with Amazon's AWS cloud services. That's an annual cloud services cost of 600 million.Another cause for concern is Spiegel's dictatorship style of hoarding the mass majority of the voting rights. Would he even have done the public stock offering without a strangle-hold on the company? it signals to me that he might not be so confident in the company's future. Snap currently has Class A, B, and C shares. Class A common stock (512,527,443 shares outstanding), which was sold in the offering and has no voting power. Class B shares (283,817,489 outstanding) which have one vote. Class C shares of common stock are each entitled to 10 votes and there are 215,887,848 outstanding. The class C shares are held by the company's founders and with them the founders control 88.5% of the voting power.Zuckerberg's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) copycat products and attempt to buy Snap does say something about the ingenuity and innovativeness of Spiegel but when Spiegel declined Zuck's buyout offer he immediately became Zuck's biggest potential threat and competitor, and quite frankly Spiegel is out-gunned and out-matched by Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg is the Muhammad Ali of Silicon Valley. This leads me to my next point, Spiegel graced the cover of L'Uomo Vogue, an Italian men's fashion magazine in October 2015. The spread featured Spiegel in several high end fashion digs and fur coats. Now I'm not saying that in and of itself is a death knell for Snap but I'll take the guy who wears the same hoodie and jeans everyday, less decision fatigue.Although I don't think Facebook and Instagram's copycat products are going to replace Snapchat overnight I do think they will slowly take market share, take a percentage of potentially new users that might have otherwise joined Snapchat, take engagement, and most importantly, set the stage for price wars and competition for ad dollars that would have otherwise just went to Snap. In short, this situation is analogous to The Undertaker, Kane, and Paul Bearer (think Snap, Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)) stepping into the ring with Snap and if Snap doesn't think fast it will be getting a double choke-slam through the canvas (for those who don't know, The Undertaker just recently retired from the WWE after a 27-year career so a shout out is in order. Thanks Taker, I spent many nights of my childhood up past my bedtime just to watch you tombstone guys into the mat).Spiegel does have first mover advantage. In the same way Zuckerberg took over the social media space, Spiegel has taken over his space by getting the young influential people on his platform first, once it has been established that this is the cool kid table of the lunchroom cafeteria, that's where everyone wants to be and it's difficult to change that. If Snap is the platform all your friends are on that's where you'll go to socialize it becomes a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy due to the positive feedback between belief and behavior. Simply copying Snapchat's features won't draw many users away, it'll take real innovation to scoop Snapchat's users at this point. The real risk to Snap's user base is keeping users interested, which is no easy task with the younger demographic. With that being said, my research suggests that Snap's users are still just as engaged as ever. But like I said earlier, I believe user growth is coming to an end so Snap will have to find a way to extract maximum value from the users it currently has. I think this will be difficult as I am very skeptical of the effectiveness of their current ad model and their ability to significantly increase ad load on their users without losing engagement. Two things some of the other social media companies were able to do well that I think will be really difficult for Snap is transition from the younger more trendy crowd to the older generations and transcending cultures.Evan Spiegel has proven to be a good leader thus far but is he a great leader? Now that they are a public company it will become more clear but it's still undecided. I'm sure most have forgotten or maybe never knew but several years ago Spiegel was at the center of a pretty immature scandal after some of his emails were leaked. Yet again I find myself comparing Spiegel to some of the other Silicon Valley greats and trying to imagine them acting like this. It would be easier to dismiss if Spiegel wasn't the CEO of a hyper growth startup tech company in Silicon Valley, the very definition of the kind of company where the leadership needs to be analyzed just as much as the actual business. An investment in Snap is a bet that the captain and his lieutenants can execute and out-innovate their competition.In Snap's S-1 it states that 60% of all ads are watched with sound on. I found this a strange data point to mention since most people don't watch Snapchat with the sound off and ads usually appear randomly and quickly in-between 1-10 second snaps. Snap videos are the main feature on Snapchat and watching video without sound is like putting Heinz ketchup on a wagyu ribeye, it's just not the same. Especially when considering users can quickly skip the ad with a simple screen tap.Snap's Lenses and Geofilter products have proven to be a big hit and increased user engagement but Snap's attempt to monetize Lenses by charging users was a complete failure. Snap had to quickly roll back the Lenses store. This demonstrated an unwillingness from Snap's users to directly pay for creative tools.Bull Case ArgumentsSnapchat thinks snaping is the newest form of communication, replacing regular text/talk communication. Think: Telegraph to telephone to text/video messaging to snap messaging. I find it reasonable to think snaps are a new alternative to previous forms of communications but far from replacing the older mediums.Mobile ad spend growth will be a nice tailwind for Snap even if the other tech giants are fighting for those same dollars (chart data below from Advertiser Perceptions' show Snap ranking 4th behind YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL, Facebook, and Instagram in the category of ""plans to increase ad spend"") as advertisers move more of their advertising spend from traditional media to mobile. The International Data Corporation projects that worldwide advertising spend will grow by 18% from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020. Mobile advertising is the fastest growing segment of this market, and is expected to grow nearly 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020, while non-mobile advertising spend is expected to decrease by approximately $15 billion during the same time period. Charts below are from Snap's S-1 filing.For the year ended December 31, 2016, Snap recorded revenue of $404.5 million, as compared to revenue of $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 6x. Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter thinks Snapchat will reach $4.9 billion in revenue in 2020. Snapchat's 2016 ad load was .6 ads per user every hour. This compares to roughly 50 on Facebook, 100 on Twitter and 7 on Instagram. Some experts believe Snapchat can increase their ad load to about 8. Over 13x what is currently displayed. Although I think they can definitely increase their ad load I think that 8 is a stretch, but the real question is what is the true effectiveness of the ads on Snapchat. Below is some data provided by Snap that looks pretty good. But I'm skeptical. I assume that data was cherry picked from dozens or hundreds of other ad campaigns that didn't go as well and why wouldn't they cherry pick when ramping up for an IPO it's not like they are going to display an ad campaign that completely bombed. I think it's fair to assume that this is more of a best-case scenario as opposed to an average ad campaigns on Snap's platform.Snap recently developed its own Snap-to-Store measurement product using the location-based features of the Snapchat application to determine the increase in store visits after viewing an advertising campaign. For example, Wendy's blanketed its U.S. stores with Sponsored Geofilters that promoted the Jalapeño Fresco Chicken Sandwich. They used their Snap-to-Store measurement methodology to report that the Sponsored Geofilter drove over 42,000 incremental people to a Wendy's location within seven days of viewing the Sponsored Geofilter. Flo-chart below comes from Snap's S-1 filing.It's important to note that Snapchat's advertising model is still in its early stages. They were included in Advertiser Perceptions' September 2016 Digital Campaign Management System Report, which examines advertiser and agency perceptions of various advertising platforms. In a comparison with Facebook, Google Display Network, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube, they ranked first in overall satisfaction, fourth in plans to increase advertising spend, and third in likelihood to recommend to a colleague. Chart below is from Snap's S-1 filing.Regardless of Snap's current revenue model I do believe it has a joker up its sleeve. It could be enough to thrust the stock price higher. Especially if the joker is used at the right time, while the float is relatively small and the short interest is high. Snap claims to be a camera company. This claim got me thinking. My first thought was GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) and hardware, not the kind of company vision the leaves me rushing to invest. Although hardware (Snap's Spectacle glasses) is definitely in its future (could be a game changer or a costly mistake). I think that Spiegel and company are smart enough to not try and compete with established camera companies and Chinese manufacturers. And although these weren't mentioned anywhere in Snapchat's S-1 filing, I think Snap is going to be making strides into the augmented reality and virtual reality spaces, and the official mention of either of those could send the stock higher.Another pivot Snap could make is to grow into a content delivery network and media company. Just recently Snap announced a partnership deal with Vice to produce eight original shows that will be aired exclusively on Snapchat. If Snap can evolve and execute this successfully it could open up new avenues of revenue.Snap signed a deal with NBC Universal for the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, worth approximately $50-75m in 1Q2018 revenue. NBC Universal and Snap completed a similar deal last summer for the Rio summer games, during which roughly 35 million Americans viewed 230 million minutes of Snapchat content according to NBC Olympics President Gary Zenkel. It'll be important to watch how those numbers change. It's also important to note that NBC Universal put $500 million into Snap's February IPO. NBC Universal could be the key partner for Snap's media ventures and be the start of a great partnership, something to keep an eye on.Also, Snap has patents! As of December 31, 2016, they had 328 issued patents and approximately 220 filed patent applications in the United States and foreign countries.Final ThoughtsA lot can go wrong before profitability is reached, competition is heating up and I'm not yet sold on the bull case. I'm also not ready to take a long-term short position. With the low float, high short interest, many unknowns and lots of hype we should see a fair bit of volatility at the least. Things I'm paying attention to going forward are:"
4062778,22148,2017-04-17T12:10:41-04:00,Snap continues to face competitive threats from Facebook easily copying features.The stock shouldn't trade at a premium if user growth has stalled.The question is really how far the stock falls.,"Considering that Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is richly valued based on projected fast growth in the future, the stock can't afford any hiccups. For this reason, the news from Instagram owned by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is concerning for Snap shareholders.My original research on the stock suggested user growth and product issues were leading to advertisers pulling back from the platform. Now the question is whether Instagram just placed an exclamation point on the negative story for the stock.As a refresher, one of the biggest worries with Snap during the IPO was a dramatic slowdown in user growth. The social platform saw sequential quarterly user growth dip to only 5 million for 3.3% growth. Snap hadn't seen that few user growth addition since back during Q314 when starting with only 57 million users.This slowdown in user growth rate corresponds with Instagram introducing Instragram Stories back on August 2, 2016. The wildly successful product for Snap was easily copied and duplicated on Instragram.Facebook now claims that more than 200 million people use Instagram Stories placing this one feature far beyond the total users on SnapChat. This ability to copy and scale SnapChat features is no doubt a big part of the user growth slowdown.One has to really question the ability of Snap to grow into the market cap that approaches $30 billion now based on nearly 1.5 billion shares outstanding after the IPO. The company is highly unprofitable and the ability of Facebook to squeeze off user growth should be a big concern for investors.The average analyst estimate is that Snap generates 2018 revenues in excess of $2 billion while still losing $0.33 per share. Even under a generally bullish view of growth prospects, analysts forecast a loss of around $500 million for the year.The news that Instagram is so easily copying SnapChat features and growing the user base far beyond where SnapChat is now has to question the growth thesis. Even the Pivotal Research target of $10 appears too bullish under this thesis.Analyst Brian Wieser predicted that 2023 revenues would reach $6.7 billion with an EBITDA of $2.0 billion based on 30% margins. This places the stock currently at 15x EBITDA levels all the way out to 2023 while one has to question if Snap can even grow much beyond 2018 targeted levels.With a reported 161 million DAUs now, Snap can probably reach 200 million in the next year and hit revenues of over $2 billion as monetization ramps. Even Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) exceeded $2 billion in revenues so this goal appears very obtainable despite the product copying by Facebook.The problem is moving beyond these levels. Clearly, a product that maxes out near 200 million DAUs and is still losing money isn't going to command a stock valuation in excess of $30 billion. In essence, the theory is that Snap only has downside ahead with the debate surrounding where the bottom exists.The key investor takeaway is that Snap isn't an attractive investment when Facebook can so easily copy the new features and the stock trades at a premium valuation. Even the most aggressive projections forecast the company losing money in 2018. Clearly, the stock only has downside until resolving the ability of Facebook to so easily copy new features."
4062366,22445,2017-04-13T16:15:02-04:00,"SNAP will host its first-ever quarterly conference call on May 10th.It will be the first full quarter of direct competition from Facebook that has copied SNAP's features.And judging from SNAP's Q4'16 user data, user growth at best will probably stall.","Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) announced its first quarterly conference call for May 10. If I am right, you will see blood on the streets. SNAP shareholder blood that is.For those who remember the dot-com era, analysts were trying to find new ways to value companies, because the know set of metrics that everyone used at the time did not compute. There was no way to come to any sensible valuation conclusion.So analysts devised metrics such as page hits, and many other crazy metrics to try to come to some conclusion why some stocks had the valuation they had. In the end, of course ,it turned out that things were not very different this time, and all the metrics devised did not work out so well.Currently, we have a similar situation with SNAP. SNAP is currently not profitable. In fact, for the next two years, analysts see the company losing money (data from yahoo).And since the company is not profitable yet, it does not have a P/E. So another way analysts have tried to value SNAP is to use active user data. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was valued in a similar way in its IPO.SourceThe above active user data is from SNAP's IPO filing. The data shows quarterly user growth on a Y/Y basis. So one could say that Q4 was not bad, with active users increasing by 48% Y/Y.However, please also notice that growth has been coming down a lot from previous quarters. In fact, one can clearly see growth flattening off. And if we calculate user growth on a Q/Q basis, then we get a different picture.The chart below uses the same data as the chart above, but instead of Y/Y numbers, I have calculated the Q/Q percentage growth.As you can see, Q/Q percentage growth between Q3'16 and Q4'16 dropped to 3.27%. The lowest on record. And I think this number will continue to drop, and we might even see negative growth. How so?Well, we all know that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been copying many SNAP type functions in its social Apps. It all started with Instagram back in August 2016, when the company announced on its blog the first SNAP type features.Sounds familiar? Please note Instagram has more than 600 million users, twice the users of SNAP. And if I may say so, I think one of the reasons why SNAP's Q/Q growth dropped to 3.27% in Q4'16 probably has a lot to do with Instagram Stories.So come May 10th, it will be the first quarter that we will see what kind of damage (if any) Facebook has done to SNAP, as a result of incorporating many of its features in its social ecosystem. Because it will be the first time these SNAP features will be available to the entire FB social space for a full quarter.What might happen on May 10thWhile we will have to wait for active daily user numbers from SNAP to see if FB has done any damage, personally, I think the damage has already been done.It's simple; It's fair to say that all SNAP users also use FB, as do their friends. So if everyone you know is also on FB, why use two Apps, since you could do the same thing you do on SNAP, with FB, Instagram or WhatsApp?Like I said, I suspect that the user growth shortfall in Q4'16 probably has a lot to do with Instagram. And with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp also in the picture, I think SNAP's active users will come under a lot of pressure just to stay at the same Q/Q level on May 10th.While I have no doubt SNAP's revenue can continue to increase, what's important to understand is that without continually increased active users, the market will stop valuing SNAP as it does. Because at some point, without an increasing user base, revenue cannot increase forever.And if active users flatten (or fall), then no matter how much SNAP's revenue increases from current levels, it will be very hard even for investors that are very positive on SNAP to hold on to it at 20X revenue.Now, if for some reason FB has put a lot more heat on SNAP than we realize, and we see a fall in Q1'17 active users, then I think SNAP's stock might fall as much as 50%. I am not counting on something like this, but please note it is a possibility."
4061567,76115,2017-04-10T16:27:14-04:00,"A month in and I'm not seeing the exuberance or hype I thought Snap Inc might have had since IPO.Snap isn't following the trend of the Twitters or Twilios of the IPO world.Instead, the path for Snap may be more like Facebook's but unless it can show it is headed for even better success than Facebook it's time to stay away.","Just a few weeks ago I wrote an article outlining the possibility Snap (SNAP) would rocket out of the IPO gate and thus recommended buying at the open only to sell at the top two months later. I compared other tech IPOs and their trajectories to calculate the time and run up to the peak of IPO hype. It turns out, however, Snap hasn't cooperated with this trend. Instead Snap has been a pretty lame disappointment and, regardless of what anyone else has said, the movements of the stock have been weak at best for typical IPO mania.As I shared in the prior article, the companies studied showed heavy, sustained movements upward only to reverse course and drop helplessly and painfully. I contended Snap would take this path and the game plan was to buy at the IPO and to dump it about 63 days later when it had exhausted the exuberance.And I wasn't just talking the talk - I did in fact put my money where my mouth was and bought a small lot on March 2nd.However, as the first half of the 'long' period wore on I realized Snap was not acting according to plan.What I was expecting was something more like this:It doesn't take a college degree to see the difference.So, I sold my entire position for a very small loss (~7%). My intentions were not to be some kind of bag holder or Snap long-term investor but instead use the IPO hype to ride a quick profit. However, when I saw the road Snap was taking I realized this isn't going to end well if I remain in the game for the rest of the study's duration.So what gives? Why did Snap not go along for the IPO roller coaster ride?There are a few theories but the two sticking out to me are:What I find interesting is Snap is indeed acting more like Facebook than it is any of the other tech IPOs I studied. However, I did leave room for a Facebook-like scenario in my risks profile for the strategy.But I contended there were some differences and the possibility of this outcome was plausible but not probable:But it seems the trail has not been paved for Snap as Wall St. and advertisers are telling Snap it has to carve its own way through the woods. Just because Facebook paved a way for mobile social media advertising doesn't mean Snap gets a free pass into the world of money thrown at it - at least it's how it seems. Sure, Snap has seen a several hundred percent increase in revenue year-over-year ($404.5M from $58.7M) but the dollar amount pales in comparison to Facebook's early days of $5.1B. Of course, Snap is much smaller in regards to users than Facebook was at IPO: 158M daily active users versus 618M, respectively - nearly a quarter of the users but less than a twelfth of the revenue.In other words Snap has 25% of the users Facebook did when it IPO'd but only 8% of the revenue. Expressed another way each user was bringing in $8.25 for Facebook but only $2.56 for Snap in terms of revenue.But the comparison doesn't make sense unless we factor in some type of stock valuation. At Snap's current stock price of around $21 it has a market cap of $24.3B. This compares to Facebook's market cap of $60B at the same point after IPO! Over two fifths of the market cap but only a quarter of the users and a twelfth of the revenue. And as we now know, Facebook is the leader in social media - bull or bear there is no denying the returns Facebook has delivered shareholders. You don't go from $18 a share to $144 a share because of hype, just like Snap can't go from $17 a share to anywhere above $29 a share on hype - as we have seen.Did I forget to mention the profitability factor at the time of IPO? Consider it your homework.Snap has a lot to prove if it wants its share price to head anywhere north of where it is. But, there is the possibility Snap takes the Facebook execution and market treatment route to a higher share price and more inline valuation. If Snap can deliver exceptional results then it may find its way to rewarding shareholders beyond a small IPO pop.""Now Joe, you sound a little hypocritical - you buy in and say it'll go up but then sell out only to turn around and bash the company and stock.""Let me remind you I wasn't bullish on Snap, necessarily. I was targeting the expectation of exuberance sending the stock to unfathomable valuation levels and I was ready to capitalize on it. That's all. Now I've seen neither Wall St. nor retail investors impressed or able to move the stock. This tells me there is a deeper situation and valuation is truly a concern.The valuation difference is stark when the goal is to usurp the leader in the space, a leader mimicking its every move in order to strangle the grip on users and subsequently revenue. It's a hard battle to fight when the valuation says you're on a flight plan to surpass the leader today without the numbers to back it up.I wouldn't touch Snap again until real metrics and financials are worthy of real 'coup power'.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Snap as well as other social media and tech companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4062013,99506,2017-04-12T12:38:11-04:00,"The overhyped Snap IPO has put a valuation on this stock that has priced its shares beyond perfection. In no possible world can we imagine the current valuation being justified.Competition from Facebook alone is enough to slow key metrics, such as DAUs, and crash the sky-high valuation of Snap. Now competition is also emerging from both Apple and Microsoft.The valuation of Snap's shares depend upon extremely rapid growth to justify the current sky-high valuation. In fact, the opposite has occurred with growth in DAUs decelerating extremely rapidly.Snap requires rapid growth in order to justify the current stock price. Both existing and newly emerging competition virtually assure growth will continue to slow for Snap. Look out below.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) came public on 3/2/17 amidst much hype and fanfare. Subscribers to Trader's Idea Flow received an IPO day trading call that earned a 10.3% one-day gain to the long side of the trade as we acknowledged the IPO momentum. We then issued our first of two short calls at $27.78 that has now earned a profit of about 28% since our initial short sale for subscribers about a month ago. We believe that there are further significant gains ahead on the short side of this trade.SNAP data by YChartsHere are a few key risks that Snap investors should be aware of:Snap is losing money, and it is losing lots of money. Snap is losing so much money at such a rapid rate that it almost resembles an early-stage biotech company where the cash ""burn rate"" needs to be monitored to keep watch for the company's ability to remain solvent. Snap lost $372.9 million in 2015, and this staggering loss exploded up to a loss of $514.6 million in 2016. Based upon company data, Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) produced the graphic below with eye-popping estimates for losses in 2017. Please note that CS makes a number of liberal assumptions about future growth for Snap, but all we can really be confident of is that the losses for SNAP this year will be mind-boggling. CS's future estimates do not account for Snap's rising competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).The size of Snap's losses is alarming. The rate of growth of these losses is of greater concern. And the company's admission in its pre-IPO S-1 filing that it ""may never achieve or maintain profitability"" is stunning. Perhaps of paramount concern is the fact that acquisition costs for new users and other costs of revenue are higher than the actual revenue generated by the company. Rising competition means that this problem may actually become worse. In a continuance of this business model, the company's chances to achieve profitability would never occur, and its ability to remain solvent could be called into question. Bloomberg's Shira Ovide took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to voice this significant concern:Of great concern for Snap's chances to achieve the rapid growth required to maintain the sky-high valuations of its current stock price is competition from at least three of the world's most formidable technology competitors in Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. It is clear that key metrics such as Daily Active Users, or DAUs, are already slowing dramatically for Snap. This article will discuss the emerging competition that may further slow Snap's growth of key metrics or even cause growth to go negative. Snap is simply not achieving the rapid growth required to maintain the current sky-high valuations of its shares. In view of this actuality, the current share price is very likely to decline dramatically. The following graphic from ReCode demonstrates just how rapidly DAU growth has decelerated in recent quarters. And this deceleration was prior to Facebook adding numerous new features or the emergence of the Apple and Microsoft products that are now launching.Please note that the addition of new Daily Active Users decelerated from 21 million in Q216 to only 10 million in Q316, and a stunning decrease to only 5 million new DAUs in Q416. At this rate of deceleration, it appears that growth of DAUs could actually go negative. This event would be disastrous for the valuation of Snap's shares, and current valuations for the stock appear to be oblivious of the fact that this rapid slowdown in growth has already begun in early 2016. There is currently an extreme dissonance between the reality of rapidly decelerating growth in one of the most important metrics at Snap of DAUs and the perception of the valuation on the stock price. The stock's current valuation is priced for very rapid growth while the entire foundation of the company's growth premise has already crumbled. The market will likely resolve this dissonance by assigning a more appropriate valuation to the shares at much lower prices.The current valuation of shares is priced for perfection and very rapid growth. In fact, quite the opposite has already occurred at Snap with the rapid deceleration of growth in one of the key metrics, DAUs. This rapid slowing of growth is unlikely to allow the current overvaluation of the stock price to persist. And if growth continues to slow or possibly even goes negative, then the current share price may decrease to a fraction of its current value.Of further concern is the question of credibility on the reporting of key metrics, such as DAUs. DAUs are a form of soft currency that Snap presents to advertisers to illustrate ad reach, thereby determining ad pricing. And DAUs have been presented to investors to indicate growth in this key metric, thereby affecting the valuation arrived at in the IPO and in the current price of the stock. But what accounting firm measures and verifies a key metric like DAUs? None. What party outside of the company is able to give investors a reliable measure to confirm the accuracy of the company's reporting on key metrics like DAUs? This question was raised prior to the IPO by a former Snap employee, Anthony Pompliano. Mr. Pompliano became vocal in his allegations that the company had in fact inflated key metrics prior to the IPO to induce investors to assign a higher valuation to Snap as an enterprise.Snap initially attempted to keep the allegations filed by Pompliano in a lawsuit redacted and under wraps where investors and the public could not view the allegations. Pompliano's request to the court to have his case unsealed was granted, and this bombshell was released today, Tuesday 4/11/17. The Pompliano allegations may have a degree of legitimacy to them. In fact, the allegations appear to have merit. If this is accurate, then this initial lawsuit will throw the doors wide open for a series of class action lawsuits. In fact, it is possible that these class actions may already be in progress.In light of the possible legitimacy of the Pompliano allegations that are corroborated by the rapidly decelerating DAUs during the past several quarters at Snap, Trader's Idea Flow wants to ask the following inane, but highly relevant questions:Who sits in their cubicle daily and counts DAUs at Snap? More importantly, who sits in their cubicle and counts DAUs independently from Snap?The algorithm that measures DAUs at Snap is subject to the old acronym GIGO, Garbage In Garbage Out. Meaning that if the algorithm for counting DAUs is tweaked favorably towards increasing the number of DAUs, then that is what will be reported to advertisers and investors. Possibly, there are many number of other means of inflating of the numbers for DAUs. The following graphic shows an initial count of 294 million DAUs, but if the users are responsible for two snaps per day, then the actual number of DAUs is half or 147 million. Accordingly, if the same users log 10 snaps per day, then the actual number of DAUs is only a fraction that is one-tenth of the original number for DAUs or just 29.4 million. So the temptation by a company to inflate a soft-currency metric like DAUs that is difficult for independent parties to ascertain would certainly exist. Mr. Pompliano alleges that this is exactly what has transpired at Snap.In any case, the rapid deceleration of user growth is now being highlighted by the unsealed Pompliano court documents earlier today on 4/11/17. Shining a bright light on this false premise that has been crucial to the current valuation of the stock began to negatively impact Snap's shares today and the stock may continue to decline in future sessions.The following quote coming from IPO Candy references Snap's ""hope"" that it can innovate to come up with new products to stay ahead of better capitalized competitors with more established R&D programs. This hope by Snap is vague at best and a huge risk for investors.Snap's shares are currently priced for perfection, which is absurd considering all evidence points to a slow motion train wreck that is already in progress. The current business model and rising competition could make it highly unlikely that Snap can reverse its slowing growth. The current valuation on the stock requires the company to achieve rapid growth in key metrics to justify the current price. Recent results have indicated that this required growth has actually been slowing. The existing and emerging competition from Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft make it highly unlikely that Snap will be able to reverse its trend of slowing growth. Candidly, Trader's Idea Flow believes that in no possible world will Snap's near-term results justify the stock's current valuation or any move to profitability.Seeking Alpha fellow contributor Mantas Skardzius does an excellent job discussing the sky-high valuations being carried by Snap's stock price. In his prescient article, ""Snap Among The Priciest Tech IPOs Of All Time,"" Mr. Skardzius discusses several key metrics that demonstrate how high valuations at Snap are now priced. The following key metric of Price To Sales Ratio for Snap illustrates the current overvaluation relative to the other priciest tech IPOs in history:Price To Sales Ratio: When companies have financial losses instead of earnings, then there can be no Price To Earnings Ratio, or P/E Ratio. For money-losing companies, the Price To Sales Ratio, or P/S Ratio, is often used as a metric of valuation. The higher the P/S measurement, the higher the risk level for the investors holding the high P/S stock. Shares of Snap are trading at a P/S ratio that is close to 60. This is an egregious valuation that carries an extreme amount of risk, which no investor should blindly be exposed to without understanding completely the highly dangerous nature of their investment. And I hesitate to even use the word ""investment."" Owning shares of Snap at current prices is gambling, plain and simple, with all of the odds stacked against you. Please note that in the Investopedia link above for Price To Sales Ratio that in the examples given by Investopedia to explain P/S, the ratio is 1.92 in one example, and 2.2 in the second example. Compare the P/S valuations in the Investopedia example with the P/S ratio of nearly 60 that is currently assigned to Snap. This stock currently trades at an absurd valuation relative to historical standards.A warning note to take extreme caution: Investing in companies that are losing money should pose a concern in the minds of all prudent investors since the risks are seriously elevated for these money-losing stocks. But when the P/S valuation of a money-losing stock is egregiously high, the risk of holding that stock becomes suitable only for those who can afford to lose all of their money placed in that investment. I became licensed as a stockbroker in 1986 and understanding the ""know your client rule"" was mandated by the regulators at the NASD, the forerunner to today's regulators at FINRA. I later became a Series 24 Supervisory Principal who supervised other brokers, so I am familiar with the know your client rule's suitability for investment requirements. The point here is that an investment in a money-losing, extremely high P/S Ratio stock like Snap would only be suitable for investors who are able to sustain a 100% loss of their capital invested in a stock like SNAP. Shares of Snap are among the riskiest of the risky stocks.I bring up this important point because the media has made much of the fact that many less experienced, millennial investors have purchased this extremely risky stock in the aftermarket since this overvalued IPO came to market. When I was a broker and supervisory principal, we simply would not accept orders to purchase stocks like Snap. No matter how adamant an investor became about purchasing shares of a stock as risky as Snap, we simply would not accept the order. We missed out on some commissions up front, but we earned the trust and loyalty of our customers after they later saw most of these high-risk stocks plummet to much lower prices. Snap is highly likely to become one of those risky stocks to trade much lower.Here is the graphic from Mr. Skardzius's article that demonstrates the absurd overvaluation of Snap's shares based upon the P/S ratio relative to the other most overvalued tech IPOs in history:The above graphic showing Snap's egregious P/S ratio that is close to 60 illustrates why any comparison with Facebook's successful stock performance (after an initial post-IPO dip) should be immediately dismissed. No reasonable investor should believe that Snap's valuation and future stock performance will be anything close to what Facebook achieved simply because the current sky-high valuation of SNAP leaves no room to move higher. Facebook's financial results were much stronger, and its valuation using the P/S Ratio was 1/6 of Snap's current valuation. In fact, many investors believe that Snap's valuation could be reduced to 1/6 of its current price in the future. This would value the stock below $4 per share. This is the kind of risk that Snap investors should understand they are exposed to at current valuations. Investors in Twitter learned this lesson the hard way, and Snap's valuation problem is far worse than Twitter's situation was even at its peak price.Cash flows: This metric is an essential measure of valuation. Negative cash flows call into question the ability of a company to remain solvent in the future. Snap's losses are staggering, and in the company's filing of its S-1, it admits that it ""may never achieve or maintain profitability."" This pronouncement should not be dismissed or taken lightly. Snap's ability to survive in the long term will be tested by rising user acquisition costs, an endless rise in the R&D spend to try to stay ahead of better capitalized competitors, and a myriad of other expenses required to grow the company. There is no end in sight to Snap's huge losses based upon the current trajectory of growth in both revenues and expenses. Snap has acknowledged this serious concern in its SEC filing prior to the IPO, which was required by regulatory mandate.The following graphic also from Mr. Skardzius's article illustrates Snap's dismal financial performance relative to the other most pricey tech IPOs in recent decades. Snap's negative cash flows are in a class of staggering losses all by themselves. Snap has already indicated that losses will increase dramatically in 2017. It is hard to imagine the price of Snap's shares maintaining current valuations, as the upcoming earnings reports announce record losses of staggering proportions.The following graphic further illustrates the stark contrast between the pre-IPO financial performance of these three distinct companies:Investors would be prudent to take measure of the risk in this stock. Snap is losing large amounts of money. The company has stated that it has no pathway to profitability. Its current valuation is egregiously high at a P/S ratio of nearly 60. And we are about to discuss the increasing competition for Snap that is rapidly emerging from some of the largest, most successful technology companies in the world.Facebook competition: It seems that Facebook launches new features to directly compete with Snap products regularly. The latest attack by Facebook upon Snap was announced today on 4/11/17, and it comes from Instagram's Direct that now enables disappearing messages. Directly competing products from Facebook have corresponded with the marked slowdown in DAUs at Snap in recent quarters. Facebook's developer conference F8 takes place April 18-19 in just one week. We may get insight into further products designed to compete with Snap.Apple competition: Clips will attack Snap from additional fronts because it is well known that the Snapchat platform has been designed to prioritize the iOS platform. Snap acknowledges that a very large number of users on the Snapchat platform are iPhone customers. The makes Snap especially vulnerable to the emergence of competition from Apple as the Clips launch finds traction in the marketplace. The Apple competition for Snap may have the potential to deliver a devastating blow to future growth of users and revenues for this recent IPO.Microsoft competition: Sprinkles is clearly targeting the same youth demographic in which Snap is trying to maintain its tenuous position. The Microsoft product is incorporating AI features, which are considered to be the ""next big thing"" in social media platforms. It is doubtful that Snap can match the long-term R&D spend and engineering acumen of more well-capitalized firms like Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook. After just being launched, Sprinkles already threatens Snap as it could be the next bright-shiny object that motivates the fickle and transient youth demographic to discard Snapchat and migrate to a ""cooler"" platform at Microsoft that incorporates AI features.Conclusion: The competition that is now emerging for Snap is formidable. The already slowing Daily User Growth metric is likely to continue to experience further losses of market share to the likes of Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. With shares priced for perfection with a P/S of nearly 60 currently, there seems to be a disconnect between the reality on the ground for Snap's rapidly slowing growth in DAUs and the stock price that requires rapidly increasing growth to justify its current lofty valuation. Trader's Idea Flow believes that Snap's shares will be more fairly valued in the single-digit price range by the end of year 2017.Please be sure to use the big, orange button to follow Bull & Bear Trading's future articles and blog posts.

The idea behind is, again, quite straightforward - should the market mood be optimistic, a company does not have to have a long track record of business success, healthy balance or any of that sort of ""old-fashioned"" stuff. On the other side of the spectrum, if the market is rather moody and feeling less optimistic about the future, the prospective public company should work extra hard and extra long just to convince this generally pessimistic public that the investment is worth the price.Using this kind of metric, first of all, shows what most of us already know - the companies that stand out in terms of young age at the time of their IPO are the dears of dot com. The trio of Amazon/Yahoo and Globe.com took, on average, only three years to get from the ""garage days"" to the vast plains of Nasdaq. You could easily notice the somewhat receded market optimism using the ""years to IPO"" metric on the recent IPOs - Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn ranged 7-9 years before going public (more than twice as long).There's optimistic, pessimistic, and there are two companies left out in the middle - these are Google and Snap Inc. Both companies were 6 years old when they joined the market. However, they did so under quite different conditions - Google has done so after a lot of postponing during the dot com crash - you could subjectively say, that Google took its time during the bad years of market perception to gain some muscle mass to impress the public. Snap Inc., on the other hand, is yet another company in the line of tech IPOs - we already had three successful IPOs, so Snap Inc. could have possibly rushed to the market so as not to miss the party. In short, Snap's 6 years to IPO show the market being more optimistic compared to 2011-2013, though rosy days of dot com era stay sufficiently long way to go.ProfitSource:BloombergThe notorious era of dot com has been marked by the hordes of companies rushing to the market with no profits to show for their standing. Being the hyper optimistic market that was prevalent back in the day, it was all fine and usual practice, though highly criticized in retrospective.Bearing that in mind, we can simply tick the ""quality"" sign next to the issues, which actually had ANY profit at the time of the offering.Without much surprise, profitable companies are the minority between tech IPOs - it's Google that shines, in addition to Facebook and LinkedIn - whereas Twitter and the dot com bunch lagged financially and actually managed to sell their stock without being able to turn the profit.Snap Inc., interestingly, in terms of rubbishness goes a step further - not only it does not have any profit, its loss is larger than the revenue, thus showing us just how long the way to success is going to be.The very fact that we can use the profit-related ratio to compare some of the stocks bears some credit on those companies, even though the P/E valuations are staggering. Expensive as it is, Facebook appears to be the best value P/E-wise among the 7 of its IPO peers.Price to Sales ratioSource: BloombergAs the majority of the companies in comparison had losses in the year of their respective IPOs, we are forced to take into account another metric of ""value"" - the Price to Sales (P/S) ratio. The ratio has gained in popularity during the dot com boom years as many investors found themselves in the situation of valuing the companies without profits. Therefore, the fact that we're in the same situation again trying to make sense of investing into another loss-making company Snap Inc. is rather sad - but let's just put that aside for a moment. That was the reality at least for the majority of these companies and that not necessarily meant the quick bust.In terms of P/S, Snap Inc. is the king - not exactly in a good way. The ratio of almost 60, four times the level of Google's P/S during the IPO, 6 times the one of Facebook during its IPO. The only issues that could possibly make some competition are the ones of the crazy era - Amazon and Globe.com.Cash flowsSource: BloombergOne of the more important metrics are the actual cash flows - after all, as long as we got the positive cash flow, there's no need to worry about the very survival of the company. In the long run, the only way to have a sustainable business model is to generate a positive operating cash flow - CFO - which, ideally, would cover the investments needed - CFI - and the dividends paid out to the shareholders, CFF (otherwise, why bother with the investment in the first place?). Admittedly, to many companies, especially during the IPO stage, this target is far off as it is usually engaged in lots of capital-requiring projects, making investments and borrowing/taking capital in (hence the share issue) rather than paying it out. Having said that, as an investor, you would ideally seek to have as much reassurance as possible by looking for a positive CFO or even a better position as close as possible to the ""target"" model.Source: BloombergWhile trying to evaluate this ""quality"" of the current cash flows, we could possibly use the very subjective CFO/CFI ratio - while admitting the fact that the company is in the rapid expansion phase (hence the high CFI), we would like it to finance its expansion through the operations channel and minimize its exposure to investors' sentiment (which can be wildly volatile). By this, we assume that investor's/creditor's patience is finite and the financing should be cut off, eventually. Also, largely CFF-financed expansion puts the company at the unwanted mercy of investors' general market sentiment as hot money could stop flowing to the market because of reasons not necessarily related to the company directly (again, think of dot com crash).Cash flow structure-wise Snap Inc. stands together with one of the first social networks in the world - Globe.com, which was de-listed only three years after its heavy loss-making IPO.For now, cash flows are terrible - initiated by the loss on the income sheet, CFO stays negative as well - figure to that extent is extremely rare among the companies being compared. CFI is, naturally, large and negative at this stage of the expansion and will continue to hover around this level. What's interesting is that even during the year of IPO hype and with all the money attracted from the investors (CFF), Snap Inc. is not going to make a positive Free Cash Flow (FCF) - this year - these massive cash injections have reduced the outflow, but surely have not reversed it. In other words, Snap Inc. is showing the same character that would like to be avoided - it is at extreme mercy of the investors/creditors to finance its further growth and its own operations is not much of help, but actually a drag on the current cash situation. The grave situation is that it overshadows even the dot com couple of Amazon and Yahoo - at the time of their IPOs, these companies were breaking even on the CFO front while managing a positive FCF with the money they attracted from investors.Clearly, not all of the tech companies are the same - Google shines again among the peers, as during the year of IPO, it could actually finance up to 60% of its investments from the operating cash flows. This performance is really exceptional among the companies being compared and fits nicely into the theory that Google had to show extra quality when the market sentiment is rough (post dot-com era, recession etc.). Among the companies of higher quality cash flows are the recent market newcomers, social networks LinkedIn and Facebook, which during the years of their IPOs managed to cover 40% and 22% of their investment needs through the operating cash flows.Not impossibleAMZN data by YChartsAs the current fundamentals of Snap Inc. look rather depressing, we could interestingly point out that the similar story line could have been applied to another company right after the IPO - Amazon. Starting off as a loss-making online bookstore, Amazon sold its shares to the public only three years after it was founded at the impressive P/S valuation of 44. Despite the mammoth competition and zero CFO, the stock managed to catch a massive investors' wave of optimism shooting up 71 times during the 1997-2000 period before retreating ~ 93%. It actually turned a positive CFO in 2002, only, and the first formal profit was earned 9 years after the company was founded, 6 years after the company was made public. However, bit of luck, bit of strategy, bit of Mr. Bezo's magic, and lots of investors' optimism going to the day (its current P/E ratio 183) has transformed this once online bookstore to the giant conglomerate of 400 bn USD capitalization.Before we jump to conclusions, we must remind ourselves that Amazon is more of the exception here, owing its success to the factors not necessarily related to Snap Inc. or any other companies mentioned. Sometimes, it is just too easy to focus on the success story and forget those thousands of companies that went under in a similar situation - just ask Globe.com, eToys.com, Webvan.com or even Pets.com. They are all now long gone and forgotten, but the IPO created hype and the major disruptions they promised at the time were very real, though unfounded.ConclusionsSnap Inc. IPO has reminded us all again of the good old days of late twentieth century. The business is in extreme competition, has not turned the profit yet and the cash flows are terrible - all this seems of secondary importance to investors, who rushed to value the company over 25 bn USD in no time.We could hardly say that Snap Inc. is ""another Facebook"" or ""another Google"" - these two have joined the market on a much stronger footing and the comparison to these companies seems vague at best.The only success story so far, which we can take inspiration from, is Amazon - current conglomerate has started off in a similar position (ceteris paribus) with many hurdles and, possibly, negative reviews. Any chance to repeat that story of Amazon? For now, unfortunately, figures show that we are much closer to the bunch of forgotten names than to Amazon."
4060677,68555,2017-04-06T05:49:35-04:00,"Many Snapchat users bought into the Snap IPO.
        Given Snap's overvaluation and the slowdown in user growth, Snap is destined for a pullback.
        Watching the highly volatile stock fall can cause Millennial investors to panic.
        This is another reason to stay away from the stock.","I am a big advocate of investing in the businesses I love and understand. This strategy has worked wonders for many people, including the legendary Peter Lynch. However, before buying a business you like, it is necessary to sift through the numbers and fundamentals or the strategy may backfire. Investing is excellent businesses only make sense when you invest at the right price.The social media boom is surely coming to an end as the companies in the sector aren't enjoying as much user growth as they once used to. All the big-name social media companies, be it Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Snapchat, or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), are witnessing a slowdown in monthly and daily active user growth and this indicates that may of this platforms are close to maximizing their reach.Despite this, Snap (NYSE:SNAP), parent company of Snapchat, had a very successful IPO with shares rising roughly 44% from its issue price of $17. With the entire social media space trading at lofty valuations, the secular trend of declining user growth will not go down well for the likes of Snap as the company is still years away from profitability.The key behind Snap's successful IPO may well be its passionate user base as it was reported that almost 43% of Snapchat users bought into the IPO. Given that Snapchat's user base is pretty young and the median age of investors who bought the stock was 26, it is certain that the platform's young user base played a big part in making the IPO a success.Millennials have largely stayed away from investing in the stock market owing to the high student debt and memory of the last financial crisis. It is evident that many Millennials, despite having no investing experience, have bought the stock just because of their love for the product. However, as mentioned above, buying the businesses you love without sifting through the numbers can prove to be disastrous.Snap's long-term potential doesn't look very bright at this point in time. With the stock already trading at over 48x trailing sales, it doesn't really have much room to run higher. Also, with Snapchat's monthly active user growth slowing down drastically (on a sequential basis) over the last few quarters, I have my fair share of doubts about the stock sustaining its current valuation in the long run.Snap is a very volatile stock and given that Millennials are not among the most seasoned investors, watching the stock drop rapidly can make them panic, thereby starting a snowball effect and pushing the stock even lower.43% of 160 million is roughly 69 million. Even if every Snapchat user who invested in the IPO just spent $100-which is a conservative estimate-they would be holding over $6.9 billion in the stock. Having novice investors, who are prone to panicking, control almost a third of the company's total market cap can make the stock very volatile and prove to be risky for long-term investors.As I explained in my previous article, Snap is definitely overvalued and is bound to fall sooner rather than later. Seeing the stock fall their buying price, and then below the IPO-issue price, can make the Millennial investor-base panic. Moreover, the market's sentiment towards Snap is pretty negative as many rating agencies have initiated their coverage with a 'sell' call. Even most of the articles on Seeking Alpha are bearish and this negative sentiment will likely transmute into more volatility and weaker performance going forward. All in all, there are plenty of reasons for Millennials to panic and sell their holdings once things get rough, which is bound to happen sooner rather than later.ConclusionSnap is not expected to turn profitable for at least two more years. In the meantime, Snapchat's slowing user growth and increasing competition from the likes of Facebook, can hinder the company's short-term and long-term projections.Even a minor earnings report disappointment can send the stock crashing. And given that a large portion of Snap investors are novice, they are prone to panic if such a scenario is to play out anytime in the near future, further pushing the stock lower.With the social media boom also at an inflection point, I think there are plenty of reasons for investors to stay away from the stock for the time being."
4060501,39301,2017-04-05T14:03:17-04:00,"Snap Inc. has attractive growth/business fundamentals that’s not fully-priced into shares; therefore, we believe Snap Inc. has tremendous upside.We believe SNAP will rally into its first earnings announcement, so selling short Snap Inc. would be unwise given recent price volatility.Furthermore, the underlying appeal of the design/app, and its rapid adoption among older-age cohorts suggests upside to monetization.Given the various growth levers, and potential for DAU acceleration, we view risk/reward favoring bulls.Furthermore, the comparisons to Facebook is starting to get ridiculous, with competitive threats overstated/estimated.","Snap Inc.'s (NYSE:SNAP) price action is stabilizing in the low $20 range, and generally speaking, we view this as a positive signal given the wide swings following IPO. Clearly, we view Snap Inc. positively as it's misunderstood among investors. The upside in user monetization, and DAU growth paired with the expansion of emerging market TAM (total addressable market) makes the growth narrative extremely appealing.Notwithstanding, the emerging markets are going through a major transition with mobile networks transitioning towards 4G LTE 3 Carrier Aggregation in the next five years, with tier-1 mobile networks transitioning to first generation 5G in the same time frame. Hence, availability of bandwidth becomes less of an issue in the emerging markets, which broadens the addressable user pool over time.Hence, we expect DAU trends to move materially higher, as we believe Snap's presence in emerging markets will improve, as global smartphone installed base replacement triggers a eureka moment for those who never had a smartphone capable of using Snapchat, paired with mobile data speeds ticking substantially higher as we move into the latter parts of the decade.It's also worth noting that Snap Inc.'s relative appeal to millennials should be viewed as a forward indicator of more broadened adoption among different age cohorts, which we will soon demonstrate. While, we view monetization more conservatively when compared to consensus, we believe user growth exceeds even the most high-end of estimates over a five-year time frame.Let's first address price volatilityWe're constructive on near-term price action, as we believe the stock is poised for a rally leading into its first quarter earnings release. Clearly, expectations from analyst consensus was low to begin with; hence, I find it extremely unlikely that financial guidance/outlook will disappoint. Furthermore, we anticipate DAU figures to tick upwards on a sequential basis, particularly in the emerging markets.Source: TC 2000Given the various scenarios in which Snap Inc. can appease the current shareholder base, it's a bad idea to short Snap Inc. going into its Q1'17 earnings report. User metrics alone could drive the share price higher, or if Snap Inc. were to communicate a more aggressive stance on ad-load, or pricing, the stock will jump.This isn't your typical IPO folks, regardless of how brilliant you think you are. Not every IPO is ripe for selling short on the assumption that the stock will plunge by 50% in the next 12 months. And, some of you have made profitable trades on stocks frothing upwards on forward sales/earnings multiples, which is a viable method for trading/investing into stocks.I believe overvaluation can occur, but in this isolated incident, we believe Snap Inc. is undervalued on a forward valuation/multiple basis despite its perceived valuation being too high.We believe conventional wisdom is wrongThe older age cohorts are adopting Snap Inc. in droves, folks. Yes, many of you thought Snapchat was the next big internet fad, but think again.Source: JPMorganThe 35+ category grew 301% y/y on Snapchat. The growth rate is starting to decelerate, but penetration into the older demos is starting to crimp into our (millennial lifestyle) these days.Yes, we acknowledge that grandpa and grandma might never join the bandwagon, but for the under-55 crowd, this app is starting to take-off.I mean, mom and dad are going to join you real soon folks, so you may need to change up your Snap stories, real fast.No more bar hopping stories, start hiding your girlfriends/boyfriends, and if you're making more money - you can't bling-out on your daily story. Your family will demand better Christmas presents (take it from me), or your parents will question your spending habits.We ran from our parents for as long as we could, and we (millennials) had a good run.But, for Snap Inc. investors, this is some good, good, news.We need old people to waste their time on the app (like us), so advertisers can sell expensive vacations, expensive cars, and second homes. Look, the closer this 35+ demographic gets to retirement age, the more likely they are to waste their arduously boring days on Snapchat, discussing the weather, or their most recent vacation.What our parents won't realize, is how good of a time suck this app really is.Hence, we expect monetization to tick substantially higher as old people make more money, spend more money, and are displayed different ads.The world of digital advertising will soon experiment with 10-second ads that appeal to old people. Meaning, the GEICO commercials get (even) shorter, American Express will have 10-seconds to display their latest Platinum Credit Card, and Carnival Cruise has just enough time to show you a boat moving across the Caribbean (with two old people laughing on the deck of course.)Of course, the pharmaceutical companies are out of luck, as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) won't have enough time to market their latest Viagra drug in 10 seconds. I mean, if they did, that would mean they fast forwarded past the negative side effects even quicker than they already do!Furthermore, the political campaigns get slicker folks, watch out!So, how would our favorite politician advertise on Snapchat?In the next election cycle, Trump could win the White House, and this time the mainstream media will likely blame it on Snapchat instead of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).He's the perfect Snapchat president, because he's a sound bite machine. 10 seconds is more than enough for Donald Trump, especially if he runs ads like this:So, we're expecting campaign advertising to blow the lids off Snap Inc.'s ad-monetization ramp. Every politician will soon sound like Trump, and the global skepticism in our political process may only worsen.Oh well, shareholders of Snap Inc. will benefit handsomely.Hence, the recent shift in age demographics is quite crucial to the investment thesis. The older the user base gets, the more valuable a 10-second ad becomes.Source: Goldman SachsKeep in mind, Snap Inc. is heavily undermonetized. When looking strictly at the ARPU figures for DAUs in comparison to other social applications, Snap Inc. makes $5.86 per DAU. Whereas Facebook and Twitter earn $77.70 and $51.95 per DAU.So, in terms of ad-monetization ramp, nothing would surprise us at this point. Snap Inc. has one of the most engaged audiences among social apps, and can quickly capture the attention of an average user when ad units are implemented appropriately.Hence, we expect revenue to trend much higher. The usefulness of a shorter ad, and improved ad recall implies better marketing ROI. Therefore, digital ad-agencies are moving quickly to devise ad campaigns for Fortune 1,000 brands. Furthermore, we expect this pattern to continue, despite the absence of an SMB (small & medium business) self-serve channel.But, what about competition?Source: Morgan Stanley ResearchKeep in mind, we haven't even seen what else is lurking in Snap Inc.'s pipeline. But, we'd imagine that they're scheming something really good. We expect Snapchat's roll out of new features to add substantially to DAU growth in the foreseeable future.If Snap Inc. sustains its recent innovation streak, the comparisons to Instagram or Facebook Messenger become less meaningful.Hence, the competitive threats are perceived incorrectly. It's weird when the folks at FB are busy poaching Snap's app design, and feature updates.Snap Inc. is more innovative than Facebook currently. The sheer efficiency in design/uniqueness of Snapchat should keep us optimistic rather than pessimists. Either Facebook's innovative culture is dying, or is being applied in entirely the wrong places.Facebook should have developed these features sooner, but instead, they're busy replicating someone else's ideas. From a technology perspective, this implies FB's software developers are failing at creativity.When companies lose creativity, they lose entire markets. Remember what happened to Kodak?Hence, Snap's sustained competitive moat comes from its ability to build-upon its unique feature set. Whereas Facebook is ripping and implementing one feature at a time.This isn't bad, but rather good. If Snap was doing a horrendous job, it would be replicating Facebook, but instead we're witnessing the complete opposite occur.Fact is, Facebook's developer teams are more focused on simplifying the app, so it functions on slower smartphones. Or, they're working on back-end engineering so the app works better on more devices. Maybe, they've included some new features over the years, but from what we've seen they've launched more advertising units, and better ways of filtering information.You could hardly call that innovation, guys, come on.Hence, Facebook's strategy is starting to mirror that of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Since you can't reinvent Search, the folks at Google went on to launch tons of side start-ups. They now call themselves Alphabet.Pretty soon, Facebook will hit that dead end, and by then… we'd expect Facebook's various efforts in VR, wireless internet, and so forth to bridge shareholders for the next 100 years. Facebook's side bets keeps Facebook in the game, and upon further revenue diversification, we'd expect sustained annuity-like revenue/earnings contribution even if it isn't the high-flying start-up it once was.But lately, Snap Inc. is not only innovating, but has plenty of room to grow as well. Therefore, we like what we see here, despite the controversy of recommending a fresh-stock following IPO.Final thoughtsProspective Snap Inc. investors really need to consider the potential upside here. Yes, the path upwards is fraught with risks and uncertainty. But, the risk/reward still favors bulls, for now.Furthermore, it's worth noting that we still have a pocket Ace. If the advertisers fail at developing compelling ads we've still got Donald J. Trump up for re-election in four more years. Hence, we've got plenty of cushion in terms of upside scenarios, whereas the downside implies Snap Inc. becomes this sub-segmented niche app like Twitter or LinkedIn.We don't think that will occur, given the broad appeal of the app, and its unique design.

4060356,101891,2017-04-05T04:50:14-04:00,"Snapchat is managed through dual-class shares that provide control power to the management.Academic evidence shows that dual-class shares can lead to agency problems and may be detrimental to company’s operations and performance.However, examples from Google and Facebook show that they can also be beneficial.Overall, these structures can benefit investors if they fully believe in the founders, but that is not the case for most dual-class companies.","This post is written by Jim (Jiecheng) Huang for Integer Investments.IntroductionShareholder friendliness has always been an important factor for us in evaluating a company. In our recent article discussing risk factors for Under Armour (NYSE:UAA), we talked about potential agency problems with their ""Tri-Class"" share structure. Today, this article focuses on Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP). We will examine a few other companies such as Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) which hold a similar tri-class share structure. A recent Journal of Finance article accused dual-class share structure companies of agency problems. Today we will examine what these agency problems are.What is a dual-class share structure?A typical dual-class share structure consists of a superior class which holds more than one voting right per share, then there is an inferior class that holds only one vote (or no vote) per share. Both classes usually share the same cash flow rights but the former class provides control to the holder.Share structure comparisons for Google, Facebook and SnapchatDual class share structures have not been popular with investors for years. Investors are concerned that companies incorporating complex voting rights and share structures are less responsive to investor demands. In fact, if the management (and usually founders) control the company, they face less pressure from minority shareholders to act in their interest. With this type of share structures, investors lose a protective market mechanism. When a controlling party exists, the market cannot correct management (opportunistic) behaviour, for example through management replacement or through an acquisition.Despite these issues, since Google's IPO in 2004, there is a growing trend toward this dual or tri-share structure. These are mostly used by technology companies. Prominent examples are Facebook, Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and most recently Snapchat. The percentage of companies with a dual-class structure increased from just 1% of U.S IPOs in 2005 to 15% in 2015. More than half of those in 2015 were for technology companies.Under Armour, Facebook, Snapchat (SNAP) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have an even more complicated structure: a ""tri-class"" share structure.However, in the case of Google, its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin no longer hold majority ownership of the company's stock, but they still own majority of the voting rights. Class A shares are publicly traded and hold one vote per share, while Class B shares carry 10 times as many votes for the founders. In 2014, Google created an entirely new class of shares, Class C shares. Class C shares holds no voting rights, so Class A or B shares will not be diluted in terms of voting power. Hence the founders can still have control of the company with 56% of the votes.Facebook followed a very similar structure for their IPO. Class A shares are publicly traded and hold one vote per share, while Class B shares carry 10 votes per shares and are owned by company insiders. Facebook also created Class C shares in 2016, these shares also hold the same economic rights but no voting rights. This would solidify Mark Zuckerberg's control of the company and ensures final say on every future decision.Recent IPO Snapchat would take an even more extreme approach. Snap also has three class of shares, but only Class A is publicly available and they contain no voting rights. While Class B holds one vote per share, mostly owned by insiders. Class C holds 10 votes per share and are owned by their co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Snap said the IPO would be the first to offer shares with no voting power.Negative aspects of a multi-class structureMulti-class structures face agency problems. A ""Dual-Class"" / ""Tri-Class"" structure, outlined in an academic paper published by Dr. Masulis, Dr. Wang and Dr. Xie in The Journal of Finance (a leading finance academic journal). They conducted a study that examines the financial consequences of a separation in ownership and control. The study looks at over 500 U.S. companies as a whole. Focusing on how divergence between insider voting rights and cash-flow rights affects the managerial extraction of private benefit of control. Results were obvious, insiders holding more voting rights relative to cash flow rights will extract more private benefits at the expense of outside shareholders.The study showed that as the divergence increases:- Marginal value of cash decreases by $0.08 when the divergence between cash flow rights and control rights increase (i.e. when some shareholders own particular classes of shares that give them disproportionate control of the company).- CEO receives greater compensation: CEO compensation increases by $1.054 million when the divergence between cash flow rights and control rights increase.- Managers make shareholder value-destroying acquisitions more often: Probability of an acquisition decisions that gives negative abnormal return will increase by 6.26% when the divergence between cash flow rights and control rights increase.- Capital expenditure contributes less to shareholder value: Shareholder value will decrease by $0.27 when the divergence between cash flow rights and control rights increase.Positive aspects of a multi-class structureMulti-class structure has its advantages. Multi-class structures are decided at the time of an IPO. The most obvious characteristic is that, founders or others can maintain a higher level of control in comparison to ordinary shareholders. This allows founders to focus on their long-term value creation plans and not be distracted by short-term performance pressures from other investors.A few prominent examples show the benefits of these structures. Here we will focus on two major claims mentioned in the Journal of Finance article: CEO receives greater compensation and managers make shareholder value-destroying acquisitions.Google acquisitions and value creationBeginning with Google, the company has been a prolific acquirer. Over the years, Google acquired many companies (see a list here). Although there is limited visibility on most acquisitions, a few acquisitions have been huge successes. YouTube is now probably worth 10 times or more the $1.65B in 2006. The price tag paid in 2006 seemed high at the time, but last year alone YouTube was estimated to have $10.4 billion in revenue. Android is also a powerful asset. The acquisition of Android helped Google become a global power house in mobile operating systems, with nearly 80% of the smartphones sold running Android.The three worst acquisitions that analyst agreed on were ITA Software ($700 million), dMarc Broadcasting ($102 million) and Slide ($180 million). But they all created value of Google in some way, so they weren't necessarily value-destroying. In addition, the actual dollar amount of these ""bad"" acquisition were entirely covered by the ""good"" acquisitions. It is difficult to say whether the acquisitions of Motorola ($12.5B) and Nest ($3.2B) generated value.In addition, Google does not pay dividend to their shareholders, so it is important that the earnings they are retaining are creating positive value. Hence, we will be using Berkshire's Modified Earnings Retention Test. It test whether the retained earnings had created value for the investors by doing two tests:Book-value gain exceed the performance of the S&P 500. Stock consistently sell at a premium to book, meaning that every $1 of retained earnings is worth more than $1.As shown above, with the exception of 2013, book-value gain for Google has consistently exceeded the performance of the S&P 500. In addition, the change in book value is always higher than the change in retained earnings, suggesting that the value $1 of retained earnings creates more than $1 in book value.Facebook acquisitionsNext, we will examine some of the acquisitions done by Facebook. Again, we are unable to examine the actual probability of value-destroying acquisitions so we will focus on the effects of their major acquisitions.A few notable acquisitions are, Oculus VR in 2014 for $2 billion, WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion and one of their most successful acquisition, Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion.We will examine Facebook's share price movement in comparison to movements in the S&P 500. The first graph shows the negative market reaction to the acquisition of Oculus VR while the second graph shows positive market reaction to the acquisition of WhatsApp. It is important to understand that despite negative market reaction to the acquisition of Oculus VR, it may sill create long-term value. Further, acquiring Instagram for $1 billion when it was valued at $500 million seemed excessive and value destroying at the time. However, Instagram is now predicted by Credit Suisse to contribute over $3 billion to Facebook's revenue in 2016 and is probably worth $37B. This acquisition would have been much harder to complete if Mark Zuckerberg was not in full control. It really shows the advantage of a dual-class structure. Would Twitter be better with a dual-class structure?Unlike many media or tech companies, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) only issued one class of shares, one vote per share. The 2013 IPO company was sending a message to their investor that they were more responsive to shareholder interests than many of their peers. But the results have been ugly. In comparison to Google and Facebook, the stock price of Twitter has performed poorly. Twitter is now trading at around $15, which is less than 60% of the IPO price of $26.All this makes us wonder whether a dual-class structure would have been better for Twitter. This structure could allow the four founders to focus on the long-term plans and not be disrupted by the short-term mind-set of some investors.Having no voting power can be beneficialIf we assume market efficiency, then these shares are actually priced lower than if they were non-dual class shares. So this ""tri-class"" structure is beneficial for investors who believe in the founder of the company and believe that the company will be headed to the right direction under leadership of the founder.What does this mean for Snapchat?With the recent IPO of Snapchat, it is difficult to say for certain whether listing shares with no voting power is a wise choice, and especially, whether investing in Snapchat despite the lack of voting rights is a good idea. There are definitely potential agency problems that investors need to consider. However, as shown by Facebook and Google, this could be a key driver for Snapchat success. One thing we can say for certain is that, with a valuation of over $25 billion, Snapchat co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy turning down Facebook's $3 billion offer is the best move so far.Conclusion:In general, academic articles show that there are agency problems with dual-class structure companies. However, if we focus on a selected group of high-flying technology companies such as Google, Facebook and SNAP, it may not necessarily be the case. With over 50% voting rights for all three companies, their founders can focus on long-term plans and not be restricted by short-term mind-sets of Wall Street investors. In addition, since these shares hold no voting rights, it will be traded at a discount in comparison to a single class share structure. Hence, investors with complete faith in the founders of the companies will benefit as they do not require the votes in the first place. However, careful scrutiny of the founders' plans and attitude is crucial when investing in this type of company.As always, thank you for reading.

4059491,102628,2017-03-31T12:53:13-04:00,"Snap inks Winter Olympics deal with NBCUniversal worth approximately $50-75m in 1Q 2018 revenue.Samsung releases its Galaxy S8, complete with a debuting AI assistant named..... wait for it..... Bixby?Amazon pushes for e-commerce-friendly product design (and hints at the power of automation to come).Facebook and Snap initiated by Barclays.","As augmented reality makes its way into the mainstream market, we look forward to the 2018 Olympic Games as perhaps the first ""Augmented Games"" in this edition of the Samadhi Brief…Contributing Authors: Fred McClimans, John Freeman, Zach MitchellSnap wins Winter Olympics dealSnap, Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) reportedly closed a deal with NBCUniversal (NASDAQ:CMCSA) related to the Winter 2018 Olympics Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. As part of the terms, NBCUniversal will be able to sell novelty geofilters and lenses to advertisers which Snapchat users will be able to overlay on top of their photos/videos. Snap will be able to share clips of the Olympics via Stories (<10-second, spontaneous clips that anyone can contribute to and that disappear after a day), and will dedicate a Discover feed (pre-recorded content from selected advertisers) to NBC's broadcast.NBCUniversal and Snap completed a similar deal last summer for the Rio summer games, during which roughly 35 million Americans viewed 230 million minutes of Snapchat content according to NBC Olympics President Gary Zenkel.Bottom line: Snap continues to seek advertising market share by establishing itself as a premiere medium - not just a niche or novelty channel - and we believe this is the right strategy. Snap's paycheck from the 2018 Games (estimated by industry analysts at approximately $50-75m of 1Q 2018 revenue) will likely include an equal amount of marketing and PR benefit if it can successfully create the first ""augmented"" Games (the London 2014 Games were known as the first ""mobile"" Games, and the Rio 2016 Games were widely heralded as the first truly ""digital"" Games).Expect Snap to leverage these upcoming games in a major way from a marketing and global expansion perspective.For NBCUniversal, which poured $500m into Snap's February IPO, and parent Comcast, this helps cement its role as perhaps the key partner for Snap's media ambitions going forward (a coveted position if it can maintain its standing).For more background on the tech aspect of the games, check out this 2016 webinar video featuring Samadhi's Fred McClimans (in a prior role) and Elly Resende, technology director for the Rio 2016 Games.Samsung releases its Galaxy S8Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) released its Galaxy S8 lineup on Wednesday (five colors and two sizes), which will feature a curved screen and will debut its AI assistant, Bixby. Of note, the phones will include a side button dedicated to summoning Bixby, indicating that Samsung views it as more than just a novelty feature (it supports both voice and button activation, and integrates the ability to use the camera as an input ""what is this I'm looking at"").Bottom line: Samsung's Galaxies are its flagship mobile phones - and its most direct competitor to the iPhone - so sales numbers tied to this launch will provide telling insight into Samsung's brand cache, particularly as it looks to recover from last fall's Note disaster and fend off what we consider to be a major threat in the form of the iPhone 8 to be released later this year. Regarding Bixby, initial reviews look promising, but it is still in its early stages, and we remain cautious until we see how well Samsung can convince third-party developers to embrace it.Amazon looks to fundamentally alter consumer goods designAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has reportedly invited a short list of consumer goods giants to its Seattle headquarters to pitch an e-commerce-focused approach to product design. The changes Amazon is pitching would make consumer staples, including cereals, toiletries, cleaning products, etc., easier to store in large fulfillment centers and easier to ship (i.e., more durable).Bottom line: Always the forward-thinker, Amazon continues to push for streamlined production and distribution. We would also not be surprised to find that large-scale ""drone-friendly"" packaging was pitched, and we look forward to following up on details of the meeting. The real impact of this move can be found in a single word: automation (from both a warehouse and shipping/logistics perspective). The idea of morphing product packaging to be more mechanically-oriented is telling about both the future of Amazon and the larger retail market.Coverage and Earnings Updates…Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snap were initiated by Barclays, receiving Buy and Equal Weight ratings, respectively. Barclays lauded Facebook as being ""the best pure play in consumer Internet around the secular growth in mobile advertising,"" and touted its strong portfolio of social media offerings. Snap was praised for its long-term prospects, but rated cautiously due to near-term profitability and valuation concerns.We agree with both sentiments: Facebook, as we've written about before, may have the richest consumer data of any private sector entity, and it has had tremendous success monetizing its user base. Snap, on the other hand, is stuck on a fast-moving treadmill (thanks to its lofty valuation) and will likely make its investors sweat over the near term.CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) was upgraded by Goldman Sachs from Neutral to Buy. Goldman issued confidence in CYBR's product suite and anticipates significant enterprise spending driving overperformance over the next several quarters. A $64 price target was given. CYBR closed at $50.15 on Wednesday.Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI) reached a record high on Wednesday after its price target was raised by UBS to $57 from $48. Justification for the boost includes confidence in ATVI's growing e-sports presence, as well as in its Overwatch, King, Destiny, and Call of Duty games. The stock closed at $50.14 on Wednesday.Dell Technologies (DVMT) reported 4Q FY2016 earnings Wednesday before the open. It posted FY2016 revenues and operating income of $61.6 billion and $(1.7 billion), respectively. Given that recently completed its acquisitions of EMC and VMware, DMVT has no analyst estimates.In case you missed it…Nokia (NYSE:NOK) won a deal from ALTAN Redes, a new Mexico telecom provider, to build and operate a new nationwide LTE network. The contract is expected to bring in $7 billion over the next nine years.Dropbox established a $600m line of credit, according to Bloomberg, providing it with a cash infusion ahead of a rumored late-2017 IPO.Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), a content delivery network (CDN) and cloud-services provider, acquired SOASTA, Inc., a private developer of software testing tools."
4058860,22445,2017-03-29T13:38:19-04:00,"Facebook has formally introduced many SNAP-like capabilities in its Apps.Snap users also use Facebook and they will prefer to use SNAP-like features from Facebook Apps, instead.Expect SNAP's active users to flatten or even fall over the next few quarters.","After several months of testing in selected markets, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced via its blog that it is adding capabilities that mimic, or outright copy, many of the features that Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has.""Facebook Stories"" will allow users to share photos and video with everyone, or specific friends, which disappear after a while. Also, you can now put filters on pictures and animations, which is the real reason why SNAP became popular.On the back of this announcement, SNAP's stock fell by almost 7% and many think that FB's new features will be a ""SNAP killer."" I think they are right, here's why.I have been using Facebook's Messenger more and more without realizing itUntil several years ago, I used to use a variety of social Apps to communicate. In fact, I rarely use the phone anymore (landline or cellular).I used Viber, WhatsApp and Skype a lot. However, over time, I found myself using Messenger more and more without realizing it. Why? Because of convenience.Several years ago Messenger was only a text service, so if I wanted to talk to one of my friends, I had to use something else. That something else was mostly Viber and Skype (and later on WhatsApp).However, as Messenger evolved with video and voice capabilities, I found myself using Viber and Skype less and less.The reason is because just about everyone I know is also on Facebook. So by default, I just see if they are online and call then. I do not need to go on a different App, or second-guess if they will answer on Viber. So while I still have Viber, WhatsApp and Skype installed, I rarely use them anymore.And that's the reason why Messenger is second only to Facebook in App usage, and has about the same active users as WhatsApp. It's the ease of communications, coupled with the fact that just about everyone you know is also on FB.sourceIt's a millennial thing (they say)In defending SNAP, Brian White from Drexel Hamilton says:Well, I have news for everyone, FB has the millennials also. FB has had them before SNAP. In fact, I do not think there is a single millennial that does not use FB on a daily basis.Taking my kids as an example, the main reason they use SNAP is for the filters. Meaning, they share funny pictures of themselves and their friends by putting a filter on their pictures or videos.However, if you give them the capability to do the same via FB, why would they bother changing Apps to share those funny pictures on SNAP, when they could do the same from FB's App? The answer is they don't.And just like myself - that used more and more Messenger without realizing it - they too will be using FB's App more and more to share these funny pictures.And very soon they will realize that they don't need to go on SNAP, because all their friends are already on FB, and they don't need to change Apps when FB offers them the same thing.It's about users, not profits (yet)To be honest, I fail to understand how many analysts are pricing SNAP. At over 50X revenue, a company has to be increasing revenue and profits by 500% per year in order to command such a valuation (in my book).However, since SNAP is not forecasted to have profits for at least 2-3 more years, the next best valuation metric is user growth.As you know, SNAP's user base has not been growing as it has in the past. In fact, looking at the most recent figures, one can probably say that user growth is stalling and flattening.SourceSo if I am correct - that many SNAP users will prefer to use the 3 main FB Apps for convenience - I think active users on SNAP will either flatten out completely, or even fall, over the next 2 quarters.And if something like this happens, watch out below because SNAP's stock will fall like a rock. And if you think Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) stock has taken a licking, wait until you see how the market will knock down SNAP, because its valuation is richer than Twitter ever was."
4058019,47521,2017-03-27T02:55:52-04:00,Snap has to improve its cost of revenue.That requires it to focus primarily on higher value markets.Why that is better for the short term but a challenge further out.Where it has to improve to narrow the gap.,"source: NYPostAt first glance it appears Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is losing its growth momentum, as its prospectus shows its growth of daily active users as 15 million over the last two quarters, far below the 36 million added in the two quarters before those.Measured by percentage, the combined quarters adding 36 million daily active users represented a growth rate of 7 percent, while the 15 million over the last two quarters of 2016 represented a much smaller growth rate of 3.2 percent.source: S-1/A FilingThere are legitimate concerns, but the fact the company has, because of high costs of revenue, decided to focus only on the North American and European markets. In the fourth quarter of 2016 Snapchat didn't add any more daily active users outside of those two markets. It didn't try to.Emerging marketsSnap Inc. in reality can't afford to go after emerging markets. The costs are higher and the return much lower. It would only add to the high costs of revenue generation it already has.According to Snap, the ten top markets for mobile advertising represent 60 percent of its users, while accounting for 85 percent of overall ad spend.The company says it doesn't want to spread itself thin, and that's true, but my view is it simply can't afford to compete in those markets at the expense of more profitable markets. There is already a lot of skepticism surrounding the legitimacy of the company to turn a profit, and any significant underperformance would put immense downward pressure on its share price and value.For that reason it's not really a short-term concern to see no growth outside of its major competitive markets, but it will struggle down the road to gain share in emerging markets if their competitors take a big lead over them. That suggests better short term prospects for the company, but raises questions as to its ability to grow several years from now.Where its performance focus liesLike with other social networking sites relying on advertising, the most important metric to watch with Snap is its average revenue per user (ARPU). In the company's filing it said focusing on the top ten markets gives the company ""the opportunity to grow our ARPU.""The company stated in the North American market it generated $2.15 per user, while in the category listed as Rest of World region, it only was able to garner $0.15 per user.What Snap has to do is get more users to increase engagement in order to improve ARPU. Yet in doing so, it also increases its cost of doing business, as the hosting costs jump; primarily because the company didn't install its own servers like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) did, which will be an ongoing challenge in regard to costs going forward.Costs are actually lower in developed markets than in emerging markets, which is why I say the market is forcing it to go in the direction it's taking. In a sense, it has to be willing to sacrifice potential future growth and market share in order to improve margins and its balance sheet.AS engagement increases the company will do better, but it'll have to find a way in the future to lower hosting, content, and other costs. Within the developed markets it'll have to find a way to scale its active users while improving its ARPU.ConclusionSnap actually does fairly well with user engagement, as they spend about 30 minutes a day using the service. Consumers under the age of 25 are the heaviest users, accounting for the high end of user engagement.I seriously doubt we'll see Snap's management change its growth strategy in the near future. The idea of spending a lot more per user to generate on average about $0.15 per use, makes little sense. For that reason it's almost certain to hit the North American and European markets hard, with the primary goal of increasing revenue per user, and secondarily to scale more. That latter will be harder because it already has a significant user base in those markets.It'll continue to grow users, but it'll almost certainly continue to slow in pace.With engagement the key to revenue and earnings growth, my thought is we should look for the company to roll out many more initiatives to keep its existing users interested, and to attract more users to the service.Any failure to do that over the next couple of years will crush the company's share price in my opinion. This is what the company has to do, and anything else is secondary to that effort.Finally, if it can do that while lowering costs and widening margins, the company would get a nice boost in its share price. That will be hard to do in the near term, so I see it continuing to work on increasing revenue per user as its major focus and goal."
4058506,22201,2017-03-28T12:10:18-04:00,"After a soft post-IPO trading period, Snap has rebounded sharply.Why it's dangerous to short this type of IPO right of the gate.For now, it's best to stay on the sidelines here.","I have a very simple message about Snap (SNAP). I don't normally care about these sort of companies, but since it's getting so much attention, let me be clear: Don't short SNAP stock yet. The sort of sharp rally you've seen over the past week is a warning of what could happen to overeager short sellers here.Now that I've made myself clear, a caveat. You can short Snap once it's been public awhile and the hype starts to fade out. But shorting Snap now is a very dangerous proposition. Despite Snap being one of the worst IPOs foisted onto the American market in years, I'd sleep better at night being long Snap stock rather than short. No, that's not an endorsement of going long Snap, let me explain.Sentiment is very strongly against Snap. Take a look at the tenor of Seeking Alpha articles the week SNAP went public.Snapchat Will Eventually Snap Back To RealityEgregious Valuation, Massive Losses, And Shortened Insider Lockup Period Make Snap Inc. A Compelling ShortOh Snap: Chat Isn't Worth The RiskSnap, Inc.: Why I'm Out On The SidelinesSnap: Is This Time Really Different?Snap Will Head Lower; It's Just A Matter Of TimeOh, Snap: Stay Away From This IPOSnap Set-Up For IPO Trap8 Reasons Why We're Not Snapping Snap's IPOWill Investors Look Past Snap's Hype?Beware Of The Snap IPO: We Fear Its Value Could Disappear As Quickly As Its MessagesExit Snap Shares Post The IPOSnap's Flawed Business ModelAmazingly, all of those articles were published on Seeking Alpha in Snap's first week as a public company. That's 13 different authors all telling people to avoid a stock in a four-day span. It's incredible!In the short term, that consensus avoid call was correct. SNAP stock initially snapped (sorry) to the downside, falling from $24 to $20. However, that wouldn't be the end of the story - the stock found its low, and has come roaring back over the past week:SNAP data by YChartsIt's fair to say that expectations for Snap are really low. Most people that know how to read financial statements and/or that saw the previous tech bubble know how the Snap story will (eventually) play out. The next Facebook (FB) this is not. In fact, given Facebook's advances in video, it seems reasonably likely that Facebook will be the Facebook of Snap's market. Snap was growing nicely, and when its growth rapidly decelerated, it decided to cash out by dumping a bloated-valuation IPO on the public. This is clear, obvious, and pretty much incontrovertible.However, contrary to my expectations, it seems young people are snapping up the IPO. I saw a report suggesting the average age of Snap buyers on IPO day was under 30 years old. I don't know how such a figure would be calculated, but it's pretty remarkable if true. Lending credence to the idea, roughly half of accounts at Robinhood – a hyper-discount brokerage aimed at millennials – traded in Snap stock on its opening day.Having spoken with several of my peers that have Robinhood accounts, let's just say that financial literacy is pretty hit or miss. Some of my friends don't even understand the idea of market caps; I've heard that argument that Apple is obviously a better deal than Google, since Google costs five times more per share. To the extent that people unfamiliar with stock splits are acquiring Snap shares, the potential for market irrationality is high.Furthermore, Snap has a remarkably small float of publicly-trading stock at the moment. Only about 12% of Snap's overall outstanding stock can trade on the stock exchange at present. This means that while Snap has its absurd $30 billion or whatever valuation, only a few billion dollars of stock can actually be purchased on the open market. This artificial scarcity of shares allows the stock to trade far over its actual market clearing price; it takes only a few naive folks believing Snap's story to keep the stock far above its true value in the short run.Low-float IPOs have been popular as of late, leading to a common trend where these companies run up; often dramatically, in the short run. Then lock-up expirations finish, allowing insiders to sell a lot more stock. Once this happens, the artificial imbalance between supply and demand is lifted and the stock in question craters. Here are some recent examples:Twilio (NYSE:TWLO)GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO)Acacia (NASDAQ:ACIA)Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK)Now, of course, not all the low-float IPOs work out like this, with the huge pop before the crash. More and more companies have been using this tactic lately, and some recent attempts such as Nutanix (NTNX) and Coupa Software (COUP) never launched following the IPO.However, the risk is very much there that Snap trades up for far longer than expected, hurting short-term short sellers who buy puts or bear a large borrow fee in the interim.Shorting new IPOs is generally viewed as a beginner's mistake within the fund management industry. The insiders have every incentive to keep the stock up for a few quarters, if they can manage it, to dump more of their stock on the market at a high price as it unlocks. As such, they'll use every aggressive accounting tactic they can to make the first quarter or two as a public company look good.Also, the investment banks that underwrote the IPO have to tout the stock (just look at all the buy ratings that have piled in lately); it's quid pro quo in return for the company picking their bank to run the deal. If an investment bank can't keep the stock at or above the IPO price for at least a few quarters, it'll tend to get far less business in the future.That's not to say Snap can't drop in the short run. This is one of the most bloated and least likely to succeed IPOs I've seen in ages. And at its current valuation, it takes some rather aggressive assumptions to justify the price. Snap could dump following the IPO, like Facebook did initially back before it figured out how to monetize mobile.But there are decent odds that Snap will go up, or at least sideways, in the short term. Shorting the stock, or buying puts, is probably not going to work out well, particularly given the steep cost of going short and high odds of a squeeze. When the conventional wisdom is all agreed on a stock being a dud, and yet it goes up anyways, as we've seen this past week, it suggests there's a more complex market mechanism at work.This article first appeared on Ian's Insider Corner and has been updated to reflect subsequent developments."
4059836,102986,2017-04-03T12:35:25-04:00,Participate in SNAP with no money down.Have a chance to buy at the $17 IPO price.Potentially participate in the upside of SNAP.There are some risks though.,"If you are like me, a distinct lack of New York investment banker relationships prevented you from being involved in SNAP pre-IPO. Most high-flying IPOs are off limits to normal investors these days.This past week, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) got a slew of positive verdicts from Wall Street research departments. Snap's ratings seem to have gotten a boost as its underwriters chimed in. Morgan Stanley offered an overweight rating on the company, while Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank gave the stock a buy. Credit Suisse also issued an outperform rating and only JPMorgan rated it neutral. Firms involved in a stock's public offering aren't allowed to issue recommendations during the IPO quiet period.Only a month into its life as a public company, we wonder what Snap will act going forward. Will it crash like a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or prosper like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)? I mention these companies since investors have drawn parallels between Snap, Twitter, and Facebook based on the companies' digital ad-based model and social, viral platforms.That's left Snap with two very different potential outcomes: Facebook, which priced its IPO at $38, closed at $142.05 a share on Friday.Twitter, which priced its IPO at $26 per share, closed at $14.95 on Friday.So would you like a chance to buy SNAP at its IPO price of $17?Since we didn't get a chance to participate pre-IPO, we can still see if we can get SNAP at the initial $17 price on a dip, and we can even get paid a little to wait. How? By selling a cash secured PUT on SNAP shares, we give ourselves the chance to pay $17 a share, but no less for SNAP anytime between the present and the expiration date.As you see below, you can sell one PUT that expires on July 21st, 2017, for $0.75/share. Each PUT represents 100 shares, if you sell one PUT, you receive $75.00 now for selling the PUT. This potentially obligates you to pay $17.00 a share for 100 shares ($1,700) for SNAP anytime between now and July 2017. You could also sell the $18.00 PUT and get close to $1.00 per share ($100 in income). If you subtract the $1.00 per share in PUT income from the $18.00 purchase price, you still land at a $17 per share price!After having sold the PUT, we've generated a little income in exchange for being willing to buy SNAP at its IPO price. We can take that $75-100 in income and use it to get some possible upside if SNAP releases strong numbers next quarter. Wouldn't we all like to share in the upside even if we couldn't get in on the IPO?If we look at the chart below, we can use the money we generated from selling the PUT and buy a CALL option on SNAP. Again, the price quoted on the chart is per share, so the cost of buying a $29.00 CALL expiring July 21st, 2017, is $0.92 per share. Since it's 100 shares, buying one CALL will cost us $92.00. The CALL option gives us the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares of SNAP anytime between now and July 21st for $29.00 share.To sum up the trade, we sell a PUT to generate income, and we have the obligation to buy SNAP shares for $17 in the event the shares fall that low between now and July 21st, 2017. If we wanted to participate in the IPO, this is as close as we will come to that price. If it does not fall below $17.00, we keep the income generated.We take the income and buy a CALL option with a $29 strike, allowing us the right to buy SNAP for $29 anytime between now and July 21st, 2017. We would only use this right if SNAP shoots up to more than $29. We get to keep the difference between the $29 share price and whatever the price might be.There are three possible scenarios we face with this trade.Scenario 1: SNAP shares fall below $17In this event, we are obligated to buy 100 shares of SNAP at $17.00, we are out of pocket $1,700, but we own 100 shares of SNAP at its IPO price. If the shares fall lower, we lose money. That is the risk of share ownership, and you would go into this trade with the full knowledge that buying an early stage tech IPO is full of risks. The CALL would expire worthless.Scenario 2: SNAP shares trade between $17 and $29 from now until July 21stIn this event, the income you received from selling the PUT squares off with the money you paid for the CALL. You neither make money, nor lose money. No harm, no foul.Scenario 3: SNAP shoots up over $29In this event, your SNAP PUTs expire worthless. Your CALL is valued at the current price (let's say SNAP foes to $35 a share for example) and the amount of time left between that date and the expiry of the July option. In the example that SNAP was trading at $35, your CALL would be worth $35 - $29 = $6.00 /share. So, you would gain $600 (each CALL being worth 100 shares) as well as some time premium if the shares reach $35 long before July.ConclusionBy selling a PUT strategically and buying a CALL, you have the possibility to either obtain SNAP at its IPO price of $17.00 or share in the upside if the shares surpass $29. All this with no out of pocket expenses!Be warned, however, if SNAP falls below $17, you will need to buy the shares for $17. No matter how low they should go, only sell PUTs, if you have the funds to buy the shares."
4057027,101557,2017-03-22T06:21:08-04:00,"Snap is still trading at a significant premium to implied share price.WhatsApp is a messaging app, while Snapchat is for entertainment.Compared to the richly valued WhatsApp acquisition, Snap is still overvalued.","Many of you have already read my full article on Snap's IPO (NYSE: SNAP). If you have not, I strongly suggest taking a look at it here. Before I begin, I still maintain the thesis I described in that article. However, I think perhaps taking a look at Snap from the perspective of Instagram and WhatsApp instead of just Twitter and Facebook might be a useful exercise. With that said and without further adieu, let us jump right into it.Just from the updated chart below, you can see that from the time I wrote my last article, SNAP has moved downwards to trade at a 49% premium to a simple implied price per share of its publicly traded comps. In fact, much to my surprise, it appears that the stock escaped Tuesday's 1.2% dip, with the Tech sector down 1.43%. Since last time, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) saw an increase in its short float, while the short float of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) remained unchanged.Now moving on the main topic of discussion. As I stated in my previous article, SNAP does not have any real perfect publicly traded comps. The best examples would be WhatsApp and Instagram, which were both acquired by Facebook. The difficulty comes with the fact that neither of these are public companies, and therefore, have no reason to disclose any information about their user base size or revenues. In fact, even after their acquisition by Facebook, many of those metrics are still unknown. But regardless, comparing SNAP now to Instagram and WhatsApp pre-acquisition could prove a useful exercise. Below you will see the data that I was able to collect on each directly before or immediately after their acquisitions by Facebook. Before analyzing it, as a quick disclaimer: the data I collected are from a variety of different sources (rather than just from Capital IQ, company files, and Bloomberg). As a result of this, the accuracy may not be perfect. That being said, I have done my best to cross-check the data to ensure it is as accurate as we can get.As you can see from the ""comps"" table above, even when compared to Instagram and WhatsApp at the time of their acquisitions, SNAP is trading ridiculously high. Those who remember all the articles and buzz around the $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp will know how richly it was valued. It is important to note that the time frame for all of these are different, so keep that in mind. Looking at a TEV/Rev basis, we know that Instagram was acquired when it had no revenue and a decent operating loss for the last two years. In addition to that, Facebook paid roughly 19 times revenue for WhatsApp, according to a Bloomberg report. Given both of these, a trading metric like 59.3x is still outlandish for SNAP, in my opinion.Looking at daily and monthly active users, you can see that WhatsApp was more like SNAP than Instagram at its acquisition time. Even so, however, SNAP is still valued significantly higher than WhatsApp on this basis. One argument could be the growth story of SNAP: that as the company continues to monetize and aggressively grow its active user basis, SNAP will reach a similar level as WhatsApp.But I disagree with this story. If we stop looking at the numbers for just a moment and look at the purpose of the applications themselves, we can see why this might not be justified. Snap says it is first and foremost a ""camera company,"" whereas WhatsApp is a messenger app that states its goal is ""to stay in touch with friends and family, anytime and anywhere."" As such, I think WhatsApp falls more under an essential app for communication around the globe, whereas Snapchat is a application with more entertainment than communication value.I think overall the analysis and comparison of WhatsApp and Instagram at the time of their acquisition to SNAP adds to the concerns about the young company's valuation. Coupling this article with what we discussed in the last article, it might be easy to see a nice tidy short thesis starting to develop. A quick counterpoint I would add to perhaps make this slightly less attractive of a short is that over the last month or so, the rate that ads appear in North America seems to be trending upwards. Again, I would reiterate the conclusion of my previous article: SNAP is a young company that is overvalued at present but is not a solid short, as information on the growth story is yet to be determined."

This significant concern appears to be a factor in Snap's slowing user growth. Staying ahead of Facebook's R&D effort will be expensive.Additional competition for Snap may surface during Apple's WWDC in June. This possible development would become a significant negative for this stock.","Much discussion has taken place regarding the recent Snap IPO and the company's valuation relative to a number of important metrics. This article will reiterate a few of these points. But rather than repeat the same metrics that have already been stated in numerous other articles, we will attempt to contribute additional salient points regarding the following items to the Snap discussion:The Snap (NYSE: SNAP) IPO priced above its initial range at $17 on 3/2/17. Its opening trade was still higher at $24 as this wearables category company debuted in public trading. On the morning of day two trading, Snap shares received an initial momentum push higher to above $29 per share. This moved the company's market cap towards the $40 billion mark. Larger than some members of the S&P 500 at that market cap, this newly minted technology darling was egregiously overvalued in the eyes of many Wall Street participants.Snap has shown staggering losses and announced in its IPO prospectus that there is currently no path to profitability. More than just disclaimers and typical IPO boilerplate, the risks associated with owning shares of Snap are very real and evolving almost daily. Reality for the price of Snap shares has begun to set in quickly. The early enthusiasm for the stock on IPO day proved ephemeral as a rapid descent in the stock's price has ensued to the $19 range in just 10 trading sessions. Many traders believe that this stock has more downside to come before arriving in a range considered a more reasonable valuation.The initial overvaluation in Snap's share price that has resulted in such sharp downside volatility since the IPO has captured the attention of Wall Street. This dramatic price action in Snap has obscured the fact that this company is a significant addition to the wearables category. Possibly more than any other wearables glasses product, Snap's Spectacles have managed to erase the negative stigma that was established by the failed launch of Google Glasses by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).Spectacles have been marketed successfully as a stylish wearables product that has cachet with an undeniable funky/cool factor. Snap's wearables camera product has been enthusiastically received by a younger demographic, many of which have shown an almost cult-like loyalty to this product and the Snapchat platform to date. Spectacles videos can be shared on the Snapchat social media platform of the parent company, Snap. This strongly positive reception by the marketplace for Spectacles is quite a contrast from the overwhelmingly negative response that Google Glasses received during the initial launch. Some may remember the infamous labeling of Google Glass owners as Glassholes. Not exactly the image that a company hopes to evoke of its customers during the launch phase. And exit stage left as the failed retail product launch of Google Glasses went down in the annals of tech hardware history as a bust.Spectacles have proven to be the antithesis of Google Glasses with style, simplicity, and fun being the marketing focus. Surprisingly, Snap labeled itself, ""a camera company"" during the IPO dog and pony show to potential investors. A technology hardware company would seem to be a less attractive proposition than a social media enterprise. Think GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO) versus Facebook (NASDAQ: FB).It remains to be seen how the camera company strategy will play out for Snap, but having such a large, high profile newcomer to the publicly traded wearables category is a very positive development. While the wearables medical device sub-category has done very well recently, the wearables retail consumer space has been underwhelming. Slowing sales in the smartwatch and fitness tracker space have become evident. Early launches of consumer virtual reality products have received a tepid reception by the consumer. So possibly, the advent of Spectacles could mark a turning point for the wearables category as innovation and new products continue to emerge. Snap's public debut and its initial wearables product called Spectacles are good for the wearables category. Wearables fans are excited to see the direction that Snap chooses to take us next.SNAP data by YChartsThere are only several short-term trading services in the Seeking Alpha marketplace with our service, Trader's Idea Flow, being one of them. So it may appear slightly unusual for us to issue a short-term trading call as we are about to do. Actually, most Seeking Alpha authors are too intelligent to go this far out on a limb and try to predict the near-term future with the following degree of specificity that we are about to attempt. But as a short-term trading service we do our best to provide idea flow. Sometimes we get it right. Take a look at the following two trading calls that we are making on Snap and then we can all see how they work out in the market over the near term:Trading volatility has been excellent on this stock, albeit mostly to the downside.Snap has provided traders with excellent volatility since its opening trade at $24 on 3/2/17. Several recent postings by Trader's Idea Flow on our work with Snap since IPO day may be useful here and help to provide context for our two upcoming trading calls:Trader's Idea Flow recommended our long position taken on IPO day using the initial momentum of this stock to profit 10.3% by selling our long position on the morning of day two of Snap's start of public trading.We then identified a maximal entry point for our short position. We sold Snap short at $27.78 on 3/6/17 and this position is currently up 30% as of the close of trading on 3/17/17. This summary provides some context to bring you up to the present on our trading work in Snap since IPO day. Now let's discuss how we might attempt to make a pair of successful trades in Snap for the near term:Our first trading call is for Snap to experience a trading bounce at $17. We believe that this bounce will occur at the $17 price level for the following reasons:The confluence of this stock possibly reaching down to the $17 level at about the same time as the week prior to the ending of the quiet period could provide a binary catalyst for the trading bounce off of $17. Trader's Idea Flow may look for this to be an opportunity to cover our short and establish a temporary long position.Our second trading call is for the momentum in this bounce to stall relatively quickly and for the price of Snap shares to continue their decline to new lows. We will employ pattern recognition using the Breakout Failure Pattern as our template to identify both the exit point for our long position and also the entry point for our new short position. Again, please reference our earlier links in this article to become familiar with the pattern recognition tool and specifically the Breakout Failure Pattern.Here are a number of reasons why we believe this stock will trade lower:Here is an upcoming timeline of a few key events on Snap's corporate calendar:May: Snap will issue its first earnings report as a public company. Based upon the most recent data, we might expect a continuance in the trend of slowing user growth, large losses, and the market will be very interested in the rate of revenue growth;June: Apple's WWDC may preview an app for the much heralded iPhone 8 that could provide additional competition for the Snapchat app. If this event were to occur, then it would be a significantly negative factor for Snap's stock price.August: Snap issues its second earnings report.August: The early lockup expiry has been set for 150 days from the IPO date. It is highly likely that we will see millions of shares coming to market from employees who will want to cash in on some of their new IPO wealth. Many of these new shares on the market will also be available for loan into the accounts of short sellers.So the next several months may prove to be long, hot, difficult months in the Venice beach headquarters of Snap. There is little doubt that the market will move the price of Snap shares to what it perceives as a more reasonable valuation. And for now, the direction of that movement is lower. Trader's Idea Flow believes that a more reasonable valuation for Snap shares may end up lower than the $17 IPO price by the end of 2017.Candidly, we believe that single digits is possible for the price of Snap shares by year end. Valuations of comparable companies currently show Snap trading at an excessive valuation based upon optimistic financial results in the quarters ahead. Even if the company meets the optimistic projections, the stock is still overvalued. But if reality does not match the optimism built into the current stock price for Snap shares, then we could see this stock become a broken IPO and trade much lower than many currently believe possible. Reference recent broken tech IPOs such as Fitbit (NYSE: FIT), Twitter, and GoPro to name just a few. These stocks each traded much lower than many believed possible. Snap could certainly find a more reasonable valuation that the market is comfortable with below $10 per share. Please don't shoot or burn the messenger at the stake.Beyond the overvaluation issue that plagues the company's stock currently in early 2017, we believe that Snap is a promising, young company. Snap is emergent in the wearables category with the potential for a bright future in 2018 and beyond. The challenges ahead for Snap's survival and growth are stoic and the choices made by the company during the remainder of 2017 will be crucial.Whether Snap can carve out a niche in the technology space as a ""camera company"" may depend upon the following question: Can Snap's young, inexperienced management team mature quickly enough and acquire the knowledge to bring costs under control, grow revenues, pivot to a profitable business plan, deliver winning innovations to the marketplace, and stave off competition, all the while trying to retain and attract talent from Silicon Valley and properly manage Wall Street expectations and communications. The long list of duties that will need to be learned quickly and executed flawlessly by Snap's management is daunting.You know, sometimes a couple of young men with a lot of money and a supermodel fiancee might just wish for simpler days and a get-a-way spot somewhere on a beach. We wish Snap and their management team good luck on their public journey.Please be sure to use the big, orange button to follow Bull & Bear Trading's future articles and blog posts.

We analyzed 36 of the biggest IPOs since 2010 to see if this event is a positive catalyst.The week leading up to the expiration is an opportunity - 60% of companies were positive; magnitude of increases was greater than decreases.The week after expiration is more usually a negative event, especially if the lead underwriter isn't buy-rated on the stock.SNAP already has more sell ratings than any other tech IPO before it.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is down almost 20% since its IPO. The company and its 26 underwriters are currently in an SEC enforced quiet period, meaning that the insiders and analysts who know the company best are unable to defend its rapidly falling stock price.The quiet period ends on March 26th, 25 days after SNAP's pricing. We've seen a number of articles (here and here for example) point to the end this period being a potential ""booster shot"" for the company as a deluge of analyst reports are released. It may well be a volatile day, but don't count on it being a positive driver for the stock.We analyzed over 35 of the biggest tech IPOs since 2010 to understand how the quiet period expiration affected stock pricing. Long story short, we recommend investors to buy the rumor and sell before the event.Buy the rumorThe week leading into the expiration favors the upside. 61% of stocks were positive during this period. In addition, the magnitude of the positive moves was greater than that of the negative moves (15 companies increased >+4%, only four companies moved < -4%). The expectation is that analysts will be positive on companies their firms just IPO'd.Sell before the eventThe reality of what actually occurs post-expiration is quite different from expectation - out of the 36 companies analyzed, the left lead underwriting firm came out with a neutral rating 23 times (64%). The week following the quiet period expiration was positive for only 40% of companies. Companies that were neutral rate were down 79% of the time.So the question becomes: what's the likelihood that Morgan Stanley (left-lead) and other underwriters come out strongly positive on SNAP? There are 10 analysts (non-underwriting firms) who have already initiated on the stock and none of them have buy ratings - four have holds and six have sells. Six sell ratings is more than any other company in this analysis had even after the expiration of the quiet period.While MS and others could well try to bolster the stock, the overall sentiment on SNAP appears to be extremely negative and we wouldn't count on anyone going out on a limb here. Don't bet on that booster shot - buy the rumor but sell before the event."
4056810,102820,2017-03-21T11:56:36-04:00,Snap Inc. received its first 'buy' rating with a $25 price target.Proponents of the company continue to demonstrate a misunderstanding of what Snapchat is.Many short-term headwinds remain; Snap is a sell.,"Snap (NYSE:SNAP) regained some steam Monday following the social media company's first 'buy' rating and the stock closed up 2%. Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. initiated coverage on Snap with a 'buy' rating and a $25 price target. This suggests 25% upside from the stock's current price. Of the coverage that has been initiated since Snap went public, this is the first note that suggests any notable upside in the future.Snap gets a 'Buy'Let's begin by breaking down analyst James Cakmak's comments regarding the initiated 'buy' rating. In a note to investors, Cakmak said, ""In short, Snap could conceivably replace the camera app."" This misconstrued notion that Snap is going to eliminate the camera app is simply outrageous. Cakmak believes Snap is the only company that's innovating and other social media giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are simply copying them. While this statement is true to some degree, it's off base. Snapchat, despite being a highly popular app, is not innovating the camera. Comments like those are downright insulting to the likes of Steven Sasson. If anything, it is innovating the way people share and interact with the camera. While this may seem like a nuance, it's extremely important in our analysis. Facebook is copying Snapchat's features and it is having success doing it. Instagram has added stories and WhatsApp just recently introduced a new feature called 'Status.' This feature allows users to post photos, videos, GIFs, drawings, and more with their friends on a feed and it will disappear after 24 hours. The reason imitators are having success is because Snapchat lacks a competitive advantage. If it was truly innovating, this would not be an issue. Comments like these make me wonder if analysts actually use Snapchat or even talk to the main demographic that uses the app. Snapchat is mostly used to share low quality images with friends.What I found most alarming with Cakmak's comments was what he said in regards to monitoring user data via Bitmoji. Bitmoji was acquired for over $100M by Snapchat in 2016. For those who are unaware, Bitmoji allows you to create an animated person that looks just like you. You can select certain clothes and animations then superimpose these images over your Snapchats (see example below).(Source: website)Cakmak believes that Bitmoji is going to help Snap better understand its user base and gather important data. This afternoon, on CNBC, he said, ""they know exactly what you look like, what your style is and what brands you're associated with."" To me, this is flat out preposterous. To think that Snapchat is going to be able to curate content to individual users' interests based of a cartoon image is ridiculous. Cakmak would like to see Snapchat become ""the digital equivalent of channel surfing"" with curated content provided to you based of your preferences. The assumption that Snap will be able to figure out what content best suits you based of what you look like shows just how out of touch analysts are. My response to these comments looks something like this:Short-Term HeadwindsInvestors should be cognizant of near-term headwinds that Snap may encounter. In May, Snap will release its first earnings report. Judging from what we currently know and the information available, it's entirely possible we see negative trends continue. Decreased DAU growth or even a possible contraction would likely send the stock retreating to new lows. Revenue growth as well as net loss will also be something that investors will be keeping a close eye on. In August, not only will Snap release its second quarterly report but its IPO lock-up will expire. We can safely assume that this will likely flood the market with new shares and potentially reduce share price. Evidence suggests that IPO lock-up expirations cause a drop in share price of about 1-3%.SNAP data by YChartsConclusionAs discussed in my previous article before Snap went public, I remain pessimistic about Snap's growth going forward. Facebook has demonstrated just how nonexistent the barriers to entry are in Snapchat's space. Competition is coming at Snap from all directions, and going public will only open it up to increased scrutiny. I cautioned against analyst 'buy' ratings previously and see this as another opportunity to open a short position. Listening to James Cakmak's comments today only increased my confidence that a vast majority of people don't understand Snapchat. I believe this stock is headed towards its IPO price of $17 in the not so distant future, with even more turbulence to come in the next 90-150 days."
4056533,24473,2017-03-20T12:06:42-04:00,"We have yet to see Snap's business model reach maturity, investing in the company today is a bet on a business model that has yet to fully evolve.Snap didn't show its first ad until late 2014, and is still very early in the process of monetizing its platform.Q4 2016 revenue was up 406% year over year in Q4 '16 to $165M from $33M in Q4 '15.Gross profit turned positive in Q3 2016 and continues to trend higher.If Snap can scale its business to 300M daily active users by 2020 it will be worth $50B+.","IntroNow that the hype has died down on Snap Inc's (NYSE:SNAP) IPO, the stock has quickly settled down from a high of $29, to $19 per share. This puts the current market capitalization of the company at ~$23B ($19/share x 1.2B/shares).Since making its financials public, Snap has found itself to be the victim of a lot of scrutiny and criticism, based on its lack of profitability. I would argue this skepticism is unwarranted.Snap's S-1 filing revealed that the company only began to monetize its platform in late 2014. We are still in the very early stages of Snap creating its business model. Comparing Snap to more mature companies like Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is relevant analysis, but must be taken with a grain of salt as there is massive disparity in both the growth rate and age of the companies.Torrid Revenue Growth & Signs Of Improving ProfitabilitySince launching its ads in late 2014, Snapchat has shown impressive execution in growing its revenue.Snap's Q4 '16 revenue of $166M, was up 404% year over year. This growth rate will slow dramatically in the coming quarters, but the numbers are impressive to say the least.In addition to growing its top-line, Snap's gross margin has improved significantly in each of the last 6 quarters.In Q4 '16 Snap posted a gross profit of $12.3M, equivalent to 7% of revenue ($165.7M). This is still well below the gross profit levels of Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), but that will change quickly as Snap continues to refine its advertising model.With such a rapid growth rate, and quickly changing margin dynamics, it's impractical to value Snap on historical financials.Going forward, investors should be focused on not only the company's top-line growth, but Snap's ability to continue to improve both its gross and operating margins.Risks: User Growth Slowdown & The Instagram ThreatThe bull case on Snap will crumble if they cannot continue to grow users.The biggest obstacle that Snapchat is facing to user growth is Instagram. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been pushing full steam ahead to copy every feature of Snapchat across almost all of its different social properties.In fact, Instagram replicated Snapchat's Stories feature in August 2016, and ever since then Snap's user growth appears to have slowed down dramatically.Snap only added 5M new daily active users users in Q4 '16, the lowest number of new Daily Active Users (DAUs) in a quarter since Q3 '14. It's still unclear whether Instagram Stories has been responsible for this slowdown, but either way, it will be something to watch in Snap's upcoming quarterly reports.If Instagram successfully integrates Snapchat's features into it's already booming platform, it will be the demise of Snap Inc.However, the fact that Zuckerburg continues to copy all of Snapchat's functionality, confirms that the LA-based social media newcomer is doing something very right.New Vice Partnership Shows A Glimpse Into Snap's PotentialJust this week Snap anounced a partnership with Vice to produce 8 original shows that will be aired exclusively on Snapchat. The show will feature rapper Action Bronson and is about him setting up different couples (it sounds Bachelor-esque).As Snapchat evolves beyond being just a social network and integrates news and exclusive shows, its monetization potential will continue to increase. Initiatives like the recently announced Vice deal are allowing Snap to grow into a content delivery network/media company.Watching leading content companies like Vice invest in exclusive shows for Snap's new age media platform, is a very bullish indicator.ValuationAccording to the analyst consensus provided by Yahoo! Finance, Snap is projected to hit $1B in 2017 revenue, and $2B in 2018 revenue.Based on the current market capitalization of $23B, that translates to a 2017 P/S multiple of 23X, and a 2018 P/S multiple of 11.5X.These numbers are very rich, but not too far outside of the valuation range that Facebook currently trades at. With a market capitalization of $405B, and projected 2018 sales of $48B, Facebook trades at 2018 P/S multiple of 8.4X.However, Facebook's 2018 revenue growth rate is estimated at 27%, versus Snap's 100%. Taking this into consideration, the price/sales multiple looks very fair, if Snap can continue to execute on monetizing its user base.Facebook just reported Q4 '16 revenue of $8.81B, with 1.227B DAUs. This translates to revenue per DAU of $7.18, during the quarter. On an annualized basis this is a revenue run-rate of $28.72 per DAU.Snap's average revenue per DAU is still drastically lower than Facebook's, but continues to grow quickly.As Snapchat is still early in ramping its monetization efforts, it's revenue per DAU has tremendous upside, and increased 239% in Q4 '16 (to $1.05 from $0.31).If in the long run, Snap can continue to keeps its users on the app for 25-30 minutes per day, it's revenue per DAU potential will be similar to Facebook's.The Bull CaseIf Snap continues to grow its user base at a rapid rate, the company will look very cheap at $19/share ($23B market cap). With 300M DAUs users in 2020, Snap has the potential to be worth $50B+, more than double what it is currently trading for.This assumes Snapchat can ramp its annual revenue per DAU to $20 from 2016's $4.20 (+386% in 4 years).In this scenario, Snapchat would have 2020 revenue of $6B (300M x $20), and likely still be growing revenue and earnings at a very rapid clip. In 2020, a $50B valuation would give the company a P/S multiple of 8.3X, very similar to where Facebook trades today.ConclusionAt $19 per share Snap Inc presents an attractive risk/reward opportunity, if you believe the company can continue to grow its user base.The biggest obstacle to Snap's success will be Facebook's repeated attempts to copy its functionality. If Facebook drives a meaningful portion of Snapchat's engagement over to Instagram, the valuation has a long way to fall from $23B.In short, Snap Inc appears to have a very binary future. Either the company will continue to dominate in the younger age demographic (14-25) and quickly become a very profitable social media titan, or it will crumble in the wake of Zuckerburg's wrath.Snap Inc S-1 Walk ThroughFor those interested in further analysis on Snap Inc, I went through the company's S-1 IPO filing step by step in a YouTube video series."
4058481,102820,2017-03-28T11:35:29-04:00,Snap received a plethora of 'Buy' ratings following the end of the analyst quiet period post-IPO.Analysts suggest increasing ad load could lead to huge revenue growth.The nature of Snapchat's platform could create monetization difficulties going forward.,"Yesterday marked the end of Snap Inc.’s (SNAP) quiet period, the stock closed Monday up 4.82%. At least 14 calls have been made on Snap, all of which are neutral or bullish. The ‘buy’ and ‘outperform’ ratings were seemingly expected and many traders took the opportunity to trade this event.The end of the quiet period brings us a lot of new opportunities. We can finally hear from the analysts most closely associated with the company and their executives. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), the lead underwriter, initiated coverage with an ‘Outperform’ rating and a $28 price target. The rating and price target were no surprise; however, their investment thesis was. Like most Snap bulls, they’re projecting huge monetization opportunities, forecasting revenue of $4.9B in 2020. What caught my eye most was the mention of Snap’s ad load, something that has flown under the radar the past month. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak cited Snap’s ad load as a source for rapid growth. Snap’s 2016 ad load was .6 ads per user every hour. This compares to roughly 50 on Facebook (FB), 100 on Twitter (TWTR) and 7 on Instagram. Nowak believes Snap can increase their ad load to about 8. Over 13x what is currently displayed to the average Snapchat user. As a Snap bear, this caught my attention because logically it makes sense. A major reason for my bearish position is slowing DAU growth, this thesis ignores DAUs and explores the monetization opportunity of the current user base. Theoretically, if Snap could ramp up their ad load they should be able to rapidly increase revenue. At first glance, this sounds like an incredible opportunity for Snap. To think their ad load is only 1/50th of Facebook’s sounds great for future growth. Snapchat will undoubtedly grow this number greatly. However, let’s take a look into potential reasons as to why Snapchat’s monetization capabilities are not remotely close to that of their competitors.Snapchat vs. CompetitorsFirst, Snapchat is primarily a messaging platform. While Facebook, Twitter and Instagram all offer messaging services, that is not their primary service. Despite having Snapchat Stories and other curated media, the platform is built around massaging. This alone creates one major problem for Snap, where will they place ads? Of course they’ll have Sponsored Geofilters, Sponsored Lenses, and curated media through their ‘Discover’ tab, but ad load must be driven differently. As I see it, Snapchat only has one place they can increase their ad load that’s intertwined with user generated content and that’s in Snapchat Stories. For those unaware, a Snapchat Story is a post a user makes available for all their friends to see, it expires after 24 hours. I use Snapchat quite often, probably 8-12 times per day, and I’ve noticed a sizable increase in ads being delivered through Snap Stories. I will say despite the increase in ads, ad load (in my anecdotal experience) is still quite low; however, I often see the same ad over and over again. This suggests that there is a great deal of potential ahead. However, I’m incredibly skeptical on just how much Snap can grow this number, even reaching 8 seems like a tall order. Competitors have a huge leg up on Snap because of their timeline feature which is not only easier to monetize, but easier for users to spend more time on. Facebook organizes content in a way that makes users feel like every time they log on they’re seeing something new. Twitter and Instagram have just recently started to reorganize user created content in a similar fashion. Due to the nature of Snapchat's platform, they aren’t able to do this. Once a user has watched all the available Snapchat Stories (only source of user generated content), Snap’s ability to monetize this user greatly decreases. Additionally, I know many users who only use Snapchat as a messaging service and never check stories or other content. Users of this nature bring no value to Snap as they will likely never see an advertisement. Additionally, I often find that people have much less friends on Snapchat than Facebook or followers on Twitter. Thus, further reducing the time users spend viewing user generated content.Breadth of Advertisers?Just as I believe Snap’s platform will limit their ability to meaningfully increase ad load, I believe the platform will place limits on the amount of advertisers they can reach. Most of the ads that Snapchat plays during stories only last ten seconds, are videos, and can be skipped immediately. This is going to greatly reduce their demand relative to the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. I have no doubt that Snap will evolve over time and find ways to meaningfully integrate ads into stories. But it’s going to be incredibly hard work. Social media websites have the perfect platform to integrate advertisements if they use a timeline type layout. Each post is independent of itself and starts a new train of thought, therefore making it easier for advertisers to capture your attention. With Snap things are a bit different. Let’s say Snapchat has collected data that suggests I’m a fan of the NFL (which is correct). Snapchat then decides to deliver a football ad in the middle of one of my friend's Snapchat Stories, who happens to be at a fashion show in Paris. The ad is completely irrelevant to what I’m watching and will likely be skipped immediately. However, on Facebook or Instagram, where each post is the beginning of a new story, it’s much easier to capture a user’s attention. For these reasons I believe that this greatly reduces the number of advertisers who will be interested in advertising on the platform. While they’ll likely get backing from big companies with already established brands, I’m skeptical if smaller companies will find advertising campaign’s to be sound investments.ConclusionSnap has a long road ahead filled with plenty of hurdles in their quest to profitability. Many underwriters aren’t forecasting profits for at least two years and with a company that has so much doubt to overcome, it’s concerning. So much could go wrong for Snap before they grow into their already lofty valuation. Long-term I remain bearish on Snapchat, but currently have no position in the stock. I will likely wait a few days before taking a position. Snap has momentum and newly public companies have a history of trading on hype and ignoring fundamentals."
4056379,22786,2017-03-19T22:29:56-04:00,"Snap faces significant competition from Facebook.Stock price and market cap is decoupling from SnapChat's great ""daily active user"" numbers.Risks of more downside ahead for shares.","When I posted a forecast that Snap (NYSE:SNAP) would fall below $20 a share by the end of last week, the prediction was easy to make. Ahead of the IPO, investors were already warned the stock would have no voting rights nor may the company may never make any profits. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) continued adding disappearing story functionality to its messaging app, including WhatsApp. Though SNAP was profitable for some longs after the stock peaked at $29.44 a share, the trade is now a loss for others.Now that the stock is below $20 a share, where is it headed next? With only trailing user growth supporting the stock price, SnapChat's stock is likely going lower in the weeks ahead.Seeking Alpha User Yorick explained the three key steps to an IPO and why SNAP's stock faces headwinds:New investors may not have experienced the stock crash for IPOs like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) or Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Zynga's business eroded quickly after it parted ways with Facebook. The company pivoted its business towards mobile apps and has yet to prove the transition will succeed in revitalizing growth. Investors ignored the unsustainable business model for Groupon. By offering steep discounts, businesses ran promotions at a loss, failing to generate repeat business from the coupon buyers. At the time, Groupon stockholders bet the revenue would grow forever.SnapChat has similar characteristics of those over-priced IPOs. The valuation is a function of user growth. But Facebook is not going to let SnapChat take its Messenger users without a fight. By levering its user base of nearly 2 billion (as at the end of 2016), SnapChat will have a tough time taking market share from Facebook.Now that SNAP options are available for trading, investors may now bet freely against the company's prospects. The open interest for April, 21 $18 Puts is 31,844 at a cost of $0.53 per contract. Chances are good that the company's active user growth will slow like that of Twitter, albeit for different reasons.Twitter's growth slowed when the company failed to simplify the site's usability. It introduced live video for sports events like NFL. This move could reverse the quarterly drop in active users. SnapChat is many quarters away from facing the slowdown that plagues Twitter. In February, SnapChat had 158 million daily active users (""DAU"") creating 2.5 billion snaps a day. In North America, the company had 68 million DAUs. Assume this region accounts for most of the revenue for SnapChat. Unfortunately for shareholders, the $23 billion market cap values each of those 68 million DAU North American ""snap"" at $33.80.Snapchat's advertising campaigns are tailored to the advertiser's needs and undergo strict reviews from the company. This may raise the effectiveness of ads but it limits the ad volume, restricting the company's revenue growth.TakeawaySnapChat shareholders will get more nervous on holding the stock now that it is below the $20 level and is headed towards its IPO price. Investors should look at past IPO successes like GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) or Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), which moved towards fair value and below that of the IPO price. Risks are high that with DAU numbers decoupled from SnapChat's valuation, it will revisit its IPO price before potentially falling further.Please [+]Follow me for continued coverage on value stock ideas.

4054418,101006,2017-03-12T22:14:00-04:00,The company's top line is expected to grow by more than 50%.Gross margin was positive in the last quarter.My target value for December 2017 is $31.,"In this article, I would try to perform the valuation of Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) based on my narrative and try to rationalize my stand.Overview of Snap Inc.Snap redefines the smartphone camera as a part of social communication tool by allowing users to add flavor to their communication through various captivating features and then monetizing user engagement through advertisements. The company's user base has grown from 46 million DAU (Daily Active Users) to 160 million DAU over the span of last three years. ARPU (average revenue per user) went up by an average of 64% in the last eight quarters, thus driving up the top line by an average of 80% in the same period.Since the product - Snapchat - requires a lot of bandwidth, Snap is primarily targeting potential users in developed countries. ~97% of total revenue is from North America and Europe. However, revenue from the rest of the world is also increasing, primarily due to a lower base effect. As the company grows, its total expenses as a percentage of revenue is shrinking, largely due to the dominant portion of fixed expenses in the cost structure.Snap received net IPO proceeds worth $2.4 billion and plans to invest in working capital, capital expenditures, operating expenses and general corporate expenses.Revenue: Leading driver of my valuation The company would increase its revenue by continuous innovation and acquisitions in order to expand its portfolio of offerings. This would result in an increase in overall engagement by users, and thus, more advertisement inventory. To back up an assumption about engagement through innovative products, Snap has a track record (even if it is limited) of successful offerings that have gained traction on social media. Popular features such as Stories and picture filters were incorporated by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) due to their mass acceptance by users. It is worth noting that Snapchat has more user engagement than Twitter or LinkedIn (LNKD).Further, it is the only platform whose ecosystem is built around a camera, pictures, and social interactions. The latter two characteristics are also true of Facebook, but its value proposition is different from that of Snapchat. Moreover, a recent update by WhatsApp has resulted in concerns of possible dilution in the differentiation of Snapchat's platform. My only contention in this regard is that no matter how many features are copied by WhatsApp, it would remain a platform centered around text messaging. Other features might add some flavor to the existing value proposition, but these features cannot replicate the Snapchat experience.Snap ads and sponsored creative tools are built around increasing user engagement. This is unique when compared to existing social media platforms. The only concern, in my view, is that the company does not have robust data like Facebook, and thus, it runs a higher risk of creating products such as ""Lens Store"" that are not well received by users.Apart from the above-mentioned factors, my revenue assumptions for Snap include the following:Margins expansions to drive up free cash flowsI have calculated margins after accounting for the following points:As Snap must incur hosting costs for every new user, therefore its operating margins would be lower than those of Twitter and Facebook. On the flip side, its Sales/Capital ratio would be higher, and hence lower reinvestment expenditure. Further, it is to be noted that I have included R&D costs in the calculation of reinvestment expenditure.My concern regarding the company's production of Spectacles stems from the fact that it has no prior experience in hardware manufacturing, which requires supply chain management skills, in addition to quality and operations management.Cost of capitalI have used higher cost of capital for the first five years to incorporate the higher risk. However, after five years, the cost of capital converges to the average required returns of Facebook and Twitter.Marginal tax rate to settle at 30%I have assumed following points when determining the tax rates and net operating losses:Capitalization of LeasesI have capitalized the lease commitments using synthetic cost of debt of 5%. Further, after adding an operating lease to EBIT and deducting the depreciation, adjusted EBIT of 2016 went up by $5.2 million. Further, this adjustment has also increased debt to ~$534 million. The below table illustrates the derivation of adjusted EBIT.Shares outstandingAfter accounting for shares of all classes in addition to RSU (Restricted Share Units), there are 1.2431 billion shares outstanding. Additionally, there were 22.452 million options outstanding. These options were valued using Black-Scholes and then deducted from the value of the firm. ValuationI have used the DCF method to value the firm. The target share price for December 2017 is $31, offering an upside of 39% to the current closing.

4054725,58721,2017-03-13T17:54:57-04:00,"Snap's fees for accounting services related to its IPO are unusually high.Going against trends, its accounting fees dwarfed its legal fees.Snap paid much more for accounting services than other similar IPO companies.","Snap, Inc.'s (NYSE:SNAP) recent IPO was the largest since 2014, and represents another landmark for social media companies. While the biggest question mark for Snap probably revolves around its astronomical valuation despite significant concerns about its business model, one relatively small thing happened to stand out to us: the fees it paid for accounting services, related to its IPO, appear to be unusually high.As part of the registration statement filings, companies are required to disclose ""a reasonably itemized statement of all expenses in connection with"" the offering, including legal and accounting fees. Legal fees are paid to the company's counsel for the compiling of the registration statement and other advice related to the offering. Accounting fees, which are separate and distinct from audit fees (which are usually disclosed in the proxy statement), are paid to the external auditor and relate to services such as the auditor's comfort letter, review of the registration statements, etc.As one can see in the chart below, legal fees typically outweigh accounting fees by about 75% on average.Snap's accounting fees were $6.9 million - almost four times larger than its legal fees and significantly more than the accounting fees paid by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and other similar IPO companies. (You can see for yourself on Page II-1, Item 13, in Snap's last S-1/A.) Compared to other similar IPO companies, the difference stands out.To give a clearer picture of just how much of an outlier Snap's accounting fees are, we made a scatter plot of accounting fees for the companies above compared to the log of their gross IPO proceeds. (Taking the log of gross proceeds better accounts for order of magnitude differences in the size of these IPOs, which range from $350 million to $16,000 million.)A pretty strong trendline reflecting the relationship between proceeds and accounting fees emerges from LinkedIn to Facebook, with Snap showing as an obvious outlier.What does this mean? Frankly, we don't know. But there could be some clues in its registration statement. Two things in particular stand out.First, at the beginning of 2016, Snap switched from using PricewaterhouseCoopers to Ernst & Young. Switching auditors can bring about an increase in costs as the new auditor gets caught up to speed on the company's business and accounting.Second, PwC and Snap identified a material weakness related to a lack of qualified accounting personnel back in fiscal 2014. According to the prospectus, these weaknesses were remediated as of the end of fiscal 2015.So why does this matter? Fees paid to the auditor are always a little sensitive. Although they're being paid by the company, the auditors really work for the public - as a ""public watchdog"". Unusually high fees can signal a couple of things, including unspecified and undisclosed accounting issues.Of course, it's possible Snap just got a bad deal. But what we can say is that Snap is in rarefied air. It's not just among its peers that it stands out. Its IPO accounting fees are still an outlier even when looking at over 1,000 IPOs going back to the beginning of 2012."
4056153,22148,2017-03-17T13:11:29-04:00,"Snap closed below $20 on Thursday for a good reason.Under the best-case scenario, Snap will follow the path of Facebook suggesting significant downside from here.Under the worst-case scenario, investors should watch out below.","On the day that Snap (NYSE:SNAP) closed below $20, one shouldn't be surprised based on the extreme valuation. As well, other concerning data points on advertising appetite add to the reasons for concern.While a lot of people compare Snap to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) due to user growth issues, the question should be whether the suddenly cold IPO ends up like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Is Snap a buy trading below $20 similar to the way the social-networking giant was a few months after its respective IPO?Mounting ConcernsRight after the IPO in 2012, Facebook dipped over 50% from the initial trading above $42. The company faced concerns with the shift to mobile and the lack of advertising products for the future direction of the user base.Facebook faced an issue that, in hindsight, was probably just a bump in the road. The more important part was that the company continued to innovate and bought out a future competitor in Instagram.In a similar regard, Snap investors face a scenario where the stock is poised to break the IPO price. Snap faces a much different issue in a bigger brother intent on copying new features developed by the company.This could become a bump in the road, but investors need to remember that Facebook traded all the way down to a low of around $17.50. Even under a scenario that Snap is a mammoth success, the stock could lose over 50% from the high of nearly $30 based on the Facebook example.FB data by YChartsSnap has other problems, though. Thursday on CNBC, Henry Blodget from Business Insider slipped out some highly negative news regarding advertiser demand for the social platform. Per the CNBC transcript:This news suggests that Snap not only has a well-documented user growth problem, but also an advertiser issue. What makes the platform attractive is the age demographics of the user base with the under-30 crowd, but this is also the group most likely to go at great lengths to avoid key video ads.Vast Valuation ProblemEven if these issues didn't exist, Snap faces a vast valuation problem. Several analysts have actually placed Sell ratings on the stock following the IPO.Moffett Nathanson placed a $15 target on Snap suggesting a valuation still in excess of $20 billion. Even despite a long list of concerns, the analyst suggests revenues could top $4 billion by 2020 to reach his target for a multiple of 5x revenue targets.This target places Snap losing 33% of its value to trade more in line with Facebook, based on 2020 revenues. If the company becomes more like Twitter, the multiple is already far in excess of where that stock should trade based off 2018 numbers.FB PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsTakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that even the great Facebook traded down substantially after a hot IPO. The stock eventually soared after some of the post-IPO issues were resolved and the company grew into the lofty valuation.In this scenario, investors have no reason to own the stock until a big dip. On top of that, the biggest problem for Snap is Facebook, which might not be solvable.The recommendation is to let the stock collapse and pounce if the advertising issues don't materialize and user growth can ramp back up. Under no scenario, though, is Snap a buy at these levels."
4054866,41741,2017-03-14T09:27:27-04:00,"Snap is the first social media IPO since Twitter, although it bills itself as a camera company.The demand for the IPO ‘appeared’ robust - in part given Snap kept the share supply low.There’s still a ton of uncertainty for this ‘camera’ company, including its shareholder unfriendly corporate structure.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has polarized both bulls and bears. I've seen more hate for the stock than love, however. Most consider the Snap valuation to be grossly expensive and can't seem to understand how Snap will make money.Then there's the fact that Snap wants to be considered a camera company and not a social media one. GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), anyone? Then there's also the fact that Snap looks eerily similar to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which has been trading below its $26 a share IPO price for well over a year. Snap will be hampered by its limited user base of sub 24 year olds, who are increasingly fickle when it comes to social media.I've already taken Snap's business model to task, questioning the long-term viability of spending twice its revenues in just costs. It isn't expected to make a profit until 2020 or so. And there's no hope of an activist showing up. That is, new Snap shareholders will own Class A shares which have no voting power and Snap founders will retain nearly 90% of voting rights. This leaves virtually no accountability for management and could keep institutional investors at bay.The silver lining remains that Snap is able to tap into a young demographic that many marketers craze. It has the opportunity, but can it close the gap with the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the big question. Snap generates some $2 in revenues per user, while Facebook is closer to $20 a user.Another positive: Snap has put its lock-up expiration to a year, which should keep early investors from flooding the open market and putting downward pressure on shares - for now. Facebook had a lockup expiration of 120 days. Snap has also kept its the float low, which has helped keep demand for shares high - even if it's somewhat artificially.But in terms of its business, Snap user growth is slowing, the monetization of its users is lagging, and Facebook's Instagram continues to be intense competition. This could lead to further slowdown in revenues, with revenues growing at just 3.3% last quarter.And the benefits of Snap is working against it, to some degree. Right now, Snap's disappearing content model works for a niche group of under 24 year olds. But for advertisers, Snap makes less sense than even Twitter. For ad companies, there is no way to track return on investment, with no ability to link or have a call to action. How does a brand know if its Snap story directly led to a purchase? And Facebook is already cloning many of Snap's key features, including Instagram stories. And Instagram stories allows for click throughs and linking.Snap is the first social media IPO since Twitter in 2013, so the demand for shares was solid. However, the euphoria could quickly wear off. Its core customer base (<24 year olds) is a fickle bunch and has no loyalty when it comes to apps or social media. The opportunity for ad companies is murky and there's little potential for Snap to tap into a larger market as its platform doesn't allow for the potential to go viral, finding accounts to follow or get followers is limited and the potential for public exposure for users is limited. So Snap has a chicken and egg problem, where it can't attract advertisers without users, nor is it conducive for tracking ROI. On the other side, the appeal to users has a ceiling. So Snap remains a questionable public company for the foreseeable future."
4053182,39301,2017-03-08T11:32:34-05:00,"Snap Inc.'s competitive novelty to Facebook and Instagram is perhaps the primary driver behind the bullish momentum.The value argument is not well-defined, and many with reputations to protect have opted to stay on the sidelines.That being the case, Snap Inc. does have a legitimate set of features to remain competitive with both Facebook and Twitter.Furthermore, the demographics of Snapchat could be a forward indicator of adoption among different age demographics.I remain on the sidelines, as it’s difficult to position investors for a long-term position given price volatility, and diminished visibility on what’s being priced into shares.","I'm taking a position on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), as it's the hottest IPO in tech currently. Though I'd like to remain constructive here on valuation, as it's worth noting that it's difficult to intrinsically value a business that's in the early innings of monetizing its installed base, I believe we can arrive at a decent enough understanding of what's driving some of the fundamental and bearish arguments in favor/against Snap Inc. and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Hence, I will only focus on the main arguments between the bulls and bears. Snap Inc.'s recent run-up has left the punditry with ample ammunition to remind retail investors that the valuation could be over-inflated. Unless you were a subscriber of Snap Inc. prior to IPO, and purchased shares directly from underwriters prior to the stock going live, you basically missed out. Hence, not having prime brokerage execution makes it more difficult to participate in IPOs in general.The recent pullback from $29.39 (future resistance level), has now armed the bears with renewed confidence given the stock is now trading at $21.44 (as of the time of writing). However, be wary of this, as many do get burned from attempting to short a stock near the top of the market. Hence, I'm going to take on a more neutral stance on shares, as I believe the stock has some compelling arguments moving in its favor, though valuation is less than desirable (basically strong positions on both sides).What differentiates SnapchatSource: Snap Inc. S-1 FilingSnap Inc. is not another washed-up social IPO. The app presents a viable investment alternative to other platforms like Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). However, the degree to which users have adopted the unique UI (user interface) differentiates the investment opportunity. The user experience is unique in comparison to Instagram and Twitter, as it's not a newsfeed or scroll dependent. The usage of the app is a heck of a lot less linear. Furthermore, it's worth noting that adoption among younger age cohorts, under-30, creates questions over the competitive UI differentiator in comparison to Instagram and Facebook.Therefore, Snapchat may have better functionality. The limitations, or perceived advantages of ""disappearing messages"" creates some uncertainty. It's either a home run and more users will adopt Snapchat's messaging feature, or they won't. If older and even younger age cohorts (under 12 years old) don't find Snap Inc.'s unique messaging function useful, the growth trajectory will mirror that of Twitter as opposed to Facebook.However, I'm starting to perceive heightened credence in the long-term bullish argument, as Snapchat's unique user interface has substantial upside in a post AR (augmented reality) world. In that format, I'd imagine users wanting to separate streams into separate buckets where they can watch a linear story of a specific individual.Many of the larger publishers are investing more ad-dollars into Instagram, but engagement (in terms of viewership) is much higher on Snapchat, as Snapchat users are less resistant to advertising when the ad-units are native to the story feed. Hence, I'm confident that video CPMs will move considerably higher in the long run creating a reasonable runway to buy in anticipation of significant ad-CPM, and ad-engagement growth from both pre-roll or post-roll ad-units.Linear content feeds from Instagram and Facebook could turn into a fad, though I'm not willing to bet against the content format (yet). The younger generation cohorts could become a reliable predictor of adoption from the remaining mobile smartphone installed base, which gives me reason to worry. Bearish and bullish investment managers are debating on Snap Inc.'s longevity, and whether the younger-aged cohorts will age into Snapchat. Meaning two-successive generations of mobile users that adopt Snapchat over Instagram and Facebook given the unique messaging features and interface of the feed in comparison to competing apps.That being the case, I'm not saying Snapchat is going to be an even larger smartphone app than Facebook, but much of the excitement pertaining to the IPO is tending to shift towards that paradigm.Never underestimate the younger installed base of users, as they're often the first to uncover the ""next big thing,"" and force their ""friends"" to participate. Given enough time, the parents then get involved to ""internet stalk,"" and so forth. This cycle will go full circle. Hence, I'm expecting adoption from both older and younger age cohorts.Therefore, I'm fairly convinced that there's room for another social app to co-exist alongside Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, or the ""big four."" But, I guess now it's the ""big five"" social apps with Snapchat included. That being the case, the growth has been nothing short of astounding, as I was one of the earliest users back in early 2013 when the app's usage was limited to sending private messages to friends.But, upon Snap Inc. unleashing Snapchat Stories in 2015 or so, the app took off faster than the Apollo moon mission. That being the case, Snap Inc.'s developer team, and its foresight when developing new features should not be underestimated.Where does this leave Facebook shareholders?Facebook reported strong usage metrics across DAUs and MAUs in the prior quarter. Hence, I'm not saying we're walking into a year where Snapchat's relevance as a social platform will exceed that of Facebook and Instagram. Facebook's installed base grew by 18% y/y on a DAU basis, which is fairly impressive given its audience of 1.2 billion DAUs, which is on track to reach 1.38 billion to 1.4 billion by the end of FY'17.Source: FacebookFacebook's fundamentals will remain intact in the immediate 10-year time frame, and the degree to which Facebook investors should be ""wary"" of competition should be limited, as Facebook's installed base of international users, and its core social functionality seems relatively intact. However, mishaps do occur on a frequent enough basis. Much of what's perceived as risks over privacy and ad-agency distrust of ad-metrics is mostly fabricated hype by the mainstream media. Hence, I'm not too concerned by those risks, but I am concerned by Facebook's mobile interface, and whether it remains relevant as we move through new tech transitions, more specifically, augmented reality.The degree to which usage behaviors shifts away from content streams (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter), and in favor of more organized streams (Snapchat) is difficult to capture. But, from what I understand, I believe adoption among Instagram users of recently launched ""Instagram Stories"" has been limited. Yes, we've heard boasts of accomplishment over at Instagram Stories, and how they have 100 million DAUs (daily active users) according to Tech Crunch.But, I'm not convinced, as a quick eyeball test shows me that the average Instagram user doesn't use the service as much, as they do on Snapchat. The unique format of Snapchat is the disappearance of these stories, and the vertical positioning of the story feed in a separate window as opposed to the horizontal pane the developers at Instagram developed for the app.The image below shows the story feed presented horizontally along Instagram's standard news feed.Source: InstagramInstagram's early adopters of ""Stories"" consisted of large media agencies that represent celebrities, or up-and-coming social media gurus utilizing the app to gain traction. Though it's powerful for self-promotion, Instagram hasn't managed to attract an audience of millennials who are privacy conscious in comparison to Facebook and Instagram. Hence, I'm not willing to label Snapchat an Instagram or Facebook killer, but do remain optimistic on the company's sustained business moat in comparison to competing social apps.Also, the ""story feature"" implementation by Instagram was clunky, and a me-too attempt at best. Snapchat's ability to retain users as a primary destination to publish more personal content reasserts the bullish argument.Bull versus Bears on SnapchatThough the biggest proponents of Snap Inc. are VC firms like Kleiner Perkins and Benchmark Capital, I wouldn't say that they're the absolute best in the industry, but they're still among the top 10 VC firms. Early participation of Benchmark in Snap's B round led to a series of other rounds that brought in KPCB, which injected half a billion and valued shares at $10 billion.So, I've heard some wild figures from other analysts. For example, L&F Capital Management valued shares at $12 billion based on a multi-year estimate on earnings/sales. Fair enough, I know the guys at L&F, as we've run into each other on other stocks like TheStreet (NASDAQ:TST), so they've got a solid handle and understanding of media/internet stocks.Though I question some of the arguments waged by bears, and whether KPCB would be so stupid to value Snap Inc. at $10 billion back in 2014, for a stock in 2017 that's now worth $10.34 ($12 billion market cap) based on L&F's judgment of fundamentals. It would suggest that VCs overly batted the valuation in prior capital raise rounds, though I'm questioning whether that's even likely. I've been a consultant for early stage tech companies moving through funding rounds, so I'm skeptical of the bearish arguments.Wild prognostications of shares falling by 50%+ should be ignored, as it sounds way too good to be true, and number 2)., if the value was that inflated then why wasn't the value-premium discounted in prior equity rounds prior to IPO?Source: Snapchat S-1 filingAs you can tell, the q/q growth comparisons are starting to trend lower. The y/y DAU growth is still relatively impressive, though it's operating from a much smaller audience base. As such, the growth curve is likely more inverted on the adoption of younger users, but whether Snapchat can move further down or up demos (demographics) will be difficult to anticipate in the near term.However, for Snapchat to reach mainstream adoption, it would have to be appealing to a broader demo. This may prove to be difficult, as expectations on reaching adoption levels comparable to Facebook's current mobile installed base seems relatively unlikely. If Snap Inc.'s interface proves to be the better bet over the long run, however, we could justify our stance.Given some deceleration in user attach rates, bears are making the case that it's a busted growth story. However, even with some user acquisition deceleration, I'm certain that given enough time, we'd see Snapchat re-emerge as a fundamentally sound investment on reasonable growth adjusted multiples. Defining that inflection point is difficult, and it's certainly not now. Furthermore, with much of the analyst consensus initiating recommendations below current market price, I'm not willing to move against the tide, or make some wild contrarian calls here.Final thoughtsThe degree to which readers should anticipate Snap Inc. to move higher should be contingent on whether there's a legitimate argument in favor of sustained momentum in app utilization/usage.I'm wary of underestimating Snapchat, or to play devil's advocate on valuation, at some point down the road, I'm expecting investors to buy into this stock on the assumption that Snap Inc.'s differentiated user experience and separate user ecosystem will result in better than priced-in earnings/sales (given enough time).I would want to add the caveat that the share price has pulled back, and a straight path downwards seems relatively unlikely. Waiting for a more opportune re-entry, and assigning a reasonable value premium when based on comps, attainable growth figures will take time. However, I would advise many of you to attempt doing so prior to initiating a long/short position in Snap Inc.Facebook remains a strong bet on conventional fundamentals. Though I question whether the app's interface could become dull or boring in a post AR (augmented reality) world, I'd argue that core Facebook metrics are strong, and investors in Facebook should hold onto shares. I believe the risks to Facebook's business model is primarily represented by Snap Inc. though they attempt to position themselves as a camera company in their S-1 filing.I don't really buy it really, and no one's paying a value premium for another GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) story. So, perhaps Snap Inc. could be a valuable hedge to Facebook. Facebook at some point could fall-off or become a fad down the road (perhaps 10 years from now). Hence, having a second string quarterback could come in handy, especially if Facebook's fundamentals experience a setback due to injured fundamentals.Hence, Snap Inc. is positioned sort of like a hedge against Facebook, but we're not certain if we'll ever need that hedge.That being the case, I'm initiating focus coverage on Snapchat. I will initiate a price target in a couple of weeks. I'm initiating Snapchat at Hold.Until I gain a much stronger understanding of what's priced into shares, I'm sticking to the sidelines.About Cho's Technology ResearchCho's Technology Research is SA's premier technology research package that gives investors and traders an additional edge when investing into tech companies.

(NYSE:SNAP) also grew into a bubble on the first day of trading. By which metric you ask?Since SNAP does not have any profits, I was finally glad to see that Wall Street commentators and analysts were valuing SNAP on a Price/Sales basis since it's a metric I use a lot.According to data compiled by Fortune Magazine and Bloomberg, SNAP's Price/Sales ratio at the time of its IPO was 58. That is by far the highest number I have ever seen of an IPO.Not only that, it's one of the highest numbers I have seen period. I don't think I have ever seen any stock trading so high. And for those who know me, I use the Price/Sales ratio a lot.Good luck to those who are thinking of holding SNAP for the long term. Because from the chart I will show you below, I don't think there are many long-term holders of SNAP (yet).Who wants the hot potato?The chart above depicts the first 4 trading days of SNAP.About 200 million shares were sold in the IPO, and on the first day alone, those shares were flipped. I'm assuming those who bought the stock, did so, because no one could sell the stock short on the first day. They were probably thinking they could also flip the stock to someone else. And for the most part, they did just that.On the second day, the stock went up again, since those who bought SNAP the day before managed to find someone to flip the shares to once more. The hot potato got passed along.However on the third day, those willing to grab the hot potato - in order to flip it along to someone else - dwindled in numbers. Probably because shares on the third day were available for shorting.To make a long story short, the main theme of the first 4 days of trading was that everyone was flipping the stock to someone else.Not a good sign for the long-term prospect of any stock, because it means that, at these levels, there are not many investors willing to hold the stock for more than several hours.Shareholders? What shareholders?It never ceases to amaze me that no one is bothered by the new multi-tier equity structure that seems to be the new norm.Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 60% of the voting rights, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, control 52% of the voting rights repetitively.SNAP's Spiegel and Murphy will control about 88.5% of the company's total voting rights, according to Snap's IPO filing.For those who don't know what this means, every major decision from now on, from appointing directors to just about everything else, rests with these two individuals.I don't know about you, but signing a blank check to any two individuals is not a good practice. Especially individuals who have no prior experience running a public company. And not just any public company, but a public company that has been losing money from day one.I am actually shocked that no one is bothered by this. Even more so, I am shocked that the SEC permits these equity structures to exist. And I am very concerned, worried, and disappointed, that no one in the U.S. congress has made this an issue. Really folks, this multi-tier structure is getting out of hand and will not end well.I know you are not bothered by this, but what's the use of calling yourself a shareholder if you do not have a voice?So as far as I'm concerned, another bubble element of SNAP is the category of a ""lack of checks and balances"" pertaining to a public company.SNAP's growth has stalledSnap daily active users rose 48% Y/Y; however, that growth has stalled recently, with Q/Q growth of just 5 million users, according to the company's filing. SNAP's Q4 sequential user growth was 3.2%. If growth flattens out even more in 2017, then user growth might be less than 20% for the full year.While I think revenue growth will exceed user growth, there are limits to how much SNAP can make per user, before even revenue growth flattens also. As such, it is possible that SNAP never makes money. At least not for several more years. And even if it does, it will not justify today's valuation.Bottom lineSNAP is a stock that exploded into a bubble on the first day of trading as evidenced by the 58X Price/Sales ratio IPO price. From my experience, I have yet to see anyone buying at such valuations that ever made money, outside of day-trading or flipping an IPO.It's also a stock that has very weak corporate ""checks and balances,"" because the founding shareholders hold almost all of the voting rights. That alone is a reason for SNAP's stock to trade at a huge discount, not a premium.Finally, growth is stalling, and in no way does SNAP deserve to trade at current valuations. I cannot predict the future of SNAP, and have no idea if it will conquer the social world. What I do know is that the valuation is ludicrous and I, for one, have no intention of buying SNAP any time soon."
4054289,21798,2017-03-10T17:22:07-05:00,"In the case of Snap, IPO means ""is probably overpriced."".Options for Snap are now available.I provide my thoughts on the stock and how to play it.","The most interesting story that I heard from the Snap (NYSE:SNAP) IPO was how St. Francis, a California-based Catholic High School, invested $15,000 of seed money into Snap back in 2012. That investment turned into $24 million when they sold just two-thirds of their shares when the company went public. That's quite a return.Although I'm not expecting to repeat a spectacular return like that, I do see some trading opportunities for Snap. The company looks overvalued at the moment as investors piled in at the IPO and bid up the price to a premium valuation. In the case of Snap, IPO means ""is probably overpriced."" Snap is not profitable and may not be for a while. Therefore, I think the trading opportunity right now is on the downside.Lots of Exuberance in the ValuationThe stock has been volatile since its debut, but as of March 10, 2017, Snap was priced at 63X trailing twelve month sales of $404.48 million. This is significantly higher than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is trading with a price to sales ratio of 14.5. To put this into more perspective, if Snap's trailing price to sales ratio was 14.5, the stock would only be about $8.86 [(14.5 X sales of $404.48 million)/shares outstanding of Class A stock of 661.84 million] as compared to the current price of about $22.On the surface, the company looks better as we look ahead. Snap is trading at 25.5X expected revenue for 2017 of about $1 billion (consensus). However, this is still 141% higher than Facebook's Price/Sales of 10.6 based on FB's 2017 expected revenue of $37.85 billion (consensus).Facebook is highly profitable and valued much lower than Snap. Snap is not yet profitable and there is no indication of when the company will become profitable. With Snap trading at such a high premium and without profits for the foreseeable future, I think the likely direction for the stock will be down.If we look at Facebook and Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) IPOs, you'll notice that the stocks fell below their IPO prices within a few months. Granted, there is no guarantee that Snap will do the same thing. However, I do think it is likely Snap's stock will drop below the IPO price of $17 within three to six months because of the high valuation, no clear path to profits and from competitive threats. Snap's valuation would be more in-line with Facebook if it dropped below the IPO price.Image source: pinterest.comUnclear Path to ProfitsSnap stated in its prospectus that they don't know when or if the company will be profitable. Here is the company's quote:""We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability.""Snap made $404 million in revenue over the past 12 months. However, the company's cost of revenue was about 12% higher at $452 million. Snap spends a lot on cloud computing power to handle its millions of users, which leads the high cost of revenue to exceed the amount of actual revenue.Snap's operating expenses of $473 million are also higher than the company's revenue. The company's SG&A expenses of $290 million are 72% of total revenue. So, Snap will have to significantly reduce the cost of revenue and operating expenses to become profitable. It will be a challenge for Snap to grow the business while reducing costs to the point of becoming profitable.Further losses over time may create the need for Snap to do a secondary offering to raise money to continue operations. The company also may need to borrow money which will add to debt. Secondary stock offerings typically dilute shareholders, putting negative pressure on the stock price. If investors see debt growing at a fast pace and no profit on the horizon, they are likely to sell their shares.Similar Features from FacebookIn addition to the high valuation and unprofitable business, Snap also will have to face increased competitive threats from Facebook. Facebook launched features similar to Snapchat on the Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger Apps. The newest feature from Facebook is known as Messenger Day, which allows users to post and share photos and videos with illustrated filters. This feature within the Messenger App allows the shared photos/videos to disappear within 24 hours, which is the way Snapchat works.Those bullish on Snap rationalize that the younger generations such as the Millennials and Generation Z gravitate more towards Snapchat to have an outlet of communication that their parents don't use. This is probably true for a certain period of time (from age 13 to 18 for example). The teens may not think it is cool to be on the same multi-media platforms as their parents and older relatives.However, what happens when these teens graduate high school and go off to college? They are likely to come around and join Facebook and Messenger to communicate with their parents and other relatives. As they mature, they'll realize that it is cool to be on the same platform as the older generations.As the largest social network and with a highly profitable business, Facebook has greater financial and human resources than Snap to implement new features on its apps. Facebook's features could become more attractive than Snap's over time.With over 1 billion daily active users and nearly 2 billion monthly active users, Facebook has proven to attract the majority of social media users. Facebook is still growing these users at a strong double-digit pace. Therefore, I think the growth is better for Facebook than for Snap over the long term. Facebook's profitability will allow it to attract investors, while Snap's continued losses are likely to turn investors off.Lock-up Period SellingSnap's actual lock-up period is 150 days after the IPO. This means that large investors who owned Snap before the IPO can sell their shares around July 31, 2017. Investors who want to lock in profits who owned shares before the IPO are likely to create downward pressure in the stock at that time. Facebook's stock dropped 50% from its listing price after its lock-up period expired. So, I would expect something similar to happen to Snap after its lock-up period, since Snap is not expected to be profitable for the foreseeable future and because the stock is trading at a high premium.There is a perception that Snap's lock up period is 12 months after the IPO. However, the 12 month lock-up only applies to 50 million shares or less than 8% of Class A common stock. Protecting 8% of shares probably won't make a large difference in selling pressure at the 150-day lock-up expiration.Conclusion and How to Trade ItSnap is likely to trade below its IPO price of $17 over the next few months (most likely after the lock-up expiration around July 31, 2017). The stock is likely to be sold off because of the overvaluation, the lack of profits and no profits on the horizon and because of the competition from Facebook. I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock fall to around $10, perhaps into the single digits.For those who own Snap and insist on holding the shares, you can consider selling some covered call options against your long position. Options have become available as of March 10, 2017. Consider selling an out of the money call option with an October 2017 expiration date. These have a decent amount of premium. You'll benefit by collecting the premium that you sell and you'll capture the downward movement in the stock from the lock-up expiration.For those who don't own the stock and are bearish on it, you can consider buying an October put option. Consider the $23 strike price. You'll be able to capture any downward movement in the stock from now until expiration on October 20, 2017. If the stock drops 32% to about $15, the put option will gain about 77% based on the put's delta of 0.43.For those who are bullish on Facebook and bearish on Snap, consider doing a pair trade. Buy Facebook and short Snap."
4053688,102771,2017-03-09T10:21:48-05:00,"Snap has optimistic sales multiples. But these multiples are justified by the firm's astronomical growth profile.Snap's growth potential is illustrated via U.S ARPU growth with all other factors, including DAU/MAU being held constant.Snap's U.S ARPU growth allows it to be compared to Facebook because both firms are heavily involved in the photo-sharing niche of social media.The concept of efficient markets is explored with attention to the perspective of retail investors.","Negative sentiment is mounting against Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP). And as of the market close March 7, 2017, the stock traded below its IPO price. Critics cite concerns about monetization and valuation. But the numbers tell a different story. Snap's top-line growth is too rapid to fit into a normal sales multiple.If current growth trends continue, Snap is undervalued with other variables held constant. And the stock can double by as soon as 2020.If we assume Snap can continue to grow ARPU at its average U.S growth rate of 2.3x, the company may post revenue of up to $26 billion by 2022. This forecast is conservative because it assumes zero DAU/MAU growth. And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has achieved a similar feat through photo-sharing platforms like Instagram and communication platforms like WhatsApp with similar monetization models to Snapchat.Snap may even exceed Facebook's ARPU growth because it targets the premium teen demographic.Quantifying Snap's Growth Potential (Source)Snap's market cap is $27B on shares outstanding of around 1.57B. The company generates TTM revenues of $404,482,000 - representing growth of around 590% from the year prior. Global average ARPU increased from $0.31 to $1.05. United States ARPU increased to $2.15 from $0.65 in the year prior, representing YoY growth of 231%.Snap's sales multiple of 66.75x 2016 revenue looks overvalued. But this multiple will quickly fall if the business continues on the same (or a comparable) growth pattern, ceteris paribus. Snap's current multiples are an accurate reflection of its growth potential and the value of its future cash flows. To illustrate this concept, let's assume Snap's top-line growth rate continues at 2.3x, its U.S ARPU growth rate, for the next ten years. (source)Why Snap Can DoubleIn this analysis, ARPU growth will be used as a proxy for Snap's revenue growth, and all other variables will be held constant. We believe holding sales volume constant makes up for the, arguably, optimistic assumptions about ARPU growth in the later years.We assume Snap, like Facebook, will eventually reach North American ARPU of up to $20+ per user. And we assume Facebook's current P/S multiple of around 14x revenue represents the threshold of undervaluation for Snap Inc.If Snap Inc. were afforded a 14.5x multiple at $26.03 billion in revenue, the company's market cap would be $364.42B. Dividing by 1.5B shares outstanding gives a share price of $242.9. And this represents multibagger upside over the next six years, ceteris paribus and if all these assumptions hold true.Note on Snap's Demographic ARPU AdvantageThe thesis expressed in this article is predicated on two factors: Snap's ARPU and its ability to generate top-line growth from its user base. Snapchat, as the social media platform most concentrated in the teen demographic, may have a competitive advantage in ARPU monetization because its demographic is simply more valuable to advertisers. Teens have been called the ""most elusive and valuable"" demographic in tech, and Snapchat is currently the best way for advertisers to target them. Teens are valuable because establishing early brand loyalty can create a lifetime customer. In addition, young people often use the entire disposable income for consumption.Snap's unique reach on the teen demographic suggests ARPU can reach or exceed Facebook's in the coming years.Note, Snap will be able to monetize the teen demographic by not only direct advertising but data collection. Many investors don't realize how important this is. Demographic data is one of the key ingredients in marketing products and developing them. This data is broken into three categories as per the Guardian U.K.Note on Facebook and the Efficient Markets TheoryContrary to most retail investors' opinions, stocks are not supposed to linearly move upwards - even if their revenue and profits grow linearly or even exponentially. In the few cases where IPO to current price linear growth occurs, Facebook, Visa (NYSE:V), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for example, it is the result of market inefficiency.The market is constantly being surprised by the growth and resilience of these businesses. Notice how most of them posted severe post-IPO dips?Facebook IPO to 2017:FB Market Cap data by YChartsGoogle IPO to 2017:GOOGL data by YChartsVisa IPO to 2017:V data by YChartsWhen Facebook IPOed, the market did not expect it to become as successful as it has become. In fact, many of the concerns brought against Snap mirror the criticisms against Facebook half a decade earlier. The current value of a stock is, for most people, the current value of future cash flows adjusted for risk and other factors. The average return of the S&P 500 is 12%, and if investors knew for certain that Facebook would quadruple their money in a few years, the stock would have IPOed much, much higher.The market will get a clearer picture of Snap's future by the next earnings date. Investors who plan to commit a significant amount of capital may want to wait to see what Q1 growth looks like. The No. 1 risk factor for Snap is disappointing ARPU growth. Second is disappointing DAU/MAU growth or an over-reliance on acquisitions to generate revenue growth.ConclusionSnap's top-line multiples are justified by its growth potential and may even be an undervaluation if growth continues at the rate illustrated in this forecast. We have illustrated this point via a projection of Snap's revenue to 2022, based on the current U.S ARPU growth rate of 2.3x holding all other factors constant. This forecast assumes no MAU/DAU growth and is conservative compared to Goldman's prediction of $2 billion by 2018.Snap Inc. is a compelling investment and the author plans to initiate a long position during the first half of 2017.

4053122,101557,2017-03-08T09:22:06-05:00,"Snap is trading extremely richly compared to comps.
        Daily Active User projections are strong, but monetization remains to be achieved.
        Upside is not worth the uncertainty presently.","As I am sure almost everyone is aware, Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) , the company behind the popular app SnapChat, IPOed last week. With the stock price set to open at $17 a share, the stock price quickly shot up 44% to close at $24.48 and has begun to sharply trade down almost 26% from its peak of over $28. There is definitely some hype surrounding the stock as well as the company. An asset manager I know once told me something that I think applies perfectly here. He said: ""Just because it is a good company, doesn't mean it is a good stock"". So let us take a look to see if indeed, Snap Inc even is a good company and see if it is also a good stock.So what is Snap Inc? Snap Inc. is first and foremost self-described as a ""camera company"" and are the creators of the popular mobile app, SnapChat. I am going to skip going over how SnapChat as an app works because I think most of you already are familiar with it. If you are not, I recommend downloading the app and trying it out for yourself.In this article, we will try and look at Snap Inc with fresh eyes. Many people are wondering if the stock price will follow Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). For those who don't remember those IPOs, TWTR stock popped off the open and then proceeded to drift downwards while Facebook's stock dropped after the open and then began its significant climb upwards. I think there are definitely a number of similarities but a distinct number of differences. Now as these graph's timeframe are from IPO date until present, it is hard to see the first week of movement but if you just pull it up on Google, you will see exactly what I am talking about.(Source: Bloomberg)For our analysis of Snap Inc, the data and financial numbers that I will pull will be from the amended S-1 statement. Now if you read my articles, you probably know that I typically save the comp analysis until the end of the article but I think in this case it might be helpful to include it here as it appears to be what everyone is raving about. Perhaps one the reasons why this company appears to be so richly valued is that it does not have a robust set of comps.Looking at the comps, we can see that on a TEV/Rev basis, SNAP is quite richly valued. If we use the average of comps to find the implied price per share we find that SNAP is trading currently at a 51.21% premium. This is obviously a very rudimentary calculation but it might help to paint a picture of what is going on here. Looking at revenue growth, SNAP knocks it out of the park. The question will be if they can continue to grow inline with this trajectory."" Our products often require intensive processing and generate high bandwidth consumption by our users. As a result, our users tend to come from developed countries with high-end mobile devices and high-speed cellular internet."" -S-1 Statement, Snap, IncThere is one key difference between SNAP and FB or TWTR, SNAP's flagship product, Snapchat, is solely available for mobile devices while Facebook and Twitter both have web platforms; more specifically, Snapchat only operates on smartphones (even restricted away from some tablet devices) and requires high bandwidth consumption. These two limitations further restrict SNAP's growth down from FB and TWTR. As such, its total addressable market is smaller for SNAP than for Facebook or Twitter.(Data Source: Facebook, Twitter, Snap SEC filings)Now let's look at SNAP through some metrics and use an average of Facebook and Twitter to project out growth. Currently for SNAP, we have data on 12 quarters of daily active user data. From this, we can then use the average growth rates of Facebook and Twitter to project out quarterly growth out to Q20. Now it is very important to note that the time frames for these datasets do not match up; namely Q1 for snapchat does not occur in the same year as Q1 for Facebook or Twitter. All this data is taken, however, when all three companies were in similar points on their growth curve. As you can see, on a Daily Active User basis, SNAP more closely resembles Twitter than Facebook. Now this is again important to mention that Snapchat has a smaller TAM and therefore I think this factor will adjust against the quick growth of Facebook. I have included the data for the chart in the table below because this will be helpful later on.On a practical note, we can see that the average between the growth rates of FB and TWTR can predict the growth rate of snapchat fairly accurately. The outliers being Q2, Q3 and Q10. Now looking at the growth rates we can see that SNAP's growth from Q10 to Q12 has ramped down. But let's use the growth rate YoY. With some quick math we can see that for Snap to maintain this level of growth, we would need to see Average Daily Usage growth be between 30-50% as we saw in 2016. Using this range we can find that Average Daily Usage would need to grow to between 186 and 215 million. Now you couple this with the significant cash burn and you should start to raising a few eyebrows.Now before we calculate their revenue growth, let us look at the second critical metric for Snap: Average Revenue per User. Almost entirely, Snap's revenue comes from the monetization of Snapchat and they monetize their app in several ways. From the chart from their website, we can see the three primary forms of their advertisements. Though the breakdown of the costs of these ads is still not disclosed, from some proprietary research, we can see that the most common form of ads appears to be Snap Ads.Looking at the table below from Snap's S-1 statement, we can see that the aggregate average revenue per user has started increasing. The breakdown of this shows that this growth comes entirely from North America. The question then becomes why this is the case. Either they are not or cannot monetize Europe and the rest of the world like they have in North America or they have not tried yet.""We monetize our daily user engagement primarily through advertising. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in large part on our ability to increase ARPU in top advertising markets. There are a number of factors that we believe will help us grow ARPU, including the demographics of our audience, the effectiveness of our advertising products, and our delivery and measurement capabilities."" - S-1 Statement, Snap Inc.(Source: Proprietary research)This means that Snap is primarily banking on the growth of ARPU in North America and perhaps Europe in the near-term. We can see the difference in this using some proprietary data that I collected. I looked at the rate at which users see any of the three different types of ads. What you find is that Europe is almost entirely un-monetized. Now it is important to note that the nature of how the ads are delivered makes it difficult to compare across different ad types. One reason for this is that there does not appear to be a limit on how many Snap Ads can be displayed (but the rate at which they appear is variable) while Sponsored Lenses and Sponsored Geofilters appear to be more binary (as in, either you see one that you use once or you don't). An interesting aspect of the use of Sponsored Geofilters and Lenses is that the ad is displayed to a multitude of people off the user sending one snapchat. In other words, we find that a user who uses a Sponsored Geofilter or Sponsored Lense will send the content to a multitude of different people or even put the snap on their Stories, thus driving more Snap Ads as networks of friends view these ads. So we see strong synergies between the three ad types with the Geofilters and Lenses perhaps further driving the Snap ads.So this shows some potential, as Snap has obviously not come near to monetizing Europe, there could definitely be some long-term upside as Daily Active Users and Average Revenue per User increase for Europe and reach North America levels. The reason for this not being the prevailing sentiment is that fact that there is quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the company's ability to perform and deliver growth at guidance.Now using our table of Daily Active User Growth and multiplying that with Average Revenue per User, we can derive some very early projections of what the next three years of revenue could look like. Obviously this model is incredibly sensitive to the release of updated ARPU and DAU with coming quarters. Currently, the model only uses 2 years of historical data to project out two quarters so the margin of error is potentially quite high. But this should give an idea of what could happen to both these metrics as it continues to grow. I set the DAU for North America to start slowing down as it approaches 100 million because I am not sure how reasonable it is for Snapchat to be used on a daily basis by ⅓ of Americans in just 2 years.In this model, I basically assumed that Snap could continue an adjusted version of the growth trend (logarithmic not linear) for the next two years. Typically adjusted purely histrionic modeling with limited data do not work very accurately so please do not use this to make a price target. The very difficult question to answer is what will ARPU stabilize at; and currently, the answer I have for you is that I have no idea. Just looking at the breakdown of ARPU for Facebook which I pulled from the company's Investor Presentation, you can see that if Snap follows Facebook, Total ARPU would more than triple from the above model's 4Q18 ARPU.So now I will circle back to what I originally promised to answer in the beginning of the article: is Snap a good company and is it a good stock? The answer, for now at least, is that it is not an attractive stock and whether it is a good company remains to be seen. Though Snap has the potential to unlock massive growth, it also faces significant headwinds in the form of low barriers to entry that the company recognizes as well as harsh competition. Though many investors look strictly at returns, the more correct metric to look at is risk-adjusted returns. In the case of Snap, I believe the risk/reward distribution to be asymmetrically skewed toward more risk and therefore does not present an attractive investment opportunity at present. The most prudent idea would definitely be to monitor the stock and see if it can continue its full speed ahead growth or if it begins to take on serious water."
4053522,92586,2017-03-08T22:44:39-05:00,"Assessing whether investing in Snap Inc. is a good idea requires looking farther into the future.Under a set of assumptions, I believe Snap could create the $1 or so in EPS that it needs to justify the stock's current price by 2020.I continue to stay on the sidelines, as I believe there is just too much risk involved in buying SNAP today.","Earlier this week, I published an article on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) presenting a comparison between its recent IPO and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB), in 2012.Today, I want to dig one level deeper into the analysis. Considering Snap has never even been ""gross-profitable,"" assessing whether investing in the company is a good idea requires looking farther into the future.Credit: The New York TimesIn this article, I will present certain assumptions on Snap's future performance that I believe could materialize. I will then do my best to assess what these assumptions might mean in terms of future top-line growth and profitability, and how long it might take for the stock's current price of about $23 to be justifiable.User baseSnap currently has 158 million active daily users of its Snapchat platform. This number grew sequentially at a concerning rate of only 3% last quarter vs. 7% in 3Q16 and 17% in 2Q16, in a plateauing trend.Source: Company's S-1Snap's management has stood behind the claim that ""bigger isn't better"" regarding the idea that Snap's ""network may stay relatively small and intimate."" To me, this could very quickly escalate into terrible news for the so-called camera company, since scale will be crucial for it to eventually turn sustainably profitable.If Snap continues to grow its user base in the lower single-digit range sequentially, I fear that the company might struggle to become viable. I believe average growth of at least 5% in the next few years, just below what we have seen in 3Q16, would be necessary.MonetizationCurrently, Snap has two primary forms of monetizing its platform's usage: sponsored creative tools (e.g. an image filter created by a sponsor and made available to Snapchat users) and Snap ads. Future monetization strategies could be developed, including the sale of non-ad products like the Spectacle. But for now, I will work with the options that are currently available.The company's global ARPU (average revenue per user) was $1.05 in the most recent quarter. This number pales in comparison to Facebook's $4.83 in 4Q16. But Snap's ARPU also grew at a three-fold pace YOY, and should expand very fast from current levels.Source: Company's S-1The company certainly has advertising revenue potential on its side, as mobile ad is expected to grow nearly three fold to $196 billion in 2020 from $66 billion in 2016, according to the company's S-1 filing. But I would be very cautious making aggressive revenue projections based on this trend alone, as most media platforms, including legacy ones born prior to the mobile usage ramp up, will be competing for those same ad dollars. The shift to mobile, therefore, is a zero-sum game to a certain extent, and will invite fierce competition.Having said that, I can imagine Snap having an upper hand in attracting mobile ad dollars better than most. But I would probably keep the bar below what Facebook is currently able to produce. I fear that limited ad impression opportunities would make monetization a tougher challenge for Snap than it is now for Facebook.ARPU of around $3, in my view, seems like a reasonable, steady-state estimate for what Snap might be able to achieve in the future.MarginsSnap's total expenses have increased 110% in the past year, with a notable jump in cost of revenue. The growth rate in expenses, however, has been nowhere near the tripling of the company's revenues over the same period.I would expect increase in hosting costs to decelerate as a percentage of revenues, as the platform becomes larger over time. Snap's use of Google Cloud to support its platform could result in robust gross margin in the far future, assuming the company reaches decent scale. I also expect operating expenses to remain high in the short term (110% of revenues in 4Q16). But eventually faster-rising revenues should start to drive significant improvement to the bottom line.I find it too aggressive to expect Snap to generate op margins that are comparable to Facebook's 45%, but I would dare entertain the possibility of 30% margins in the future - Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) was 14% on a non-GAAP basis last year. I understand there is a good bit of risk baked into this estimate, but I also believe such target could be achieved.Plugging in the numbersImagine Snap Inc. several years down the road, in a more mature state, just about where Facebook is today. For as long as the company's prospects remain attractive and the stock stay at least lukewarm, a valuation of 20x-25x earnings sounds reasonable enough: not too aggressive to suggest steep growth in the future, and not too conservative to hint at deterioration in the business.For SNAP to be worth $23/share, the company therefore needs to conservatively produce about $1 in EPS in the future (realistically more, considering the risks and the time value of money).Assuming consistent average user base growth of 5% sequentially, quarterly ARPU of $3, and op margins of 30%, I calculate that it would take until the end of 2020 for Snap to produce earnings that would justify the stock's current valuation. At that point, I project that the daily user base would have more than doubled from the current 158 million to 345 million, while annual revenues would have reached nearly $4 billion vs. $404 million in 2016. Under this scenario, total expenses (cost of sales and opex) would be about 175% higher than they were in 2016.ConclusionsI understand that my projections are exposed to substantial risk, while the more optimistic reader might even find them to be too conservative. But to assess whether Snap might be a good long-term investment today, I believe going through the exercise of projecting the company's future results is important, and helps as a benchmark against which actual performance can be measured.For now, I continue to stay on the sidelines, as I believe there is just too much risk and uncertainties involved in buying SNAP today.Follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

4052609,102101,2017-03-07T08:30:18-05:00,Too much pessimism for Snap post-IPO.Snap is set to revolutionize the ad industry with the viral nature of the platform.Premium pricing can sustain the cap in DAU.The investment bankers apparently aren't messing up the math.,"Source: eMarketerIn a world where Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are battling ad blockers, Snapchat users can’t seem to get enough of Snap (SNAP) ads. From video ads to geo filters and sponsored lenses, users can’t seem to differentiate between original content and paid advertisement.Snapchat is the first platform where users play with ads like they some kittens. With the narrative that Snap will have a hard time stealing market share from Facebook and Google, Snap is differentiating itself by becoming the Apple of advertisement.Advertisement has mostly been measured driven by reach & engagement. In the modern era, more data means advertisers can track conversions to gain useful insights to determine the return on ad spend by leveraging analytics platforms built in-house or by a third party to inform their targeting and bidding.Measurement is key in 21st century advertising, and platforms that have been able to differentiate themselves with automated and ML (machine learning) based analytics platforms have been able to gain market share faster than their competitors.For Facebook and Google, the narrative has revolved around reach. The overwhelming number of users on each platform means no internet user is left out when advertisers want to introduce a new product or service to the world.However, this subtle but powerful advantage has been heavily abused leading a lot of internet users to install ad blockers to prevent intrusion of unsolicited ads.For example, the last Shell #makethefuture ad on YouTube demonstrated the spending ability of global brands and their wiliness to keep the ad in your face when they want to pass a message across, relevant or irrelevant. Anecdotally, I observed the reach and ubiquity of the ad during the campaign duration leaving me questioning the frequency cap of the ad which I believe was set at infinity.While some can argue for the creativity of the ad which deftly leveraged top singers from across the globe to pass the message about renewables. The truth is that it was deployed to keep getting in your way till you take your time to ask what message was being passed across by this oil company.At the other end of the spectrum are Snap ads which are revolutionizing the way users perceive ads. Not only have they recorded the highest engagement rate of any ad type ever deployed, they have also succeeded in creating quick virality due to their ability to connect well with the target audience. This has enabled Snap to charge a hefty premium for most of its ad inventory with some of its ad going for over $500,000 per day.Below is a breakdown of Snap’s premium ad pricingThese go for $20-$40. Their huge engagement rate of up to 5X the click through rate on other platforms is astonishing.To put that in context, YouTube in-stream ads have a minimum duration of 15 seconds for the pre-roll format. That means while users are waiting to skip YouTube videos, Snap users are still having fun with Sponsored lenses.RiskSnap recently introduced goal based bidding. This indicates the handicap of its ad engine, until now, to leverage machine learning to create a more targeted advertisement to achieve key marketing goals for more complicated campaigns such as e-commerce and app installs.Also, there is a huge cap to Snap’s reach due to the mobile-centric nature of the app as well as the heavy bandwidth consumption of the platform.Advertisers are still asking more than Snap can currently deliver. Adding more features will delay profitability. This will increase risk premium leading to a cap in upward valuation.There is also a contrasting research that users are probably skipping ads more than we think.Finally, there is the cap to MAU driven by the huge population of users who are subscribed to bandwidth constrained networks.If Snapchat can continue to demonstrate to advertisers the huge return on ad spend on its network, it could carve out a niche for itself in the digital ad industry by disrupting the way advertisers conceive media buying.The analogy with Apple comes when you realize that there is a cap to those who have the purchasing power for a new iPhone. Most iPhone users are heavily concentrated in developed economies. It is safe to assume that iPhone users comprise the bulk of Snapchat usersSource: Business InsiderConclusionWith the Snap ad API getting better, improved measurement means Snap can continue to charge a hefty premium for its ad inventory. The fear of a limited upside on ad load can be quelled if this premium pricing is maintained.This is not to justify Snap’s valuation. However, the limited inventory compared to competitors is justified given the engaging and viral nature of Snap ads. This might be all advertisers require to price Snap ads like the iPhone which has witnessed a minimal change in ASP (average selling price).If you like my article and would like to stay up-to-date on the next one, you can click the ""Follow"" button next to my profile."
4052337,33451,2017-03-06T12:22:32-05:00,"SNAP is not necessarily a social media company. It's a phone company that has chosen to provide free calls forever.Not only does Snapchat have competition, there is some difficulty monetizing advertiser dollars.Almost half of the 18-34 year old market uses Snapchat for conversations.Near term, I'm not betting against Goldman Sachs.","To fully understand the Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) IPO, you have to understand what Snapchat is and how it works. In the March 13, 2017 issue of Time Magazine, Joel Stein wrote an article titled ""Snapchat Faces the Public."" In the article, Stein perfectly describes the situation by saying, ""Snapchat indeed has a monetization problem: How do you sell ads if you're essentially a phone company that has chosen to provide free calls forever?"" Opposed to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snapchat offers users an opportunity to take a picture or video, add some text or filters, and send it to another person, or a group of people. The ""Snap"" can be seen for no more than 10 seconds, and then it's gone. This could possibly be the reason Evan Spiegel is not branding Snapchat as a social media company. You can't share a snap, retweet it, or like it. As the father of teenagers, I get how it works, but it's not my thing. Snapchat users talk about having a streak with a friend, which means they have communicated with each other daily for a period of time. My son has a streak that's more than 500 days. So, you could essentially do the same thing with text messages, but the messages wouldn't disappear. Since social media posts tend to follow you around, even after they've been deleted, Snapchat offers a way to avoid that particular situation.As I mentioned in my previous article, I don't agree with SNAP's valuation. I'm not an analyst, but I've been around the market a while. I can't see where a company that lost $515 million last year on $405 million in revenues is worth $24 billion. I also don't like the fact that there is no clear model for monetization. Snapchat offers what it calls ""3V ads,"" letting brands take over consumers' smartphone screens with video promos. If you use Snapchat, you'll notice a Discover section with a bunch of videos from Fortune 500 companies. I'm not sure what kind of return advertisers are getting on their advertising dollars, but you aren't forced to see the ads to use the app, like you are on Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR). The main reason I'm not a SNAP shareholder is the sale of non-voting shares of stock to the public. U.S. financial markets are the best in the world and offer some of the strictest corporate governance. One share - one vote is the best way for shareholders to level the playing field and have a say in how their company is ran. According to SNAP's prospectus, shares owned by co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy have voting rights nine months after they die. It's not like I'm ever going to own enough stock in a $36 billion market cap company to have an impact on the management, but non-voting shares go against the reasons I invest in the market in the first place.According to a June 22, 2016 article in the Wall Street Journal, a Nielsen study commissioned by SNAP showed Snapchat reaches 41% of all 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. daily. The number could be higher over the last nine months, but I haven't been able to find any more current numbers. The idea behind Snapchat is that conversations with our friends are private and probably much less meaningful than those we have with our boss, or anyone else who might judge our level of responsibility. I'm 52 years old and I still prefer to have most of my meaningless conversations with friends in person, but I'm not in Snapchat's demographic. Even though close to half of the 18-34 age group Snaps every day, only 25% of all internet users use Snapchat. Comparatively, 70% of all internet users use Facebook. If you recall, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, which was an unprecedented sum at the time. The acquisition was valued on users and not the traditional revenues and earnings model. When I was in the car with my teenagers one day, I heard them talking about people's Finsta accounts. Always on the lookout for a good stock tip, I inquired about what social media company Finsta is. They both had a good laugh and I learned a Finsta account is a Fake Instagram account, which most young folks have. Their friends and acquaintances know about it, but the Dean of Admissions to the college they plan to apply to does not. Facebook has had a couple of forays into Snapchat's space, but nothing ever really had any great success, until last summer. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, announced a Stories section. According to a June 30, 2017 article in TechCrunch, about one-third of Instagram's 400 million users are posting on Stories every day, so Snapchat is not the only game in town. If you're like me, you don't believe anything anyone says in the stock market and do your own research. I found this interesting article on diskover.com discussing declining trends in Snapchat usage from a more grass roots level. The article basically says Instagram Stories is providing real competition for Snapchat. The big reason being America's love affair with celebrities. A decline in users, coupled with no real way to monetize advertiser dollars, could be a recipe for disaster, which means I'm all over the short side of SNAP. Now that SNAP is public, we'll be able to get a better idea of what they're doing by reviewing their quarterly and annual filings.People ask if I'm going to short SNAP and if I think it will go higher. I'm definitely not shorting the stock, even though I believe the fundamentals dictate doing so. Stephen Isaacs, chairman of the investment committee at Alvine Capital, said in a March 2, 2017 interview with CNBC ""Morgan Stanley and Goldman should hang their heads in shame here. I mean not about the valuation but non-voting shares?"" I couldn't agree more, but there is no way I'm placing a bet on the short side against Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Goldman was named syndicate trading manager, also known as the stabilization agent, for the early trades on SNAP. So, Goldman set the price and managed the greenshoe, or the additional shares allotted to underwriters. According to Bloomberg data, Credit Suisse Group AG was the lead underwriter on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) in 2014, when Alibaba raised $25 billion on their IPO. Goldman Sachs was awarded the same role on the Alibaba deal, as well as Twitter in 2013. I learned long ago not to get in the way of a moving train. Does that mean I won't short it? Absolutely not! However, if I do short SNAP, I'll wait for some of the hysteria around the IPO to die down before doing so. That's not to say the stock couldn't take off like a rocket from here and I won't be on board the train. It's happened before and it will happen again. If you're trading SNAP and making money, more power to you. I'm still sidelined until I see which direction the trend is heading."
4052191,102771,2017-03-06T00:06:54-05:00,"Snap Inc. has completed its IPO and earned a massive market cap that many market participants feel is unjustified. However, do not short this stock.Snap has front-loaded its top-line growth and its cash position allows it to acquire other firms at a rapid pace.Mobile ad growth and an acquisitive strategy mean Snap Inc. is very likely to hit or exceed revenue expectations for the next few years.","Snap Inc.'s (NYSE:SNAP) IPO is likely to draw short interest due to the lack of voting rights for Class A shareholders and a relatively large market cap of around $30 billion. The market cap reflects a P/S ratio of 75. Snap has a significant amount of priced-in growth, but shorting is a bad idea because the company's growth prospects seem to justify its valuation.Snap can be compared with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) because both products deal with a casual and ephemeral segment of the social media market that may be harder to monetize compared to less casual networks. Users enjoy a casual social media experience without the investment and personal exposure of networks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).However, unlike Twitter, Snap has deferred growth by intentionally delaying monetization. Its cash position (considering IPO funds) keeps it cheap on the enterprise value metric and acquisitions are a viable growth engine. Advertising market growth further bolsters the bullish case for Snap Inc. and make shorting the stock a bad idea.Snap Inc. vs. Twitter: Top-line GrowthSnap Inc. has a materially different growth profile than Twitter in the years surrounding the IPO. While Twitter's revenue growth has been healthy, it is nowhere near Snap's numbers. This is because, thankfully for stockholders, Snap has delayed monetization until only a few years before going public.Much of the ultra-fast top line growth is really catch-up growth because advertisers were only allowed on the platform when it already had a huge amount of users. Snap Inc. is expected to hit $2 billion in revenue by 2018, according to Goldman Sachs, a key underwriter of the IPO. While Goldman shouldn't be taken at face value, Snap has a good chance of beating expectations because Goldman's projection is based on reasonable assumptions.Goldman's $2 billion projection assumes DAU will increase to 221 million in 2018, up from 158 million at the end of last year. This growth assumption is actually conservative compared to Snap's historical growth trends.From Q116-Q216, Snap's DAU grew from 107 to 158 which is 47%. Goldman is only estimating a 40% increase from 2017-18. Most of top line growth will probably come from expanded monetization of current DAU - in keeping with the deferred growth strategy mentioned earlier.Snap Inc. is not necessarily the most efficient advertising platform available because of its unique and ephemeral picture-based format. But the platform is one of the most concentrated on the lucrative teen demographic and this could make up for its formatting challenges. Snap claims to have the best monetization potential in its target market and the evidence backs up this claim. For example, over 75% of teens in the United Kingdom use Snapchat. And the platform's demographic saturation is over double Facebook's in this market.(Source)Let's look at the numbers (from company filings):Snap Inc. has not made it clear exactly how much of global advertising growth will be in its specific demographic, but teens are known to be a premium demographic due to consumption patterns and the possibility of catching customers young for lifelong brand loyalty.Facebook is actually declining among teens and this presents an opportunity for Snapchat to take marketshare from the larger firm.Some investors have concerns about Snap's ability to monetize its platform, but there are many ways Snap can pull this off while charging a premium for its lucrative demographic. For example, here are some ways Snap can drive monetization:1.) Selling user engagement: Ex. ""Snap this picture of taco bell and tag our new Cheesy-Gordida taco to 20 friends and get one free.""2.) Selling ad space: Make users watch quick ad before they can view their snap.3.) Selling user information: Sell location data, time, snaps per day, products tagged, etc. User information is an often overlooked source of social media value.Is Acquisition Still a Possibility?At $30 billion market cap, Snap Inc. is far away from the $3 billion Facebook offered in 2015. Facebook only has $8.9 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, so any buyout would need to be partially financed with debt and equity.At this point, a buyout is unlikely, but still possible because Snap's huge IPO-supplemented cash pile makes it cheaper on the enterprise value metric.However, what is more likely is that Snap will use its cash to acquire other companies. Snap went on an acquisition binge in the months before the IPO and this trend is likely to continue. It is not a good idea to short acquisitive super-growth firms because if this strategy is done right, revenue growth can be engineered to beat expectations. We know Snap is acquisitive because of its history.From TechCrunch.com1. Snap acquired Looksery in August. The Looksery acquisition was $79.4 million, with $71.2 million in retention bonuses.2. Snap also acquired Bitstrips, the creators of Bitmoji personal avatars, in March last year. Snap paid $64.2 million for the company.3. Snap acquired a ""mobile search company"" in August for $114.5 million - this is Vurb, a mobile search engine that pulls info from partnered apps.4. Snap also says it acquired a ""research and development-driven computer vision software company"" in 2016 for around $47 million - this may be Seene, a start-up that let mobile users create 3D selfies.ConclusionSnap Inc. has IPOed with a huge valuation, and many will be tempted to short the stock - this is a bad idea. The company should not be compared to IPO failures like Twitter because even though both companies share an ephemeral style, Snap is different because of its front-loaded growth profile and niche position in a rapidly premium market.Snap's huge amount of cash and its acquisitive strategy further bolster the likelihood of strong top-line growth in the future. The stock seems likely to hit Goldman's $2 billion revenue projection by 2018. And while the stock is pricey, it doesn't look overvalued when growth potential is considered."
4052133,102400,2017-03-06T08:00:06-05:00,"Snap looks like it could follow the disappointing fate of many tech IPOs before it.The margins for Snap look awful when you compare it to what Facebook and Twitter's looked like back during their IPOs, yet the company is valued at higher multiples.User acquisition costs are exceeding revenue per user even if you include sales and marketing expense.Despite all of this, I caution against going short.","You're an astute investor. You've been following the markets for a while and you're not new to this charade with Snap (SNAP). You remember GoPro (GPRO), the revolutionary (camera) media company:You remember the gaming company, Zynga (ZNGA), which was bound to take over the industry:You're such a veteran you even remember Groupon (GRPN), the company that was going to turn everyone into mini versions of their grandmas:But beyond all else, you remember Twitter (TWTR):You've looked at Snap's financials and it's being valued at ridiculous levels. While Twitter and Facebook (FB) IPO'd at approximately 20 and 13 times forward revenue, respectively, Snap is trading at valuations over 30 times forward revenue! Furthermore, it has worse margins than what Facebook and Twitter had at their IPO. This should yield lower multiples, yet Snap's multiples are higher across the board. Let's have a look at those beautiful margins:Source: Author's custom charts, last amended S-1 for each respective companyAfter looking at these charts, you congratulate Snap on barely achieving a positive gross margin. Even Twitter was able to pull that off before its IPO. Furthermore, comparing the y-axis scale between each company illuminates a rather gloomy picture for Snap. But wait, there's more! Snap likes to point out it is improving the monetization of its existing daily active users (DAUs) as can be seen in the chart below:Source: S-1 filingBut it doesn't give you the full picture. Let me show you, astute investor, the cost associated with obtaining each new customer:Source: Author’s custom chart, S-1 filingCOGS-per-user is self-explanatory; the metric takes the cost of revenue and divides it by daily active users. This is another way of looking at gross margin (comparing revenue per user to COGS per user). It also helps identify the incremental hosting cost impact which is briefly discussed in its amended S-1:The second metric takes COGS per user and then adds in the sales and marketing expense. We add S&M back in because it is another cost associated with acquiring new users. As before, you divide this number by the total daily active users. When you look at the total user acquisition cost, it is still GREATER than the revenue Snap is receiving from each user. The rate of growth in customer acquisition costs is fairly offsetting to the average investor.Part of the reason behind this is Snap is starting to saturate the US market and is moving into less profitable, international regions. Hosting costs are higher in these areas despite labor costs being lower, so the net effect is higher costs and declining revenues. Analysts point out that because Snap's revenue model is not far into its life cycle yet, looking at revenue numbers is misleading. They claim this because advertisers still treat Snap as part of their ""experimental"" budgets. Hence, as Snap proves itself, it will receive a greater slice of the advertising pie. But as you and I both know, the user growth story isn't booming either:Source: Author’s custom chart, S-1 filingMost of this decline in growth is attributed to (*cough* Instagram) Android problems. This has been discussed in many news pieces and articles here, so we're not going to dig into it. However, it is important to note that user growth (or lack thereof) is the primary concern long-term investors have. But despite all of this being known, we saw a 44% pop on the first day of trading and an 11% pop the following day. You know there is no way this is sustainable unless almost everything at Snap goes right. Your forecasting prowess has illustrated the possibility of lucrative profits:Source: Years of hard work with the world’s most sophisticated, predictive neural networking models (sarcasm). Author’s custom chartTime to leverage the house and short Snap, right? Not so fast. So there are a few reasons you shouldn't short Snap even without leveraging your house. The market right now, at least in my opinion, is playing the ""greater fool"" game. For those of you unfamiliar with the phrase, greater fool investing is where you try and take advantage of irrationality in the markets. It's like investing in a pyramid scheme – you're just aiming to get out before everyone else. Normally, that's a great time to short because eventually it'll all collapse. The problem with this relates to an old phrase that has been kicked around in the stock markets for a long time:It’s a great quote to leave in the arsenal for moments like these because it can save your skin. Personally, I won't be touching Snap with a 10-foot pole. I will, however, continue to observe in the distance. If you go short, be prepared for turbulence. It took years before Twitter started tanking significantly. It took about half a year from the IPO before you could even make a sizable gain. The lull in tech IPOs is also increasing appetite for Snap, which may take a while to die off.

4052683,23709,2017-03-07T11:48:45-05:00,,"Last Thursday, March 2, shares of Snapchat parent Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) went public at $17, well above the $14-$16 initial public offering range. The shares hit a high of $29.44 on Friday morning before closing the week out at $27.09. That quick gain of just under 60 percent was great for investors that were involved with the IPO, but it wasn't quite the same for investors that entered into SNAP shares after the shares started trading on Thursday morning.With SNAP shares now trading in the secondary market and the buildup of the IPO now behind us, the question to us is, are SNAP shares really worth the current $34.7 billion in market capitalization? At that market valuation, the shares are trading at about 37 times EMarketer's estimate for Snap's 2017 advertising sales. As spelled out in the S-1 filing, Snap's Snapchat is free and the company generates revenue ""primarily through advertising,"" the same was true for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Actually, that's not THE question, but rather one of the key questions as we contemplate if there is enough upside to be had in SNAP shares from current levels to warrant a Buy rating? Odds are the IPO underwriters, which include Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) that made a reported $85 million in fees from the transaction, will have some favorable research comments on SNAP shares in the coming weeks.While SNAP shares fit within the confines of our Connected Society investing theme and are likely to benefit from the shift in advertising dollars to digital and social media platforms like Facebook and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and YouTube, our charge is to question using our thematic 20/20 foresight to see if enough upside in the shares exists to warrant placing them on the Tematica Select List?Boiling this down, it all comes down to growthThe question when looking at Snap is, ""Can it grow its revenue fast enough and deliver positive earnings per share so we can see at least 20 percent upside in the shares?""Well, right off the bat, the company's user base of 158 million active daily users was relatively flat in the December quarter and grew just 7 percent between 2Q 2016 and 3Q 2016. Assuming the company is able to continue to grow its user base, something that has eluded Twitter for the most part, it will still need to capture a disproportionate amount of the mobile advertising market to hit Goldman Sachs' forecast that calls for Snap to increase its revenue fivefold by 2018.Snap recorded $404.5 million in revenue last year, up from $58.7 million in 2015, so a fivefold increase would put 2018 revenue at more than $2 billion. IDC projects that mobile advertising spend will grow nearly 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020, while non-mobile advertising spend will decrease by approximately $15 billion during the same time period.While a fivefold increase in revenue catches our investing ears, we have to question Snap's ability to garner such an outsized piece of the mobile advertising market when going head to head with Facebook and its several platforms, Google, Twitter and others. The argument that a rising tide will lift all boats will only go so far when all of those boats are vying for the same position in the monetization river.There are other reasons to be skeptical, including users migrating to newer social media platforms or ones that have been updated like Facebook's Instagram that launched Stories to better compete with Snapchat. Snap called this out as a competitive concern in its S-1 filing - ""For example, Instagram, a subsidiary of Facebook, recently introduced a ""stories"" feature that largely mimics our Stories feature and may be directly competitive.""With good reason, because as Instagram Stories reached 150 million daily users in the back half of 2016, Snapchat's growth in average daily user count slowed substantially. Part of that could be due to Snap's reliance on the teen demographic, which even the company has noted is not ""brand loyal."" We're not sure anyone has figured out how to model teen fickleness in multi-year revenue forecasts.Making things a tad more complicated is the recent push back on digital advertising by Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) Chief Marketer Marc Pritchard, who publicly expressed his misgivings with today's digital media practices and ""called on the media buying and selling industry to become transparent in the face of 'crappy advertising accompanied by even crappier viewing experiences.'""As Pritchard made those and other comments, a survey from the World Federation of Advertisers showed that large brands are reviewing contracts related to almost $3 billion of advertising spend on programmatic advertising, which automates digital ad placement. The question to be answered is whether ads are actually seen and this has led to a call for companies like Snap to follow Facebook, YouTube and have Snapchat's ad metrics audited by the Media Rating Council.One other wrinkle in the Snap investing story is the company has yet to turn a profit.In 2016, while Snap's revenue was just over $400 million, it managed to generate a loss off $514.6 million, and per the S-1, it will need to spend a significant amount to attract new users and fend off competition. In reading that, the concern is user growth could be far slower - and expensive - than analysts are forecasting, which would impact advertising revenue growth like we've seen at Twitter. The thing is, new user growth for Snapchat already slowed in the back half of 2016 as newer messaging apps like Charge, Confide and Whisper have come to market.When Snap finally does turn a profit, we could see the outsized P/E ratio lead value and growth at a reasonable price (GARP) investors to balk at buying the shares, which means Snap will be relying on growth investors. It amazes us how some investors love companies even though they are not generating positive net income, but balk at a P/E ratio that is too high the minute they start to generate positive albeit rather small earnings per share. We get around that problem by using a multi-pronged valuation approach to determine upside and downside price targets.Is Snap the Next GoPro?While all those numbers and forecasts are important to one's investment decision-making process (we make that point clear in Cocktail Investing: Distilling Everyday Noise into Clear Investment Signals for Better Returns), we have a more primal issue with Snap. Back in late 2015, we shared our view that GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) was really a feature, not a product. As we said at the time, we saw Yelp (NYSE:YELP), Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and others as features that over time will be incorporated into other products - like Facebook's Professional Services, those at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or others from Alphabet's Google, much the way point-and-shoot cameras were overtaken by camera-enabled smartphones and personal information management functions were first incorporated into mobile phones and later smartphones, obviating the need for the original Palm Pilot and other pocket organizers.When GoPro shares debuted in June 2014, they were a strong performer over the following months until they peaked near $87, but 15 months after going public, GPRO shares fell through the IPO price and have remained underwater ever since.What happened?We recall hearing plans for a video network of user channels at GoPro as well as the management team touting the company as an ""end to end storytelling solution,"" but over the last few quarters, we've heard far more about new product issues, layoffs, facility closures and falling unit sales. In 2016, GoPro saw camera unit sell-through fall 12 percent year over year to 5.3 million units from approximately 6 million units in 2015.In our view, what happened can be summed up rather easily - GoPro was and is a feature, not a standalone product. It just took the stock market some time to figure it out once the IPO blitz and glory subsided. While we could be wrong, we have a strong suspicion that Snap is more likely to resemble GoPro than Facebook, which is monetizing multiple platforms as it extends its presence with new solutions deeper into the lives of its users and has changed the way people communicate.As investors, we at Tematica would much rather own innovators of new products and solutions that are addressing pain points or benefitting from disruptive forces and changing economics, demographics, and psychographics in the marketplace than companies that offer features that will soon be co-opted by other companies and their products. Following that focus on 20/20 foresight, we avoided GoPro shares that fell from $19.50 in December 2015 to the recent share price of $8.84.And then there's this...There is another consideration that is not specific to Snap, but is rather an issue that all newly public companies must contend with - the lock-up expiration. For those unfamiliar with it, the lock-up period is a contractual restriction that prevents insiders who are holding a company's stock, before it goes public, from selling the stock for a period usually between 90 to 180 days after the company goes public.Per Snap's S-1, its lock-up expiration is 150 days, which puts it in 3Q 2017. Given the potential that insider selling could hit the shares, and be potentially disruptive to the share price, we tend to wait until the lock-up expiration comes and goes before putting the shares under the full Tematica telescope. This isn't specific to Snap shares, but rather it's one of our rules of thumb.We have a strong suspicion that Snap is more likely to resemble GoPro than Facebook, but we'll keep an open mind during the SNAP shares lock-up period. After all, companies are living entities that can move forward and backward depending on the market environment and leadership team. Let's remember too that it took Facebook some time to figure out mobile.Finally, we aren't so thrilled that none of the 200 million shares floated came with voting rights, leaving the two founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy with total control of the company. We prefer seeing more direct shareholder accountability… but hey, that's us."

The camera firm's IPO was priced above the expected range and a huge first-day pop put the valuation at more than three times that of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). With slowing user growth and sizable losses, my worries were definitely justified as the street has turned against the name quickly.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)At Tuesday's low, shares have lost almost 30% from their peak, now sitting more than 10% below their market opening price from Thursday. A number of research firms have come out with ratings, many of them are quite negative, with the rest being holds. In fact, the price target range is $10 to $22, so the top end is barely a dollar above where Snap shares trade currently. In fact, the average target on the street is $15.50, nearly 10% below the IPO price. That says a lot about how much the street dislikes this stock.One thing that I didn't cover originally but has picked up more attention is Snap's decision to sell non-voting stock to the public. That means investors don't have a say in what the company does, and that's a big turnoff for investors. In fact, some large institutional investors are trying to get Snap barred from certain indexes due to the non-voting share issue. If you don't think voting rights are an issue, take a look at what we've seen in the past:Even after the large fall, Snap still trades at roughly 2.5 times what Twitter does. That's a heavy price to pay for a company that's burning through cash and is not profitable. While there is certainly plenty of room for user growth at Snap moving forward, buying the stock now means you are likely going to hold for quite a while. If the name does not get included in certain indexes, demand for shares will certainly dry up. In the short term, the bias is to the downside as the market continues to figure out what Snap is really worth and most market experts think that number is well below where we are currently."
4052138,68555,2017-03-05T10:15:03-05:00,"Due to the slowing sequential user growth, Snapchat may maximize its reach soon.Snapchat's strong revenue growth makes shorting very risky.Snapchat's success largely depends on its ability to monetize its core user base.","Despite the fact that the social media boom is coming to an end, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, had a very successful IPO with the shares rising almost 60% from its issue price of $17. Although the retail investors didn't get to ride the entire rally-as it opened at around $24-the stock is still up considerably.Although the social media boom is coming to an end, the stocks in the sector are still trading in bubble territory. The likes of Snap, Twitter, and even Facebook to an extent, are trading at valuations they will struggle to justify in the years to come. You can make a case for Facebook's valuation given its digital marketing market share, profitability, and remarkable growth. However, as for Snap, I don't see how the company can justify its current valuation, and I have a couple of reasons for my rationale.Growth doesn't do justice to valuationSnap currently commands a market cap of over $31 billion. To put the overvaluation into perspective, the company only generates about $400 million in annual revenue, meaning the stock's P/S ratio currently stands at over 77. By comparison, Facebook has a P/S ratio of 14.3.Although Snap's revenue growth rate is a lot higher than Facebook's, it still doesn't justify the substantial premium that the market is putting on it because of Snapchat's slowing DAU growth.Source: Goodwater CapitalAs you can see from the chart above, Snapchat's sequential user growth has slowed down dramatically in the last three quarters and stood at just 3% from the latest quarter. Although I am not an advocate of sequential comparisons, you can see from the chart below, the growth of daily active users is relatively consistent in the social media space, and seasonal factors do not affect it by a margin significant enough to make the comparisons void.Source: Tech CrunchSo, Snapchat's DAU growth chart not only points towards a slowdown in user growth but also makes for a tough YOY comparison in the quarters to come. Snapchat may maximize its reach soon in the future and there's uncertainty surrounding the platform's ability to grow beyond its current demographics. Combine that with the slowdown in sequential growth and you have a good reason to not own the stock.Should you short it?Although Snap's overvaluation is evident, it is still not a good enough reason to short the stock. Timing a short correctly in a bull market is a very tricky task and given the recent momentum of the stock, I think investors shouldn't short it just yet.Even other fads like GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) kept on rising for months after their IPOs before the eventual crash. While I don't expect Snapchat to crash as hard as either one of them, I do think the stock can head a lot higher from current levels before the eventual crash.Source: Goodwater CapitalAs you can see from the image above, Snap's revenue growth rate has been exceptional over the past two years and is expected to stay strong for at least three more years. Moreover, the company is also expected to turn profitable by the end of FY 2019.As it is evident from the likes Facebook, the market usually puts a hefty premium on social media companies as long as they continue reporting impressive revenue growth and consistent improvement in profitability.The fact that Snap's revenue is expected to grow in triple digits despite a slowdown in user growth rate indicated that the company' ability to meet the estimates depends on its ability to monetize its core user base. Hence, in my opinion, investors should keep a close eye on Snap's monetization initiatives as it can paint a very clear picture of the stock's future movement.ConclusionIt seems like Snap's owners have exploited a market that is hungry for a fresh high-profile IPO by cashing out almost $1 billion in shares. At current levels, Snap is clearly overvalued, and the slowdown in Snapchat's user growth rate will make it further difficult for the company to grow into its valuation. However, as mentioned above, Snap can continue trading at irrational on account of its strong revenue growth and path to profitability.The company's ability to justify its current price, or move higher, largely depends on its ability to monetize its core user base. Thus, I think investors should keep close tabs on the company's monetization efforts and make their decision accordingly. However, as of now, I think investors should watch the stock from the sidelines and wait for a significant irrational move, in either direction, before taking a long or short position."
4052043,92586,2017-03-03T19:26:34-05:00,The comparison between Snap and Facebook around the time of their IPOs is inevitable.My analysis uncovers what I believe to be an unprecedented level of confidence and optimism about the future of Snap.It takes a bit of imagination for an investor to see the path to the $1.5 billion or so in annual net earnings that would justify Snap's current stock price.,"The comparison between Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is inevitable. Snap went public this past Thursday, and the stock has been up 65% from the IPO price of $17/share in a matter of days. Meanwhile, the Menlo Park company went public in May 2012 and, unlike Snap, its IPO (priced at $38/share) struggled to gain traction in the early days. FB's shares lost about half their market value in about half a year, trading at a low of $17.55 in September 2012, never to see those rock-bottom price levels again.Credit: The Daily DotIn this article, I explore a bit more the differences between Snap and Facebook around the time of their initial public offerings. Doing so has been an eye opener, as the analysis uncovered what I believe to be an unprecedented level of confidence and optimism about the future of Snap.Snap vs. Facebook by the numbersThe table below will guide our discussions. Take a moment to look through the data before moving on:Source: DM Martins Research, using data from SEC.govConsidering Facebook's current size (nearly $400 billion in capitalization, the 12th largest company in the world) and market dominance in the social media space, it is remarkable that Snap is currently perceived to be worth nearly half Facebook's market value one month after its 2012 IPO.Snap's valuation does not seem to be necessarily justifiable by fundamentals. For example, its DAU (daily active user) count is roughly three times smaller than FB's in 2012. The growth of Snap's user base is no more impressive by comparison, as both companies had been expanding DAU at 48% YOY by the time of the public offerings. Interestingly and perhaps worrisome, Snap even issued a disclosure, buried in the S-1 filed with the SEC, that ""the growth in DAU was relatively flat [sequentially] in the latter part of the quarter ended September 30, 2016"" while 4Q16 quarter-over-quarter DAU growth slowed down substantially from 7% in 3Q16 to 3%.Looking from a different angle, Snap is nearly 10 times smaller than Facebook was post-IPO on a total revenue basis. This might not impress the most attentive reader, who would point out that Snap's monetization efforts are still in the very early stages - the first paid advertising didn't happen until late 2014. But it is worth pointing out that Snap's stock price today suggests a sky-high trailing EV/sales of 77.5x, whereas FB was valued at a more timid 21.1x multiple post-IPO.Lastly, notice how Facebook seems to have gone public at a much more mature stage of its business. The company generated 77% in GAAP gross margins in the year that preceded the initial public offering, as well as SBC-adjusted op margins of 53%. Conversely, Snap is still unable to cover even its cost of revenues, and produced dismal adjusted op margins of -121% last year.The TakeawaysThe metrics above tell me that the market is betting aggressively on the prospects of the new social media platform after having seen Facebook build a massively profitable business in a matter of a few years. It takes quite a bit of imagination for an analyst or investor to see the path to the $1.5 billion or so in future annual net earnings that would justify Snap's current stock price of $27/share, assuming Facebook's 20x current forward earnings multiple. For reference, Snap produced a net loss of about half a billion in 2016 (on revenues of only $405 million), or -$0.64/share, that was $140 million worse than in 2015.I believe Snap has much to thank Facebook for being the first company of its kind to test the waters and deal with the early-days investor skepticism. As social media proved to be a viable business, FB appreciated 680% since the all-time low reached less than five years ago, and Snap snagged valuation multiples that I believe to be extraordinarily aggressive, if not unrealistic.In terms of buying Snap at current levels, I believe momentum is on the stock's side. Although my short-term prediction is probably no better than a coin toss, I would not doubt that shares may reach $35 or $40 in a matter of a few months. Snap, in fact, is more likely to trade on emotional reaction and euphoria than on the underlying fundamentals of the company over the next weeks. But I cannot bet on the stock as a long-term strategy until I can see that DAU growth will not continue to slow down, or that its monetization efforts will be aggressive and successful enough to give me some confidence that scale can be achieved.If you are looking for a great social media company to invest in, I highly suggest giving FB some serious consideration. And if you are looking to possibly make a quick buck over the next couple of days while having fun in the process, Vegas is only a short flight away.Follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk. I call it the Storm-Resistant Growth portfolio. The very early results have already exceeded my expectations.

4051940,102883,2017-03-03T14:16:03-05:00,Investors in Class A shares will receive zero voting rights.Valuation is quite expensive relative to the Facebook and Twitter IPOs.Excessive non-performance based compensation for executives is a cause for concern.,"Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), owner of the budding social media platform Snapchat, went public yesterday in an oversubscribed IPO that saw shares gain 44% by end of day.After an abysmal year for technology IPOs in 2016, SNAP raised $3.4 billion yesterday, surpassing the $4.3 billion raised from 26 technology IPOs on US exchanges last year according to Dealogic.Echoing the IPO behavior of other technology firms, SNAP founders Even Spiegel, 26, and Bobby Murphy, 28, implemented a multiple class structure. But unlike their tech peers, shares were issued to the public with zero voting rights, which is considered extreme even by technology industry standards. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page gave themselves disproportionate voting power back during their 2004 IPO allowing them to control almost 60% of voting rights. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) followed suit in 2012 only to strip investors of their voting rights last year in order to maintain 60% of voting rights while donating a substantial portion of his shares to his foundation.Voting powerSNAP has created a three-tiered share structure.Prior to the IPO, the company boasted just over 512 million Class A shares, which carry zero voting rights. The founders each held 21.8% of these shares. Early investors Benchmark Capital Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners held 12.7% and 8.3% of these shares, respectively with SNAP board member and Benchmark general partner Mitch Lasky holding a further 12.7%.Class B shares carry one vote per share and were primarily owned by the aforementioned venture capital funds: Benchmark (22.8%), Lightspeed (15%), and Lasky (22.8%). Atop the share hierarchy are Class C shares, which were equally owned by Spiegel and Murphy and each boast 10 votes per share, effectively giving the young founders 88.6% of voting rights.Post-IPO, each Class B share transferred will automatically convert to a Class A share save for a few exceptions. Additionally, Class C shares will convert to Class B shares upon transfer save for a few exceptions, which include the transfer of shares between the founders themselves. Both Class B and Class C shares convert to Class A and Class B shares, respectively, upon the death of the holder. Moreover, should one of the founders' holding of Class C shares fall below 30% of his holding at the time of the IPO, or a specific number of shares to be later determined, said shares would automatically convert to Class B shares. And when there are no Class C shares left, outstanding Class B shares will convert to Class A shares, all of which would gain voting power to the tune of one vote per share.Figure 1: SNAP major shareholders prior to IPOSource: S-1 SEC filingA cursory review of the holdings would reveal that the SNAP founders each enjoyed a control premium of almost 2 times. A control premium in excess of 1 violates the ""one-share/one-vote"" principle and enables a concentrated group of shareholders to control the firm.In a report co-authored by IRRC and ISS, researchers found that controlled firms with single-class structures outperformed their counterparts with multiple class structures in the S&P 1500 Composite Index over a three-year, five-year, and 10-year performance period ending in August 2012. However, multiple class structures did outperform over a one-year period[i]. In analyzing SEC disclosures between 1990 and 1998, Chad Zutter of the University of Pittsburgh found a substantial discount applied to the initial valuation of dual class structures. He interpreted it as the market's perception of ""a relationship between the extreme entrenchment of dual-class management and firm performance"" and concluded that the market tends to overprice said structures around the time of the IPO only to correct as time passes[ii]. These findings seem to broadly confirm the conclusions derived from the IRRC/ISS report.Interestingly, other researchers have adopted a more nuanced view. Thomas Chemmanur and Yawen Jiao's IPO model revealed that dual class IPOs are more likely to outperform their single class peers when ""the reputation of the incumbent is high and the firm is operating in an industry where the difference in intrinsic values between the projects with high and low near term uncertainty is large""[iii]. Whether Spiegel and Murphy are the true visionaries they are trumpeted up to be is yet to be determined, but the technology sector does offer its fair share of uncertainty and astronomical valuations.Disenfranchisement did not seem to deter investors in the technology sector in the past, but have the SNAP founders gone too far? In a recent letter to Spiegel, Murphy, and chairman-designate Michael Lynton, the 18 members of the Council of Institutional Investors, which include the California Public Employees Retirement System ((CalPERS)) and Aberdeen Asset Management, urged SNAP to adopt a single class share structure citing the findings in the IRRC study[iv].The Corporate Governance Principles for US Listed Companies championed by the Investor Stewardship Group (ISG), a grouping of 16 US and international institutional investors which include BlackRock and Vanguard, has also publicly rebuked dual class structures. Their second principle concisely echoes this sentiment: ""Shareholders should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interest"". It further calls for boards that currently employ dual class structures to regularly review the benefits of such a practice and to ""establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders"". Although the ISG does not plan to uphold these principles until January 1, 2018, their message is loud and clear[v].Expensive valuationTalk of SNAP's valuation has gripped markets. Prior to the IPO, SNAP disclosed a price of $17 per share, fetching a valuation of approximately $20.4 billion, or 50.3 times FY 2016 revenues or 20.4 times FY 2017 projected revenues. An expensive proposition compared to the valuations used for some of its peers such as Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Figure 2: SNAP, Facebook, and Twitter data prior to their IPOs.Source: S-1 SEC filing, Bloomberg Intelligence, Wall Street Journal, and Seeking Alpha (Truth Investor)Making this generous valuation even more worrisome is the fact that SNAP reported a gross margin of almost -12% for FY 2016 (although margins turned to a positive 7% in Q4 2016). These abysmal margins are due to the fact that, unlike Facebook and Twitter, SNAP outsources its data services to the Google Cloud. Earlier in the year, SNAP signed a 5-year deal with the Google Cloud Platform that requires a minimum payment of $400 million/year to provide the infrastructure vital to keep its Snapchat application running. Twitter, at a similar revenue base, boasted gross margins of 63%[vi].Other profitability measures do not paint a prettier picture. Adjusted EBITDA worsened by 57% to reach -$459 million in FY 2016 and the company continues to hemorrhage cash flow, reporting free cash flow of -$678 million, almost double its cash loss in the prior year period. It is no surprise then that SNAP's valuation is predicated on the anticipation of stellar revenue growth going forward, with estimates that they would reach $1 billion in FY 2017 vs. $405 million last year. Nevertheless, growth in Daily Active Users (DAU) appears to be losing steam, reporting year-on-year growth of 40% in Q4 2016, down from a peak of 65% growth in Q2 2016. Even quarterly DAU growth has fallen to the single digits in the last two quarters of FY 2016. Analysts have not overlooked the potential for Facebook's ""Instagram Stories"" to accelerate this trend.Shareholders should also note that Twitter, trading currently at almost $16/share, is still 62% below its IPO valuation and market observers are skeptical as to whether it can generate the growth necessary to justify a higher valuation. Facebook, after debuting in a disastrous IPO which shed over 50% of its value, has come roaring back, currently trading at over 350% of its IPO price, after it definitively proved its staying power.The stakes are evidently high, and given the extremely volatile nature of young technology companies, it is incumbent upon boards to at the very least give shareholders a say in how their companies are run.Executive CompensationOur discussion then turns to executive compensation, where it appears that SNAP executives are being generously compensated for their potential to generate future growth as opposed to actual performance.Figure 3: SNAP executive compensation in FY 2016 and FY 2015.Source: S-1 SEC filingEvan Spiegel, who currently serves as CEO collected $2.4 million in compensation in FY 2016 and received no shares as compensation.The Company has stated that post-IPO, Spiegel will receive a symbolic salary of $1, mirroring that of Mark Zuckerberg and the Google founders. Nevertheless, he is slated to receive an award of 3% of all outstanding shares on the closing of the IPO, a handsome $612 million windfall (at $17 per share). The award will be paid in the form of Class C shares, making Spiegel the largest controlling shareholder, pushing him ahead of Murphy in the pecking order.Last year SNAP made headlines when it poached Imran Khan from Credit Suisse to be its chief strategist, rewarding him with 7 million restricted share units ((RSUs)) worth an astounding $146 million. Almost all share awards (RSUs and stock options) have a service condition (time spent at the company) and a performance condition. According to the S-1 filing, the performance condition is 'satisfied on the occurrence of a qualifying event, which includes a change in control or the effective date of an initial public offering'.As of December 31, 2016, SNAP had almost $1.5 billion in employee RSUs that have not yet satisfied the service condition. More troublingly, had the IPO occurred on December 31, 2016, SNAP would have recognized a colossal $1.1 billion in compensation for RSUs that have already satisfied the service condition. The most recent RSUs granted in November-December 2016 boasted a weighted average fair value of $16.33/share. As for stock options granted during the year, the weighted average fair value was $30.19/share, with a strike price of $1/shares. In July 2016, 1,253,028 stock options were granted with an underlying common stock fair value of $31.08/share.The oversubscribed IPO is an enormous payday for SNAP executives, and given the lack of genuine performance conditions, they will not bear the consequences should a massive correction in the share price take hold à la Twitter.Much ado about nothing?If SNAP were to become the next Facebook, dissenting voices will surely be silenced as institutional investors reap the benefits of a higher share price. On the flipside, investors stand to lose quite a bit and will not have the power to change how the company is being run.SNAP's unabashed subversion of shareholder rights at the expense of power-hoarding visionaries, the venture capitalists who enable them and the opportunistic bankers who hype them is truly a cause for concern. No promise of potential profitability should replace shareholder democracy and reasonable valuations.The question investors have to, therefore, contemplate is whether accepting excessive non-performance based remuneration and a dual class structure that marginalizes them, is truly worth the risk of investing in SNAP?

4051684,74905,2017-03-02T19:47:42-05:00,"Despite having a strong product, Snapchat faces serious headwinds.The current valuation implies that these headwinds aren't priced into the market.It is likely Snapchat doesn't justify its valuation and disappoints investors.","IntroductionAs Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) IPOs, it's clear the company has quite a few advantages. Specifically, it's a great product with very strong engagement and user growth. Of course, three years ago this was exactly what people said about Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Since then, Twitter has struggled to monetize its user base and its user growth began to slow. As such, the stock is worth only 1/3 rd of what it was worth at its peak, and 1/2 the valuation of Snapchat post-IPO. While Snapchat's co-founders have wide-ranging visions for the company, when reviewing the S1 and the competitive landscape, it became clear to me that they face many of the same challenges as Twitter. Ultimately, I believe these challenges will weigh on Snapchat's premium valuation and investors will find Snapchat performing closer to Twitter than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over the next 2-3 years. (Author's note: unless otherwise stated, all information about SNAP is pulled from the S1).SNAP's Product and User GrowthSnapchat's product is very strong and does give the company some advantages in its competitive market. The product is well optimized for user engagement in terms of finding that ""magic moment,"" or that point in time where users realize the value a product can provide in their lives. Snapchat is unique in that this moment can vary by demographic. Younger users likely find this moment when playing with geofilters, while older users may have the moment when exploring Snapchat publishers and interacting with their favorite brands. Either way, Snapchat's product is optimized so all demographics can find these moments relatively quickly. This product optimization has let Snapchat build very strong user engagement.It's interesting for investors to note that Snapchat has chosen to focus on Daily Active Users (DAUs) as its key metric for engagement. DAUs is growing strongly and I agree with management that it is the most relevant metric for the company and investors to follow as a performance indicator. Unlike a platform like Facebook, where users are likely to spend 20-30 minutes in one sitting, Snapchat is likely to be used by consumers in short frequent bursts; this makes the DAU metric more relevant than Monthly Active Users (MAUs) because it more accurately captures this style of engagement. Indeed, this is one clear differentiator between Snapchat and Twitter - despite its similarities to Snapchat, management focused more on MAUs. I believe this mistake was a huge reason why Twitter's management didn't recognize deceleration in user growth and engagement early enough to address the problem. Even today, Twitter still does not report DAU numbers, and it is hard to know just how engaged the user base is. It's also interesting to note that Twitter management may have recognized this issue, as in its last two quarterly reports Twitter has begun highlighting DAU growth, which is now back to double-digits. Like Snapchat, this should be its focus.Despite the strengths of the product, investors should remember that many of Twitter's growth/engagement problems were not visible at this stage in its evolution. Certain areas of the user experience that bugged Twitter are also major problems for Snapchat. Difficulty in finding friends, for instance, has always frustrated me on Snapchat. This specific problem really hurt the ability for Twitter to attract marginal users and it can do the same to Snapchat. Attracting these marginal users is key to maintaining the growth numbers that Snapchat will need to justify its IPO valuation. It is possible that, as Snapchat begins to reach saturation in the developed markets with its core user base, other engagement issues will come to light that will keep marginal users away. Further, and in a strong contrast to Twitter, Snapchat is heavily reliant on smartphones and broadband networks due to its nature as a video/image sharing product that requires more bandwidth. This severely limits its exposure in emerging markets, where the broadband networks aren't as developed and could contribute to a steep drop in user growth. To conclude the discussion on products, it is also worth noting that, in recent months, we have seen huge competitive pressure from Facebook. Instagram and WhatsApp have released similar features as Snapchat and the current feedback on these features is very good, which could be bad news for Snapchat.MonetizationMonetization is the key reason why Snapchat is likely to disappoint investors at its current valuation. While digital advertising is a growing space, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook's massive market share make it likely that this growth will mostly go to these two, while other companies fight for scraps, or even shrink. The reason that Google and Facebook have been able to build this market share is because their products are incredibly successful in gathering consumer data and using that data to maximize advertiser return on investment (ROI). This data allows advertisers to target massive groups and track conversion rates scientifically. This is revolutionary, as large-scale advertising campaigns traditionally had no way to do this. Snap can't do this either, because the platform is not well-suited for developing the type of data that Facebook and Google use to run these campaigns. The mention of ""challenges in user metrics measurements"" in the risk section of the S1 points to this. Here, Snapchat alludes to the fact that it hasn't been able to develop specific information about its users, such as age and gender - key demographic information that is necessary for advertisers to maximize ROI. This is intuitive when considering that most of Snapchat's data is unstructured (images/videos), which is significantly harder for computers to analyze and organize (essential if a company eventually wants to monetize the data). This ""data problem"" is very important for investors to keep in mind, because it means that, even if Snapchat can overcome the growth headwinds, it still likely will struggle to monetize in the ways that Facebook did. While Twitter has struggled with this, it is worth noting that the data that Twitter can collect from its users does seem as though it should be significantly more robust and useful than Snapchat's.Whether or not Snapchat has the data to steal market share from Google and Facebook, it's worth noting that ad campaigns are much harder to deliver on Snapchat without disrupting the user experience. While investors may look at Snapchat's S1 and see positive metrics from its advertising program, they leave me skeptical. Many of the metrics it refers to force me to question data measurement practices. For example, some metrics it points to include ""users who watched ads with sound on,"" ""play time per user,"" and ""increase in search traffic."" The first two metrics are self-selecting groups, meaning they don't include users who skipped the ads (investors can't assess how effective these ad campaigns really are). The last metric doesn't tell investors anything whatsoever as far as whether Snapchat's ads contributed to the increase in search traffic. It's telling that Snapchat doesn't refer to many metrics that advertisers usually look at, such as click through rate, to measure campaign success.To conclude the monetization analysis, investors need to remember that Snapchat is only in its first few days of monetizing through ads; while this means there is room for growth, it also means that advertisers have yet to fully assess whether or not the money spent on the platform is worthwhile. This lag in assessment of marketing campaigns has been clear in other public companies. Twitter, for example, has seen revenue lag user growth numbers by 6-12 months likely because of this. Further, there are things that Snap does very well. Snap has strong brand awareness through its publisher and geofilter programs. While these types of ad campaigns will always be utilized by marketers, they don't have nearly the same ROI as the types of targeted ad campaigns discussed above, and thus won't be able to justify SNAP's current valuation. Many of the monetization problems I've outlined above were very similar to Twitter's problems and, eventually, were the key drivers of Twitter's massive shift in strategy towards more live programming and the huge reorganization of its internal sales structure.App or Ecosystem?One key indicator for success for many of the largest internet companies was their ability to move from a single app to a fully integrated platform from which other apps are plugged into and engage with (an ecosystem). When a company can develop this ecosystem, it makes switching costs significantly higher, giving the company a Warren Buffett style ""moat."" Facebook is a great example of purely software-based ecosystems, whereas Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a software-hardware mixed ecosystem. Both of these companies are great examples of how getting to ""ecosystem"" status increases user's switching costs. To create sustainable long-term growth (and shareholder value), it is imperative any internet company can become an ecosystem. It isn't clear to me that Snapchat is capable of making its product move from app to ecosystem. Management's current approach seems to use hardware to create an ecosystem, in the reverse of GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) attempt to move from a camera company to a social media company. For GoPro, this did not work, and I don't think it will for Snapchat either. It's telling that it's targeting hardware, rather than focusing on developing a software-based ecosystem to emulate Facebook. To me, this shows the limits of Snapchat's appeal. It is very much an app-style product, which is perfectly optimized for mobile, has a few simple features that work very well and is easy to use for consumers. There isn't as much of an opportunity to integrate Snapchat into other products or develop it into a product that can work well on everything. As such, it's unlikely to ever cross from ""app"" to ""ecosystem."" Here, it does significantly worse than Twitter, which has some features of an ecosystem. Features that the shift to live should allow Twitter's management to focus on.Valuation and ConclusionsWhen we look at all the headwinds facing Snapchat, it's hard to see why it deserves such a premium over Twitter. To get a better idea as to the valuation compared to Twitter, I ran a comp screen on CapIQ comparing Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook. Note that this is not meant to give a very specific valuation of SNAP, only to show that the risks I outlined above are clearly not being accounted for in the stock.Here are some key takeaways from these numbers. First, Snapchat is already being valued as worth twice as much as Twitter, with 1/2 of forward revenue estimates. Even if Snapchat was valued around the same area as Twitter, its forward EV/Revenue would be about the same or higher than Facebook, despite the fact that Facebook and Google are capturing all the growth in the industry. These valuation metrics, and the forward projections that analysts currently have for Snapchat, tell me that the market is looking at Snapchat and seeing a company that they think can steal market share from Facebook and Google. They are not pricing in any of the risks that I analyzed above. Investors need to look at this and decide on their own whether Snapchat is really going to compete with these internet giants? Is that really realistic, given the headwinds facing the company? Given that shareholders are receiving non-voting shares and have zero say over the direction of the company?At the very least, it is extremely likely that it will take Snapchat 2-3 years before it can do this: 2-3 years in which Snapchat will not be able to justify these valuation numbers, disappointing investors and likely doing very poorly in the market. In fact, this is exactly what we saw with Twitter. Now, with Twitter priced more realistically, the realignment of Twitter's strategy towards live programming gives investors a chance to actually profit from owning Twitter. With that in mind, I have become a shareholder in Twitter. Conversely, I wouldn't even consider purchasing Snapchat unless its valuation was halved. Investors should stay far, far away from this IPO."

        SNAP's first day on Wall Street is more similar to TWTR's first day than FB's first day.
        The growth outlook for SNAP isn't all that rosy from either a user base or monetization standpoint.
        All together, we think SNAP is worth $12 billion versus the market's valuation of $28 billion.
        It may take time for the Snap hype bubble to pop (the stock may go significantly higher before it tumbles), but we think its only a matter of time.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP) had a very good first day on Wall Street, opening to the public 40% higher than its IPO price. While there has been lots of excitement surrounding this IPO, we believe Snap draws eerie similarities to prior IPOs which popped and then dropped. We think investors should stay away from SNAP.SNAP Price data by YChartsThere are many reasons to avoid Snap here, but we have identified two which are most important:The market is currently valuing Snap at $28 billion. That is about 26x this year's revenue estimate. We do not think the company has enough of a realizable growth opportunity ahead of it to warrant that type of valuation. We think Snap is worth around $12 billion, implying significant downside from current levels.Too Much Hype?Snap had a fairly successful first day on Wall Street. Shares popped more than 40% to $24 and change from a $17 IPO price. That isn't great by historical standards. As seen in the chart below, a 40% price to open gain is far off from being a top-10 gain since 2012. It is, however, still very good and indicative that there was a good amount of excitement for the IPO.(Source: Wall Street Journal)But was there too much hype? It seems the question everyone has been asking is whether Snap will be the next Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)? The first day of trading puts Snap more in Twitter's footsteps. Interestingly, Facebook struggled to close above its $38 IPO price on its first day of trading back in May 2012. Twitter, though, surged 73% in its first day of trading to $26 per share.Today, Facebook trades north of $136. Twitter trades under $16 per share.FB data by YChartsThe recent IPO environment isn't all that comforting, either. Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), which was arguably the most hyped tech IPO of 2016, surged 90% on its first day of public trading. The stock continued to roar throughout most of 2016 and a touched a high near $70 per share in September 2016. But then Q3 results rolled in, and they were accompanied by the announcement of a secondary offering. Shares tanked and are now just above $31.TWLO data by YChartsUp from its IPO price, TWLO has done much better than other recent big IPOs. Anyone remember GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO)? On the idea it was a revolutionary media company, GPRO surged 30% on its first day of trading and doubled within a week. Shares continued higher in the near-term to almost $100. But then earnings rolled in, and with them came the understanding that GPRO was not a revolutionary media company. Rather, it was a fad hardware company with a niche audience. Consequently, the stock now trades under $10 per share.GPRO data by YChartsAnd then there is Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), the tech company which was pioneering a new era of wearable technology. It, too, surged on its first day of trading and headed significantly higher in the weeks following its IPO. It turned out, though, that the wearables market was quite crowded, and that FIT had some big competition. On top of that, demand for wearables began to wane after a hot start. Now, FIT is right around all-time lows while competitor Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) is showing significant signs of strength.FIT data by YChartsEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) had one of the more exciting first days on Wall Street. The online crafts marketplace had a price to open surge of 88% to $30 per share on its first day, but had some shaky days thereafter. Yet again, though, the real wake-up call was the first earnings report, which had shares down big and making new post-IPO lows. The plunge continued and today, shares trade at $10 and big change.ETSY data by YChartsHow about Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK)? Shares of SHAK doubled in their first day of trading to close at nearly $46. It was a new burger concept that found itself on the right side of the health trend and had blistering comps. Shares soared as high as $90 in May of 2015. But then comps came down, questions arose about the ability to expand and preserve sales volumes, and the stock fell. Today, SHAK trades around $35 per share.SHAK data by YChartsIn all of these examples, there is a common playbook. A richly valued company pops on its first day of trading. There is a big hype story about the potential growth trajectory of the company, and this supports the rich valuation in a near-term window. Shares head higher. Then reality hits (i.e. the first earnings report), and investors start to question the big hype story which supports the lofty valuation. Each subsequent ER serves to undermine that hype story. Eventually, the hype story is lost as yesterday's news, and the stock sells off sharply.Snap seems to fit that mold perfectly. For months, and even years, Snap has quickly been growing in popularity. It has stolen the attention of teens from Facebook, and according to many surveys, is the most used app by teens. Revenues grew by nearly 7x last year, and the projection is for a more than 2x increase this year. The app is trendy, cool, and hip, and so is the stock so far. The Street is awarding it a 26x projected revenue multiple, and a near 70x trailing revenue multiple. Investors seem to think that the Snap growth story is just getting started.The truth, though, seems far from that.Fundamental ConcernsWe have pointed out our fundamental concerns before in our article regarding why Facebook investors shouldn't worry about Snap, but let us recap here.All this considered, the growth outlook for SNAP isn't all that rosy from either a user base or monetization standpoint. The North American user base appears to be nearing saturation at an unexpectedly small number, while the international growth trajectory will be challenged by Facebook. ARPU does have some room to expand, but relative to Facebook's ARPU growth, it looks like Snap is going to have a hard time attracting top-tier ad dollars.At a $28 billion market cap, though, the stock trades at nearly 26x this year's revenue estimate. A 26x PSR multiple for a stock with negative operating income, negative EBITDA, negative earnings, negative cash flow, no clear guide to profitability, and a bleak revenue outlook feels significantly stretched. Even under aggressive growth assumptions for revenue to top $1 billion this year, $2 billion next year, and grow at a 30% CAGR over the next 10 years, we still only think the company is worth $12 billion today.Bottom LineThe Snap IPO feels a lot like Fitbit, GoPro, and others. As a company, Snap is trendy like Fitbit and GoPro were. All 3 target a younger, more connected, and more fickle demographic. All 3 pioneered new technologies, but face intense competition. All 3 have had tremendous revenue growth quarters, but all 3 have also had profitability and margin concerns. All 3 had strong first days on Wall Street.It remains to be seen whether or not all 3 will ultimately be sub-$10 stocks, but our bet is that they will. It may take some time for the Snap hype bubble to pop (the stock may very well go significantly higher before it tumbles), but we think its only a matter of time."
4051996,102628,2017-03-03T15:18:32-05:00,"Snap gains +44% in its first day, garners a strategic investment by NBC, and receives neutral ratings from the Street.Snap’s small float underpinned the IPO’s success, ensuring an overabundance of demand vs. supply.Apple proves once again that it is operations-focused - as opposed to innovation-focused - attacking Qualcomm with a new round of litigation.3-D design firm Autodesk blends pain with gain.Palo Alto Networks tanks, while Lyft talks cash and YouTube finally goes (solidly) over the top.","Contributing Authors: Fred McClimans, Zach Mitchell, John Freeman.Snap, Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) closed yesterday's trading session at $24.48, +44%, vs. its initial pricing of $17, concluding the most anticipated tech IPO since Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) in September 2014. +44% on opening day is great, but it's worth noting that the opening trade took place at $24.00, and stayed within a range of $23.50-26.05.The $24.48 share price gives SNAP an impressive (we might say overvalued) $28.3b market cap - about 2.5x the value of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and greater than the $26b Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) paid to acquire LinkedIn last December.To be fair, however, we consider TWTR a bit overvalued as well, and believe the best mechanism for TWTR to realize shareholder value is through an acquisition.SNAP's small float - only about 19% of total shares outstanding - played a significant role in facilitating the large initial jump at the open that persevered all day. The underwriters did a phenomenal job of: 1) ensuring demand, 2) minimizing volatility, and 3) earning healthy commissions.Despite SNAP's strong IPO, we've got eight good reasons why we are intentionally avoiding SNAP at this time.So, where does yesterday's IPO place SNAP relative to its closest peer in the social networking space? (We're not convinced SNAP is a camera company.)Comparing market cap to revenue for SNAP and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) highlights one of our concerns with SNAP: valuation. SNAP's 2016 revenue represents only 1.41% of its $28.4b post-IPO market cap. In comparison, FB's 2016 revenue weighs in at 6.45% of its $400.7b market cap. Granted, FB is a considerably more mature, and diverse, firm than SNAP. But - and here's the important part - they are both competing for a finite pool of advertising dollars for the younger generation of social users.Snap Analyst RatingsPivotal Research initiated SNAP with a Sell, and a price target of $10.Nomura initiated SNAP with a rating of Reduce.Atlantic Equities and Susquehanna both initiated SNAP with a Neutral, which we agree with.A Strategic Investment for Snap?NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast (NYSE:CMSA), is reported (by CNBC, which is also owned by CMSA) to have taken a $500m position in SNAP through the IPO, with a pledge to hold the shares at least one year. Other strategic investors in SNAP include Alibaba and Tencent (TCTZD). NBCUniversal has history with SNAP, particularly in the area of reworked content for delivery through Snapchat.We're not sure of the strategic value given the lack of shareholder rights afforded to SNAP shareholders, but it is an interesting move for a media company looking to migrate its audience from the TV to the mobile device. Note that 50 million shares of the IPO ($850m) appear to have been allocated to investors agreeing to this lockup period (which will help minimize volatility in the near term).The dynamics behind large IPO allocations are always interesting, and we look forward to SEC filings including SNAP's 10-Q and high-profile 13-Fs to see who else besides NBC has put their money on yellow.Now to the rest of the Non-SNAP universe…Apple Goes Operational on QualcommApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched another lawsuit at Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), this one in the UK, where it asserts QCOM is charging ""royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with."" You can find a good Seeking Alpha source here.More than anything, this reflects our core thesis on AAPL that it has become very focused on the operational aspects of its business and is looking for leverage points to better negotiate with QCOM. Who would have guessed APPL would be playing the Art of the Deal.On another note, we are interested in the possibilities of AAPL's leveraging of curved OLED screen technology in its iPhone 8 (and potentially wearables). However, the big question we have is not whether it will look cool, but rather if it will bring new breakthrough user functionality.AutodeskAutodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK), with one of those ""off cycle"" fiscal years ending January 31, reported its 4Q numbers, including a better-than-expected loss of $170.5m on revenue of $478.8m. The 3-D design company is in the midst of a business model transition, away from perpetual software licenses in favor of a subscription/service model. It's the right thing to do, but it could mean a bit of a rough ride for the next couple of quarters.Lyft Sees an Uber OpportunitySensing blood in the water after a series of management gaffs at rival Uber (NYSE:UBER), the WSJ is reporting Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is looking to raise a half billion new money at a $6-7b valuation. We think the timing is right for Lyft, but we're not sure that Lyft has the same tech-fueled disruptive vision that has driven Uber's growth (which is truly a tech company, rather than merely a ride company).Palo Alto Networks TanksPalo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) reported a solid revenue miss in its 2Q 2017 release, reinforcing our decision to not include PANW in our client portfolio. It posted revenue of $422.6m that was +26.3% Y/Y but $7.12m below estimates. Here's an interesting write-up by Kayode Omotosho on his lack of conviction with PANW.YouTube Finally Goes Over The TopYouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has extended its dive into the consumable content market with the launch of YouTube TV. Unlike its prior efforts, this is a direct attack on the OTT (over the top) cable TV providers, offering a bundle of 40 ""network channels for $35/mo."" The beauty here is the delivery: up to six users/devices (think laptop/mobile) that can stream via Google Cast to the large screen (exactly how my family consumes the majority of its content).Of note, the bundle will include a number of channels that show live sports, including ESPN, ESPN2, and 10 regional sports networks, and YouTube's Chief Business Officer Robert Kyncl stated that about 80% of televised sports events in the US will be available in the offering. Further, as CBS, NBC, and FOX are all included in the bundle, YouTube TV will be able to stream all non-Thursday-night NFL games. The inclusion of live sports, especially the NFL, is a compelling feature that eliminates a major reason why would-be cord cutters have balked thus far.We love this move for GOOG, as it is leveraging its existing tech infrastructure to not only attract more advertising dollars, but to also earn subscription revenue that could make a significant, positive bottom-line impact.________Don't miss an alert or update.

(NYSE:SNAP) appears overpriced on fundamentals. SNAP has approximately 1.39 billion fully diluted shares after coming public, including unexercised stock options and other convertibles. At $24.00 per share, this means the company is valued at $33.6 billion. SNAP raised $3.4 billion for roughly 20% of a company with zero profits and came public at a valuation twice as expensive as Facebook, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FB), and four times more than Twitter, Inc.'s (NYSE:TWTR).The company posted a net loss in fiscal 2016 of $515 million even though revenue increased sevenfold to $404 million. For 2015, revenues were $58 million with a net loss of $372 million. With a $25 billion valuation, SNAP has a price that is 62 times sales, compared to Facebook's 13 times sales.In my opinion, SNAP is essentially a legal dictatorship over the shareholders. Management and its bankers implemented a three-class share structure that allows the founders to retain super-voting shares. Pre-IPO investors' shares would have less voting power and there are no votes at all for the IPO shareholders. This means SNAP shareholders can't submit shareholder proposals, place pressure on the board to fire the CEO, block or approve a takeover offer or merger, or have a say for members of the board.SNAP is structured such that the CEO and founder wields a great deal of power. He can never be fired and the company can spend the money it raises on anything he wants to. This includes making massive political contributions, even though the company has no profits.SNAP came public with no clear-cut director compensation policy. An S-1 filing said the board will adopt a director compensation policy following the IPO, but it's anyone's guess as to what it will be comprised of.In my opinion, the stock will be hot as greedy investors pile in when the stock begins to trade, but this is the worst company you can invest in. Once again, in my opinion, the CEO is openly saying he could care less about investors' rights and has provided none of the real ownership rights our public markets allow. I realize Snapchat is the social media app of choice by teens and twenty-somethings, but with close to $1 billion in losses over the past few years and no profits in sight in the coming years, I have to say ""I'm out.""My primary fundamental criteria for growth stocks are: 1.) Dominant business franchise 2.) Breakthrough technology 3.) Honest, competent management 4.) Insider ownership 5.) Little or no institutional ownership 6.) Excellent products and services 7.) Little or no debt 8.) Substantial profits and cash flows. While several of these criteria are present in SNAP, there are not enough to pique my interest. Should one or more of these criteria change, I might have a different level of interest."
4052071,101665,2017-03-04T09:46:24-05:00,"SNAP has achieved a lot and has a very addictive product, but the valuation is ridiculous given its current stage.The company has strong annual revenue growth, but its gross profit margins are horrible, with no delineated strategy to profitability.Blending three different valuation models, we arrive at a price target of $9 per share, which is roughly a third of the current stock price.We have not heard one compelling bull case for why this stock is a bargain at $30 billion.","Investment Thesis: Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is an amazing business with a very coveted user base. However, the valuation and the risk factors around the business have made this a compelling short opportunity at $27 per share after its post IPO runup. Aside from the crazy valuation, shortened insider lockup period, the cost of sending each snap (COGS) exceeds the revenue the company makes from storing and sending each snap, with the company unable or unwilling to articulate a strategy to change this. During the roadshow video, the company even had a section titled, ""Free Cash Flow"", but the only thing that was mentioned was the business is asset light, with no guidance on how the company will generate free cash flow and when and how much it will be able to generate. We believe without a path to free cash flow generation, and with an enormous valuation, investors should consider shorting the stock as soon as they are able to acquire shares and/or use put options with a year time horizon.Business Description: Snap is a social networking mobile application which allows people to communicate and interact with each other through photos, short videos, and chats. Snap is known for its ""self-destructing"" feature, which deletes photos instantly after they have been viewed. Snap's main revenue source is advertising.Source: Snapchat Wikihow PageSnap continues to introduce new features, introducing its on demand geofilter in July 2014, which allows users to upload pictures and logos to generate their own filter within a specific location. This feature is currently offered in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. These on demand geofilters are usually used during special events like weddings and anniversaries. Depending on the time period and the size of the geofilter, the price can be as low as $5 per day and have a size limit up to 5,000,000 square feet.Source: Snap Mobile ApplicationMergers and Acquisitions Are Core Strategy For Snap:Snap has explained that mergers and acquisitions are a core part of its business strategy, with numerous acquisitions likely to occur over the next 18 months. The company is likely to continue to acquire companies for their technology and/or teams. Some of the notable acquisitions include the company acquiring Bitmoji and Scan Inc. Bitmoji allows users to design and generate cartoon images of themselves and then add them as photos, videos, and conversations. The acquisition of Bitstrips cost Snap $100 million and Bitmoji is still running as an independent application outside Snap. These acquisitions will further dilute investors and are likely to be companies with limited revenue, let alone EBITDA or profit.Source: Company FilingsCompetition: On August 2, 2016, the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-owned photo-sharing app Instagram announced its new feature called Stories, which sounds and works almost the same as Snap's Stories. Instagram's Stories feature allows users to post photos and mini videos as many times as they want without them appearing on the user's profile. Similar to Snap's Stories, Instagram's Stories delete after 24 hours. The main difference between the two apps is Snap's Stories offer special effects and lenses, and Instagram does not. Instagram now offers mostly the same experience but with a broader reach. According to Business Insider, Instagram has about 300 million daily active users, whereas Snap has around 150 million. Based on the research done by AdvertisingAge, Nike (NYSE:NKE) got over 800,000 views on a newly posted Instagram Story versus 66,000 views on Snap's Story. Although Snap has many loyal users, Instagram has a larger user base and captures a bigger portion of the market.Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are the mainstream communication and social networking apps, but when it comes to the actual growth in their posts, Snap has the edge over both of them. According to Olapic, as of 2015, Snap was outpacing Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter at the same 4-year point in their existence. Users like the ephemeral nature of Snap. People now prefer information at their fingertips and tend to spend less time sitting and reading every post on their news feed. Snap did not allow users to upload pictures from their camera roll until late 2016, which made the content feel more original.Financials: Snap has historically posted large losses with a net loss of $514 million for FY 2016. When looking at the revenue breakdown for Snap, we see that 96% of its 2016 revenue comes from advertising. Snap has a significantly higher percentage of advertising revenue to total revenue than the other major social media companies. Even though Snap's revenue is almost all advertising based, it has no significant long-term advertising contracts. Potential long-term clients are not putting money towards Snap due to the uncertainty of whether Snap's ads are effective, while competitors such as Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have established effective advertising models for their clients. The uncertainty is due to the type of ads that Snap is offering. SnapAds are 10-second video advertisements placed through user's stories. The main drawback for advertisers is that these ads can be skipped with a swipe. If a user does not want to watch the ad, they skip it at the cost of the advertiser, not Snap. Additionally, Snap's ability to track users and quantify an advertisement's effectiveness is questionable given the limited data it stores on users relative to Facebook.Snap also has to spend an enormous amount of capital on bandwidth, evidenced by its Google cloud platform license agreement. On January 30, 2017, Snap entered a five-year agreement with Google where it's required to purchase at least $400 million of cloud services from Google every year. A major covenant related to this agreement is that in the event Snap does not reach the $400 million yearly minimum, it's required to pay the difference to Google. Snap only recorded $404 million in revenue for 2016 and this contract will severely limit any gross profit going forward. Snap is one of the only public companies of its size which does not even have positive gross margins, which is likely to continue in the coming quarters. Snap stated it also has a major contract with AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN). It has committed $1 billion over the next five years for the same service Google is offering. Amazon Web Services is redundant infrastructure for Snap given the Google deal structure. It will be paying $600 million just to run its service and this is before any other business expenses, including sales and marketing and research and development. Free cash flow has also declined significantly and does not have a bright outlook. In 2016, free cash flow declined to negative $677 million, a decrease from 2015's negative $325 million. While a negative free cash flow can indicate investments with a high return, we do not see this as the case for Snap. Source: Snap Inc. S-1Source: Bloomberg ArticleManagement: Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy will still control Snap due to them having the majority of the voting stock. We believe that the founders are going to sell a good amount of their ownership in the coming months while still maintaining enough to give them control over major decisions. In 2013, after raising $60 million from investors, each Snapchat founder reportedly also swapped $10 million of stock for cash. Other startups that have done this strategy, including Zynga, Groupon and Foursquare, have had poor stock performance since these transactions.Valuation: When doing our valuation of Snap, we used three different valuation models to help find the intrinsic value of the company. The models that we used were comparable company analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, and comparable value per user. We felt these models help provide the most accurate valuations for Snap since they take into account the industry valuations and Snap's potential growth. Since we are using 3 different models, we blended the 3 prices together to get a price target of $9.For our discounted cash flow, we used very aggressive growth assumptions in order to value SNAP. When looking at its gross profit margin we forecasted major improvements, similar to that of Facebook. As of fiscal year 2016, Snap had a gross profit margin of -11%, we forecasted the 2017 gross profit margin to reach 40% and by 2021 to reach 81%. For 2016, Snap reported net income of negative $514 million and a net margin of -127%. We forecast that the margin will shrink to -30% in 2017 and improve by 2021 to reach 22%.The weighted average cost of capital was determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Due to Snap not having a trading history, we used the average of its competitors' beta. From this, we came to a beta of 1.1. We used a risk-free rate of 1.4% which was taken from the S-1 filing. To find risk premium, we used the S&P 500 index return of 9.8% and the ten-year treasury bill rate of 2.3%. To find the premium, we subtracted the ten-year rate from the S&P 500 return to get a risk premium of 7.5%. Using the CAPM formula, we derived a cost of equity of 9.7%. The 1.7% cost of debt was taken from the interest rate on the notes Snap has issued. Using a terminal growth rate of 3% and the WACC of 9.6%, we came to a share price value of $9, indicating substantial downside (note the low discount rate still resulting in a very low share price relative to recent trading).A major driving point of Snap's S-1 filing is its Daily Active Users and Daily Active User growth. For this reason, we looked at the active user base for its competitors (note DAU was not available for competitors). For this, we used market cap and divided it by the monthly user base in order to find the value of Snap's users. We looked at competitors with major user bases, as well as individual apps with smaller user bases, both with high engagement. Based on the value per user method, we arrived at a $14 per share price target.Source: JGR Capital Partner's AnalysisSource: Facebook and SNAP Corporate FilingsIn order to value Snap, we did a comparable company analysis. We decided to compare Snap to GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Twitter, Facebook and Google. When deciding which companies to select, we looked at their main product, as well as the business they operate within. Snap is considered a major social media company that is why we compared it to Twitter, Facebook, and Google. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, Snap focuses on the fast timeline model where you can only see ""posts (pictures)"" for up to 24 hours while other companies focus on rolling timeline, where you can see past posts. Netflix is one of the leaders in streaming content, with a major following on mobile devices. Snap is a ""camera company"", so GoPro is a perfect comparable company with its similar social media focus. Snap's recent launch of Spectacles directly competes with GoPro's first person camera. Looking at quarterly revenue growth for SNAP, it is significantly higher than its competitors and most likely will be unable to maintain this level. It is currently 15 times the average growth of its competitors, which have significantly more history behind their quarterly revenue growth. Our comparable company analysis found that Snapchat should be valued at $4 per share when using peer multiples. We used a blended price target, placing greater weight on the discounted cash flow given the company's new business model and high growth, and arrived at a price target of $9. We note this is relatively in line with the lower sell side price target of $10, which Pivotal Research recently used.Source: JGR Capital Partners AnalysisStock Restrictions: Snap has offered 200 million Class A shares in its IPO. There are two types of Class A shares that were offered in this IPO. 50 million of these Class A shares have a lockup clause which restrict holders from selling their stock for one year and the other 150 million shares are unrestricted shares. Employees of Snapchat have a better structure than Class A holders since they can sell their position after 150 days. This restricted period is shorter than the usual 180 days and, in our view, might reflect insiders' high interest in taking profits at these elevated levels. This gives the employees a significant advantage over the restricted new investors. Snap also gives new shareholders no voting rights, which limits investors' ability to influence the business' direction, as opposed to being a shareholder at most public companies.Risk Factors: In the short term, the main risk factor for shorts is that the momentum driven long investors drive up shares to absurd levels; however, shares will pull back over the next 12 months in our view. The main long-term risk is that the company is acquired for some ridiculous valuation. From our acquisition screen, no technology company has been acquired in recent history above $30 billion, with the LinkedIn-Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquisition even occurring at levels below where SNAP trades, thus we view an acquisition at a premium to current levels as highly unlikely.Conclusion: Overall, we see Snap as a compelling short opportunity trading around $27 per share. Snap has a valuation which prices in all its growth and then some and is likely momentum driven rather than for any fundamental reason. With negative gross margins and billions locked in for cloud storage and no plan to generate meaningful free cash flow, we see this as one of our high conviction short ideas."
4051521,24849,2017-03-02T12:38:34-05:00,Shares surge nearly 50% after going public.Valuation more than 3 times that of Twitter.Cash burn and slowing user growth will hurt in coming quarters.,"Thursday's biggest winner so far is a company in its first day of trade, camera company Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Shares have surged nearly 50% at this point, even after the IPO was priced above the high end of the indicated range. With a move like this, investors should be very careful, especially given some troubling metrics.I read through the amended S-1 statement, and the first thing that needs examination is user growth. The company currently has about half the users of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), yet Snap shares currently trade for more than three times what Twitter does. The chart below, taken from the S-1, shows a recent history of Snap's user growth.While the percentage growth numbers look impressive, what will investors think as the increases come down? The company had a tremendous start to 2016, adding 36 million average daily users in the first half. That makes for a tough comparison in the first half of 2017. To get to 30% year-over-year growth by the end of Q2 2017, a rate well below the most recent quarters, Snap needs almost 186 million quarterly average daily users. That's an increase of nearly 28 million, nearly double what was seen in the back half of 2016. Again, that's to get to 30% growth, less than half the percentage increase seen in Q2 2016.The other thing that worries me, and is certainly one reason why the company has gone public, is the cash burn at this company. While revenues in 2016 soared to $404 million from $59 million in 2015, the net loss rose from $373 million to $515 million. Snap management has stated that it doesn't know how soon, if ever, it can become profitable. Large losses have resulted in a lot of cash burn, as the graphic from the S-1 below shows. This doesn't include cash used for acquisitions either.That's more than $1 billion of cash burn in the past two years. Even though Twitter is losing money as well, it still generated almost $150 million of free cash flow in 2016, and was positive in 2015 as well. Industry giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) kicked off more than $11.6 billion in free cash flow last year and continues to grow that amount.So when you have slowing user growth and poor cash flow, a valuation more than 3 times that of Twitter definitely worries me. Twitter had a roaring debut when it went public, and investors that bought then are sitting with large losses now. As Snap's numbers get digested over the next few quarters, I think investors will fade this stock a bit, so this initial surge definitely worries me."
4051780,102432,2017-03-03T05:01:40-05:00,"Looking at Snapchat's current platform and how it differs from what other social media advertising platforms offer.Is this time really different - a tale of recent broken IPOs with much hype but little substance.Short-term buzz and bullish sentiment could send Snap much higher, but long term, it looks set up to disappoint.","Despite the seemingly overall negative tone taken towards Snap Inc., (NYSE:SNAP) and its recent IPO, demand for shares has surged sending the price up 40%+ on its opening day. Those buying in are hoping to be a part of the next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) perhaps, but if you've ever used the Snapchat app, you should be able to tell right away there are significant differences between the platforms and integration of advertisements, which is how all these companies generate most of their revenues. We'll take a look at those differences below, along with a look back at some recent IPOs that may indicate what's to come in the near future.What is Snap?Today, it calls itself a camera company that empowers people to have fun and live in the moment, but not that long ago, it was Picaboo, an idea of an app to send pics of ""fun stuff"" to friends.(Source: Business Insider)Snap's first and main product is the app everyone knows by now - Snapchat. It's been the hot trending social media app of the last 5 years, which in a nutshell lets users send and receive photos, videos, and text messages with friends. It was a hit because of the timers for photos and videos, along with self deleting message histories, letting users send content to friends that they otherwise would likely never upload onto something like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Since we're here today sitting on a market cap north of $28 billion, it seems like that feature is quite popular to say the least. From its design, it definitely filled a void that the before mentioned social media companies didn't fill when it came to sharing content and not worrying about who saw it. With the app, you choose who to send your photos/videos to, you know that content will be deleted when the 10 second or less timer is up, and you don't need to worry about it being seen by unintended others. Sure the app has a story feature which allows you to upload a picture or video that's available for all your friends to view as many times as they like, but that too is limited to 24 hours and only to your friends. There is no ability to share content uploaded by others on the app. Everything stays within your contact list (unless you choose to make your content public, but I have only seen that being used by celebrity accounts). This is drastically different from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which have news feed style home screens that show what your friends are up to, what they liked and shared, and give users easy access to content from all sorts of individuals and companies that your friends are engaged with. Items uploaded on those platforms can go public very easily, which is good from a viral advertising and promotional point of view, but bad from an uninhibited ""fun moment"" sharing point of view which Snapchat is geared towards.These differences work well for Snapchat because they reduce the second guessing nature of users who want to share content that might seem mundane or questionable on other social media platforms. That reduction in inhibition to share a moment or video drive daily usage and engagement within the app. Coupled with the more recent addition of filters and geo location tags, it catered to the need many feel to share multiple aspects of their day to day lives with friends.(Source: Snap)Taken together, it was a good idea and is no doubt fun to use, making it quite sticky once friends are on it. Added to this is the uptake of celebrities who use it on a daily basis. Snapchat gave the average user a view into the daily lives of their favorite publicly known figures, and it gave these figures another channel to grow an audience and promote their brands.On the side of all this is the recent hardware goals that Snap is planning in order to diversify its brand as more than just a single app. First was spectacles, selling for $129.99 currently, which are sunglasses with a built-in camera that link to your phone and the Snapchat app, allowing a user to take videos and pictures from their point of view while wearing the glasses. Next are plans for drones to take pictures/video with, according to several sources. Both are fun thoughts, but are questionable when it comes to serious revenue generation for the long term.Does Snapchat Have a Moat?Those buying in have to consider whether there is anything truly unique to Snapchat that can't be replicated by its competitors. It's already quite widely known that the idea of filters and short video stories has been copied by Facebook on their Messenger app, and Instagram with its recent stories feature. Both additions allow messenger and Instagram users to create similar style content as that on Snapchat. An interesting note is since the introduction of stories on Instagram, Snapchat user growth and engagement in Snapchat story views has declined. This shouldn't be a surprise, since although Facebook may be losing popularity among millennials and younger generations, Instagram definitely isn't, and anything that Instagram can do to replicate Snapchat's features will drive usage time away from Snapchat. This will be an important factor to keep track of going forward, as it should be expected that any new feature Snapchat unveils will be quickly implemented on competing platforms which currently have much larger user bases and established markets.When looking at the user experience next, it's quite different from what Facebook offers, chiefly due to the lack of a desktop platform and productivity features. Although Facebook started out as a plain social media company that allowed you to connect with old friends, it quickly morphed into a source of news, productivity, replaced the need for private websites for many small businesses, and became the go-to event planning application. All these features give Facebook its current moat and stickiness factor, as well as attracting a user base from every age group. Another similar success story was LinkedIn, which may have started out as a professional version of Facebook for business relationships, but ended up being a new way to recruit, find jobs, and recently take courses and grow a skill set. All the other social media apps also allow a much greater level of engagement between users, with long standing public content being the vehicle through which individuals and companies spread their message.The focus on younger generations is a plus to Snapchat since it has succeeded in engaging them, but it also limits the growth potential in its user base. As was pointed out in an earlier article on the company, Snapchat has likely already captured upwards of ~70% of individuals in the US in its key demographic group of 18-24 year olds. That puts a limit on the growth rate going forward unless management finds a way to get older individuals on their app, or pushes its brand into foreign countries.Advertising On SnapchatWhen comparing the app to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, it seems like Snapchat's user interface is not as well suited to the presentation of advertisements to its users. At the moment, ads pop up in between views of stories your contacts have uploaded, and advertisers have an entire section on the app called Discover where their content is hosted. However, this content has to be voluntarily accessed by navigating to that part of the app. You can send and view private messages sent by friends without ever seeing an ad, which is quite different from how other social media platforms interlay advertisements into your news feeds and side columns. I assume this is likely to change in the future, as the app must become more revenue focused, now that it has gone public, but for now it trails behind its more ad-friendly competition.HardwareThe recent launch of spectacles, and plans for potential drones to help take pictures and video seem more gimmick than opportunity for solid revenue generation. I wouldn't count out the possibility of rapid initial interest in their products, similar to what GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) experienced at its start, but I see similar problems in the longer term with the sustainability of selling fancy cameras to grow as a business. It's a fun addition, but the main product here will be Snapchat and its ability to bring in advertising dollars.A Tale of Recent IPO SetbacksAs I'm sure most know by now, buying in at the time of an IPO is a quick way to lose money due to excessive hype and stock promotion by associated financial institutions that drive up the price short term. The promise of the next big thing gives many the sense of not wanting to miss out should the hype be real. However, you only have to look back at the last few years to see how similarly hyped and ""revolutionary"" companies have performed since their IPOs.GoPro saw a 100%+ return in less than a year since its IPO, it was supposed to revolutionize the camera industry, but its story fell flat a year later. Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) was looking to change the fitness space with its wearable health tracking devices, which gained popularity briefly and like GoPro saw their success become short lived. These hardware-focused firms should give caution as to whether Snap's cameras have any long-term sustainability.Moving onto a recent tech example, we of course have Twitter, which like Snapchat, was a unique and fun way to get a short message across to your friends and followers when it launched. It failed to really develop itself as anything more than a public messaging app however, and as a result, did not sustain the type of growth that Facebook has. From the sounds of it, Snapchat aims to stay a simple, and fun way to send content between friends. Rather than develop functionality within the app, Snap is looking to diversify via hardware, which is an interesting path forward, but has a poor track record of working out as of late.Future OutlookSnap is still quite early in its development and has plenty of time, and now money, to revamp its growth plans going forward. However, from what is currently being showcased, a photo/video messaging app with some compatible photo-taking hardware is not something that signals real innovation or moat worthiness. Being the fresh new stock to hit the market with a huge following is likely to see shares continue to appreciate for the next couple of months, but unless Snap can avoid the problems Fitbit and GoPro ran into with their hardware along with the lack of real usefulness Twitter encountered as it lost growth, it looks set up to disappoint."

4051457,102628,2017-03-02T10:05:21-05:00,"Snap, Inc. is about to enter the market in the most hyped tech IPO of the past few years.We like Snap’s leveraging of tech (software AND hardware), its trendsetting ability, and its management team.We have serious questions regarding its current business model, user/rev growth rates, and demographic saturation in the US.We’re not convinced SNAP can achieve the breakout growth it needs in the short term to justify its inflated valuation.We anticipate post-IPO volatility given pent-up demand and the small float, and have no plans to snap up Snap during its initial public period.","Contributing Authors: Fred McClimans, John Freeman, Zach Mitchell.Snap, Inc. (Pending:SNAP) is reportedly set to IPO between $17-$18 a share, up from the $14-$16 range it was marketed at in early February. If SNAP is anything like other social-focused IPOs, there will be just two simple metrics used to measure its post-IPO success: new user growth and advertising revenue. Everything else, from management to competitive positioning, must be judged in this context, at least over the short term.To better understand SNAP, we've evaluated the ""camera company"" (as they have labeled themselves) against our Samadhi Fundy Indexes, which we use as a framework to better understand all companies in our Samadhi Capital client portfolios, as well as those, like SNAP, on our watch list.MLX (Moore's Law Index)We consider the degree with which we believe SNAP can add value from future Moore's Law-driven increases in computing performance, memory, storage, and network throughput (i.e., leveraging technology's exponential y/y advances).Pro: In the case of SNAP, it's not about creating tech but leveraging tech, which it has done fairly well by continually developing sticky new features. Chief among these have been videos, stories (a string of photos/videos that last for precisely 24 hours), lenses and filters (which allow users to overlay funny or flattering graphics over their photos), Discover (showcased content from a select handful of advertisers), group messaging, and hardware integration (namely Spectacles).SNAP's frequent updates have steadily established the company as a trendsetter in social tech. Since usage of Snapchat necessitates a strong Internet connection, SNAP's user growth should benefit in underdeveloped countries by advances in Wi-Fi and 4G availability (where it is presently bandwidth-constrained). Perhaps even more promising going forward, 5G deployments in developed markets, likely to be economical in smartphones within two Moore's Law cycles (4-5 years), hold the potential for the manipulating of and/or otherwise adding more value to picture and video content that can be more easily transmitted over 5G but is still challenging with 4G speeds.Con: SNAP is not doing anything special here. Yes, ongoing incremental upgrades to features have generated attention from new demographics and, consequently, user growth, but we consider most of SNAP's updates to be gimmicky and, ultimately, incapable of generating long-lasting earnings growth. The bottom line is that we don't believe that SNAP is taking any greater advantage of Moore's Law-driven processor/memory/storage/throughput improvements than other social networks, messaging apps, etc.We rate SNAP's leveraging of technology a 7 out of 10.SMX (Samadhi Management Index)We consider the SNAP management team in areas such as strategy, execution, and transparency.Pro: From an overall vision and strategy perspective, we believe SNAP's management is spot on. It has been able to stay on the leading edge of the social media curve and has continually set new trends since its inception - a particularly admirable achievement, given the notorious fickleness of the demographics most active and interested in social media. In the process, SNAP transformed itself from a niche/novelty application to an increasingly mainstream platform that even the most traditional media brands have shown interest in and have been forced to pay attention to.Management's own stated goal is to ""make people happy"" when they use the service, and make its products a place where the users connects with the ""seven most important people"" in their lives. It may seem minor, but this type of disciplined approach is increasingly rare in the digital world where more eyeballs are generally considered better eyeballs.Con: The difference between running a private company and a post-IPO company is extreme - just ask the management team at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). SNAP's executives are clearly talented, but still green on what it takes to be a completely transparent publicly traded company. Achieving profitability - or anything close to it - has also eluded management thus far, despite notable top line growth.We're also not sure the distributed ""beach-side"" corporate office structure (which appears a bit ""lifestyle"" focused) is ultimately stable enough to fuel fast growth in a very quick-moving, and competitive, market. SNAP grew its employee count by 210% in 2016, and has already begun snapping up larger, yet distributed, office space through the Venice Beach area.Yes, the management culture is innovative and attracts talent, but even the company itself highlights the shortcomings and risks of this model (they highlight issues of talent in the S1, but we're not sure risks don't also include execution as intra-team interaction becomes increasingly difficult).Going back to SNAP's ""happiness"" theme (a point reinforced by what we call the ""silly factor"" of Snapchat), while this worked well for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) with its Happiness Factory campaign, here it runs a risk of turning off older users, a demographic it desperately needs to support as its younger users age up.We rate SNAP's management team an 8 out of 10.CMX (Competitive Market Index)We consider the type, strength, and sustainability of SNAP's competitive advantages, including talent, technology, and competitive differentiation.Pro: From a cultural and target market perspective, SNAP is clearly differentiated against other social networking companies. It is clearly NOT TWTR (nor the now comatose Google+). Its ""self-destructing"" message feature is the antithesis of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and it is a universe apart from LinkedIn (or any type of enterprise/business app). It has great talent on board (from executive to dev), and has demonstrated that it can create (and maintain) a unique ""cultural aspect"" to its offerings that do offer some level of market protection (SNAP is significantly stronger in the younger demographics).SNAP's user base is incredibly active, and desired by advertisers.We also believe that SNAP's recent shift towards features, such as Live Stories, that enable multi-perspective engagement will further broaden its stickiness with users (over 60% of SNAP ads are watched with sound, a point that we believe greatly increases engagement and, ultimately, brand awareness and conversion).SNAP's monetization scheme is based on leveraging its sticky user base in four areas: Ad Products, Ad Delivery, Measurement, and Sales Channels.Con: SNAP is one of the more vulnerable companies we've seen of late from a competitive perspective. Yes, it has great talent, but that talent is quickly becoming commoditized as the ""uniqueness factor"" of software development gives way to the realities of ongoing software operations. Its tech infrastructure, while solidly in the cloud, performs extremely well but doesn't appear to have any unique special sauce that can't be replicated elsewhere.Further, as we recently wrote in Facebook Slaps at Snap's IPO, FB has been able to replicate several of Snapchat's features on a significantly larger scale (and to a much larger audience) across its social media platforms, and FB has also had considerably more success monetizing its user base (although in the higher age brackets above SNAP's core demographic). While we admire SNAP's demonstrated ability to trend set, the often-gimmicky nature of its new features and the inability to turn innovations into bottom line growth lead us to temper our praise.Today, SNAP's user base, activity, and features aren't wildly differentiated or more easily monetized when compared to FB (or FB's Instagram and WhatsApp offerings). In fact, FB's WhatsApp (with 1.2b monthly active users and +20% y/y growth), recently launched Snapchat-like features including overlaid drawing, captions, and emojis. FB's Instagram recently launched a Snapchat-like ""stories"" feature (for pictures and video), while its Messenger service has driven hard into the commerce and marketplace segments).We rate SNAP's competitive position a 6.5 out of 10.BMX (Business Model Index)We consider SNAP's means of production, revenue generation, and bottom line efficiency (again, it's all about users and advertising while controlling costs).Pro: We like models that can achieve operating leverage fast, and SNAP's SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) model provides exactly that. As the company grows, we'd expect to see a series of semi-inflection points, where the company takes advantage of its infrastructure and accumulated user behavioral data to open new revenue streams and achieve greater operating leverage.Con: While we like the core business model, we're concerned about the slice of the TAM (total addressable market) that SNAP can lock up and continue to grow against FB (and other to-be-developed, social apps). We're also not convinced that SNAP's business model is unique enough to maintain a competitive edge, nor are we convinced the company can expand into adjacent market opportunities that readily given its focused user base.When we look at the financials of SNAP, the picture doesn't look as robust as the core business model would indicate. SNAP has managed to increase its revenue (generating $404m in FY2016), but it continued to run deeper into the red, with $514m in losses.*Calculated by dividing FY16 revenue and earnings by DAUsUnlike FB, which helped launch the social networking market, SNAP is entering an already crowded market and does not have the luxury of slowly growing its revenue per daily active user. Its present $2.56 ARPU (average revenue per use) is still low, and we have doubts as to the size of the addressable market (given SNAP's current demographic focus) coupled with the lack of attack vectors (mobile only, single app only at this time).SNAP must quickly demonstrate it can provide a better ROI for its advertising clients, something we consider possible, but challenging in the near-term (our own informal queries to Snapchat users and advertisers have convinced us that FB is the more popular ROI monster in this market).We rate SNAP's business model a 6.5 out of 10.Eight Other ConsiderationsThere are a few other factors that have us concerned about the SNAP IPO.1) Demographic Challenges. We love the stickiness factor of Snapchat, and its solid grip on its target demographic. But that grip is perhaps too tight. SNAP states that the majority of its users are in the 13-34 year old range. But how big is that pool, and how saturated is it today?According to SNAP, around 36% of its daily average users in the US (its primary market today) are in the 18-24 year old demographic. Based on 69m North American daily average users, of which we estimate 62.1m are in the US, that works out to roughly 22.36m users between the ages of 18 and 24 - or 71% of the entire US population between those ages. That's an incredibly high saturation rate, which means that advertising growth (in the US) has to primarily come from increased advertising spend per user, and not additional user growth.Its second largest segment in the US is the 25-34 year old bracket, which accounts for 27% of its US user base. Moving to the up-and-coming bracket, 13-17 year olds, that only accounts for 22% of its US user base. Here's the troubling part (for a firm that is primarily targeting the younger generation): the younger user in the US is a declining demographic.2) Contextual Data. From a market perspective, we are cautious about the ""private"" nature of SNAP's appeal and its focus on the millennial segment. SNAP's initial selling point was its privacy: Users create and share personal moments that automatically disappear after they've been viewed. At the time, it was a singularly unique feature, and it appealed to those younger users who were looking at a way to communicate but potentially not remember (or be held accountable for) what they were sending to others. It was a more robust, and fun, form of Instant Messaging (SMS, Text, etc.).But that privacy-first focus (as well as its ""seven most important people"" approach) also limits discovery within SNAP's network. Finding new friends (and expanding the context-rich data available by an ever-growing social graph) is inherently more difficult than on other ""open/public"" social networks (such as TWTR and FB), and yields a far narrower range of advertising demographics. We feel this lack of discoverability (even as SNAP aggressively moves to expand its target demographic) is still a limiting factor on growth.3) Voting Rights. There are none. In a bold move, SNAP is issuing non-voting shares for its IPO. The only close analogy that comes to mind is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which created two classes of publicly traded shares with different voting rights. In the case of SNAP, this will help protect the firm against activist investors, but it also brings to mind ultimate issues of control and the ""lifestyle"" nature of the firm.4) Limited Float. SNAP is offering only 12% percent of the firm in this initial offering, and while that can help drive up interest in the equity, it can also be viewed as a ""we need max cash now"" approach that can also bring with it a great deal of beta moving forward (note: FB's initial float was ~18%).5) Limited Alternatives. SNAP is coming to market at a point in time where investors are hungry to participate in the ""social"" market but have increasingly few options. This level of interest could result in any positive earnings results being viewed overly optimistically, resulting in initially inflated values (and we're all about long-term growth).6) Valuation. SNAP's suggested pricing places it at a 50-60x trailing revenue valuation, significantly higher than FB (at 14.0x) and TWTR (at 4.5x) today. Further, both FB and TWTR had significantly lower valuation ratios at IPO despite having social services that appeals to a much broader (larger) target user base.7) Cloud Commitments. Cash generated from SNAP's IPO is likely to be only slightly higher than its five-year commitments to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), $1b, and Google, $2b, for cloud-based infrastructure (note: SNAP has stated it may additionally pursue building out its own infrastructure).8) Drones. Word is circulating in the media that SNAP has (or is) experimenting with drones, a potential add-on to its Snaptacles hardware line. Putting aside the many trials and tribulations of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), we actually believe this could be a viable extension of the SNAP brand, particularly if it focuses on smaller, low-cost ""party favor"" type devices that feed off the personal and happiness factors of SNAP's ""camera"" users (and avoids the larger, commercial drone market entirely). However, at this point, the issue of drones is more representative of the larger question of ""what's next"" for SNAP, a question for which we do not have an answer at this point.Bottom LineWe believe SNAP has the building blocks to grow its user base and advertising revenue, and admire how SNAP has been able to trend-set in a hyper-competitive social media space, turning heads in the process and often forcing competitors to scramble and catch up. Further, we are not dismissing the possibility of a post-IPO run, as SNAP's model, while far from proven at this point, could result in relatively moderate ad-revenue growth that would appeal to investors fixated on a ""FB alternative"" (particularly now that TWTR is, well, TWTR). We're also intrigued by the blend of low-cost commodity hardware as a mechanism to encourage user engagement.At this time, however, we're not convinced that SNAP can achieve the breakout growth in new users and advertising revenue necessary to justify its inflated valuation. SNAP's lofty P/S, in addition to the enormous magnitude and probability of downside cases, have led us to pass on taking a position at this time. We will instead keep an eye on SNAP's post-IPO performance (both financial and management) for reevaluation later this year_____________For additional information or to sign up for our email alerts, please visit SamadhiPartners.com."
4051152,24157,2017-03-01T15:51:50-05:00,"Is the market so hungry for another tech IPO that it will overlook the dismal fundamentals and nosebleed valuation of SNAP?Snap has generated enough interest from investors to price its IPO at $17-18/share.There is a big disconnect between the current valuation and the fundamentals, and this disconnect makes Snap a very risky investment.","When Snap (NYSE:SNAP) first filed for IPO, there was a lot of negative hype, and the original $25 billion valuation quickly fell to $22.5 billion. Is the market so hungry for another tech IPO that it will overlook the dismal fundamentals and nosebleed valuation of SNAP?As we noted in early February, when we placed Snap in the Danger Zone, its fundamentals are similar to prior Danger Zone pick Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and not remotely close to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Nevertheless, when you crunch the numbers of Snap's valuation, there is a big disconnect between the current valuation and the fundamentals, and this disconnect makes it a very risky investment.Pressure to Lower Valuation DisappearedSnap's S-1 revealed large issues in the firm's business model, including major cash losses. With the filing in hand, it made sense for the market to lower expectations and pressure Snap to drop its expected IPO price range. Snap obliged, and its amended S-1 valued the firm at $22.5 billion, down from the expected $25 billion.Unfortunately, this rational thinking by the market didn't last long. According to CNBC, Snap has generated enough interest from investors to price its IPO at $17-18/share, above the initial range, and open trading at the previously expected $25 billion valuation.Snap's Secret? Major Cash LossesPer Figure 1, Snap's net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) fell from -$344 million in 2015 to -$498 million in 2016. Meanwhile, revenue grew from $59 million to $404 million, or 590% over the same time.Figure 1: SNAP's Profitless Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC, and company filingsSnap has a highly negative NOPAT margin of -123% and a bottom-quintile return on invested capital (ROIC) of -34%. Snap's expense level and growth rate are a concern. In 2016, the company's cost of revenue was actually greater than its overall revenue. No matter how many users Snap touts or how fast those users are growing, it's clear the current business model is no Facebook model.Even Non-GAAP Metrics Can't Hide LossesNon-GAAP metrics are a red flag for investors because they often mask the true economics of the business. Snap uses adjusted EBITDA in its S-1, but even non-GAAP metrics cannot mask the large losses of the firm. The largest item removed from adjusted EBITDA is stock-based compensation expense. Snap removed $73 million (124% of 2015 revenue) and $32 million (8% of 2016 revenue) in stock-based compensation expense in 2015 and 2016 respectively.Even after this adjustment, Snap's adjusted EBITDA was -$459 million in 2016 compared to -$515 million GAAP net income. Nevertheless, we warn investors against trusting that metric even if it does turn positive at some point in the future.Competition From Social Media Giants Make Future Profits Less LikelySnap's management likes to pitch the company as the next Facebook, but we think becoming the new Facebook is easier said than done. Claiming to be the next Facebook is a great way to sell your valuation. In reality, Snap is the next Facebook competitor, which has proven to be fatal for many businesses.Despite Snap's claims to be a camera company, the firm's heavy reliance on advertising dollars (96% of 2016 revenue) pits it against some of the largest media/Internet firms in the market. Specifically, Snap faces competition from Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Twitter, and, if Snap is truly a camera company, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). Per Figure 2, Snap's -123% NOPAT margin places it well below its main competitors.Figure 2: Snap's Negative Profitability Lags All CompetitionSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsIn addition to operating with drastically lower margins, Snap faces an uphill battle in regards to its user base, aka daily active users (DAUs). This calculation avoids easy comparison to previous Danger Zone pick Twitter, which discloses monthly active users but not individual DAUs. However, Bloomberg estimates that as of Q3 2016, Twitter had 136 million DAUs.Facebook uses DAU to measure its user base, and it dwarfs Snap and Twitter, per Figure 3. Facebook's daily active users reached 1.17 billion in Q3 2016 compared to just 153 million for Snap. Through Q4 2016, Facebook's DAUs have grown to 1.22 billion and Snap's have grown to 158 million. It's worth noting that Facebook reported 526 million DAUs in the last quarter before it went public. Is Snap more like Twitter rather than Facebook? It would appear Snap shares more similarities with the former than management would like to admit.Figure 3: Snap's DAUs Closer To Twitter Than Facebook* Twitter DAUs taken from Bloomberg estimate in June 2016Sources: New Constructs, LLC, Bloomberg, and company filingsWant More Risk? Valuation Already Pricing In That Snap Is The Next FacebookInvestors are always looking for the next Google or next Apple. In other words, they're looking for a firm that will disrupt an existing market and greatly reward shareholders along the way as stock prices soar. In Snap's case, the stock's valuation already assumes the company will be the next Facebook even though Facebook hands down is the most successful social media company of all time.The comparisons to Facebook make some sense. Snap and Facebook each compete for user engagement and must find ways to monetize those users. Furthermore, with Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, the firms compete directly in the ""photo-capture"" aspects of mobile applications and social media. The comparisons stop there.First, when Facebook went public, it was a profitable firm. In 2012, Facebook's NOPAT was $1.1 billion and the company achieved a 21% NOPAT margin. Since then, Facebook has continued to grow its revenue, user base, and improve margins.Second, to become the next Facebook, Snap would ultimately need to take market share from the highly successful incumbent. To take share from Facebook, Snap must either (1) charge advertisers less, (2) provide more value for the same or higher price or (3) both. While option one is certainly viable, as Snap directly controls its product pricing, it does little to improve already negative margins. At the same time, engaging in a pricing war with profitable competitors makes it hard to ever believe Snap can reach breakeven.Option 2, provide more value than Facebook ads, seems unlikely in the near term. In Snap's S-1, the company provides the Advertisers Perceptions' September 2016 Report, which examines advertiser and agency perceptions of different advertising platforms. While Snap ranked first in ""satisfaction rating,"" it ranked fourth in ""Plans to Increase Ad Spend"" behind YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. If Snap plans to provide greater value, it has yet to convince advertisers as they're still choosing competing platforms ahead of Snap.Lastly, and most importantly, SNAP's expected IPO valuation already implies that the firm will grow into the next Facebook. This expectation leaves room for little upside, but a lot of room for failure.How Much Risk? See Exactly What A $25 Billion Valuation ImpliesBelow, we model multiple scenarios for the future cash flows performance baked into a $25 billion valuation.It's also worth noting that each of these scenarios assumes SNAP is able to grow revenue and NOPAT/free cash flow without spending on working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely, but allows us to create very optimistic scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations in the current valuation are. For reference, SNAP's invested capital grew $800 million from 2015 to 2016. It's clear to see that the expectations already embedded in SNAP's valuation are much too high.Over-Hyped IPO Could Set Shares Up For FailureUltimately, Snap's success will be determined by its ability to attract advertising revenue in a highly competitive market. We've seen Twitter fail to monetize its user base while Facebook flourishes. At the same time, Facebook continues to grow its user base while Twitter struggles to maintain its former growth rates. With the hype and attention Snap's IPO is receiving, the firm will be hard pressed to meet or beat such high expectations.As soon as investors get the idea that Snap is more like Twitter than Facebook, we think SNAP's current valuation could crater.Disclosure Red Flags: Investors Have No Say On Important MattersAs an ""emerging growth company,"" Snap is exempt from standard requirements related to executive compensation. These exemptions include holding advisory votes on executive compensation and providing information regarding the ratio of CEO pay compared to compensation of other employees. These minimized disclosure requirements are a red flag for investors, as they reduce transparency into how executives are incentivized.Additionally, the share structure is a disadvantage for IPO investors. After IPO, Snap will have three share classes. The A shares being sold to the public are not entitled to vote on matters submitted to stockholders. Snap is going public and enjoying the benefits of an IPO (influx of cash) while giving away zero voting power to new investors. Instead, the co-founders of Snap and existing private shareholders will retain all voting power in the newly public company.Impact of Footnote Adjustments And Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to the financial statements in Snap's S-1:Income Statement: We made $210 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $167 million in non-operating income (41% of revenue). We removed $188 million related to non-operating income and $22 million related to non-operating expenses. See all the adjustments made to SNAP's income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $696 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $94 million. The most notable adjustment was $299 million (19% of reported net assets) related to operating leases. See all adjustments to SNAP's balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $807 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $807 million. There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was $492 million in outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represents 2% of SNAP's expected market valuation.This article originally published here on March 1, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Kyle Martone receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and StockTwits for real-time alerts on all our research."

4050481,55342,2017-02-28T12:08:09-05:00,"Snap Inc. is likely to go public in two days.The IPO is reportedly oversubscribed.You might want to sell out of the stock, not too long after the IPO.","In all likelihood, we're now just two days away from what promises to be one of the most anticipated tech IPOs in a long time. According to a report by Reuters, the upcoming Snap (NYSE:SNAP) IPO has already been oversubscribed, and that's not surprising. Such has been the eagerness to participate in this IPO, that enthusiastic albeit confused investors erroneously even lapped up shares of Snap Interactive, an unrelated company with a somewhat similar name. Yet, Snap's upcoming IPO has received mixed reviews, and evidently, not everybody is equally convinced about the company's prospects. In our opinion, it won't be surprising at all if Snap manages to bag sizable listing gains when it goes public on 2nd March. However, in the event that Snap shares do soar on debut, it might not be a bad idea to book profits and review this investment option as things unfurl in the coming quarters. Here's why.Is Snap really the next Facebook?We've all been reading about everybody's take on the big question - Is Snap more like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)? Again, opinions are divided, and while some industry observers have highlighted similarities between Snap and Twitter, others have rather vehemently insisted that the maker of Snapchat is more likely to be the next Facebook. One well articulated argument on similar lines comes from Tim Mullaney on MarketWatch. Some of the points Mr. Mullaney makes are very valid. However, there are some stark differences between the two companies, at least based on the state of their businesses prior to their IPOs.For starters, even with its significantly larger user base (Monthly Active Users - MAUs), Facebook recorded sequential growth rates that were better than the ones Snap has recorded in its preceding two quarters. Snapchat's Daily Active User (DAU) base grew by 7% and 3.3% respectively in its latest two quarters, down from 14% and 17% in the first two quarters of 2016. In contrast, Facebook's MAU base grew by 6% and 7% in the two quarters prior to its IPO, on a much larger base. Since Snapchat shares DAU numbers and Facebook declared only MAUs at the time, that's not an apples to apples comparison. But the fact that Facebook's DAU grew by 4% on average in 2016, on a base of over 1 billion DAUs, sufficiently validates the distinction between the two platforms. In terms of popularity, at least.The Facebook IPO was also significantly cheaper at 28 times sales, compared to Snapchat's likely sales multiple of between 48 and 55, depending on whether it's valued at $19.5 billion or $22.2 billion. If anything, Snap's valuations are reminiscent of Twitter's price to sales multiple of ~45. Snap is also markedly different from the two companies when it comes to cash burn. Prior to their IPOs, Twitter and Facebook had free cash flow margins of -10% and -4.7% respectively, both of which look significantly better than Snap's -113.5%. That's not to say that Snap will necessarily go Twitter's way post IPO. However, there isn't enough evidence yet, to suggest that Snap will be the next Facebook.As you take a deeper look at the comparisons, it becomes increasingly evident how much better Facebook really was back then. Yet, we know how the year post IPO panned out for Facebook. Tech IPOs tend to work up a lot of euphoria, but it doesn't always last in the long term, unless valuations are backed by serious performance. Quoting from a post on Reuters:In Snap's case as well, it might not be a bad idea to grab any listing gains that are forthcoming and evaluate the investment option as the narrative unfolds.What Else You Should Know About SnapAt this point, there are some aspects of Snap's business that deserve a mention. The company's stellar top line growth is one of the things that has caught investors' attention, and as things stand, the trend could continue in the coming year or two, at least. Goldman Sachs, one of the lead banks on Snap's IPO expects the company to rake in close to $2 billion in revenue in 2018. That would represent a doubling of revenue over the estimated $1 billion Snap is expected to generate in 2017. That sort of growth is worth highlighting. However, given Snap's current business model, higher engagement, which generates higher revenue, also drives up the cost of revenue. Quoting Snap's Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan:There's a downside to that as Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Gadfly pointed out recently.Snap managed to post a positive gross margin only recently, after recording losses even at a gross level for the first half of 2016. So, it's hard to imagine that Snap will manage to turn a profit anytime soon. And with its free cash flow margin deep in the red, Snap's financials don't inspire much confidence, and there's no easy way to assess how long the proceeds of its IPO ($3.2 billion) will last.On a separate note, it's also worth mentioning that with Snap Ads, Snapchat apparently reports an ad watched, as soon as it loads. Advertisers might eventually want to base their spends on how much of the ad was actually watched, rather than on how many ads were loaded.As most of you already know, losses are still heavy and growing. Coming to user growth, Goldman Sachs estimates that Snap will grow its DAU base to 221 million by 2018. While that sounds pretty good at first, if you do the math, it boils down to under 4.5% sequential growth, on average, every quarter. So, that's not much of an improvement from its growth rate at the moment. And the fact that Facebook continues to mount the pressure by introducing Snapchat like features on Instagram and WhatsApp won't help. In the absence of strong user growth, Snap looks a tad bit undesirable in the medium term. Once the initial post IPO enthusiasm evaporates, the company's shares could potentially lose favor, making it a very risky bet. As Ovide aptly puts it:For those of you who are buying into the IPO, we hope it works out well. For those who aren't, you might get another chance."
4051768,94846,2017-03-03T02:28:03-05:00,Snap made its market debut at New York Stock Exchange.Its closing price was 44% above its initial value of $17.Will Snap go the Twitter way or take the Facebook path?,"Snap (NYSE:SNAP) made its market debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, closing at $24.48 - 44% above its initial value of $17.Last year, The Wall Street Journal had reported that the IPO could value the mega-unicorn at $25 billion or more. The current price puts the company at a market capitalization of $28.3 billion.For many investors, Snap's IPO could resemble the path of either that of Facebook or Twitter. But such comparisons may seem a bit early for mega unicorn, Snap - especially since the IPO market faced a slowdown last year. 2016 had been a quiet year for IPOs, with as many as 105 US companies going public - a decline of 62% from 2014. According to the annual review by Renaissance Capital, US IPOs raised less than $19 billion, a decline of 37% from 2015 and the lowest level since 2003.With such a slowdown, Snap's IPO could revive the IPO optimism and allow investors to gauge at some of the hottest technology stocks. Snap's IPO comes at a time when markets are relying heavily on financial deregulation and tax reforms under the new Trump administration. SPX has already seen a surge of more than 11% since the November 8 elections last year. On Wednesday, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P 500 were seen at record highs.With top investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs involved in Snap's IPO, comparison to companies like Twitter and Facebook are only natural.In 2013, Snap rejected a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook and today, it will be in direct competition with the biggest social media giant. When Facebook first went public in May 2012, it was the largest tech IPO in US history and offered a price of $38 per share, raising $16 billion in that offering.But the stock soon fell as it opened with share prices crashing more than 50% over the following months. Over a period of time, Facebook acquired more than 50 companies including WhatsApp and Messenger and catered to a wider audience with innovative features and user-friendly technology. Through Oculus VR in 2014, Facebook plunged into the arena of Virtual Technology and today, it is the first social network to surpass 1 billion registered accounts, currently sitting at 1.87 billion monthly active users. Its current stock price trades a little more than three times its IPO price.Facebook will prove to be a tough competition for Snap, especially after some new features on its acquired platforms that closely resemble Snap's features. Facebook's WhatsApp recently introduced a feature that allows its users to update their statuses and use pictures or GIFs that vanish after 24 hours. Similarly, Instagram introduced similar story-like features, which could potentially attract Snapchat's daily users.But, for Twitter the story took a different turn.In September 2013, Twitter shares surged more than 80% on its IPO. Due to a high investor demand, the share price of Twitter closed well above its $26 IPO price at $44.90. But today it trades as low as $15.79. The company's value has declined significantly - by more than half from its opening price, and even more from its all-time high near $70. The micro-blogging platform has faced huge challenges over the past few years. It has failed to find potential buyers with major firms like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) rumored to have backed off from closing a deal. Twitter also laid off many workers, reportedly as many as 300 workers in October 2015. Additionally, the number of active users have remained stagnant with as many as 319 million in 2016.Snap's successful IPO may reflect the optimism amongst its engaged audience and its loyal user database of 158 million people. In 2016, the company showed an increase in its revenue from $59 million in 2015 to $404.5 million in 2016.However, a company's good market debut tells very little about the future course of any firm. While Snap has a strong potential to prove itself to tech investors, it also faces competition from established names like Facebook and Google. For it to remain at par, the company will need to add more value in the coming years and prove that it has a business model that can create value for long term investors through its first quarter earnings."
4050941,21136,2017-03-01T09:10:09-05:00,The parent company of Snapchat is set to IPO this week on 3/2.High valuation and several red flags make us hesitant on investing.Snap is slated to be the biggest US tech IPO since Facebook went public in 2012.We look forward to watching it as a signal to potentially other more realistic companies set to go public in 2017.,"SummarySnap Inc. (Pending:SNAP), parent company of messaging app Snapchat, plans to make its much anticipated market debut this Thursday (3/2). Snap Inc. expects to raise $3.0 billion through its offer of 200 million shares at a price range of $14 to $16 per share. Of these shares, 28% will be offered by company insiders, and all will be non-voting shares with the founders maintaining majority voting power.If Snap Inc. prices at the midpoint of its price range, it would command a market cap value of $17.8B and on a fully diluted basis, a market cap of between $21.5B.Although this price range is lower than the original valuation projected, we strongly feel it is still too expensive given the fundamentals. There are also several red flags that make us nervous about investing including: steep competition, slowing user growth rate, non-voting share structure, and the recent sale of $16.2 million shares by the two co-founders, among others.SNAP will list on the NYSE under the ticker, ""SNAP."" Joint bookrunners include: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Allen & Company. Snap also has over twenty other underwriters working on the deal.The deal is currently reported to be multiple times oversubscribed, meaning more fund managers want to buy shares in the IPO than are being issued by Snap. This typically signals that the company will open above, or at the high end of its expected price range.For an in-depth overview of Snap, refer to our previous post.Advertising Market - High Growth, Yet Increasing CompetitionThe International Data Corporation (IDC) projects worldwide advertising will grow from $652B in 2016 to $767B in 2020, with mobile advertising being the fastest growing segment in advertising. In 2016, $66B was spent on mobile advertising, a number that is expected to grow 3x by 2020. This transition from ad spending on TV and desktop to mobile stands to benefit Snapchat's mobile strategy.However, at the same time, Snap faces tough competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (whose subsidiaries include Instagram and WhatsApp), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Line (NYSE:LN). Facebook in particular has shown itself capable to stealing DAUs from Snap by launching similar features.Comparing Snap to Earlier US Tech IPOsTo put Snap's performance in context with some of the big tech IPOs, Fortune compared Snap's projected price to sales ratio to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and found Snap was more expensive than all of them on a price to sales basis (see chart below).(Fortune)Additionally, Snap is growing at a slower rate than both Facebook and Twitter when the two made their market debut. Quarter over quarter growth for Facebook, Twitter, and Snap was 5.7%, 6.9%, and 3.2%, respectively. In terms of DAUs at time of IPO, Facebook had 483M versus Twitter at 100 DAUs, and Snap at 153M DAUs (see below).(SEC Filings)To put Snap's valuation in the context of recent M&A activity, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, a messaging app, in April 2014 for $19B. At the time of the acquisition, WhatsApp had 350M DAUs, almost double compared to the 153M DAUs for Snap.Use of Proceeds and High SpendingIPO proceeds are necessary for Snap to fund both its near-term cash burn as well as to deliver on its commitments to Google Cloud, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, and others. As of December 2016, Snap had 987.3M in cash and cash equivalents, and in just the year 2016, the company reported a net cash outflow of $677.6M. We expect heavy spending to continue in the near term and for the company to continue to report net losses.Snap has committed to spend $1B with Amazon Web Services and $2B with Google Cloud over the next five years.Legal MattersSnap noted in its filing it switched accounting firms from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to Ernst & Young (E&Y) in April 7, 2016. The decision was made after PwC identified material weaknesses in Snap's internal control over financial reporting. E&Y audited Snap's financial statements for the year 2015 and 2016. The decision to switch accounting firms was approved by the board, but may raise questions to investors on why Snap felt it was necessary to make the switch.Accelerating Lock-up PeriodOn Feb 13, Snap announced changes to its lock-up expiration rule to allow employees to sell shares after 150 days (versus 180 days, which was initially listed in its IPO Prospectus). Employees holding standard stock awards are now able to sell shares after 150 days, the same holding period as co-founders and investors.It is rare that most investors be able to sell shares before employees. Therefore the acceleration of the lock-up expiration for employees now puts them and investors on an equal playing field in terms of their opportunity to offload shares. Employees and investors stand to benefit tremendously from the IPO, and may be motivated to being unloading shares as soon as the lock-up period expires.Performance of Past IPOs Suggests Holding OffReuters looked at the largest 25 technology IPOs both globally and in the US and found that during their first year as public companies, these start-ups tend not to perform very well. Globally, shares of the majority of the 25 largest technology IPOs were below their first day closing price one year later, with the median one-year performance being a decline of 22.3%. And looking at US technology IPOs, 14 of the 25 biggest fell in their first year compared to their IPO price.Alibaba, Twitter, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Facebook, and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), all dropped during their first year as public companies. This research suggests investors may be better off by waiting several months before investing in Snap as opposed to attempting to get in at IPO price.Conclusion: Watch For Fun, Stay On The SidelinesWe look forward to watching this deal, given the hype, but recommend investors steer clear.Competition from Facebook, slowing user growth rate, non-voting share structure, and large net losses all make us wary about investing, particularly at the proposed valuation. For us, the risks far outweigh the benefits. For us, Snap is a no-go at its current valuation.**A Signal For Further IPOs**Regardless of whether investors view the Snap IPO as a good investment or not, it will be closely watched as a signal to whether the mainly stagnant IPO market will make a rebound in 2017. Depending on how Snap performs, its IPO could encourage other successful startups, like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (AIRB), to enter the IPO market. Snap's IPO is slated to be the largest US tech IPO since Facebook went public in 2012.Don Dion's IPO Insights provides up-to-date information and analysis on the major IPOs each week, along with additional opportunities to invest and short these stocks at their quiet period and lockup period expirations, respectively.

4048709,66213,2017-02-23T04:23:24-05:00,"Snap filed for an IPO to raise up to $3.2 billion.
        The company still has a long road of expensive growth in order to justify their valuation.
        Investor interest in this IPO may disappear faster than a Snapchat message.","Snap (NYSE:SNAP), which you may know as Snapchat has filed for an IPO to raise up to $3.2 billion. You may also know them as a technology and social media company, however they are self-described as a camera company. Regardless of what they call themselves, I call them not worthy of investors' money. The young company is overvalued with significant risk and huge losses in its future.Their Balance Sheet Is Not a Disaster…. YetIt's not uncommon to see a tech stock hit the market with an upside-down balance sheet - actually, we kind of expect it. Snap, on the other hand, is a different story. They have stockholders' equity of more than $1.5 billion. But give it some time and you'll see that number erode as they need more capital to fund their operations. The company was only founded in 2011 and they have a long road ahead of them. They pulled in just under $405 million in revenue for 2016, which is a huge jump from the $59 million the year prior, but a distance away from growing into their multibillion dollar valuation. As they try to grow their topline, their balance sheet will get hit hard.Source: Snap's S-1There Is No Expectation of ProfitabilityThis is a pure growth play, which means eyes are going to be looking across their topline. Most investors aren't expecting profitability from Snap anytime soon, but rather the opposite; huge losses. To justify the insane valuation, Snap must grow revenues substantially. While Snap saw their sales jump in 2016, they also saw their net loss grow from $373 million to $515 million. And their free cash flow loss was $163 million higher than that for 2016. When a company burns through cash like that it can catch up to them very quickly. Expect heavy money to be thrown into R&D, sales and marketing, and corporate development over the next several years. Continued losses will cause a need for more funding. This is not to say that Snap's investments and expenses can't pay off long-term, however the risk should not be completely ignored.Source: Snap's S-1There Is Plenty of RiskFor the quarter ending December 31, 2016, Snap had 158 million daily active users. There is no question that is an incredible accomplishment, however we have learned through Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) how the inability to grow active users and monetize on them can send a stock plummeting. They must keep their users engaged and provide constant innovation to their base.Another risk lies in their revenue. Currently, their revenue is almost solely advertising. For 2015 and 2016, 98% and 96% of their revenue was from third parties advertising on Snapchat. The lack of diversity in their sales poses another risk to investors. Snap must be able to grow their advertising revenue by heaps and bounds, which will also be affected by growing and sustaining their daily active users.And of course, let us not forget that the offering is for Class A common stock which have no voting rights. That's a smart move because it allows Snap to spread risk without having to give up any control. By maintaining control, they can move some of the risk by onboarding new silent investors without having to listen to what they say. Now they can do what's in their best interest, choose their board of directors, and set their compensation. M&A, asset sale, or any matter submitted to stockholders would be led by co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy.ConclusionI haven't even ripped into the ridiculous $20 billion valuation because it's not necessary. The numbers and risk speak for themselves. Somehow, they are trying to convince investors that the valuation is on the low side, but I don't believe that to be true at all. I think they are worried about getting greedy with this IPO and then completely flopping on its first day of trading. I am not so sure they market is going to treat this IPO as kindly as they may be thinking. At least I know I won't be. This stock is too much of a gamble in its current state and I'd rather try my luck at a hand of blackjack."
4050483,102871,2017-02-28T11:47:11-05:00,"Snapchat's three primary advertising avenues, Snap Ads, Geofilters, and Lenses fail to translate to usable data and information as to the effectiveness of the advertisements.The overall intrusiveness and inefficiency of the advertisements will deter user engagement, and in turn, deter user growth.The inability to monitor the effectiveness will deter advertisers from using their platform as an avenue to appeal to millennials.","IntroductionSnapchat's (SNAP) upcoming IPO has drawn a lot of attention with its proffered valuation ranging between $19.5-$22.2 billion. This article examines how the lofty valuation is not warranted due to its unproven business model and revenue streams. This article highlights Snapchat's current challenges and inability to retain and grow their advertiser platforms, which makes up 88.2% of their revenue stream.Snapchat has three self-proclaimed advertising avenues: Snap Ads, Sponsored Geofilters, and Sponsored Lenses. Comparing Snap to its main competitor, Facebook's (FB) Instagram, will show how drastic these flaws are. For longevity sake, I will try to keep my references to Instagram at a minimum, and will continue to cover Instagram's new features, and how it differentiates itself from disruptive market intruders.Both applications are based on the connectivity of people, yet there are meaningful differences in how they implement their respective strategies. Snapchat is based off sharing quick snapshots and videos of what people are doing, which subsequently disappear after 24 hours. Instagram is more focused on sharing moments that individuals want to remain, to create a profile, a business, or otherwise. Instagram allows one to build an identity on the platform. The lack of ability to create an identity within Snapchat undermines user engagement from the beginning, which will deter user engagement and inhibit their ability to attract advertisers.Snap AdsSnap Ads are vertical full screen video advertisements that play when an individual is watching a live story, a news publisher's story, or when watching another user's story playlist.Source: Snap's S-1 (pg. 107)Live Stories allow users to send in pictures of specific events, then Snapchat compiles them, chooses which pictures to use, then publishes them to a larger audience of users. ""One Direction Makes History"" and the ""Milan Fashion Week"" are their current options as I write this article. I originally thought Snapchat completely removed these Live Stories because I had not seen one in forever, but that was because they are placed at the very bottom of your friends' recently updated stories, making users scroll to the very bottom of the page before the Stories present themselves.These ads enable slightly more targeted ads based on the Live Story that is being watched; however, the ease of being able to skip these ads make it unrealistic that individuals will actually watch. Further, Snapchat increases its overhead cost by having individuals pick out the chosen stories for fear that something inappropriate may be submitted. This aspect differs from Instagram's low-cost platform because Instagram doesn't have to create any content. The users create the content and Instagram simply observes what the users follow, pictures and videos they view, comment on, ""like,"" etc., and is able to place it into an algorithm to classify each profile. Snapchat provides no information in the S-1 regarding the viewership of the Live Stories.Publisher stories are stories within their news or ""Discover"" outlet. These are also able to be slightly more targeted based on the story the user is reading. For example, Planet Earth's magazine segment on penguins has advertisements regarding sustainable energy, and Sports Illustrated has advertisements for the new Baywatch movie. The articles are not standard, and are largely depicted through single sentences on the screen with videos or other related pictures/videos in the background.This requires the user to tap through the article, thus, when an ad pops up with the disclaimer that it is an ad at the bottom right corner, the user is able easily skip the ad. In terms of the articles themselves, it takes forever to get through and actually retrieve something of substance from it through clicking through one-sentence snaps at a time. This form of news may be what some millennials are looking for, but the sheer inefficiency of the news will deter users in the long term.The last avenue for Snap Ads is the User Story Playlist. Although I find all the Snap Ads invasive, this is by far the most intrusive. Snap users can upload stories to their profile, allowing their friends to view them for a 24-hour period. Ads within this avenue hurt user engagement. Users click on these stories expecting to view what their friends are doing, not have some random face pop out telling you about a product. This would be the same concept as if Instagram put advertisements on specific user's profiles; it would kill user engagement.Further, these ads are not targeted to any individual other than their only market - the millennial crowd. Instagram has user profiles for every interest thinkable (sneakerheads, fitness accounts, watch aficionados, news, travel enthusiasts, they are literally endless) and the platform is able to harvest all this data on everything you like, to create targeted ads within the user's feed. This is much less invasive because the ad is specific to what the user typically follows, thus, it hardly even registers as an advertisement at all. A final note, I have seen an advertisement after ""User A's Story"" many times.Snapchat offers the following formats to advertise within the streams above: long-form videos, articles, app installs, or web views as depicted below.Source: Snap's S-1 (pg. 108)I will cite to the efficiency of these advertisers using Snapchat's ""Success Stories"" found here. I always look at advertising efficiency numbers and studies with skepticism, especially when the stats chosen for the success stories are picked by the company, which is attempting to draw in the advertisers. Snapchat offers Shock Top as one of its Long-Form Video success stories. The first red flag I saw on Shock Top's success page is that it reached 2.9 million Snapchatters, with views totaling 12.5 million.That means that each Snapchatters would have watched this ad 4.3 times (a little overbearing if you ask me), and it is hard to believe that after the first ad they watched the whole video again (if they even watched it all the way through the first time). Their stats, being 15-point increase in brand awareness (I'd sure as hell hope so if you were shoving this ad in my face 4+ times), a 19-point increase in message association (no further clarification on what this means), and 22% lift in purchase intent (which also means nothing to me if you don't have actual proof these viewers purchased it).Snapchat offers no success stories related to its Article Attachment.One of Snap's success stories related to App Installation is Kabam's Contest of Champions. Snapchat chose to cite the following statistics: 5+ million views, 9% unique engagement, and 11,000+ app installations. Using the vague (+) following the numbers, this translates to .2% of individuals downloading the free application. Further, these numbers don't take into account the individuals who download the app, then immediately delete it because it's not what they thought it was (I do that frequently and so do many of my friends).I'd prefer to know how much money the people who installed the app spent on add-ons, rather than the information given. Once again, Instagram also offers instant app installation advertisements, which are easily traceable, and much more targeted based on the interest of the users rather than the general demographic.Web View ads are probably the most viable option under Snap Ads because they are the only option that provide an avenue to visit the product's site and make purchases, although none of Snap's statistics reveal if something was actually purchased on the website. Snapchat offer's two Web View campaigns: AT&T (NYSE:T) and Hollister. AT&T had 4m+ total impressions (that means nothing to the bottom line), 1.6x increase in time spent vs. websites without Web View loading (unimpressive and obvious), and 14% unique engagement (means very little in the grand scheme of things).Snapchat's statistics for Hollister show an 11% increase in unique engagement, 2X increase in time spent attributed to Web View instant loading (what does this even mean), and 31 seconds of unique time spent on websites. I'm sorry but if I were paying to make these advertisements, and paying Snapchat to place them on the platform, I damn well better be getting some more specific statistics on how any of these affect my bottom line.Snapchat continually cites to these stats that are immaterial but sound good on their face. Further and once again, Instagram provides a much more specific target demographic, and allows you to shop within the application, making it much more seamless and allowing for better data for the advertisers.Although Snap Ads should provide the best consumption data for advertisers as opposed to Geofilters and Lenses, the figures cited to are underwhelming. Moreover, the intrusiveness affects the user experience and the ads are much less targeted than Instagram's data harvested targeted ads. Perhaps this is why Snapchat provides several more ""success stories"" related to sponsored filters as opposed to Snap Ads. However, these are equally less effective, and can also only be used to raise brand awareness.Sponsored GeofiltersSnapchat's Geofilters offer advertisers another avenue for exposure; however and yet again, it is next to impossible to trace the effectiveness of these advertisements. Geofilters are predesigned filters available on the preview screen before you send the snap. They are based on geographical landmarks, such as buildings, and other large events.Source: Snap's S-1 Filing (pg. 95)The statistics given throughout the Geofilter's success stories are even more vague and unconvincing than the Snap Ads. For instance, online deal application RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) was cited to have reached 11+ million Snapchatters, have 20+ million views, and one in six Snapchatters who unlocked the filter chose to use it. Once again, none of these stats tell the advertiser how effective this filter was in increasing traffic to the app.An equally unpersuasive story is Burger King's hot dog Geofilter campaign. Snapchat cites to one out of every five Snapchatters who unlocked the filter sent it, an 18-point increase in Ad Recall, and my personal favorite: 76% of Snapchatters who remembered the Geofilter said it made them happy. The lack of ability to track the real influence these ads have cause Snap to provide these unimpressive and nonsensical statistics.In an attempt to reconcile their inability to deliver numbers to the advertisers, they developed the Snap-to-Store measurement methodology.Source: Snap's S-1 filing (pg. 113)I think the convolution speaks for itself in this desperate attempt to harvest some measurement. There is no solid way to measure the effectiveness of these Geofilters, and this will deter advertiser use, and only be a minimal avenue for companies to increase brand awareness and first-to-mind branding.Sponsored LensesThe last advertising avenue effectiveness is largely in the same vein as Geofilters in terms of the inability to track the effectiveness. Lenses are typically interactive animations that are either overlaid on a person's face or changes the overall background around the person. Snap originally attempted to monetize the lenses by creating a store where users can purchase them. This failed, lenses usage deteriorated, and Snap abandoned the sale of them and began attempting to sell them to advertisers. Snap offers some lenses that are sponsored and some that are Snapchat created.Source: Snap's S-1 (pg. 94)One of Snap's success stories come from X-Men: Apocalypse, which is one I personally remember using several months ago. The chosen successful stats were 109 seconds of average play time spent with the lenses, a 13-point increase in brand awareness, and a 25% lift in theater watch intent. I remember using the Lens that shot laser beams from my eyes, probably sent it to a few people with a caption I thought was clever. The fact that I remember using it is somewhat impressive from an advertiser standpoint, but this made me no more likely to watch the movie because it simply reminded me how I dislike the characters and storyline of X-men.The ad would have been much more effective if they were targeted towards people who have expressed a mild interest in superhero movies. Another one of their self-proclaimed sponsored Lens success stories is Suicide Squad's. They cite to a 22-point increase in Ad Recall, and a 14% increase in watch intent. Both statistics fail to translate to actual viewership of the movie, a continuing problem with both the Lenses and Geofilters.This form of advertising also increases the overhead to the companies to create the ads, along with the cost of third-party studies to see how effective (if at all) the ads were. There are ways to incentivize use of these products in a way that give advertisers more feedback; however, Snap has failed to implement any.Final Thoughts: User GrowthSnap's slowing user growth has been a red flag for a lot of potential investors. Snapchat offers only one viable avenue for users to expand who they follow: through their contacts. Thus, you can only add people whose number or username you have, but let's be honest, if you don't have their number, you don't have their user name.This differs from Instagram where it is connected to your Facebook, and you Snap more than just your friends. Although you can find other usernames via the internet, the lack of seamlessness in adding friends (not just individuals but also other accounts), along with the inability for users to create an identity/profile within Snapchat will halt both user growth and engagement.I will continue to cover new features and updates of both Instagram and Snapchat's that affects their business model. Specifically, I have begun writing the follow-up article on Snap's spectacles, the non-voting shares, and an overall opinion on the psychology of Snap's CEO."
4047673,53272,2017-02-20T20:07:04-05:00,"Facebook took user behavior to places users didn't think they wanted to go - with the newsfeed itself, with the algorithmic newsfeed and with the continuous rolling back of privacy.How does this relate to Snapchat?It's a swing away from metrics.Instead of asking where metrics, data and algorithms take us, Snap is looking for creation.","There's a pretty common narrative that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have a lot of control of the internet, in that they choose where you go and what you see. While this is true in an obvious sense, it also misses something important: Google and Facebook don't have fundamental control over what's actually in your search results or your news feed.This is pretty clear for Google - it doesn't control what you search for. It does decide what results you get, but that decision also is, in some sense, out of its hands, because it has to give you the best results it can. So while Google always is making decisions around search, and those can create or uncreate companies, they are in essence technical, mechanistic judgments (or ought to be, at any rate) and not editorial ones. Google Search is, and has to be, a mirror of the internet - both the content of the internet and human behavior on the internet. It's useful to compare it with an index fund, which doesn't have opinions about individual stocks, but only makes technical, mechanistic adjustments to how well its holdings reflects the index: so too, Google can only adjust how well it reflects the internet. That's a very partial kind of control.While this is explicit for Google, it's implicit for Facebook. You tell Google explicitly what you want, and you don't think you tell Facebook, but actually you've spent months and years telling it, through everything you've interacted with or ignored. Facebook makes technical, mechanistic judgments about what will be in your newsfeed that are just as bound by things beyond its control - by the internet - as Google's are. It's an index of its users. Every now and then, it decides that it's got off track, no longer aligns with users, and course-corrects. But the need, as for Google, is to mirror the internet (or that large part of it that's accounted for by Facebook itself). And so just as Google can't control what you search for, Facebook can't control what engages you.This means Facebook is surfing user behavior and must go where the user takes it. This is why it looks like such an unreliable partner: it will invite you onto the surf board, certainly, but if you're unbalancing the board, then it will push you off, and that isn't Facebook's choice. If it didn't push you off, then the board would upset and Facebook would be at the bottom of the ocean as well, next to Myspace. The genius of Facebook has been to stay on the board all this time, and especially though the transition from desktop to mobile.Within this, there have been some times where Facebook took user behavior in places that the users themselves didn't think they wanted to go - with the newsfeed itself, with the algorithmic newsfeed and with the continuous rolling back of privacy (you can see some of this repeated as it has reworked Instagram - more on this later). But in all of these cases, what drives Facebook is data - metrics and algorithms. You think you want a linear newsfeed, but actually, the data shows that you're wrong. Facebook is the first company to measure false consciousness.How does this relate to Snapchat? Well, there are several ways you can draw contrasts between Snapchat and Facebook. One, pretty obviously, is that it's a swing of a pendulum away from order and control towards fun and chaos. Another, that it's a swing from passive consumption (""I'm bored - what's in the newsfeed?"") to creation (hence, opening the app into the camera). Another again is that, like Instagram, it unbundles the camera from Facebook (and from iMessage, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger) into a better standalone model.But it's also a swing away from metrics. Instead of asking where metrics, data and algorithms take us, Snap is looking for creation. Creation is the common thread repeated over and over again all though the IPO filing, and comes out very strongly in the roadshow video - ""we must create the new, different and fun all the time.""Much of this creation is centered on the camera - Snap says it's a camera company, and it's often useful to try taking companies at their word on things like this. But camera is a broad term. As I've written elsewhere, thinking about the image sensors on a smartphone just as taking ""photos"" is very limiting. For Snap, this is clear with the first product - disappearing photos comes from the idea that imaging on a phone is communication as well as or instead of memory, and hence, that making you keep all your photos is like saving all of your phone calls. More broadly, one way to look at Snap's products is as trying to work out what it means that the display, the input and the camera are all the same thing - all one digital piece of glass. Most of Facebook's smartphone apps could be controlled with a mouse and keyboard, or even just the ""tab"" key, and use the camera as though it's a webcam sticky-taped to the top of the CRT. In contrast, Snapchat and a whole bunch of other apps are much more mobile-native than they are mobile-first, and have the tabula rasa freedom that they can target only the billion or so people with lots of bandwidth and high-end phones, rather than Facebook and Google's commitment to reaching everyone. That creates a great many possibilities for the completely new idea.It's hard to design products like this with metrics - you don't already know what those products would be, and your users have no idea. You can iterate with data (that is, ""surf your users""), and you can discover that something you have isn't working, but you can't always create with data - you can't use algorithms to work out what to invent. This is the (much overused) Steve Jobs argument - it's not the consumer's job to invent new things. Yes, you analyze your users to see if it works, and Snap's S1 talks a lot about listening to users, but that's not how you create.So, you could see Snap's emphasis on ""new"" as just running away from Facebook. Facebook is, after all, systematically cloning cool new Snapchat features, and with some success - there are clear signs of Snapchat's growth slowing in favor of Facebook's apps, especially in some of its non-core markets. But it's also important that Snap thinks it's mining imaging, touch, GPUs and experience just as Facebook mined sharing, and thinks that there are many more places this could go. And, of course, the more you create and the more risks you take, and the more you're interested in fun and anarchy, the more possible it is that you create products that burn brightly and then flame out - so you have to keep creating because your experiences have to be new, not (just) because the old ones are being copied by someone.This could, perhaps, take Snap to places and generate new ""graphs"" that might be structurally more difficult for Facebook to follow. On the other hand, one of Facebook's tactical advantages is that it has four places where it can try to clone features - it could choose to put a Stories clone into Instagram, not Messenger, WhatsApp or the main newsfeed app. It could put other ideas into other places, depending on where it thinks they fit best - on how best it can surf these new waves, to return to the metaphor.Meanwhile, Instagram hasn't just been implementing Snapchat features - it's gone through a more structural shift that illustrates a more structural question for Snapchat's long-term potential. If Google and Facebook try to mirror the internet (again, in the sense both of content and behavior), and Snapchat deliberately does not, Instagram has moved from one camp to the other. Instagram has moved not just towards Snapchat, but also away from the beautiful, carefully considered image and towards a more general, mass-market use case - towards being another index.To me, this is Instagram moving toward being another index, or mirror - moving towards the behavior of billions of people instead of the behavior of millions of people, and to surfing users rather than prescribing for them. There are millions of people who will post beautiful pictures of coffee or 1960s office blocks, or like a photo by a celebrity, but there are billions who'll share a snapshot of their lunch, beer, dog or child. Instagram is moving to capture that in the same way Messenger and WhatsApp captured chat. It's becoming an index.So, one question for Snapchat is whether you can get to a billion users without being an index, no matter how many new things you create. Is the risk not that it gets overtaken by Facebook, but that it can't generalize enough? That's obviously a specific concern with the specific character of the user experience today (""too hard for anyone over 25""), but it's also a much more basic question with the character of the product vision - can you scale from having insight and product vision for around 150 million people to having them for everyone?One of the ways I've talked about social on smartphones is that smartphones themselves are a social platform in a way that the desktop web was not. Every app has an icon on the home screen, so it's quicker to switch apps than switch tabs in the same app. Every app has push notifications and access to your address book and your photo library. So, it's much easier to use multiple apps on a phone than on the web. This makes it much easier for apps to take off, but they can look like fireworks - burning brightly and then disappearing. Each social app is trying to capture some piece of psychology or of Maslow's hierarchy and encapsulate it in a few interaction mechanics, and each one is trying to find some angle that's unique enough to break out, but not so unique that it becomes a fad. They're also trying to fund a mechanic that can't entirely co-opted by Facebook (Live Video is another good example here). Not many have managed all of this.One could argue that the leading apps have now captured the key parts of the social domain - filled in the ""white space,"" as some people say - and that though people will keep finding quirky angles, it'll get harder and harder to get onto the first page of apps and stay there. Following this narrative, Snap found the last piece of white space (if it can keep Facebook away, which is actually all that matters), and there may not be another big one. But you could also argue that Snap thinks there will always be entirely new ways to interact (just as there are always more human desires), and that it will be there trying to be the one creating them."
4047596,101442,2017-02-20T12:39:43-05:00,"Snap's penetration across the age groups is poor, obstructing it from its growth potential.Snapchat app requires high-bandwidth internet connection, thereby further limiting market penetration in countries with mobile connectivity of 3G and below.The global mobile advertising market, though with high growth potential, is increasingly competitive, represented by two titans in the face of Google and Facebook.The value of Snap is about $15.6bln, at best, and far below the proposed IPO value of $18-$22bln.","With Snap (Pending:SNAP) officially filing for an IPO on February 2, 2017, there has been much speculation all around the media, including Seeking Alpha, on just how justified the expected valuation of $18bln-$20bln is using a more qualitative approach. In this report, I will look from a different angle and will try to find the company's value as I see it, by using my usual method - the intrinsic valuation.ThesisHaving filed its S-1 statement as an ""emerging growth company"" (as defined in the JOBS Act ""…as an issuer with 'total annual gross revenues' of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year""), SNAP did not need to present more than two years of its audited financial statements. That aspect, along with the fact that the company has had an operating loss of $382mln and $520mln in 2015 and 2016, respectively, renders any financial analysis inconclusive (though not completely unnecessary). On this occasion, I will present my view on how I see the company evolving over time.Let us start with the topline. More than 98% of SNAP's revenues come from advertising, and this trend is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. Furthermore, about 90% of its revenues are generated in the North American region. One reason for this geographic concentration may be connected to the fact that, having originated in the US, Snap is not that well-known or popular outside the continent. The company's ability to revert this trend and make it a globally recognized app should help it grow its revenue base. Unfortunately, there is some headwind in this respect. First, the vast majority of people using Snapchat app are aged 18-34 years old. This low penetration across the age groups fares poorly when compared to such internet advertising moguls as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (virtually, any age group) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (13 to 65+).Second, Snapchat requires high-bandwidth internet connectivity, implying that however good its image improves in the eyes of people outside the North American region, user (and hence advertising) growth will be restricted only to those nations which have the necessary infrastructure to transmit data at 4G/5G speeds (primarily, developed-country regions). Personally, I am not a Snapchat user but, for the sake of experiment, I installed and opened the app with mobile data ON in a country with most common internet connectivity being 3G. It took me quite some time to load a single Lense and my limited data traffic has suffered a lot. Given this exceedingly negative first-time user experience, I was quick to realize I needed to un-install the app.The third aspect worth noting is that Snap is in the highly competitive market, by the company's own admission (S-1, p. 120), in the face of Facebook (including WhatsApp and Instagram), Google, WeChat, Line, Telegram and many others. There is also virtually no stickiness with Snap's platform, enabling users to switch easily to any of the above-mentioned competitors. This is exacerbated by the fact that the company's technology can be easily replicated by its competitors (with Stories feature made available by Instagram and self-destructing - and encrypted - messages provided by Telegram).To put the aforementioned analyses into perspective, let me provide you with some figures. According to eMarketer (a research provider on everything digital), global digital ad spending was expected to reach $195bln in 2016 and grow to $335bln by 2020, with mobile ad spending accounting for 55.84% and 73.7%, respectively, which translates into a CAGR of 22.7%. By applying a 2.45% growth rate thereafter ( equal to 10-Year T-Note at the start of 2017), we get a potential global mobile advertising market 10 years from now of $285.5bln - attractive enough to lure even more competitors into the business. With 2016 data provided above, Snap's own revenue figure as well as the Google's and Facebook's 10Ks, we can see from the table below that the market in 2016 is largely dominated by Google and Facebook, with Snap having only a negligible share.As a result of the aforementioned factors, Snap, even though with a potential to succeed in its endeavor to become global online advertising platform, will not be a dominant player, with only a limited share of global mobile advertising revenues, which I am going to cap at 5% of the forecast global revenues of $285.5bln in year 2026.ValuationI will value SNAP using a 3-stage DCF model and a 10-year valuation horizon with the following assumptions:Growth - Using the abovementioned global mobile advertising revenue growth assumption and a 5% market share that I apply to the company 10 years from now, I estimate the company's revenues will have to augment by about 63% each year for next five years. From that period and up to period 10, the growth rate will linearly decline to a terminal growth rate of 2.45%, which is the 10-Year Treasury Note rate as of December 30, 2016 (the reason I am using year-end rate and not the currently observed one is that SNAP's reporting period ends in December and the rate is relevant at that point in time).Profitability - For a young growth company it is natural to have negative operating profits for some time, given increased reinvestment needs to support high future growth rates. Consequently, there is nothing inherently troubling that I see now with Snap's negative profit margins. As the company grows, however, and economies of scale kick in, I will expect to see an improvement in the operating profit margins. I will assume that the currently negative operating margin will grow at a double-declining rate to reach 25% (that of Google) in period 10. Reinvestment - This is an ""umbrella"" term used to describe what any company has to implement to support future growth: capital expenditures net of depreciation and net working capital investment. To compute the reinvestment rate, I will use the approach advocated by Professor A. Damodaran of NYU in the form of the so-called ""sales-to-capital"" ratio (with higher ratio figures translating into greater revenues for a given level of capital spending, implying higher reinvestment efficiency) for incremental sales. To get a sense of where the company currently stands, I have computed the sales-to-capital ratio as revenues divided by invested capital. I have also calculated the same figure for Google, Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) during the last five years:As can be seen, compared to other companies in the table, Google stands out as relatively more efficient in its reinvestments, while other companies have been hovering below 1.0, though steadily improving. In my valuation, I will apply the sales-to-capital ratio of 1.0, implying that for each $1 million increase in revenues, Snap will spend $1 million for reinvestment purposes.Risk - This term is going to describe nothing more than a discount rate that I will use in my DCF model. Since this is the pre-IPO valuation of a young and money-losing company, which does not have any debt (except for capital and operating leases and hosting commitments), I will apply the cost of capital of 9.02% (95th percentile of the US publicly listed companies, Damodaran, 2017) in the first year and will gradually adjust that figure down to the median value of 7.22% in period 10, reflective of the fact that as the company grows and becomes more profitable, its risk will converge to that of a typical mature US company (note that the reason I have used the US cost of capital - as opposed to the global one - is the fact that 90% of revenues are generated in the North American region alone and I do not see how this proportion may change, given the reasons mentioned above).Apart from these major assumptions, I have also assumed the following:The table below presents the model output results:As you can see, the company equity value that I get is about $15.58bln, or $12.54 on per-share basis (and I might have been a little too optimistic about the market share of 5% that I applied which, given the intensifying competition, may never be reached in reality). Moreover, this value applies more to those shares, which have a voting power, and since the current IPO will offer Class A shares having absolutely no voting power, a further discount on value should be attached (in the range of 5%-10% according to some academic studies) for lack of control. Given the proposed IPO per-share price range of $14-$16, it seems concerned investors will be better off staying away from the IPO until the price reaches a more favourable level."
4050682,102844,2017-02-28T18:02:28-05:00,"SNAP is different: You can’t use the same metric of success as we did for the social media companies that came first, like Facebook and Twitter.The company has outstripped its peers to-date when it comes to ARPU (average revenue per user) growth.SNAP has been purpose-built to capture social media advertising dollars, which have gone from a trickle to a torrent over the last two years.","Originally published on Toptal by Valuation Expert Joe MattaFor those who haven't been following the news since Snap (NYSE:SNAP) announced its intentions to go public, the press cycle has been on a roller-coaster ride. Initial valuation estimates in the $20-25bn range were quickly followed by a few bolder claims that the IPO may fetch the company a valuation as high as $40bn. With this in mind, immediate post-announcement commentary was decisively bearish, and largely centered around the company's disproportionately high price compared to revenues of only $405m in 2016.As time has gone by, more thoughtful analyses have shifted attention over to Snap's growth prospects, and here significant concerns have emerged over the company's slowing user growth, drawing comparisons to Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) lackluster post-IPO performance, and thus placing serious questions on the purported valuation figures. As a result, Snap has reportedly lowered its expectations, and certain estimates expect pricing to come as low as $14-16 per share, implying a valuation of $16-19bn.Ahead of its expected pricing (anticipated on March 1st), we take a look at whether the rumored valuation makes sense, and provide our own guidance on where investors should be pricing the stock.We find that while overall market concerns regarding DAU growth are justified, the market is likely undervaluing the company's ARPU growth prospects and conclude that there is significant upside on the table for investors. For us, Snap is a buy.Growth is the answerAs mentioned, initial reports largely focused on comparing Snap's purported valuation to its revenues, which when compared to its peers, admittedly looks very expensive (table 1).But such an analysis misses the mark completely in two important ways. Firstly, many of the companies in Snap's peer universe are not directly comparable (Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a search company and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an online retailer, to name a few). Limiting the peer universe to Snap's most directly comparable peers, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, is a more appropriate juxtaposition (charts 1 and 2).But even when just limiting one's comparison to Facebook and Twitter, the maturity profiles of the respective companies are very different and must be accounted for. A fairer analysis would look at the metrics pre-IPO for all three (charts 3 and 4). In doing so, readers will notice that the relative valuation, albeit still expensive, looks less so than in the prior charts.There are still timing issues with such a comparison though. For reference, Facebook was eight years old and Twitter was seven at the time of their IPOs. Snap is only five, and with 2-3 more years of growth under its belt, it could be a very different company.Moreover, Snap is a direct-to-mobile platform while Facebook and Twitter went public in a world in which desktop-delivery still played a dominant role. Considering the shift from desktop to mobile, Snap is entering a market with a growing user base (mobile taking share from desktop) on a delivery platform that is capturing increasing user engagement (charts 5 and 6).In summary, the different maturity profiles coupled with the different delivery platforms, both now as well as at IPO, make for a troublesome comparables-based approach when assessing Snap's valuation. Snap may look expensive when compared to its peers, but comparing to its peers is not the right approach.With the above in mind, a Snap-only analysis makes most sense. And such an analysis should almost solely be focused on one thing: growth. For any company at Snap's stage, growth is paramount to valuation, and to this end, there are fundamentally two things that affect growth going forward:1) Growth in Daily Active Users (DAUs), and 2) growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).We look at these in turn.DAU Growth: Doubts LoomMuch of the more insightful analysis which emerged a few weeks after the filing has in fact focused on DAU growth. And the hawks are out in flock. Unfortunately for Snap, while initial user growth performance was impressive (chart 7), there has been a significant downtick in new users joining the platform in recent months. Despite outperforming both Facebook and Twitter in terms of user growth in the six quarters leading up to its IPO, Snap saw quarterly growth rates drop from double-digit figures to only 7% in Q3 16 and, even more worryingly, to a paltry 3.3% in Q4 16 (chart 8).Management's justification for the following can be found in its S1, where it states:The above explanation thus emphasizes two key potential causes for the slowdown in growth: technical issues with its Android product, and/or increasing competition.The former, while problematic, would not be a significant cause for concern. One would think that a company funded to the tune of $2.6bn and with nearly 2,000 employees (many of them in engineering) would be able to solve this and revert the company's growth course back to what it was at the beginning of 2016.But the more worrying concern revolves around competition. Snap faces increasing pressure from competitors, particularly Facebook and Instagram, which, if unresolved, could continue to limit DAU growth going forward. In fact, it is no wonder that Snapchat's growth numbers began suffering in Q3 16 as this was exactly when Instagram launched Stories, a near-blatant copy of Snapchat's namesake.Unfortunately for Snap, data regarding growth in DAU by geography only lends further weight to the competition concerns. In fact, on a geographical basis, much of the slowdown in Snap's DAUs appears to have been primarily in the ""Rest of World"" region (chart 9). Given Instagram's significantly larger user base abroad (80% of Instagram's c.300m DAUs are international), one could see how the incentives for installing Snapchat diminishes as Instagram (and other competitors) begins to offer the key features that Snapchat has to-date sold itself on.To summarize, things don't look good for Snapchat from a DAU growth perspective. Not only was Q4 16 Snap's lowest growing quarter since the beginning of its publicly available data, but also it was even slower than that of Facebook, a far more mature company (chart 10). Given these headwinds, Snap will have to effectively convince investors that it can address its decelerating quarter-over-quarter DAU growth if it wishes to hit the valuation numbers that have been publicized.Looking Ahead: Facebook Growth or Twitter Struggles?With the above in mind, our expectation is that Snap going forward will experience a user growth profile more akin to Twitter's than to Facebook's. While growth will be sustained by its continued popularity in the United States, competition from Facebook, Instagram and other international competitors will continue to limit Snap's growth internationally.Our base case expectation is therefore for an average of 14.1% growth per year post-IPO, almost right in between Facebook's and Twitter's annual average growth rates of 19.1% and 10.3%, respectively (table 2). The primary source of the growth premium to Twitter derives from Snapchat's ability to innovate on product features better than Twitter (more on this below).ARPU Growth: Solid Start with Ample Upside RemainingWhilst the above DAU estimates are nothing for investors to get excited about, and fall largely in line with most market commentary, stopping one's analysis at DAU performance is shortsighted. In particular, it misses the key other side of the coin: ARPU. And when it comes to ARPU growth, we see a radically different story. Our view is that Snapchat will see strong ARPU growth going forward, driven by the following factors:All of these will in turn be boosted by general underlying strength in the mobile advertising space. We look at these in turn.Snapchat is a very monetization-friendly productOne of the most attractive features of Snapchat from an ARPU standpoint is that the product itself appears to lend itself very well, arguably better than its competitors, to monetization. The effectiveness of the platform is largely driven by Snap's ability to innovate on product features and stay ahead of the competition, and this has allowed it to build impressively strong positions in image sharing and in video.Looking first at image sharing, Snap has caught up rapidly with its competitors (chart 11) largely thanks to its ability to innovate with the format (initially with disappearing messages, later with filters, Stories, etc.). The implication of this is significant in that it has allowed Snap to lead the industry in terms of developing and delivering sponsored/branded content for this type of format. For instance, focusing on sponsored filters, Snap's ability to reach a large audience far exceeds Facebook despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 12).The growth in image sharing and the innovation surrounding its product features has positioned Snap favorably amongst advertisers, allowing it to strike important partnerships with very significant brands worldwide. One of the examples of such campaigns that Snap highlights in its S1 relates to how Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) blanketed its U.S. stores with Sponsored Geofilters that promoted the Jalapeño Fresco Chicken Sandwich. Snap's measurement tool reported that the Sponsored Geofilter drove over 42,000 incremental people to a Wendy's location within seven days of viewing the Sponsored Geofilter.Perhaps more important than image sharing, Snap has developed a dominant position in video, converting it into a serious threat to Facebook. According to the KPCB presentation, as of Q1 16, Snap has surpassed Facebook in terms of daily video views despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 13).This success to date has been driven by Snap's unique approach to the video format. KPCB refers to Snap's approach as ""3V Advertising"": (1) Vertical - made for mobile viewing, (2) Video - a great way to tell a story, and (3) Viewing - always full screen.The combination of these three has made video advertising that much more effective on Snapchat. In fact, according to the KPCB presentation, outside of Snapchat, many video ads are ineffective with 81% of people muting the ads. However, Snap points out in its S-1 that on average 60% of all Snap Ads are watched with the sound on.The above again points to Snap's effectiveness as a monetization platform as well as the management team's ability to keep innovating on product and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to marrying fun and engaging product features with monetization avenues. A recent example of success with video would be Gatorade's sponsored lens during the Super Bowl, a campaign which led to 60 million plays in total, 165 million views and an increase of 8 points in purchase intent.Snap has developed the ultimate trifecta - a robust advertising platform that combines communications (chatting), image creation and sharing, and video content. This has lead to numerous marketing campaigns achieving above-average industry impact, performance and ROI. This should support rapid growth of ARPU as more marketers recognize these benefits and decide to move advertising dollars over to Snap.Snap is very strong with a key user demographicAs the pool of mobile advertising investment dollars rises, more advertisers are looking to target Millennials and younger demographics. In 2015, Marketers dedicated over a third (34%) of their annual marketing budgets to targeting these groups. That figure was likely even greater with teens and ""tweens"" included.The above phenomenon is largely because Millennials are expected to drive consumer spending in the years to come. Millennials are 80 million strong, the largest demographic in the United States, and as of March 2015, also the largest demographic in the workforce.This of course translates into huge spending power. Estimates indicate Millennials could be spending $1.4 trillion annually by 2020 and could inherit as much as $30 billion in the coming years. Even teens and tweens are generating significant spending power, spending as much as Baby Boomers in 2015.The issue advertisers face is that Millennials are moving away from traditional advertising channels to their phones (chart 14). Companies like Snap, as well as its competitors, provide an optimal channel through which to target these groups.Fortunately for Snap, it seems to have developed a very strong position in these age groups. With 63% of Snap users in the 18-34 age category, and 22% between 13-17 years of age, Snap has captured the attention of a highly coveted marketing demographic (chart 15 - note: chart is from a 2016 comScore report, as such the data does not perfectly tie with Snap's latest demographics reported in its S-1).More importantly, Snap has become a leading platform in terms of its engagement within 18-34 age demographic (chart 16). Facebook is clearly a dominant player with massive reach and significant engagement, but Snapchat is the second leading platform in terms of average monthly minutes per visitor. As Snap continues to expand its reach and further penetrate this key age group, it should move higher and further to the right on this chart as it continues to threaten Facebook's leadership.This all bodes very well for Snap. The company has continued to rapidly expand its reach within the 18-24 category while also broadening its penetration within older age groups. As of December 2015, according to comScore, more than three out of five 18-24 year olds now actively use Snapchat, with older age groups also on the rise (chart 17).With a dominance in the Millennial, teen and tween demographics, the second leading platform in terms of monthly engagement and further expansion of its reach within each of those key demographics Snap should receive an outsized portion of advertising dollars going forward. This should support rapid ARPU expansion in the coming years.Snap's management is more monetization focusedPutting the above two tactical points aside, the most encouraging thing about Snap is that management has consistently shown a greater predisposition and knack for converting fun new product features into monetization avenues. In short: Snap's management appears to be excellent at monetization.And the results bear this out. When comparing to Facebook and Twitter, Snap started monetizing earlier, and has grown faster in terms of ARPU than both of its comparables, despite being several years ""younger"" as a company (charts 18 and 19).Admittedly, claiming that Snap is simply better at monetizing than its comps is a subjective and difficult-to-prove assertion. However, if you believe this, then what makes this an even more interesting point is when you consider how much upside could still be left for Snap to capture. To this end, a simple side-by-side comparison of ARPU numbers with Facebook and Twitter suggests that Snap's ARPU could rise as much as 7x what it is today (chart 20).For us, Snap's impressive historical performance in ARPU driven by its clear ability to innovate in product and monetization, combined with the tremendous upside still there for the taking, points to strong and rapid catch-up in terms of ARPU in the years to come. It is therefore not surprising to us that after having failed to acquire Snapchat, Facebook has now reverted to replicating its features consistently.Overall industry growth will keep supporting Snap's ARPU growthAside from the intrinsic strengths of Snap as a company, it's also obvious that overall underlying industry strength will help sustain ARPU growth in the coming years (although the extent to which this will be remains a question).According to a report from IDC, ad spending is expected to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020 with mobile specific spending growing 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. Social media marketing in particular is expected to grow 20% per year to $50.2bn in 2019, comfortably overtaking newspaper advertising by 2020.Moreover, according to KPCB, there is a $22bn market opportunity in mobile advertising as it is the only growing outlet in terms of percent of consumption time. This should continue to encourage marketers to shift away from more legacy outlets like TV and print and into mobile (chart 21). Given that Snap's entire advertising inventory is on mobile, a growing pool of total mobile advertising dollars will certainly benefit it going forward.Rabbit from a hat: Ancillary product launches may add further upside to ARPUFor further revenue upside, one can't overlook Snap's potential to develop ancillary products.Snap has already demonstrated a willingness to explore new product categories with the launch of Spectacles in September 2016, its first ever hardware product. New product developments outside of software could potentially provide Snap with a very interesting monetization model that is different from its competitors (FB is exploring VR) and a unique way of owning more of the user's share of mind.Spectacles are wearable glasses with a built-in camera that links seamlessly to a smartphone to create unique Snaps from a ""human perspective."" The company views Spectacles as an extension of Snapchat and intends to use the glasses to create a unique circular format for video as opposed to the standard rectangular viewing perspective (once again reinventing the standard video delivery model).Spectacles do generate revenue for Snap, but for 2016, the revenues were not material and, thus, not reported in the company's filing. Going forward, Spectacles could represent a much larger portion of Snap's revenue.It's unclear what other types of new products Snap is planning to bring to market, but it has demonstrated a strong ability to create innovative and sticky products that drive incremental user growth and revenue (chart 22). Expect each new product introduction to be strategic in driving user growth, enhancing user engagement, and increasing share of mind, all things that should bring create even greater revenue opportunities for Snap.ARPU growth going forward: A monetization machineLooking ahead and given all of the above, our expectation is that despite slowing user growth, Snap's platform should support very strong ARPU growth going forward. We see Snap's ARPU catching up with Facebook's in the next five years, and it would not surprise us if it surpasses it further out. In other words, despite Twitter-like user growth, Snap is likely to experience more of a Facebook-like, if not better, ARPU growth profile.The biggest risk to this scenario playing out mainly relates to Facebook and other competitors' ability to replicate Snap's features both quickly and effectively. Should this be the case, Snap's leadership in product innovation will likely fail to spill over into significant ARPU growth. However, should competitors struggle to play the ""catch-up game"" well enough, Snap will likely see ARPU growth rates in line with what we predict below. The latter has been interestingly described as the ""Gingerbread strategy"" in this article.With that in mind, we anticipate two possible ARPU growth trajectories. Our downside case projections are more in line with other commentaries and essentially consider the latter scenario of product innovation followed by effective catch-up by competitors. The base case is instead predicated on management's ability to keep innovating on product, and competitors' relative ineffectiveness at copying such features.The numbers of both cases are displayed in table 3 below, but the highlight is that in our base case projections, we anticipate north of 50% CAGR over the next five years, with ARPU catching up to Facebook's 2016 numbers by 2019/2020.Putting this all together: What is Snap worth?With all of the above in mind, we can now proceed to calculating our estimated valuation for Snap. We first look at what Snap's revenues will look like going forward, based on our DAU and ARPU assumptions outlined above, and then move into a valuation analysis using these revenue estimates.Financial ForecastsOur financial forecasts are summarized in Table 4, but the headline numbers we want to highlight are the following:ValuationWe value Snap on an EV/Revenue basis using a target multiple range of 6.0x to 10.0x derived from the midpoint of the range between Facebook and Twitter current trading multiples. On the one hand, Snap's more limited DAU growth warrants a lower multiple than Facebook's, but on the other hand its more favorable ARPU prospects warrant a premium to Twitter's multiple. We apply these multiple to forward 2018 revenue estimates to account for Snap being a younger company than both of its comps. Our valuation estimates are summarized in Table 5 below, but the key takeaways are as follows:Snap: Twitter growth, but Facebook ARPUIn many respects, one could say that the Snap IPO heralds a more general shift in social media platforms from building for user growth to building for user engagement and monetization. Since inception, Snap has always felt more like a blend between a traditional social media app and a gaming app. The more playful nature of the platform has in turn translated positively into monetization and ARPU growth, far more so than Snap's peers did at their equivalent stages of their lifecycle. Whether a purposeful management strategy or not, Snap seems better built for monetization.This of course is occurring concurrently with an increasing shift in advertising spend from traditional media outlets to online/digital and particular mobile channels. In many ways, it feels like advertisers are reaching the tipping point of shifting a majority of their dollars to social media and ""new media"" channels.As a result, we view Snap's future financial prospects very favorably, and per our analysis above, conclude that Snap is a buy. Snap's value is a function of being the first social media platform that has been built with advertisers in mind from the beginning.This opinion article is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute investment advice.

4047447,101924,2017-02-19T10:42:47-05:00,"Snap, one of the most anticipated tech IPOs in years, filed an amendment which slashes its valuation by up to 24 percent.The lowered valuation is still very high, and Snap has yet to explain its path to profitability in the face of intense competition and a fickle consumer base.These above factors mean that Snap’s user growth is already slowing down even while it has massive losses.Snap could be propelled initially by early excitement, but investors should still look for other opportunities despite the lower valuation and pricing.","There are a thousand and one articles out on the internet discussing Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) imminent IPO and its prospects, and for good reason. The IPO is set to be one of the biggest tech IPOs in years, and has inevitably drawn comparisons to other social media IPOs like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Although comparisons to Twitter, which continues to make a loss, rather than Facebook, which has proven itself highly resilient, are more apt. We now finally have a price range, as Snap announced by amending its SEC filing that it is targeting a price range of $14 to $16. This is below expectations and will see Snap valued from $19 to $22 billion, far less than the $25 billion which investors had expected beforehand. I expect Snap to change this value one way or the other at some point before the IPO formally launches, but this initial value indicates that Snap is more cautious than initially expected.Snap is a better investment at this lower valuation, but it still does not change the fundamental problems with this company which make so many investors nervous. As long as Snap cannot answer background checks about how it intends to become a profitable company, investors should continue to avoid Snap and look for better opportunities on the IPO market.Road to ProfitabilityThe one thing to note about Snap's lower valuation is that it is still very high relative to its sales. Fortune reports that Snap's valuation is 47 times sales at minimum, which is higher than Twitter at 44.8, Facebook at 28, and Alibaba at 19.8. This means that Snap has plenty of room to lower its price as this is still an expensive IPO.The fact that Snap's valuation is comparable to Twitter is interesting, because Snap has a lot of work to do to convince investors that it will not be the next Twitter. The fundamental concern which multiple investors have with Snap is that it currently seems to be thriving on hype rather than a sound, fundamental path to becoming a profitable company. Snap's gargantuan losses are well-documented, as the company admits in its filing that it lost about $515 million in 2016 and $372 million in 2015.Plenty of tech companies have gone public even though they were profitable, but few if any have recorded losses this big. And most concerning of all, Snap really does not have a path towards profitability.Snap can point towards how its revenue shot up from $58 million to over $404 million in 2016 as it began launching advertisements. Snap's user base is primarily teens and millennials, and advertisers are willing to pay for a website which can supposedly hold their attention.The problem is that said demographic is notoriously fickle and does not like nor will listen to advertisements, as Quartz points out that over half of Snapchat users tend to skip over them. Furthermore, if Snap tries to ramp up advertising, those users will flee towards other social media websites. Facebook and Instagram with Instagram Stories have pulled users away from Snapchat, and Snapchat's user growth rate has slowed since the middle of last year. Furthermore, Snapchat lacks global appeal compared to other social media websites and has focused on propping itself in North America. While there is merit in such a strategy, it limits Snap's potential and makes it clear that it has no intention of actually challenging larger social media competitors.In short, Snap is a company that is losing a great deal of money, has a user base whose growth is steadily declining, and cannot ramp up advertising to make money given its fickle demographics. These factors mean that its path towards profitability is murky at best, especially as larger competitors intrude on its territory.Wait and SeePlenty of analysts have noted these above problems with Snap, but cold, rational thought will not totally kill the hype that surrounds one of the largest tech IPOs in years. Snap will probably perform well out of the gate as investors will convince themselves that such a large, rapidly growing tech company representing something new will do great. But as the hype wears off and Snap continues to show that it cannot post good numbers, its stock value will go down.Depending on circumstances, that could actually be a good opportunity to snatch the stock up then. But it is impossible to foretell for now, and investors should currently avoid this IPO. Do not get overwhelmed by the media frenzy and stick to sober thought."
4047423,23899,2017-02-19T05:25:18-05:00,"Snapchat's impressive recent growth may not be able to offset its history of losses.
        The platform relies heavily on advertising growth and would need to compete with the likes of Facebook and Google for ad revenues.
        Slowing user growth and retention could also signal a shift in Snapchat's popularity.","By Richard SaintvilusSnap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) the parent company of popular messaging app Snapchat, recently officially filed for its initial public offering. Calling itself a ""camera company,"" Snapchat, which boasts a private market valuation of $17.8 billion, has ambitious plans to raise some $3 billion from the offering -- a figure which some analysts call merely a placeholder number for a far greater goal.Don't Make Snap DecisionsEstimates suggest this offering to value the company between $20 billion and $22 billion, according to MarketWatch. But should retail investors, who the company says will have no voting rights, buy into the IPO? Just as important, given the recent IPO lemons we've seen from the likes of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) -- another camera company -- Snapchat investors must consider the bigger picture.According to its recent filing, Snapchat has made considerable progress in terms of monetizing its core ephemeral photo- and video-sharing app, which had 158 million daily active users at the end of 2016 for an average of 2.5 billion ""snaps"" created per day. Aside from the ads posted on its photo-sharing platform, the company makes money from content created by third-party channels such as news organizations. And to better diversify its revenue stream, Snapchat recently launched hardware called Spectacles and has since implemented a payment feature called Snapcash.Too Many Things Must Go RightThe company, which lists -- among others -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as competitors, said revenue surged to $404.5 million from just $58.7 million in 2015. Notably, that figure surpassed the company's own target range of $300 million to $350 million. Just as impressive, Snapchat's average revenue per user (ARPU), a closely-watched metric that denotes the strength of the business, grew to $1.05 in the fourth quarter, surpassing the previous amount, $0.31, posted a year earlier.But here's the thing: The company is also drowning in losses and warned that it ""may never achieve or maintain profitability."" In 2016 Snapchat said it recorded a loss from operations of $520.4 million, which grew from a loss of $381.7 million in 2015. While the company has, indeed, improved its ARPU, that level of growth has come at great cost.What Can Go Wrong? A Lot.Granted, like most burgeoning young startups, the fact that Snapchat is losing money early in its growth phase is expected. At the same time, however, consider that some 98% of its 2016 revenues came from advertising, suggesting that in order for Snapchat to grow the company will topple the two-headed advertising monsters in Facebook and Google. And that's a daunting task, especially considering the fact that Snapchat's user growth hasn't been extraordinary.While the company does boast 158 million daily active users, which Snapchat called a ""critical measure"" of user engagement, growth was flat in the fourth quarter. And this was preceded by only 7% user growth between the second and third quarters of 2016. Was it coincidence that between the second and third quarter Facebook launched Instagram Stories, which some analysts describe as a Snapchat-like feature? It could be. But it also underscores how Facebook still controls certain levers.Bottom Line For SNAP StockAnd while Snapchat does have an attractive demographic of young users, the company warned that its teen demographic is not ""brand loyal"" and could shift attention to another platform. For now, Snapchat is saying all of the right things and disclosing concerns investors might have before buying into the stock. And, yes, these disclosures could just be standard operating procedure prior to an IPO. But the company could also be telling the truth.As such, the fact that Snapchat is burning through cash hand-over-fist, while user growth has slowed is too reminiscent of Twitter for me to get excited about its prospects. Even more ominous is the reality that Snapchat must beat Facebook and Google on their home turf to stop the bleeding. Yeah, good luck with that.Risks To Consider: The strong popularity in Snapchat has already generated tons of excitement in SNAP's IPO. But the company must separate itself from the hype and prove it is a money-making franchise -- one that can sustain itself amid strong competition from incumbents like Facebook and Google. Likewise, cash is going to be an issue as the company must spend to innovate and grow.Action To Take: Avoid the IPO and wait for the exuberance to taper off. Keep an eye on the high range relative to where the company priced the shares on the day of the offering. Price-to-sales ratio will be a key factor when comparing Snapchat's valuation to that of Facebook.This article was originally posted on StreetAuthority.com."

4047127,98016,2017-02-17T09:01:04-05:00,"Snap set to sell $3.7B in IPO very near last private financing round in May 2016 (~$18B post-money).Negative Snap IPO press (slowing growth, lack of profitability, valuation multiple, competitive intrusion, and non-voting stock offering) could create a buying opportunity to ""get in at last round"".Question for a savvy investor is what price WOULD Snap be attractive at, and what do you have to believe in order for Snap to get there?Early selling shareholder proceeds detailed (spoiler: huge early VC wins).","I've heard great investors get greedy when others are fearful, so the generally fearful Snap (NYSE:SNAP) IPO sentiment could present a buying opportunity for investors to potentially ""get in"" close to Snap's prior private round prices which should help offset many of Snap's well-documented investment considerations.I previously covered my estimates of Snap's IPO filing range (I estimated around $15-16) and anticipated aftermarket trading range ($20-25) in a previous article. Snap filed a second amendment to its IPO S-1 filing with a proposed offering range lower than expected at $14-16 per share, valuing Snap at ~$18-20B, well below the $25B target supposedly pointed to by management and not a far uptick from Snap's Series F in May 2016 of $1.8B at an $18B post-money value.Since Snap's initial S-1 filing, there has been resounding press coverage, the majority focused on Snap's downsides:That's a lot of negativity to digest. However, I took a step back and asked, ""If someone offered me the chance to invest in Snapchat at the same price that institutional investors like General Atlantic, Sequoia, T. Rowe, Lone Pine, Glade Brook Capital, and Fidelity invested at about a year ago (presumably after taking a deeper diligence dive of Snap's data and plans), would I take it?""For analysis's sake, let's say Snap prices at $16 per share and comes out flat in aftermarket trading affording the chance to get in close to Snap's prior valuation: What do you have to believe to suggest it could get to $20+, providing an investor a 25%+ return on its way to becoming a $24B+ company?What kind of revenue would support a $24B+ valuation under average valuations in the space? Publicly traded online media companies growing revenue at least 10% annually (i.e. GOOGL, FB, RATE, ZG, XOXO, NFLX, YELP) have average one-year forward revenue multiples of 3.5x to 5.5x (though can be above 9x). Assuming Snap eventually trades in this normalized multiple range, to achieve a $24B valuation Snap would need revenue of $4B to $7B. Snap will own ~1.5% market share by the end of 2017 with its $1.1-1.2B estimated revenue, and this base market share should grow organically by 30% from general market growth. Snap will also likely continue increasing market share. To get to $4B revenue, Snap would only need to increase its market share in 2018 to 3.5%, in 2019, would only need to get to 2.7% share, and in 2020, would only need to get to 2.0% share, or 0.5% more than it has at 2017 year-end.From a bottoms-up revenue build, below is a revenue sensitivity illustrating what Snap's daily active users and average revenue per user on an annual basis would have to be to get to $4B+ in revenue.When Snap gets to Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) ARPU levels (should happen within the next 18-24 months), Snap would need (to get to $4B in revenue) 250M daily active users (DAU), which is 91M more DAU than it has today. Snap averaged adding 13M new DAU per quarter over the last four quarters, but only added a net 6M DAU in its last quarter, suggesting that, to get 91M additional DAU, it would take 1.8-3.5 years.To summarize, if you believe Snap can continue taking market share close to its current rate of adding ~1.5% share every 12-18 months, Snap should own $4B in revenue by mid-2019. That would afford Snap a $20/share value by mid-2018. Similarly, if you believe Snap can quickly scale to Twitter or Facebook-level ARPUs (Snap's engagement stats suggest it should get somewhere in-between relatively quickly), then Snap only needs to add 40-90M additional DAU, which at today's net add pace would take 2-3 years, supporting $4B in Snap revenue visibility by mid-2019. Again, forward valuation on that would afford Snap $20+ price by mid-2018.All this to say, if Snap stumbles out of the gates and hovers close to $16-18 in trading, I'd seriously consider rolling the dice on investment as it seems only a matter of time for Snap to grow into its originally targeted valuation closer to $20-22 per share. And let's not forget the benefits that come to those who invest before they know a company is a sure-fire winner:Selling Shareholder Detail; Early VC Investor CoupsThis latest amendment also detailed sales by selling shareholders, which I've summarized below:Big selling shareholder winners coming out of this IPO look to be co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, each looking to gross $224-256M by selling 7% of their total shares held, all without diluting any of their 89% voting power currently enjoyed. Evan and Robert will each retain $3.0-3.4B in share value (at $14-16 share value).Snap's early investors looking to realize great IPO windfalls include Benchmark Capital (selling 8% of shares held for gross IPO proceeds of $150-171M) and Lightspeed Venture Partners (selling 5% of shares held for a gross $65-74M). Benchmark will retain shares with a value of $1.7-1.9B after IPO (at $14-16 share value) and Lightspeed will retain shares with a value of $1.1-1.3B.As a friendly FYI of how much better your life would be as a Benchmark partner or investor, Benchmark's fund VII was a $425M fund raised in January 2011, which means that its IPO gross proceeds from Snap for sold shares will return 35-40% of its entire fund, with the retained value (at IPO offer prices - will likely pop) representing 4.0-4.6x the value of its entire fund. Snap alone will return Benchmark's fund VII by a total of 4.3x to +5.0x alone (27-30% IRR for an entire fund from a single investment). Lightspeed also doing well, with Snap looking to return 1.8x to +2.0x its Fund IX ($675M raised January 2012).Looking forward to Snap's roadshow, which is said to kick off Friday in the Mid-Atlantic, with a target trading date of March 2. I look forward to seeing post-IPO trading to gauge how well my initial estimates track."
4046831,41741,2017-02-16T14:52:19-05:00,"Snap could be the biggest IPO in three years.But could this be another busted IPO?If Snap is more than just a fad, it still pays to avoid the IPO.","Snap, Inc. (Pending:SNAP) is the parent company of disappearing message app Snapchat that will hit the public markets next month. Its valuation, like many hot tech IPOs, will be rich. However, this could be investors' chance to tap into the millennial generation and the hot social media trend.Snap is expected to come in at a $25 billion valuation, more than twice the market cap that Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) currently trades. Yet, it's been a quiet year for IPOs, which means the demand from investors is in Snap's favor. Still - are investors hungry enough to pay 60x sales for Snap shares? When Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) trades at less than 15x and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at 6x.Is it possible that Snap turns out to be a ""busted"" IPO, where daily user growth is slowing and competitors like Facebook and Instagram are rolling out their own versions of Snap stories? Snap is likely feeling the competitive pressures, as the Instagram Stories launch coincides with slowing Snapchat user growth. Snap realizes it's now or never for an IPO.But the bigger issue, which could be attractive for an activist investor, is that Snap founders are keeping almost total control of Snap following the IPO. Granted, an activist getting enough of a stake to really shakes things up might be difficult.The big play for investors could be playing wait-and-see. Snap could end up much like the last major tech IPO - Facebook. Shares of Facebook faltered after its IPO, soon falling below the offering price. At the time of its IPO, Facebook also was generating 10 times the sales that Snap is today.Snap's IPO paperwork, the Form S-1 from earlier this month, wasn't all that great either. In part, investors are realizing that it's not Facebook. Snap already is seeing slowing user growth - with user growth coming in at 3.3% in 4Q, down from 7% growth in 3Q.Yet, for the first two quarters of 2016, daily users grew over 15%. Recall that stalling user growth and inability to fully monetize users has been the downfall of Twitter - as shares are now well off the $26 iPO price.Activist opportunity?Then, of course, there's the corporate governance issue at Snap. Snap is issuing non-voting shares in its IPO. An unusual move for a U.S. IPO. In fact, they'll be the first company ever to issue non-voting shares in an IPO.Co-founders will have voting control of nearly 90% of shares. No one has a say in board members and it will be rather insulated from an activist. This type of structure is troubling, as outside shareholders would have no voice at all. While there's never been a non-voting IPO issuance, there have been dual-class IPOs, and many of these companies underperform. Consider Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), all of which are off more than 70% from their IPOs.The expected Snap IPO welcoming might not be joyous - in the interim that is. In the short term, it wil likely move higher as investors are hungry for tech IPOs. But the longer-term viability of its business model - where it's already spending two times its revenues in costs - is questionable. Getting ad dollars and figuring out monetization for social is tough, as seen with Twitter. Activist investors can target companies with dual-class and unequal structures, although it's not easy, but for a non-voting class, it's nearly impossible. There will be virtually no accountability for management. The Snap IPO remains questionable in the rapidly changing tech scene."
4046164,21136,2017-02-15T09:21:20-05:00,"Snap IPO filing has finally been released to the public; reaction from investors is mixed. The company expects to raise $4B and be valued at between $25B and $35B.Slowdown in growth rate, high net losses and nearly total voting control by founders are among our chief concerns.With much uncertainty and several red flags, we are hesitant on this IPO. We look forward to watching the deal develop.","After much anticipation, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of messaging app Snapchat, has publicly released its IPO filing through the SEC. Snap Inc. is expected to be the biggest technology IPO since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in 2012. However, reaction from investors on the deal is mixed. The company hopes to raise $4B through the sale of its shares, which would give the company a valuation of between $25B and $35B and could go public as early as March (an exact date has not yet been determined).Although most people think of Snap Inc. as a social media app, the company describes itself in its SEC filing as a camera company which believes that ""reinventing the camera represents its greatest opportunity."" Snap Inc. changed its name from Snapchat last year as it sought to transition away from being just a mobile app and prepared to introduce new products, such as its camera-equipped sunglasses, Spectacles, which were released in September.The company had filed confidentially last year for its IPO. Under the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Act, companies with less than $1B in annual revenue can file its IPO with regulators ahead of its release to the public. This gives the company a window of time between the SEC getting the documents to when they are then available to all investors.Business Overview(Image Source)Snap Inc. is best known for its Snapchat app, which enables users to send disappearing videos, photos and messages to one another. The app was first launched in July 2011 and in one year had over 30 million users. In October 2012, the company launched on Android phones which significantly increased its user base. Since its beginning, the company has been adding additional features to its app. In 2013, users were able to send video messages for the first time. Additional features include: 'stories' which enables users to upload and watch a series of short video clips from friends and group chat for messaging with multiple users.In September 2016, Snap Inc. began selling camera-equipped sunglasses called Spectacles in pop-up vending machines and in its retail store in New York. There was much hype surrounding the sunglasses when they were first released, but interest has since waned with its New York store mostly empty. The company says Spectacles have not generated significant revenue for the company and said in its filing that it plans to increase distribution in 2017.The company is based in Venice, California, and as of December 31, 2016, had 1,859 employees. Employees who work at the company describe the culture as highly secretive with little communication between different groups.Management and InvestorsCEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Bobby Murphy co-founded the company when they were studying at Sanford University. Since then it has raised over $2.63 billion in seven rounds of funding. Investors include Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Coatue Management, Institutional Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Yahoo! and others.In the SEC, the two founders, Spiegel and Murphy, report selling an aggregate of $16.2 million worth of shares in September 2016, about a month before they first filed its IPO documents. Spiegel's compensation package in 2016 was $2.4 million.Revenue and User BaseIn 2014, the company launched its first ad on the app. Snap Inc. generates the majority of its revenue through ads and has been growing revenue at an impressive rate. The company generated $404.5M in revenue in 2016, more than six times the $58.7M generated in 2015, and it has an expected revenue target of $1B for 2017. The company incurred net losses of $514.6M and $372.9M in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although net losses are normal for startups, Snap's are quite large, with the cost of revenue being higher than revenue in 2016 (see below).(S-1/A Filing)The company has also been quickly growing its daily active user base, although a slowdown in growth rate raises concern. For the last quarter ended December 31, 2016, Snap Inc. had 158M active users on its app. This was a 3.2% increase from Q32016 whereas daily active users grew by 7% from Q2106 to Q32016 (see chart below). On a positive note, users of the app are very active. The average user opens Snapchat 18 times a day and uses it for 25 to 30 minutes.The slowdown in growth rate for Snap Inc. comes as its competitor Facebook and Instagram are launching products, which mimic Snapchat. Additionally, the majority of Snap's users are between 18 and 34 years old, which is a demographic that tends to be less brand loyal and more likely to switch from trend to trend.(S-1/A Filing)An additional concern is the continued control the two founders will have post-IPO. Together they hold approximately 89 percent of voting shares, and the company is issuing non-voting shares in its IPO; a move that is unprecedented in a U.S. initial public offering and has made some investors wary.ConclusionThere has been much hype surrounding Snap's IPO but also concern about the huge net losses and slowing growth rate of users. Investors are unsure whether Snap will become the next Facebook or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and whether its current valuation is justified.Activity in the IPO market has picked up somewhat in 2017; however, with AppDynamics' (Pending:APPD) and Mauser Group's (Pending:MSR) pre-IPO acquisitions, deal flow is still a bit scattered.Snap's IPO performance will serve as a strong signal to other startups, like Airbnb (AIRB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER), on whether to go public.At its current estimate valuation we are very cautious on this IPO, but look forward to watching the deal develop.Don Dion's IPO Insights provides up-to-date information and analysis on the major IPOs each week, along with additional opportunities to invest and short these stocks at their quiet period and lockup period expirations, respectively.

4045821,101576,2017-02-14T13:09:56-05:00,"Snap Inc.'s IPO does not provide investors voting rights.This is unprecedented and will permanently lower the bar for corporate governance in U.S. stock markets.BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink recently has made bold pledges to stand up for shareholder rights with votes.If there's no vote available for BlackRock as a shareholder of Snap, is Snap investible for BlackRock?","- BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, Letter to CEOs of S&P 500 Companies, January 23, 2017The feedback so far about the plan of Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the parent of Snapchat, to not provide voting rights to public investors at IPO, if you believe the bloggersphere, media reports, and good governance-types, has been controversial if not negative.Considering Snap's boldness in this denial of shareholder voting rights, it is likely the IPO promoters will dismiss this carping by Lilliputian funds as inconsequential to the success of their expected $3 billion mega IPO.However, what if a giant investor like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) were to decline participation in Snap's IPO because of this denial of voting rights for Board members, and a merger or sale of the company? Would that make a difference?The answer is it might. While BlackRock's passive index funds would normally wait to invest until Snap's inclusion in an index, its actively-managed institutional equity funds with assets under management of $120 billion as of the end of 2016, could decline to participate in Snap's IPO.The reason: The lack of shareholder voting rights, which CEO Fink publicly stated BlackRock might like to utilize as a fiduciary acting on behalf of clients.BlackRock's public stance on Snap's IPO could have a serious impact on investor sentiment and compel Snap to rethink withholding voting rights. Such a public declaration also might cast some doubt on BlackRock's massive equity index funds ($1.36 trillion) future investment in Snap's stock. This is material as BlackRock in total reportedly owns 5.67% or $1.79 billion of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock, frequently compared to Snap.This is a historic test. If BlackRock becomes a bystander to the shareholder unfriendly terms of Snapchat's mega IPO - the first U.S. public company in memory to withhold shareholder voting rights at IPO - then the bar for corporate governance on U.S. stock markets will be set lower, permanently. Other issuers will be tempted to follow Snap's lead and cause further damage to corporate governance standards in U.S. stock markets.This puts CEO Fink in a difficult position. He has publicly pledged to BlackRock clients to act as a fiduciary on corporate governance with BlackRock's vote, yet there won't be a vote in the case of Snap. Meanwhile, BlackRock's index funds, if they follow precedent, will mechanically buy Snap stock upon inclusion in an index, probably not long after the IPO, due to an expected market capitalization of $25 billion upon its market debut.Expecting the major index providers - Standard & Poor's (S&P), Nasdaq, Russell, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MSCI), and the Financial Times (FT) - to find the moral strength to exclude companies from their indexes in order to prevent lowering the bar for corporate governance in the U.S. has never been a winning bet.Undoubtedly, CEO Fink and BlackRock, fortified by a small army of lawyers' skillful parsing, could presumably shake loose from their public pledges to pursuing good corporate governance through shareholder votes, quietly participate in the Snap IPO, buy on index inclusion, and bear with the lack of voting rights.Presumably, these same BlackRock lawyers also could create a pre-requisite that even its index funds require the availability of voting rights to exercise their fiduciary duties, and cite the unprecedented case of Snap as the cause of this change. That would send a powerful message heard around the world.If BlackRock becomes an investor in Snap, BlackRock shareholders and clients would be owed an explanation from CEO Fink of how exercising fiduciary duties through ""voice"" and ""vote"" - which he declared less than a month ago - is reconciled when a public company does not provide BlackRock the ""vote."" It would be assumed this creates the opportunity now for BlackRock's ""voice"" to be heard.Yet, so far, BlackRock has been mum. It was absent as a signatory of a February 3 letter to Snap from the Council of Institutional Investors (NYSE:CII) about the lack of voting rights. The CII letter was signed by other Associate Members with the same standing as BlackRock.So much has been, and will be, gained by BlackRock continuing to stand up for corporate governance for long-term shareholder value in the U.S. and globally, including in Greater China where we have witnessed their considerable influence. CEO Fink's vocal public leadership on corporate governance has been admirable and has helped BlackRock outdo its peers, Vanguard, Fidelity, and State Street, on this score.Now shareholders are at a juncture where much of this progress in corporate governance could be stalled without BlackRock sustaining its leadership in institutional shareholder influence. BlackRock should retain its ""vote,"" and not lose its ""voice,"" regarding this historic denial of shareholder voting rights."

        Snap’s NOPAT fell from -$344 million in 2015 to -$498 million in 2016.
        For those thinking Snap could be the next Facebook the comparisons are thin. A closer look at Snap’s S-1 reveals that Twitter is the only comp that makes sense.","As Snap's IPO approaches, investors point to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as good comps. A closer look at Snap's S-1 reveals that Twitter is the only comp that makes sense given Snap's negative profitability, nosebleed valuation, and questionable disclosure practices. For these reasons and more, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is in the Danger Zone this week.Snap's Secret? Major Cash LossesIn what began under a shroud of secrecy, Snap filed IPO documents confidentially with the SEC. Many investment banks were denied access to the documents. Snap also threatened to cut underwriters' fees if confidential information was released without the company's blessing.What is Snap hiding? If you have good stuff to show the world, wouldn't you want to show it?Since the release of Snap's S-1 late Thursday afternoon, the answer to ""what is Snap hiding"" appears simple: major profit losses. Per Figure 1, Snap's net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) fell from -$344 million in 2015 to -$498 million in 2016. Meanwhile, revenue grew from $59 million to $404 million, or 590% over the same time.Figure 1: SNAP's Profitless Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsNot surprising, SNAP's losses coincide with a highly negative NOPAT margin of -123% and a bottom-quintile return on invested capital (ROIC) of -34%. While still in its early stages, Snap's expenses are a concern. In 2016, the company's cost of revenue was actually greater than its overall revenue. No matter how many users Snap touts or how fast those users are growing, it's clear the current business model is no Facebook model.Even Non-GAAP Metrics Can't Hide LossesNon-GAAP metrics are a red flag for investors because they often mask the true economics of the business. Snap uses adjusted EBITDA in its S-1, but even that metric cannot mask the large losses of the firm. The largest item removed from adjusted EBITDA is stock-based compensation expense. Snap removed $73 million (124% of 2015 revenue) and $32 million (8% of 2016 revenue) in stock-based compensation expense in 2015 and 2016.Even after this adjustment, Snap's adjusted EBITDA was -$459 million in 2016, compared to -$515 million GAAP net income. Nevertheless, we warn investors against trusting that metric even if it does turn positive at some point in the future.Snap Faces Competition From the Social Media GiantsSnap management like to pitch the company as the next Facebook, but we think that goal is a lot easier to voice than it is to achieve. Claiming to be the next Facebook is a great way to sell your valuation. In reality, Snap is the next Facebook competitor, which has proven to be fatal for some businesses.Despite Snap's claims to be a camera company, the firm's heavy reliance on advertising dollars (96% of 2016 revenue) pits it against some of the largest media/internet firms in the market. Specifically, Snap faces competition from Facebook , Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Twitter , and, if Snap is truly a camera company, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). Per Figure 2, Snap's -123% NOPAT margin places it well below its main competitors.Figure 2: Snap's Negative Profitability Lags All CompetitionSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsIn addition to operating with drastically lower margins, Snap faces an uphill battle in regards to its user base, aka daily active users (DAU). This calculation avoids easy comparison to previous Danger Zone pick Twitter, which discloses monthly active users but not individual DAUs. However, Bloomberg estimates that as of 3Q16, Twitter had 136 million DAUs.Facebook uses DAU to measure its user base and it dwarfs Snap and Twitter, per Figure 3. Facebook's daily active users reached 1.17 billion in 3Q16 compared to just 153 million for Snap. Through 4Q16, Facebook's DAUs have grown to 1.22 billion and Snap's have grown to 158 million. It's worth noting that Facebook reported 526 million DAUs in the last quarter before it went public. Is Snap more like Twitter rather than Facebook? It would appear Snap shares more similarities with the former than management would like to admit.Figure 3: Snap's DAUs Closer To Twitter Than Facebook* Twitter DAUs taken from Bloomberg estimate in June 2016Sources: New Constructs, LLC, Bloomberg, and company filingsUpside? Valuation Already Pricing In That Snap Is The Next FacebookInvestors are always looking for the ""next Google"" or ""next Apple."" In other words, they're looking for a firm that will disrupt an existing market and greatly reward shareholders along the way as stock prices soar. In Snap's case, investors are betting on the company becoming the ""next Facebook"" even though Facebook is one of, if not, the most successful social media companies in the market today.The comparisons to Facebook make some sense. Snap and Facebook each compete for user engagement and must find ways to monetize those users. Furthermore, with Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, the firms compete directly in the ""photo-capture"" aspects of mobile applications and social media. For those thinking Snap could be the next Facebook, though, the comparisons stop there.First, when Facebook went public it was a profitable firm. In 2012, Facebook's NOPAT was $1.1 billion and the company achieved a 21% NOPAT margin. Since then, Facebook has continued to grow its revenue, user base, and improve margins.Second, to become the next Facebook, Snap would ultimately need to take market share from the highly successful incumbent. To take share from Facebook, Snap must either (1) charge less, (2) provide more value for the same or higher price or (3) both. While option one is certainly viable, as Snap directly controls its product pricing, it does little to improve already negative margins. At the same time, engaging in a pricing war with profitable competitors makes it hard to ever believe Snap can reach breakeven.Option 2, provide more value than Facebook ads, seems unlikely in the near-term. Within Snap's S-1, the company provides the Advertisers Perceptions' September 2016 Report, which examines advertiser and agency perceptions of different advertising platforms. While Snap ranked first in ""satisfaction rating"", it ranked fourth in ""Plans to Increase Ad Spend"", behind YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. If Snap plans to provide greater value, it has yet to convince advertisers as they're still choosing competing platforms ahead of Snap.Lastly, and most importantly, SNAP's expected IPO valuation already implies that the firm will grow into the next Facebook. This expectation leaves room for little upside but large downside risk.$25 Billion Valuation Implies Facebook-Like Profit GrowthIt's clear Snap's unprofitable business is in the early stages of its development. However, we can still model multiple scenarios that quantify the expectations already baked into the firm's expected $25 billion valuation.It's also worth noting that each of these scenarios assumes SNAP is able to grow revenue and NOPAT/free cash flow without spending on working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create very optimistic scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations in the current valuation are. For reference, SNAP's invested capital grew $800 million from 2015-2016. It's clear to see that the expectations already embedded in SNAP's valuation are much too high.Over-Hyped IPO Could Set Shares Up for FailureUltimately, Snap's success will be determined by its ability to attract advertising revenue in a highly competitive market. We've seen Twitter fail to monetize its user base while Facebook flourishes. At the same time, Facebook continues to grow its user base while Twitter struggles to maintain high user growth rates. With the hype and attention SNAP's IPO is receiving, the firm will be hard pressed to meet or beat expectations from the get-go.As soon as investors get the idea that Snap is more like Twitter than Facebook, we think SNAP's current valuation could crater.Disclosure Red Flags:Investors Have No Say On Important MattersAs an ""emerging growth company,"" Snap is exempt from standard requirements related to executive compensation. These exemptions include holding advisory votes on executive compensation and providing information regarding the ratio of CEO pay compared to compensation of other employees. These minimized disclosure requirements are a red flag for investors, as they reduce transparency into how executives are incentivized.Additionally, the share structure disadvantages IPO investors. After IPO, Snap will have three share classes. The A shares being sold to the public are entitled to no vote on matters submitted to stockholders. Snap is going public and enjoying the benefits of an IPO (influx of cash) while giving away zero voting power to new investors. Instead, the co-founders of Snap and existing private shareholders will retain all voting power in the newly public company.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to the financial statements in Snap's S-1:Income Statement: we made $210 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $167 million in non-operating income (41% of revenue). We removed $188 million related to non-operating income and $22 million related to non-operating expenses. See all the adjustments made to SNAP's income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $696 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $94 million. The most notable adjustment was $299 million (19% of reported net assets) related to operating leases. See all adjustments to SNAP's balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $807 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $807 million. There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was $492 million in outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represents 2% of SNAP's expected market valuation.This article originally published here on February 6, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Kyle Martone receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
4046620,102820,2017-02-16T08:45:45-05:00,Snap Inc. is losing significant amounts of money and showing no signs of being profitable in the near term.Daily Active Users (arguably the most important metric in measuring social media companies) are already showing signs of stalling.Hype around Snap’s upcoming IPO could further inflate its already lofty valuation.Snap's floating stock situation could breed volatility.,"With the release of Snap Inc.'s (NYSE:SNAP) S-1, we've finally been given a much needed look inside Snapchat's operating activities. After propping open the hood and taking a look inside, what did we find? Not the darling with claims of being the next great tech company. While Snap showed incredible revenue growth of 590% from 2015 to 2016, it still managed to face a net loss. 2015 and 2016 net losses were $373M and $515M, respectively.Before claiming Snapchat is the next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), let's take a step back and consider a few things. Facebook went public with revenue of $3.71B and net income of $1B. Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) last full-year revenue before its offering was $317M. However, it had a net loss of $79.4M (and has yet to have a profitable year). Snapchat faces a myriad of threats and uncertainties down the road, and from what we've seen so far, it draws more comparisons to Twitter than Facebook.Identity IssuesWhen I first heard that Snap was touting itself as a camera company, I instantly thought of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). When GoPro went public, it pitched itself to investors as a media company first, and a consumer electronics brand second. What happened? The Street bought it. GoPro surged post-IPO as investors chased what they believed would be a sprawling media company. GoPro's EV-to-Revenues went north of 10 and its EV-to-EBITDA shot over 120. Investors were expecting major growth, and when that didn't come, share prices dropped quickly. What Snap is currently doing appears to be eerily similar to what GoPro did. What it calls itself and what it actually is are two completely different things. Snap is a social media company that sells ads to its advertising partners. Its only hardware product, Spectacles, had non-material revenue in 2016. With worldwide ad spending projected to increase nearly 3x to $196B between now and 2020, it seems foolish for Snap to be wasting money developing gimmicky glasses. The bulk of Snapchat's user base is 18-34 year olds, a demographic known for lacking brand loyalty. Millennials also are up to date with the latest fashion trends and lack the disposable income that other demographics have. Spending over $200 on a pair of bulky Spectacles doesn't strike me as something I see myself, or my friends doing anytime soon. While innovation is important and the key to longevity in tech, it's equally important for Snap to maintain its identity. Adding hardware to its business model brings about a whole different slew of operating hurdles. While I don't believe any single product flop will hurt Snap's long-term potential, I do believe the decision to develop products of this nature is concerning going forward. Blowing capital on R&D projects such as these is alarming. Bringing new users to the platform and innovating the way people interact with ads should be its preeminent concern.(Source: CNET.com)Stalling DAU growthArguably the most important metric Snapchat will be judged on a quarterly basis will be Daily Active Users (DAUs). This metric is essential in monitoring user growth. Increasing the reach of the platform is the easiest way for Snap to further top-line growth. Snapchat's Q4 2016 DAUs were 161M, up from 154M in Q3. Facebook had over 8x that amount, posting 1.23B DAUs during December of 2016. Twitter, which only reports MAUs, had 319M. While year-over-year growth is still strong, growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis is coming to screeching halt. Snapchat has seen a decline in growth for three of the past four quarters. Q1-Q4 2016 growth rates were 18%, 14%, 4%, and 5%, respectively.(Original Content, Data from Snap Inc.)Furthermore, growth in North America (Snap's most lucrative market) is also stalling and appears to be approaching a ceiling. While only 43% of the user base hails from North America, roughly 88% of Snap's revenue comes from there. Q4 2016 average revenue was $2.15 per user in North America vs. $1.05 worldwide. Average revenue per user for Europe and the rest of the world was $0.28 and $0.15, respectively. In the same quarter, Facebook posted average revenue per user of $4.83 (worldwide), over 400% greater than that of Snap's. If Snap can continue to grow revenue and keep costs down, it could make for a compelling investment. However, I have my reservations. In Snap's S-1, it mentions no plans to slow down expenses; it can be expected that going forward (at least in the short term), costs will be steadily above revenue.(Original Content, Data from Snap Inc.)Despite stalling growth in DAUs, Snap is doing an excellent job of growing average revenue per user. Unique advertising strategies such as Sponsored Geofilters and Sponsored Lenses are behind this. If Snap can continue to find ways to simultaneously increase user satisfaction while pleasing advertising partners, we can expect these numbers to continue to grow.(Source: Snap Inc.)Too much hype too soon?It's not uncommon for companies with familiar names, those that are often pop-culture hits, to see a massive run in share price following their IPO. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), GoPro, and Twitter all had extraordinary hype around their IPOs. These companies skyrocketed post offering, trading to levels that valued the companies, in some instances, over 10x that of their current market cap. These frothy valuations, mixed with irrational exuberance, is something to be mindful of before getting wrapped up in the hype. Investors are always searching for growth but let's remember a few things, specifically in the case of Snapchat, that a good product doesn't always make a good business. Furthermore, a good business doesn't always make a rational investment. Growth must come at a reasonable price, and I fear this may not be the case for Snap.Despite fundamental warning signs throughout Snap's S-1 and concerns about future profitability, it's entirely possible we see a massive run-up post-IPO. If this happens, there are a few things we must remember in trading during the weeks and months after the offering. First, Snap is more comparable to Twitter than Facebook. It has said in regards to future earnings that it ""may never achieve or maintain profitability."" Let's not forget about apps like Yik Yak, which garnered a $400M valuation in late 2014 before falling off the face of the earth.(Source: Appannie.com)With Instagram introducing stories and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expanding the functionality of iMessage, Snapchat will see increasing threats targeted at all angles of its business.The FloatSnap currently has Class A, B, and C shares. Class A common stock, which will be sold in the offering, has no voting power; there are 512,527,443 shares outstanding. There are 283,817,489 Class B shares outstanding which have one vote. Each Class C share of common stock is entitled to 10 votes; there are 215,887,848 shares outstanding. There are roughly 1B total shares outstanding. Based on its current $25B valuation and Snap's intentions to raise $3B in the equity market, it can be inferred that approximately 12% of the shares outstanding will be offered to the public. Snap's IPO is for Class A common stock exclusively. We can assume that some amount of shares in the range of 130-150M will be offered. Snap has yet to release the exact amount of shares for sale in the offering. Snap also has reserved 355,522,498 Class A shares for future issuances under its 2017 Plan.Herein lies the rub. A small float, lots of hype, and questionable fundamentals have conceived a potential monster, that being volatility. With a smaller number of available shares to trade, moves in stock price can be exaggerated causing excessive gyrations in price. Any news that the street perceives as slightly positive could send Snap soaring. This ranges from sell-side upgrades, encouraging notes from company insiders, insider buying, etc. With a low float, shock on supply and demand can be momentous. A perceived positive news event could cause a strong surge in buyers. This increase in demand to buy the stock will inevitably push the stock price higher. The issue lies in the amount of stock available to be purchased. This is where low floating stock can become a problem. With so many buyers and such few sellers, the market will force the price beyond what may be reasonable from a fundamental point of view. However, like short squeezes, these moves in share price are forced by supply and demand and are logical from a technical standpoint. After an event like this, something as simple as a small miss in quarterly earnings can send the stock crashing back to reality.ConclusionSnap Inc. is not a company I believe is a rational investment on a fundamental level at this stage in its business and at its current valuation. However, I do believe certain psychological and technical aspects of this IPO set up some intriguing short opportunities if circumstances prevail and exceedingly increase the valuation of Snap."
4046702,101421,2017-02-16T11:46:11-05:00,"Social sharing and communications company Snap has filed terms for its $3 billion IPO.The company is growing rapidly, but management wants investors to pay too dearly for its revenue growth.My advice is for risk-averse investors to AVOID the IPO, as a potentially better entry point may occur after the first few reporting periods.","Quick TakeCommunications app and camera company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has set proposed terms for its $3 billion IPO, aiming to sell 200 million shares of its Class A common stock for a midpoint price of $15 per share.The company intends to value itself at approximately $20 billion, which represents a nearly 50x Price/Sales multiple based on trailing 12-month revenues.In my view, that multiple isn't warranted, especially when compared to industry heavyweight Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) 14x multiple.Risk-averse investors should avoid the overvalued IPO and watch the stock for potential buying opportunities after the first few reporting periods.CompanySnap offers a group of communications applications and a ""Spectacles"" device that enable users to snap photos or short videos, personalize and share them with others.Snap management views the camera as their primary use for mobile devices and the business model is mostly advertising driven, with a currently small amount of revenue coming from product sales of its 'Spectacles' device.Below is a brief explainer video of Snap Spectacles:&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;(Source:Mashable)Snap has raised more than $2.6 billion from private investors, some of which are selling a portion of their shares in the IPO.IPO Details and CommentaryI previously covered Snap's pending IPO in my article, Snap Files to Go Public in $3 Billion IPO.Notably, of the 200 million total Class A shares being offered in the IPO, 55 million are being sold by the founders and early investors in the company.145 million shares are being offered by the company at a $15 midpoint for gross proceeds of $2.175 billion, subject to the usual overallotment options provided to the underwriters.Furthermore, the founders Evan Siegel and Robert Murphy are retaining a small portion of Class B stock and 50% each of Class C stock, so together they will retain 88.5% voting control of the company post-IPO, even if they are no longer with the company.Management did not provide any details as to how it would use the proceeds from the offering other than for general corporate purposes.Snap's user base is still growing rapidly. As of December 31, 2016 it counted 158 million Daily Active Users, which represented an increase of 48% vs. the same date in 2015.Global Average Revenue per User has also grown, from $0.05 in 1Q 2015 to $1.05 in 4Q 2016. By comparison, Facebook's global ARPU was $15.98 in 4Q 2016.However, the company's presence has primarily been in North America and has only had token usage in Europe and the rest of the world.This has become a source of concern, because competitor Facebook has rolled out similar features such as 'Stories' across its entire global platform, potentially denying Snap growth potential outside North America.At the proposed share price range, Snap intends to value itself at between $19.5 billion to $22.2 billion, at the lower range of previous 'whisper' reports during the company's roadshow.At this valuation, it would be a slight increase over its most recent private valuation of $17.8 billion per investor Fidelity's mark in 4Q 2016.At a $20 billion valuation and with Snap's trailing 12-month revenues of $405 million, management is indicating a Price/Sales multiple of 49x.Although numerous press reports have implied a goal of forward 12-month revenues of $1 billion, even at that lofty growth rate, management is still asking investors to pay a 20x multiple.Given Facebook's current multiple of 13.95x trailing 12-month revenues, even a 20x seems too rich for my taste.Accordingly, for risk-averse investors, my opinion is to avoid the IPO and adopt a wait-and-see approach.Based on the company's first few reporting periods as a public company, there may be a buying opportunity six to ten months post-IPO at a better entry point.I write about IPOs, secondaries, and M&A deals.

4047540,76115,2017-02-20T09:00:00-05:00,"Snap Inc is ready to IPO.Like many of its social media cousins and IPO brethren before it, it will likely take off on the tails of hype, a small float, and ""the next big thing"".I realized there is an opportunity here in IPO land - still - after finding many people calling to short it out of the gate.Do not short Snap out of the gate! Ride it up; then do as you wish but I'll offer you my strategy.","Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), the closely named parent company of Snapchat, has set forth its final approach for IPO. Data, information, financials, and valuations abound! Another unicorn takes the stage - short it they say! It has no place in the tens of billions in valuation! I mean for crying out loud the expected $20-22B valuation puts it in the range of hotel companies like Hilton (NYSE:HLT) and memory and chip makers like Micron (NASDAQ:MU). This is a clear and obvious short, no questions asked!Whoa, wait a minute.No questions asked? Are you sure about that?I'm not. Why would you intentionally throw your money away and possibly have to own up more than you can afford with a strategy potentially putting you in a financial quandary of unlimited losses?""But, Joe, come on this is obvious! Snapchat is already slowing on the user growth front, it's not profitable, heck it even says don't expect profits now or in the future! They aren't even selling voting right shares, that's never happened at an IPO!""And I would say, ""Yes, you are 100% right.""""Great, then let's short it out of the gate!""Nope, sorry, I still think it's a terrible idea. Let me show you why with a short case study on a few IPOs.Setting The StageI love IPO's. It could just be the new car smell that comes to mind or the idea of young companies allowing me to own a piece of their (expected) growth or simply the rollercoaster ride they create as they hit the secondary market. Whatever it is, these companies and their IPO's create fun charts and could be very profitable for you and I. The best part is it's pretty darn consistent time and time again.There's a few fundamentals these tech IPO's have in common, namely; hype surrounding many people's favorite app or trend, a small float of shares, and huge expected growth in revenue or just huge expectations in general. My fellow contributor Reid Zyniecki wrote an excellent article on these points as they pertain to Snap (go give him a follow, he's earned it), therefore, I'm not going to outline all the details of why Snap meets this criteria. Instead I'm going to focus on the expected track of Snap's stock once the bulls and bears are set loose in several days.Welcome To The StudyMy test subjects are in the form of the following charts and are from the day of their IPO to their height. With some fun, I'm going to do a little blind taste test here. Can you determine what companies these charts belong to?(Source: stockcharts.com)All bets in?That's pretty spectacular. If Snap is anything like a Twitter or a Twilio it has some ride ahead of it.Now I ask you on this end: Do you still want to short it out of the gate? Never mind the fact you probably will have trouble not only finding shares but paying the high borrow rate for an average of 63 days is likely prohibitive. In fact, based on the above charts you should go long for around 63 days. But in any case I strongly suggest not shorting Snap's IPO.At least not right away.""Oh so you will short it?!""Not exactly.I'm not a fan of borrowing something I don't own with something as volatile as a hyped up IPO. I'd rather continue to pay down my student loans, not potentially make my debt pile bigger.Instead, I will sell the initial lot around 63 days after the IPO day and take the profits and buy long(er)-dated puts. These long dated puts will be decently out-of-the-money, simply because there will be less premium and the downside will be large enough to make up for the distance outside-the-money.Distance you ask?The reason for this side of the strategy is the charts of the above stocks look like the following after their height. These are literally a continuation from the charts above, starting the following day.(Source: stockcharts.com)So while they might not come down as quickly as they rose - almost double the time it took to go up - they definitely come down hard with consistent declines; an average loss of 62.5%. Some of these stocks continued to decline in the longer run, such as GoPro and Twitter, while the others either bounced a moderate amount or remained level.What's interesting to note about the rise is it happens well before the 180 day lockup period expiration. For those not familiar with IPO's this is the period where insiders cannot sell following the IPO. After those 180 days insiders can begin selling their shares. Typically, this is an event where traders expect the stock price to fall in anticipation of insiders selling large amounts of shares at much higher prices than the IPO.There is some correlation with this expiration period. While the peaks of the case studies above happened well before expirations - in some cases 145 to 112 days before - the first bottoms in the securities were very near to the lockup. The only exception to this is Twilio which had a fast run-up and a fast decline and is actually rising and well above IPO price as the last few days of its expiration approaches.For the rest, it took an average of 184 days from IPO to first bottom. The problem is the samples are wildly different even after taking out the low case of Twilio. For example, Shake Shak's bottom was 243 days after IPO while Twitter's was 138 days after. Therefore, it's hard to make a case to time the selling of the put strategy to this event but could create a decent checkpoint if one is still holding the bear end of the strategy. That in mind, I will target the loss percentage rather than targeting the time. When it is reached I will sell my puts and lock-in those profits as well.It Could Flop - At Least In Comparison To My AnalysisIt's possible Snap may not act like these famed, hyped IPO's. It could perhaps be a GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) and simply come out of the gate, flounder for a bit and find itself two years later at a respectable 83% gain.The problem is Snap isn't a domain registrar and web hosting company (arguably boring). Snap provides a millennial crazed, addictive app near the height of its growth - claiming a 589% year-over-year revenue increase between 2015 and 2016.On the other hand, Snap could wind up being a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and stumble out of the gate and drop to half its IPO price before gaining the confidence of Wall St. and exploding, but only after 434 days as a public company.The key differences between these two scenarios are simple, however. GoDaddy wasn't exciting and was coming off 23% revenue growth as it headed into its IPO. Facebook had the infamous NASDAQ IPO debacle and was also pioneering the way for how social media apps and sites make money. As we all know, Facebook has figured it out as its stock has appreciated over 250% since its debut along with impressively sustained revenue growth. Therefore, it's not a surprise Snap has garnered over 500% in revenue growth at this stage. The trail has been paved already and advertisers have long been aboard the social media train.So these two examples, while possible, are not really probable. Snap has the traits of a hyped IPO with big expectations, a small float, a market still running with the bulls, an alternative branding as it IPO's (read: GoPro) and the attention of many young investors and non-investors. Furthermore, going back to my opening conversation, there are a lot of naysayers just like the other related IPO's before it. And while these quick-to-short-investors may be right in the long-term, they are likely wrong in the near-term. There is a proper way to play this and it takes some analysis and setting aside emotions to do it properly.Considering the stage I have set here, I'm willing to visit Snap's progress on May 3rd (assuming snap IPOs on March 1st, if not I'll edit this sentence to reflect the proper dates), exactly 63 days later - the average time to height for this case study. Then we can see how the strategy is playing out and when to take the next steps.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on Snap (as well as the update to this strategy) and other social media and tech companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4045216,98016,2017-02-12T22:50:59-05:00,"Goal to provide as accurate an estimate as my Twilio pre-IPO analysis.Snap's value derived from its young, addicted 158M user base (though user growth is rapidly slowing).Early Snap advertiser results compelling; Snap should own a solid share of the $66B mobile ad market.Snap's $25B IPO valuation goal would represent a 20-25% premium to the value per daily user of its May '16 financing.I estimate filing range comes in near prior round valuation of $18B (est. $15-$16 per share), is revised up, then trades up to $20-$25 per share ($22B-$28B).","This article on Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is intended to be in a similar vein to the analysis I did for Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) prior to its final IPO share price filings and subsequent trading.For Twilio, I wrote a piece estimating its IPO share price (I estimated a filing range of $16-$18 with post-IPO pop to $24+; TWLO later filed with an initial IPO price range of $12-$14, ultimately offered IPO shares at $15, which then traded up to $28 to close first day). I later used the analysis to support a follow-up piece in August 2016 after Twilio had traded up to $50-$55 to illustrate how it was absurdly overvalued. I noted then that a $30 per share price was more in line with where the company's performance supported; three months later, TWLO had traded down to $30 per share, where it hovers to this day.For sport, I'll again try my hand at accurately estimating IPO prices. This time for Snap.Snap BackgroundSnap filed its S-1 filing for initial public offering on February 2, 2017, and a week later, on February 9, an amended S-1 filing, with the most notable update being admission that competition has impacted user growth and disclosure of a 5-year commitment to spend $1B with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN).Snap began in 2010 as an iPhone app developed by a few 20-year olds at Stanford that allowed users to send pictures that disappear after a pre-set time set by the sender. Two years later, it had amassed 1M users. Another ~18 months saw the addition of features like ""stories"" (chronological pictures of a user's day), ""smartfilters"" and replay (time stamp, temperature, and speed), and ""chat"" (text and video chat), helping Snap reach 50M users midway through 2014.Impressive User Base, But Growth Slowing And Young Users Cost A Lot To Acquire And Addictive High Engagement Costs a Lot to ServiceToday, Snap has 158M daily active users (DAU) who spend on average 25 to 30 minutes a day sending on average 16 snaps a day (2.5B snaps sent daily), with 25% of users posting daily to their stories. This engagement is ravenous for a mobile app, representing ~2x the time engagement of Instagram and 20x+ the time engagement of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and is more in line with video and desktop-centric sites like YouTube (40 minute avg. daily user engagement) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (35 minute avg. daily user engagement). Snap introduced a physical product, Spectacles, which is too early to determine any meaningful augmentation to its mobile app business.Snap's user base has grown fast but is slowing, and the capital cost to amass Snap's base is high relative to other platforms. At its IPO, Facebook had 526M daily active users, growing 9% quarter over quarter, which was built on a cumulative invested capital base at IPO of $3.5B, or $7 of invested capital per daily user. Twitter had over 100M daily active users, growing 7% quarter over quarter, which was built on a cumulative invested capital base at IPO of $1.1B or ~$10 of capital per daily user.With its 158M daily user base, Snap falls well below Facebook's scale at IPO, but is 1.5x Twitter's size. However, Snap revealed a rapidly slowing quarterly growth of 4% in most recent Q4, and it took Snap $2.7B of cumulative invested capital to accumulate this base, or $17 of invested capital per daily user (2.6x the cost of Facebook's base and 1.7x the cost of Twitter's). Snap users have been more expensive to accumulate and also cost more to service: the average quarterly COGS per daily active user for Snap ($1 quarterly COGS/DAU) is 1.6x more expensive than Twitter's ($0.60 quarterly COGS/DAU) and 1.8x more expensive than Facebook's ($0.50 quarterly COGS/DAU). Another way to see this is that Snapchat only just logged its first quarter of material gross profit profitability in Q4 '16 (granted it is very young in its ad monetization path).Time will tell if Snap's users ultimately prove compellingly profitable to cover high initial acquisition costs and higher ongoing service costs.Advertising Revenue Model In Infancy, But Compelling Early Results And Impressive Success-Metric Measuring Capabilities DemonstratedSnap describes itself as a camera company, but essentially all revenue comes from third-party advertising. In other words, the product Snap is actually selling is the eyeballs of its users. As it says in its S-1:How is Snap doing in monetizing its user base with advertisers relative to Facebook and Twitter? At IPO, Facebook generated ~$2.00-$2.50 in revenue per daily user (lumpy, but relatively stable in the prior quarters), and Twitter generated $1.60 in revenue per daily user (stronger growth of 14% quarter over quarter). Snap only generated $1.00 per daily user, but quarter over quarter revenue per user growth over the prior 3 quarters was 58%, 67%, and 24%. Snap is demonstrating a compelling ability to quickly tap advertising partners and drive exponential revenue growth (Snap's Q4 '16 revenue of $166M is 5x larger than its Q4 '15 revenue).Snap's advertising is driven by a variety of innovative ad offerings that prompt high user engagement and sharing. Below is my favorite advertiser case study that Snap highlighted:The quantifiable results Snap is driving for advertisers suggest it should capture a material portion of total mobile advertising market spend, which was a $66B market in 2016, expected to grow nearly 3x to $196B in 2020.Snap Valuation History And My IPO Share Price EstimatesSnap's valuation history is mouthwatering: 2-3 years after founding, the company raised $80M at an $800M valuation from IVP in June 2013. A few 14 months later, in August 2014, Snap raised $485M at a $10B valuation (represents $150+ in enterprise value per active daily user at the time; keep in mind that Instagram sold for $1B to Facebook, which represented a per registered user value of $37, so assuming 30%-50% daily active, the implied value per daily active would still be half of Snap's at $75-$90). A few 7 months later, in March 2015, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) invested $200M at a $15B valuation (or $185/active daily user at the time). Finally, in May 2016, 14 months later, Snap raised $1.8B at an $18B valuation (a decline to $126/active daily user at the time).It's been widely reported that Evan Spiegel, Snap's CEO, is setting IPO valuation expectations at $25B (this would represent a 20-25% premium in the per active daily user value that Snap raised at less than a year ago, for whatever that made up valuation metric of mine is worth).Getting to per-share estimates, Snap has around 1.1B shares, so a $25B valuation expectation would suggest a post-offering/trading share price of around $22. Applying an underwriter's 15% IPO offering discount would suggest to me Snap could file an amended S-1 with a filing range of $18-$19 per share, if it intended to aggressively follow through with this early press messaging on valuation expectations.But where do I actually believe Snap will file? I suspect conservatively much closer to its last round's valuation range of $18B, which would suggest a $15-$16 per share filing range. I'd anticipate it'd revise the final offer price upward after initial market demand feedback, and then look to see shares pop to a $22+ trading range or higher, depending on frothiness and buzz.What valuation would public comparable valuations suggest Snap is worth? Readers familiar with my prior Twilio analysis know my valuation methodology here centers around analyzing forward (2017E) revenue multiples of a comparable set of public tech companies (in Snap's case, I'd use a comp set of online media companies) relative to their forward revenue growth rates. I've found that this analysis is predictive of 60%-70% of the variance seen in valuation variations of public companies, particularly to the pre- or early profitable tech sector.Below is the scatter plot correlation of online media companies' forward revenue multiple (current enterprise value divided by 2017E revenue) relative to each company's 2017E annual revenue growth:Source: CapIQ market data and consensus estimatesFacebook rounds out the group of 14 companies as the growth and valuation leader with a forward revenue multiple of 9.5x on estimated 2017E revenue growth of 37%. Companies growing 2017E revenue 25%-30% like Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are trading around 5x-6x revenue. Slower growth companies like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), WebMD (NASDAQ:WBMD), and Bankrate (NYSE:RATE) with growth rates less than 15% trade at 2x-3x 2017E revenue.So where does Snap's 2017E revenue growth rate look like it will fall out, and what would that imply about the revenue multiple it should enjoy? Well, Snap presents a difficulty, given it will significantly surpass a 37% revenue growth rate and exceed the bounds of ""known"" growth rate valuations our public comp set provides, which means we would need to extrapolate from the trend line, which isn't ideal for accuracy, but what the heck, let's get crazy.To estimate a general 2017E revenue growth, I assumed 3.5% to 4.0% quarter-over-quarter daily user base growth in line with Q4 '16, which gets to ending 2017 daily users of 183M, up 15% year over year. I also assumed 20% quarter-over-quarter ad revenue growth per daily user (slightly below Q4 '16 growth of 24%) through full-year 2017, which results in Q4 '17 quarterly revenue per daily user of $2.19, up 110% over Q4 '16 actuals of $1.04. These two assumptions alone put 2017E revenue at $1.1B to $1.2B for 2017E growth that is nearly 200% over 2016. There just isn't a public comparable for this kind of exponential revenue trajectory! Regardless, let's extrapolate based on our public market comps to determine Snap's ""appropriate"" 2017E revenue multiple... below is the extrapolation chart to help illustrate how ridiculous this becomes:Applying the correlation equation to extrapolate Snap's revenue multiple suggests that at a 200% 2017E revenue growth rate, Snap should be valued at 27x 2017E revenue. Given our assumed 2017E revenue of $1.1B-$1.2B, Snap's enterprise value under this approach would be $30B for a share price around $27 per share.Evan Spiegel and the Snap team, I sincerely wish you the best in hitting that ""fair value"" extrapolated valuation share price in aftermarket trading. This will be an interesting one to follow."
4043011,102400,2017-02-06T13:15:39-05:00,"Snapchat's IPO is expensive both on a trailing and forward basis relative to its peers' historical IPOs.Instagram is stepping up against Snapchat with its copycat features, slowing down the company's DAU growth worldwide, especially ex-North America and Europe.While Snapchat's user base size and target demographic is respectable, the likelihood of sustained value creation seems low.Overall, it is suggested that investors stay away from the company barring overly severe punishment of the stock following the IPO.","After a long wait, it is finally here: Snapchat's (NYSE:SNAP) IPO announcement. The secret veil surrounding the company has been lifted and here is what we are greeted with:Let's compare that to Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) IPO*:And to Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) IPO*:* = Numbers from initial S-1, not last amendment.It may be tempting to try and invest early in the next Microsoft, eBay, LinkedIn, or Facebook, but one must be wary of investing in the next Twitter. Twitter currently trades at a market cap of around $12.6B, effectively halving in value since its IPO. The issue for Twitter has been monetization, active user growth, and user engagement. Snapchat will likely face these same problems, suggesting it should be trading at much lower multiples. The negative margins due to large spending, such as the $2B commitment over the next 5 years for Google Cloud services, also suggest the company should be trading at a lower multiple to trailing sales.Source: Bloomberg GadflyThe company looks more reasonable on a forward revenue basis, as can be seen in this data compilation from Bloomberg Gadfly, but it still trades expensively compared to other historical IPOs. The graph above doesn't look into the profitability of the businesses at IPO, such as Facebook which already had an operating margin of 47% the fiscal year prior to IPO as opposed to the negative margins for Snapchat. And if Facebook looks like a good deal retroactively now, keep in mind it traded much cheaper after IPO. Given investors are now prepared from both the Facebook and Twitter IPO, it shouldn't be surprising if Snapchat trades lower than the $25B valuation number being thrown around right now.Instagram and SnapchatInstagram is ramping up to take-on Snapchat, with the release of Instagram Stories last summer growing to around 150M DAUs currently to take on Snapchat's equivalent feature. Instagram currently totes DAUs over 400M, compared to over 158M for Snapchat. The graphs below aren't an apples-to-apples comparison, but will give you an idea of growth rates for each platform in active users:Source: TechCrunchGrowth in daily active users has slowed down drastically for Snapchat in the second half of 2016, likely due to the release of Instagram Stories. And while the two graphs above are not apples to apples, given the difference between DAUs and MAUs, a direct comparison is more revealing: Instagram has over 400M DAUs now, compared to 330M DAUs in June or a growth of 21% in the last 6 months vs. Snapchat's 10.5% growth in DAUs in the same time frame. And while this type of growth for Instagram may not be repeatable given the new feature release, Instagram poses a real threat to Snapchat's business.As Snapchat saturates North America, it will find even tougher competition abroad given 80% of Instagram users are from outside the US and Canada as opposed to around 57% for Snapchat. Monetization in North America is much steeper for Snapchat: $2.15 average revenue per user vs. $0.28 in Europe and $0.15 in the rest of the world. Hence, US competition is naturally much more important than anywhere else. Still, Instagram has a larger foothold worldwide and this shows given completely flat growth in DAUs outside of North America and Europe in the latest quarter.Snapchat: More detailsAdditionally, and this is talked about fairly frequently these days, the shares being issued will be Class-A, non-voting stocks. The founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, have access to the all-powerful Class-C shares, which have 10 votes each and offer them complete control over the company. While this isn't a complete surprise given tech IPOs' preference to being controlled companies, it is a step beyond the norm. Investors will be along for the ride of a 26- and 28-year olds' whims, which may or may not work out like it has for Facebook.Also, it seems the company is having some identity issues, labeling itself as a ""camera company."" This reminds me of a quote from GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) S-1:If only the two could switch their businesses and achieve their dreams. It's a minor critique, but sometimes these companies with identity problems end up pursuing a path that doesn't work out well for them as it isn't their core competency. Snapchat has done well so far, with Spectacles generating positive buzz despite feeling gimmicky. Hopefully, the company continues to innovate in a way that builds the platform rather than expands the company horizontally.Speaking of core competencies, what does Snapchat bring to the table? I consider Snapchat's unique value proposition to be the size of its user base and its appeal to younger demographics. Hence, that will be the capability mainly discussed below using Jay Barney's classic four questions outlined in his resource based view:Snapchat is a company that has a temporary competitive advantage, but is rapidly losing ground to the other competitor in the environment with similar attributes. And furthermore, the company performed a mini Porter's five forces analysis in its S-1 and revealed the following information:Let's fill out the other forces:To be fair, Instagram faces many of the same threats given Porter's five forces is more of an industry than company specific analysis. The important takeaways are:Final ThoughtsIn summary, Snapchat trades at a rich valuation both on a trailing and forward basis relative to its peers' respective IPOs. The company offers some competitive advantages, but history tends to suggest these advantages will be temporary, especially given the nature of their target demographic and industry. Furthermore, the company has seen a slowdown in DAU growth as a result of Instagram. Given these factors, I would recommend investors stay clear of the $25B price tag being thrown around in the media right now.Snapchat should have considered going public after they had more substantial proof their business model is strong or gone public earlier. At this time, given the drastic slowdown in their user base growth, this was likely one of the worst times to offer an IPO aside from the fact tech IPOs have been rather subdued lately. While this will help boost investor appetite, investors will likely be cautious after seeing the years of trading following Twitter's IPO. While it's not likely, there is a chance investors may punish Snapchat's valuation too far given the aforementioned reasons, offering an opportunity to invest cheaply. Otherwise, steer clear as your money may disappear 24 hours after the IPO.Author's note: If you would like to be notified when I publish an article, please click the follow button beside my name at the top of the article or on my profile page.

4042771,102638,2017-02-05T17:25:22-05:00,,"Is your head still spinning because of last week's news cycle? Congratulations - you're normal. Trying to keep up with any news, even just one element (e.g., business) has been a near task in futility. Politics (understandably) in one form or another is currently dominating everything, even business. So with that said, it could be argued why the most anticipated, hailed, saving grace for all that is ""The Valley"", the IPO to save the IPO world, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) (aka Snapchat) filed its former ""confidential"" papers on Thursday. And the reaction? (insert crickets here)Sure, there has been the usual high-fiving chorus throughout the tech world, and in particular ""The Valley"" world. That's to be expected. However, with that said, I want to offer up the following headline as possibly the reasoning behind so little fanfare. It comes from none other than Vanity Fair, and ask if you have the same reaction as I did. Ready?""Silicon Valley, Rejoice: Snapchat Files For Huge $3 Billion I.P.O.""My initial thoughts?: Silicon Valley dreams of working for ""stock options"" and IPO riches meets its WTF moment in reality.Why you ask? Hint: ""rejoice"", ""huge"", ""$3 Billion"" equals ""It's different this time."" And not in a good way.Let me phrase it this way: All this waiting, all the hype, all those ""dreams"" placed squarely on the shoulders of this forthcoming IPO - and all they get is a lousy $3 billion and the CEO gets to keep (and wears) the ""lousy T-shirt."" Yep: ""rejoice"" just seems a little out-of-place after that, doesn't it?Now $3 billion is nothing to sneeze at, especially if it's ""your"" money that's going to be the content for the counting. But this is Snapchat! You know, the supposed next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) if not FB killer.Comparisons to other tech companies (e.g., Twitter) brings a swift response from roadshow messaging, ""We're the next Facebook, Not The Next Twitter."" All I'll say is investors better hope, pray, and give burnt offerings to help that insinuation along before the possibility that the ""burnt offerings"" is their money up-in-smoke after the fact, just saying.Again, here we have ""the"" most anticipated IPO to come down the pike in quite some time. Their shopping for this IPO has been done in near secrecy, where ""confidentiality"" was the term used as to describe the process. Many thought since they waited till the ""markets"" once again were tractor-beamed into never-before-seen-in-history-highs that this IPO would be priced at the whisper number of $5 billion reminiscent of FB's. Especially given all that seems to be riding on this ""unicorn's"" back.Sorry, to be the bummer, but $3 billion is closer both in math, and reality, to Twitter's $1.8 billion IPO offer range, than it is to FB's $5 billion. And what may be even worse? Their filings seem to make that case even further.In my opinion, this isn't a good sign if you're the supposed ""David"" in ""The Valley's"" version of ""Goliath"" killers. Especially if you're simultaneously held to be the IPO savior of tech. And there's only one thing worse than ""expectations"" not being met, even if it is hopes, or dreamlike infused wishes.What's that you ask? Hint: When you state publicly that your business, a business that is looking to garner other people's money who will someday be looking for a return on that investment read - they may never find that scenario ever possible.Think I'm kidding? From their S-1 filing, page 19, in bold, italicized text. To wit:So, I'm going to ask you a question from a business standpoint: Why in the world would you include such a statement?Some will argue this was just some boilerplate legal mumbo-jumbo that is constructed and stated in more differing ways than there are ants on the planet, and needs to be included somewhere within the fine print, where all this form of legalese gets inserted to be glossed over. And that would be a fair argument. However, if that's the reasoning: Why in the world would you make this statement front, center, and unable to miss?Unless?(I'll just pause here, and let you fill in that thought you just had on your own. Remember, ""investors"" at these levels are supposed to be ""sophisticated"", as in, they inherently understand potential losses. So why the need to make it so uncharacteristically prominent? Think that line over a few times, and try to square-that-circle on your own.)From my perspective, this not only appears troubling at first blush, it gets even further problematic as the cloud of ""confidentiality"" gets lifted further into the light of true business fundamentals. Why do I say such a thing? Again, from their own filings, page 36, and, once again, in bold and italicized, to wit:Translation? If you don't like what we're doing with your investment dollars and assumed because you gave us your money we needed to listen to you... Screw you - it was right there in the S-1. Cha-ching!The more I perused this S-1, the more I found myself thinking this seems to be nothing more than a legalesed filled document to do nothing more than solidify a founders cash-out with no chance of recourse. Or said differently: Screw whatever befalls the company and investors later. i.e., the ""I've got mine - who cares about yours"" type of mentality that seems to plague much of what is commonly known as ""tech"" or ""The Valley"" stylized entity.As always: Don't take my word, or conclusions for it. Read the document for yourself, and come to your own conclusions. Especially if you are one of those just ""chomping at the bit"" as to be the first to ride this long-awaited unicorn. For there are warning signs throughout this document that anyone with a modem of business acumen will find troubling.I'm sorry, did I hear you say, ""It can't be any worse than what the above portends?"" Fair enough, so here's another detail contained within page 4, once again, to wit:Sounds great, right? Yep, until you also read they incurred a net loss of $514.6 million, up from $372.9 million in the same period. Translation? More users - more losses. See above statements for what that may translate to ""your"" returns on investment hopes. And try not to think about the old ""we sell dollar bills at 98 cents - but we make it up on volume!"" joke as you try to evaluate what this business model should be worth, or better yet, how anyone could ever value it at $25 billion or more. Only in ""The Valley"" is all I'll say.I'll just end with this one statement, or observation:Remember when making profits was seen as ""just not getting tech"" and you were relegated to ""doesn't have a clue"" status if you dared to ask questions such as ""profitability"", ""net profits"", ""return on investment"", and more? You know, when the Fed was pumping in all that QE money? What's happened since then?Hint: A dried up IPO market, IPOs that are still ""in transition"" that may never see light of day, IPOs that were supposedly ""the"" new markets for their relative products are now seen as investment disasters, i.e., look to TWTR, FIT, GPRO, TWLO, P, and others for clues, always remembering how they too were ""cutting edge"" when it came to messaging, cameras, wearables, and more. Because today? Hint: look to any stock chart.And yet, here we are (again) today with another ""app"" that takes pictures so that people can augment their pictures or message - then goes ""poof."" Just like its cash-burn status. And we're told - ""it's different this time"" (again) when evaluating its business model and metrics.Sure it is.You know what truly is different this time? The inclusion of the term ""poop"" on a S-1 filing.Oh yes - that's not a misprint. It's right there on page 110 as to give credence to the ""ads for eyeballs"" fallacy. You just can't make up stuff like that. No one would believe it.No wonder this was all done originally under the cloak of ""confidentiality."" Now that it's hit the light-of-day? ""Poop"" may indeed have been a good term to include, because from my perspective…This whole thing stinks to high-business heaven. Where many an ""investors'"" bank account may also find itself, i.e., ""Money Heaven."""
4042748,66783,2017-02-05T08:56:45-05:00,,"Silicon Valley hubris seeks third-class vote-less stockholder.Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of SnapChat, filed for an IPO on Thursday. The filing revealed just how toxic this deal is going to be, not just from a financial point of view - a risk IPO investors are willing to take in order to grab the next Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - but from a corporate governance and shareholder-rights point of view.This has implications far beyond Snap: If Snap's current owners can pull it off and get away with it, other companies will start doing the same thing, and it will forever change what it means to be a screwed stockholder.Voting rights have already been diluted as our Silicon Valley heroes, such as Google and Facebook, have made a joke out of their common stockholders, but they still get to vote, even if in ludicrously diluted form.But Snap will take it to the ultimate level: new shareholders will get no voting rights at all. Zilch. That's a first in the history of US IPOs. These will be the three classes of Snap shares:This vote-less Class A common stock is what is going to be sold to the public at the IPO. Shareholders will get little for their money - other than hope and hype and the financial toxicity of the deal that we can now see thanks to the filing.Snap plans to extract $3 billion from the ""public"" by selling these new vote-less class A shares at the time of the offering in the near future, so initially to Wall Street firms at the IPO price before trading starts. These firms then sell their shares to the public when trading starts, hopefully at a higher price. If Snap can pull it off, it will be the largest ""tech"" IPO since Facebook.The company currently has a ""valuation"" of $17.8 billion, established behind closed doors at its last round of funding. The hope is that the IPO price will value the company at $20 billion to $25 billion. That's some serious moolah.Now that we have its S-1 filing with the SEC, we can get a feel for the risks. Snap was founded in 2011. For years, it had no revenue model. In 2015, it started putting ads on its service and booked $58.7 million in advertising revenues, most of it in the second half. And it had a loss of $381.7 million. OK, it's a startup. Fine.In 2016, with its ad platform fully operational, revenues rose to $404.5 million, of which 98% was from advertising. And its net loss exploded to $514.6 million.This is the same program Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is on. Twitter is still losing a ton of money every year: $521 million in 2015; $577 million in 2014; $645 million in 2013. It has not yet reported results for Q4 2016, but the net loss for the year will likely be between $300 million and $400 million. The company has announced rounds of layoffs and is subleasing a considerable part of its office space. Its shares have plunged 74% from its post-IPO peak.Like Twitter, Snap has come up with its own metrics. Its key metric is ""daily active users"" of which it had 158 million ""on average"" in Q4, 2016. But growth has been slowing over the last few quarters.The growth rate from Q3 to Q4 2016 was only 3.3%, down from a growth rate of 13.8% a year earlier, and down from 14.5% two years earlier.The filing explains some of the reasons for this slowing growth in users, including ""significant competition in almost every aspect of our business both domestically and internationally"":The filing explains that it's easy for users to switch to the competition. And turns out, its users, who are primarily between 18 and 34, are not ""brand loyal.""And then there's somewhat of a cost situation. Snap uses ""a capital-light business model,"" which means third parties provide the massive infrastructure needed to run the service that is heavy on videos and images. This third party is ""primarily"" Google Cloud. Snap just ""committed to spend $2 billion"" with them over the next five years.So that would be $400 million a year on average, just for having the site hosted in the cloud. Alas, total revenues in 2016 were only $404 million. So that doesn't leave a lot of room for anything else - much less profits.OK, it's going to be tough out there. We get that. The cloud is expensive. Every business should face stiff competition sooner or later to bring out its best. It's just a question of whether or not the business can make it - and at what valuation investors want to own part of it, and if they want to own it as screwed third-class stockholders with absolutely no voting rights.This non-voting share scheme is designed to protect top management from the wrath of stiffed stockholders.Financial risks - a company bleeding red ink for years to come and needing the IPO money to be able to continue to bleed - are why IPOs are so much fun and such a gamble. Some work out. Many take your money down with them.But there is something much more important at stake: surrendering your voting rights. And if equity investors - this includes institutional investors that will back the IPO - don't revolt now, it's going to become pandemic. If Snap gets away with it without a severe drubbing in the share price and ultimate abandonment by investors, they'll all do it. And third-class vote-less shareholders will become the norm.Despite what you might think, automakers did not ""cut back"" on fleet sales. But keep an eye on rideshare companies.

4045494,101659,2017-02-13T16:31:33-05:00,Snapchat user growth is quickly slowing.Profitability is still proving to be quite elusive for Snapchat.Heavy reliance on Google could be detrimental for Snapchat in the long run as it looks to grow.Avoid SNAP.,"The IPO filing of Snap, Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat is one of the most anticipated tech offerings in the past few years. However, there are many analysts who clear their reservations regarding the future of the company and its stock.User growth is slowing Although Snapchat has experienced tremendous growth since inception, significant slowdown is on the horizon. Growth of DAUs (daily active users) has been declining for two consecutive quarters. In Q3, the company experienced a decline from 65% to 62% of its users being active daily, but in Q4, Snapchat experienced further slowdown to 48%. To set the stage for a comparison with another tech giant, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has added 189 million users in 2016 while Snapchat has only added 51 million. Facebook's performance is boosted by growth experience outside of North America and Europe. However, it also outperformed Snapchat in North America despite the inclusion of both Mexico and the Caribbean in Snapchat's DAU count. Due to this very unconventional way of geographic clustering by Snapchat management, we believe Snapchat is attempting to inflate its North American performance before its IPO.(Original Content, Data from ReCode)Additionally, Snapchat is not generating the same per customer revenue that Facebook was able to achieve pre-IPO in 2011. While Facebook was making an average of $3.2 dollars per customer, Snapchat is only able to receive $2.15. This may be a sign of things to come, unless Snapchat finds a business model that allow it to effectively monetize its users.(Source: Bloomberg)Additionally, Facebook's increasingly aggressive investment in Instagram which has released similar features to those of Snapchat through the ""Instagram stories"", signifies future competition that will hinder the future growth of Snapchat.Snapchat management has begun to focus on growth through increased engagement with existing customers as opposed to growth through customer acquisition. However, this task may prove to be even more difficult than user growth. Analyst estimates state that Snapchat users spend between 25 and 30 minutes on the app daily, which is half of the amount of time Facebook users spend on the web and desktop applications. The average American spends around 186 minutes a day on their phones (excluding calls & texts). This is broken down into 44 minutes of video and 60 minutes of social network use. If Snapchat has already captured 25 mins of this time, it will be difficult to cut out an extra piece of the pie with Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Even with the innovative product roadmap, there is a hard limit on the amount of engagement Snapchat can gain.(Original Content, Data from PewInternet)The Snapchat spectacles are therefore a smart strategic pivot for Snapchat and a key driver of Snapchat's potential future success. Going away from the smartphone hardware allows the company to target a whole new opportunity to obtain users' time in a space that is not yet heavily targeted by its competitors. This can be seen in the IPO as it has filed under a ""Camera Company"" suggesting that there may be more hardware products to come.Snapchat is struggling to find its way to profitability Just as most Silicon Valley unicorns, Snapchat has struggled to create a sustainable and profitable business model. When Facebook went public, it was already profitable and it still experienced stock price drops up to 50 percent after its initial IPO, which were not recovered until two years of proven operations. Other companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) have not been able to recover stock prices and have continued to struggle with profitability. Revenue has grown from $58 million in 2015 to $404 million in 2016. Snapchat has experienced an operating loss growth from $381 million to $520 million during that same period. It is evident that Snapchat is trying to find a business model that will allow for it to cover its costs and become profitable. But in the meantime, poor fundamentals may put downward pressure on Snap's stock once it goes public.Snapchat numbers are much more like those of Twitter than Facebook. Out of the three social media giants, it has the worst operating income at -$520 million and a valuation that is over $5 billion higher than Twitter. We believe the company should be valued at $15-18 billion based on these metrics.Dependence on Google Most of the infrastructure set up by Snapchat is hosted by Google Cloud. The company has entered a $2 billion contract for the next five years to maintain and expand this infrastructure. This is relevant as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is receiving a great deal ($2 billion in revenue) while helping one of Facebook's competitors grow. Additionally, while it is paying Google, it acknowledges YouTube as one of its main competitors. If Snapchat's growth continues in the next five years, it can be expected that Google will begin to charge a large premium to continue supporting Snapchat, which could significantly hinder future earnings.Even though Snapchat is one of the most anticipated IPOs of the year, we do not recommend taking any long positions due to issues with the business model, fundamentals, and tough competitive landscape.If you enjoyed my opinions, insights, and analysis, please hit that FOLLOW button and check out my other ARTICLES and analysis.

4043176,73185,2017-02-07T02:53:20-05:00,"Snapchat's growth, considering its small size relative to Facebook, is largely unimpressive.Facebook grew at a much faster rate when it was Snap's size.Snapchat's DAU growth slowed when Instagram Stories launched, underscoring the fact that Snap's current advantages are easily replicated.Facebook actually grew its ARPU more quickly on a sequential basis than Snapchat did last quarter.In the long-run, Facebook investors have no need to worry about Snap.","With Snap (NYSE:SNAP) recently filing for its IPO, there has been a lot of buzz about what implications that has for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). We think any concerns over Snap eating into Facebook market share or taking away ad dollars are greatly exaggerated. If the S-1 filing has taught us anything, it is that Facebook investors have no need to worry about Snap.Snapchat's growth, considering its small size relative to Facebook, is largely unimpressive. According to the S-1 filing, Snapchat added 3m DAUs last quarter in North America on a base of 65m (including Mexico and the Caribbean). Facebook added 2m DAUs last quarter in the US and Canada on a base of 178m. Under the conservative assumption that FB added roughly 1m DAUs in Mexico and the Caribbean combined, then FB and Snapchat added the same amount of daily actives in North America last quarter despite Facebook having nearly 3x the underlying user base.That is a strongly bearish observation regarding Snapchat's user growth, and last quarter was not an anomaly. Over the past 3 years, while Snapchat's nominal user growth in North America has outpaced Facebook's nominal user growth in North America, it hasn't been by that much (roughly 1m DAUs per quarter, and that includes Mexico and the Caribbean in Snap's numbers). Moreover, most of Snapchat's user growth ""outperformance"" came in the first-half of 2016. When Instagram Stories launched in August, though, Snapchat's user growth fell sharply, Facebook's user growth ticked up, and the gap in net adds once again compressed to roughly 1m DAUs.All else equal, Snapchat should be growing at a much faster rate. Snapchat reported it had 35m daily actives in North America in Q4 of 2014. There was a point in time back in March of 2009 when Facebook had a similar amount of daily actives in North America. Over the subsequent 8 quarters, Facebook proceeded to add almost 9m DAUs per quarter to grow its North America DAU base to 105m by early 2011. Eight quarters after it hit 35m daily actives, however, Snapchat only has a 68m DAU base in North America. This means the company has only added a little over 4m North American DAUs per quarter since it hit 35m daily actives, much lower than the 9m North American net adds pace Facebook had when it was that size.Why is Snapchat having trouble growing at a rapid rate? Part of the problem is its niche audience, while part of the problem is its easily replicable features. Both of these are bullish indicators for Facebook's growth. Snapchat has naturally carved out a niche for itself in the 25-and-under demographic and is having trouble grabbing users older than 25. According to the S-1 filing, users 25 and older visit Snapchat ~12x per day and spend ~20 minutes per day on the platform, while users under 25 visit Snapchat over 20x per day and spend over 30 minutes per day on the platform. Snapchat is a kids' application, and consequently, the app has a restricted TAM. Recent user growth trends of adding roughly 3-4m daily actives per quarter actually implies Snapchat may be nearing saturation in North America. That is fairly bullish for Facebook because it means that whatever damage Snapchat posed to the user base, it has largely already been done.Perhaps more at the core of Snapchat's problem is that its features are very easily replicated. According to Snap's S-1 filing, DAU growth was relatively flat in the latter part of the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the early part of the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This essentially means Snapchat experienced slow DAU growth from August through November. As mentioned earlier, Facebook launched Instagram Stories in early August. This is no coincidence that Snapchat's DAU growth slowed when Instagram Stories launched, and on page 12 of the S-1 filing, Snap admits that two major risks related to user growth include: 1) ""users increasingly engage with competing products instead of ours"", and 2) ""our competitors may mimic our products and therefore harm our user engagement growth"".(Source: S-1 Filing)If the August user slowdown is any indication, this has already happened. Point 2 about competitors mimicking products underscores our earlier point that Snapchat's current advantages (Stories, filters, etc) are easily replicated. With a slew of similar products like Instagram Live, Facebook Live, Instagram Stories, and Messenger filters, Facebook can leverage its size and reach to migrate the Snap user base to its Instagram/Facebook/Messenger/WhatsApp ecosystem.This is further illustrated when discussing international markets. In Europe, Snapchat only added 3m daily actives last quarter on a 49m base, while Facebook added 6m daily actives on a 256m base. Snapchat actually saw flattish user growth in its ""Rest of World"" segment in Q4, while Facebook grew daily actives by 28m in the Asia-Pacific region and 11m in the ""Rest of World"" region last quarter. The more scale Facebook has, the more leverage it is naturally granted in rolling out new features. This is problematic for Snap, which relies on a few easily replicable features as a competitive moat.On the monetization front, Facebook actually grew its ARPU more quickly on a sequential basis than Snapchat did last quarter, strongly implying an advertiser dollar preference for Facebook. Snapchat registered North American ARPU of $2.15 last quarter, up 22.2% sequentially. Meanwhile, Facebook grew US & Canada ARPU by 26.6% last quarter to $19.81. This is somewhat due to Snap's seasonality, but Q4 is also the highest ARPU quarter for Facebook as well, so this cannot be entirely explained by seasonality. Regardless, considering that Facebook's domestic ARPU is more than 9x that of Snap's ARPU, there is no reason that the sequential ARPU growth rates at Snap and Facebook should be similar.Unless, of course, Snap isn't attracting serious ad dollars. Snap has certainly generated a lot of buzz over the past couple quarters, and a multi-billion dollar IPO is only augmenting that buzz, but we think that's all it is: buzz. Facebook has the irreplaceable advantage of scale within a growingly connected ecosystem. Snap is trendy, but slowing user growth in the back-half of 2016 shows cracks in the trend. As Facebook rolls out Instagram Live Stories globally and continues to expand its ecosystem, Snap's growth story will continue to fall apart. In the long-run, Facebook investors have no need to worry about Snap."
4043110,73335,2017-02-06T18:28:17-05:00,"In the run-up to its IPO, it was hailed as the next great technology company. And now that its S-1 is out, the commentary has turned quite negative.Snap still has significant room for revenue growth even if its user growth remains muted.While this may not be quite the outcome some expected, it is still a good enough story for a successful IPO.","The media, analyst and investor communities clearly have a love-hate relationship with Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP). In the run-up to its IPO, it was hailed as the next great technology company (in part due to Snap's own communication efforts). And now that its S-1 is out, the commentary has turned quite negative. As always, the truth is somewhere in the middle and public filings paint a very clear picture of why that is.The chart at the top of this post shows quarterly revenue for Snap compared with that of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), aligned by founding year (sourced from their respective IPO prospectuses). The first observation is that Snap is going public earlier in its lifecycle than both Facebook and Twitter. Of course, this is partially offset by the fact that Snap was conceived during the ""post-PC"" smartphone revolution, which accelerated consumer adoption cycles, especially for social media. That said, Snap's advertiser adoption seems to be growing at roughly as the same pace as its predecessors (at the same point in their respective lifecycles), which is more relevant for a revenue comparison. Taking these factors and the chart into account, it looks like Snap's revenue growth is slightly behind Facebook's pace and well ahead of Twitter's.Now, what's driving this revenue growth? User growth and ad engagement. The chart below shows average daily active users for each of the three companies, aligned by founding year (Twitter only reported DAU for one period in its IPO prospectus, so I had to use a few assumptions built on top of Facebook's historical DAU/MAU ratio at the same point in its lifecycle to estimate these).Clearly, user growth is the metric that has scared tech and investor communities alike. Despite all the advantages the smartphone revolution presented, Snap's user trajectory looks meaningfully flatter than Facebook's. While Snap's DAU figures are certainly higher than Twitter's were at the same point, its growth trajectory is only slightly better. Also, Snap's user growth slowed even further after Q3 when Instagram added the ""Stories"" feature that Snapchat had pioneered. The competitive dynamic with Instagram is certainly concerning when it comes to user growth, but there is little evidence to suggest an impact on aggregate engagement from Snapchat's existing users. Instagram already owns a vast international user base and the presence of Instagram stories obviates the need to experiment with Snapchat (especially with Snapchat's daunting UI compared to Instagram's easy onboarding experience).So based on existing evidence, it would be safe to assume that Snapchat's steady state user base is not likely to challenge Facebook or Instagram, even if it is somewhat larger than Twitter. This isn't necessarily bad simply because of the kind of users Snapchat tends to attract. We have heard enough about Snapchat's hold on teens in the US, but Snapchat's aforementioned daunting UI is even more important. The first screen presented to users when they open Snapchat is a camera screen (as compared to a ""feed"" or option to follow friends). This is a deliberate decision to ensure that a significant portion of their user base not only consumes content, but creates it. This is antithetical to the engagement patterns on most social networks, including Facebook and Twitter, where content creators tend to be a very small portion of the user base. By extension, the average Snapchat user should be more engaged and, therefore, more valuable over time than the average Facebook or Instagram user.While we don't have public user engagement or ad engagement data to confirm this hypothesis, we do have something to benchmark this against. The chart below shows average revenue per user for the three companies (using quarterly revenue and average daily active users during the quarter).Snap's ARPU trajectory looks quite healthy and roughly on pace with where Facebook would have been. It is complicated to draw a direct relationship between ARPU and ad engagement since we still don't have specific figures on ad load, i.e. the number of ads each user is exposed to. At the very least, it does show healthy growth in the company's advertising business. Over the next few years, video will likely morph into Snap's key advantages over rival networks. While Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have been attempting to move into video and video advertising, the nature of engagement with the ""feed"" is ""scroll""-centric. Users are more likely to quickly see snippets of content and scroll past rather than engage with discrete bits of content for a length of time. This is a poor fit with video consumption habits and TV advertising (where a majority of ad dollars are still allocated). However, Snapchat's full screen video and lenses lead to deeper engagement, which is a better fit for TV advertisers. Of course, YouTube and, to some extent, Instagram (via Stories) will receive significant portions of the current TV ad budget over time. But Snapchat's hold on US teens will guarantee that it gets a fair share.On the whole, we can clearly see that Snap still has significant room for revenue growth even if its user growth remains muted. While this may not be quite the outcome some expected, it is still a good enough story for a successful IPO."
4042381,23395,2017-02-03T05:55:19-05:00,,"Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) highly anticipated IPO filing has hit, and its $3 billion deal size is larger than every 2016 tech IPO combined.The social media juggernaut is on track to price in early March. Snap's rumored $25 billion valuation will hinge on investors' confidence that it can follow in the path of its largest rival, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), while avoiding the pitfalls that plagued Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). With the benefit of hindsight, we examine how Snap stacks up to Facebook and Twitter at the time of their IPOs and today.At the time of their IPOs, Facebook was by far the largest, but also the slowest growing, as it was the furthest along in its monetization ramp and was the only one with a positive operating profit. Snap is growing the fastest, but has paid the most for that growth, coming in with the lowest margins of the three (-109% operating margin). It is estimated to come at a higher premium than the others and slightly above Twitter's valuation.Since their IPOs, Facebook has seen an explosion in user base, with revenue and profitability following suit, while Twitter has stagnated and halved its value. Snap, newly rebranded as a camera company, will have to meet high expectations to meet to please investors in the time to come.Snap is hoping its estimated 2017 sales of $1 billion (150% growth) will be enough to justify its $25 billion price tag. The company will be asking investors to overlook its current unprofitability and will be highlighting its strong user engagement and popularity with the younger demographic. Facebook's introduction of Instagram Stories seeks to siphon away some of Snap's signature features. While Facebook is trying to copy Snap's products, if Snap can match Facebook's meteoric rise ahead of its 2012 IPO, it could reach Facebook's size at IPO in three years."
4042461,22148,2017-02-03T10:24:18-05:00,Snapchat parent Snap filed for an IPO.The user growth and financials reported by Snap have several red flags.Twitter offers the better value and the user base heading in the right direction.,"After the close Snap (Pending:SNAP) filed for an initial public offering. The social-networking company has a wildly popular site in Snapchat, but the prospectus has some huge red flags.Considering the recent trend of overly hot IPOs followed by years of underperformance, one of the best stocks to consider on this deal is Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The valuation is much more compelling and the success of Snapchat increasingly places the company as the target of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) leaving Twitter more free to focus on social media.Red FlagsSnap filed to raise up to $3 billion at a valuation expected to reach $25 billion. In the last fund raising almost a year ago, the private firm raised $1.8 billion in cash and was valued at around $20 billion.As this Forbes article highlights, Snap plans on obtaining a valuation similar to that of what Twitter garnered when going public. Considering the similar valuation for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), the alarming part isn't necessary the valuation, but rather the uniqueness of the company.Facebook and Google were leaders in their respective sectors while Twitter and Snapchat are followers in a way. Both have unique aspects that set them apart from Facebook, but both are close enough for the social networking giant to copy them.The other red flags are numerous including the following:The concerning part is that at first blush one might think the substantial loss is due to stock-based compensation, but the reality is that Snap only spent $32 million on that category in 2016. The majority of the costs were cash related.While a valuation of over 60x 2016 revenues is hard to swallow, the stalling user growth is a major concern. As the below chart depicts, Snapchat is seeing DAU growth virtually stall.Sequential quarterly DAU growth dropped to only 3% in Q4. The highly troubling part is that ROW growth completely stalled. As North America becomes saturated with 69 million DAUs, Snapchat will find the growth path difficult as users outside North America and Europe increasingly turn to competitive options such as Instagram from Facebook.Buy Twitter InsteadThe clear reason to buy Twitter is that the social-media giant has already scraped bottom with user growth. In fact, Twitter has seen growth re-accelerate in recent quarters.For Q3, Twitter reported that MAU grew 1% sequentially to 317 million. The key though is that users actually declined during last Q4.Source: Twitter Q316 presentationThe last quarter could even see faster growth due to the NFL games streamed on the platform and Donald Trump favoring the service for his proclamations. My previous articles have highlighted how engagement for his accounts have exploded since the November elections.The other ironic part about the Snap valuation is that Wall Street has long suggested Twitter doesn't do a good job monetizing the platform. Yet, Twitter is expected to produce revenues in excess of $2.5 billion last year with possibly less DAUs than Snap.At a valuation of $12.6 billion, Twitter is worth half of the projected price to own a piece of Snap. Twitter has significantly better financials having already reached positive cash flows and adjusted earnings.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that Snap is a financial mess trying to compete with Facebook. Twitter trades for half the expected valuation of the IPO and offers better financials and accelerated user growth.Don't fall for the hype of Snap. Twitter is the value play in the social sector and the company offers the potential for some upside considering engagement likely increased during Q4."
4042535,101421,2017-02-03T13:46:00-05:00,"Tech company Snap intends to raise $3 billion in its IPO at a valuation reported in the press as $25 billion.Prospective investors would have to assign a Price/Sales multiple far in excess of Facebook to agree with that valuation.Further, investors will have to agree with management's fundamental thesis, that the camera is the primary smartphone interface.I'm not sure I agree with either the valuation or management's foundational thesis.I will provide an update once we know the company's proposed pricing and valuation expectations.","Quick TakeCamera company Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) has filed its initial S-1 registration for a $3 billion IPO at an undisclosed valuation. Snap views the camera as the primary use of the mobile device and seeks to monetize its user base primarily through advertising.The company has a short history of rapidly growing revenues, which exceeded $400 million in 2016.CompanyVenice-based Snap was founded in 2012 by current CEO Evan Spiegel and current CTO Robert Murphy to initially provide users with a smartphone app that enabled them to post pictures that were automatically deleted after a brief time period.The company has since expanded its scope to include chat, video, media that does not become automatically deleted, and a camera integrated into sunglasses.Below is a brief company video on its recently introduced Spectacles product:(Source: Snap YouTube)Snap has raised in excess of $2.6 billion in several private financing rounds from numerous investors including top tier venture capital firms, corporate investors, private equity firms and government-owned investment enterprises.The company claims that 158 million people use its flagship Snapchat each day, creating over 2.5 billion 'Snaps'.Market and CompetitionSnap operates a largely advertising-driven business model, although it does sell its Spectacles product for $129 each. It seeks to provide advertisers with access to its user base, which has typically centered around a younger demographic, between the ages of 14-30.The company has developed a number of advertiser tools and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable them. In many respects, Snap competes with other mobile-oriented social networks such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and to a lesser extent, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).The market size for Snap's service is dependent on the size of its network of users, their frequency of use of the various services and features, and advertisers' ability to achieve their ROI goals. Global advertising is expected to reach $767 billion in 2020, according to Snap.But ad growth by sector is more interesting, showing mobile ads should account for virtually all ad growth through 2019:(Source: DigiDay/Zenith)Snap says it is also focused on the countries where most of the ad spend growth will occur:(Source: DigiDay/Zenith)So, the company is well-positioned to take full advantage of the trend toward mobile advertising worldwide.FinancialsSnap's recent financial results can be summarized as follows:Below are the company's operational results for the past two years (Audited GAAP):(Source: Snap S-1)RevenueGross MarginCash Flow from OperationsAs of December 31, 2016, the company had $641 million in cash on hand and $175 million in total liabilities, with no long-term debt.IPO DetailsSnap intends to raise $3 billion in its IPO, selling Class A shares at an as-yet undisclosed price.The company intends to use the proceeds for 'general corporate purposes', Management also intends to retain firm control of the company through Class B shares, which is a common approach.In this case, public investors are 'just along for the ride' and should be well aware of the concentration of control in senior management, notably the co-founders: CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Robert Murphy who each own 21.8% of Class A stock, which will convert into Class B at IPO.Other major investors are Benchmark Capital (12.7% Class A; 22.8% Class B) and Lightspeed Venture Partners (8.3% Class A; 15% Class B).CommentaryAs for IPO valuation, which has been the topic of much debate, the most recent private investment valuation was in Q4 of 2016 by Fidelity Management that valued the company at $17.8 billion:(Source: WSJ Startup Stock Tracker)Numerous reports in the press have indicated an expected IPO valuation of $25 billion, which would not be surprising given its recent private market valuation of nearly $18 billion and strong revenue growth.Management believes that the camera will become the primary interface for users in a mobile setting, just as the flashing cursor was the 'starting point' for computer users.Snap was built from the ground up for the smartphone camera, whereas its erstwhile competitors, Facebook and Twitter, were originally built for the desktop and 'morphed' into mobile applications.Further, an investor in Snap's IPO would need to agree substantially with its foundational thesis, that the camera will become the primary interface for mobile devices. I'm not sure I agree with that.Cameras are indeed important for capturing memories and other information uses by consumers and businesses, so I don't mean to minimize its importance.However, smartphones have become extremely powerful computers with a wide range of uses, and the camera is but one application out of many.Additionally, Snap's competitors, most notably Facebook, aren't standing still.Although Facebook, through its Instagram application, has been criticized as being a 'copycat' of some of Snap's functionality, it is pursuing a strategy of retaining users on its platform, effectively denying Snap large numbers of users on a global scale.So, Snap will certainly continue to grow revenues and is widely expected to reach $1 billion in top line revenues in the next 18 months, but investors will potentially be asked to invest at a valuation that may require a much higher growth rate and terminal value.Snap management has published a global ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of $1.05, and a North America ARPU of $2.15.This is a far cry from Facebook's worldwide ARPU, which reached $15.98 in 4Q 2016, an increase of 34% vs. 4Q 2015. (Source: Facebook 10-Q)Although it's early days for Snap and its ability to monetize its user base, it has a very long way to go before it competes with Facebook.Even generously using Facebook's current 13.7x Price/Sales multiple, for Snap's trailing 12-month revenues of $405 million would indicate a valuation of $5.5 billion; assuming forward revenues of $1 billion would indicate a valuation of $13.7 billion.So, if Snap offers shares at a $25 billion valuation, investors would need to accept a near-term Price/Sales multiple in the range of 25x-35x.That's a very tall order and one predicated on buying into their vision of the camera as the central focus of mobile computing and their ability to compete effectively with Facebook.When Snap discloses their proposed share price range and valuation, probably within the next 30 days, I'll provide an update.I write about technology IPOs, M&A, follow-ons and secondaries.

4031519,91965,2016-12-19T16:28:15-05:00,"Snapchat's newest update includes a feature designed to allow users to send ""group"" messages.All else being equal, Groups will likely increase Snapchat MAU/DAU metrics.Snapchat's timing of the Groups feature may be designed to piggyback on its IPO home stretch.","Back in July 2015, I threw a long-shot email to Evan Spiegel in an attempt to offer a recommendation to improve Snapchat's (CHAT) platform. Naturally, Evan had much better uses of his time (like asking supermodel Miranda Kerr for her hand in marriage), and my unanswered Hail Mary was rendered incomplete. I also shared this with the SA community, and even went as far as labeling the Groups feature a ""no-brainer for Snapchat.""Just this week, after I had downloaded the newest update for the Snapchat app, I noticed Team Snapchat had added a seemingly familiar feature - Groups. And while this is certainly a small change, I believe it to be a deceptively powerful value-add to Snapchat's core offering. Allowing a user to create his or her own customizable groups, such as Work Colleagues, University Buddies and Secret Crushes, should likely enhance the peer-to-peer communication on the platform, as this significantly improves the prospect of receiving a personalized Snapchat message on any given day.Why did it take Snapchat so long to add Groups to its platform?If, like me, you believe the Groups feature is so convenient to users that it's essentially a no-brainer, then I really think there are two viable explanations to this question. The first is more obvious, in that it is possible that until recently nobody at Snapchat had thought of this feature. Surely this iteration is quite simple in nature and wouldn't take very long to tack onto the existing platform. Therefore, it is possible that until recently Team Snapchat did not think of the idea. However, while possible, I find this explanation unlikely. I can't imagine people who work/use this platform daily, all of whom are sending thousands of Snapchats to one another, didn't have the perception to realize a Groups feature would save a great deal of time in their daily usage of the app.Which leads me to think it is plausible that there is some sort of strategic rationale, and that Snapchat may have opted to wait to add this feature. Is it possible that this feature is part of the company's IPO plan? In mid-November, Snapchat confidentially filed the paperwork for an IPO, which could hit the Street as early as March 2017, suggesting the company is in the home stretch. The Wall Street Journal reported this coveted IPO could fetch a valuation as high as $25 billion. However, Snapchat is expecting only $250-350 million in revenue in 2016, and this implies a near-100x price/sales multiple. And with the company likely reporting a bottom line figure in the red, how does it expect investors to value its recent improvements without using a financial assessment? Certainly, growth in Monthly Active Users (MAUs) is a very important metric when analyzing the potential growth of a social media business. And over a shorter period of time, growth in Daily Active Users (DAUs) is even more important. And I suppose if I had to keep one trick in my bag designed to improve MAUs/DAUs right before my company's IPO, it very well might be the Groups feature. Sending messages to your group of friends, who then answer with a reply to their group of friends etc., can create a pyramid-shaped domino effect that could drive active users to the platform.In conclusion, it is quite possible this is simply a small, inevitable change I'm overanalyzing that may have little to no material impact on the MAUs/DAUs. However, as the company had recently started veering its focus towards Stories, I had been a little worried it had lost its roots. I do believe Snapchat's true offering revolves around the best and most efficient way to give users the ability to securely send a personal message that disappears. And for the time being, I will choose to interpret the Groups feature as a signal that Snapchat does understand this.Nevertheless, Groups will enhance the convenience for users to send peer-to-peer messages that disappear and very well may drive user engagement, while simultaneously increasing those MAU/DAU metrics IPO investors will be paying close attention to. As for the IPO itself, I will likely choose to observe the speculative sizzle from the sidelines - which reminds me, I should invest in a pair of spectacles."
4041811,102646,2017-02-02T00:54:21-05:00,"While Snap Inc calls itself a camera company, we all know it is a social media company.Snap Inc will be one of the most expensive tech IPOs ever.Snap is popular with millennials but what will happen once they outgrow it.","Snapchat's parent company, Snap Inc (PRIVATE: CHAT) is expected to go public as early as March in a transaction being led by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS). The company, which is popular with millennials will be valued at more than $20 billion. This will be one of the biggest tech IPOs in the recent past. In a recent interview with CNBC, Trip Chowdhry, the managing partner at Global Equities Research called Snap junk not worth more than $500 million. He said this about the company: ""We are at the tail end of the social media boom. Novelty is giving way to fatigue."" To a large extent, I agree with him. In this article, I will highlight the reasons why short 'investors' will be rewarded than the longs.Target MarketTwo of the best companies to compare with Snapchat are Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). While FB has become a success for its investors, Twitter has struggled with user growth and monetization. Part of the reason is that FB is a mass product focusing on family and friends, Twitter is a niche product with an emphasis on news. As a result, though more than 1.4 billion Twitter accounts have been created, only a small percentage of the account owners use the platform on a daily basis. For Snapchat, the target market is the millennials. In fact, on a daily basis, the company reaches 41% of people aged between 18 and 34.Source. BloombergThis presents the biggest challenge to CHAT. In the filing, the company is touting the user engagement or the time spent its users spend on the platform. A report by Fitzegerald noted that Snapchat's users spend about 10 minutes per day in the platform. How does the company assure its investors that the engagement will remain high? Also, how will the company distinguish itself from its closest peers? Instagram has already updated its application to provide the same product as what Snapchat provides. Further, Instagram is a much larger 'company' than CHAT with 500 million monthly active users (MAU) and 300 million daily active users (DAU). In addition, Techcrunch reported that Instagram's stories feature had gained more than 150 million DAU. As of June, CHAT had about 150 million daily DAU as shown below with 235 million people using it monthly.Source. StatistaIn short, going forward, CHAT will have a challenge in terms of user growth especially when the current users age. As a way of addressing this issue, CHAT will list as a camera company to differentiate itself from the apparent competitors. Its mission statement now is:This reminds me of a popular saying, ""If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.""ValuationAs a private company, Snap's financials are not known. However, in a report by Recode, Snap told investors that it would generate between $300 and $350 million in revenues in 2016. eMarketer on the other hand projected that Snap would generate almost a billion dollars in 2017. The ad revenues would grow to $1.7 billion in 2018 as shown below.Source. eMarketerIf the figures are true, at the IPO, Snapchat will be trading at 25x its projected revenues. This will be higher than its would-be peers multiple as shown below.Source. BloombergFinal WordsSnapchat is without a doubt a great company especially with the millennial demography it targets. The only problem with it is the valuation. The $25 billion price places the company at half the size of Instagram which analysts have valued at $50 billion. Investors who will buy the company at the IPO will be making a grave mistake.Before going long the company, consider the following statement by Trip Chowdhry"
4042724,23395,2017-02-05T03:35:54-05:00,,"Snap (NYSE:SNAP) hopes its estimated 2017 sales of about $1 billion, up 150% from 2016, will be enough to justify a rumored $25 billion price tag. That valuation hinges on investors' confidence that it can increasingly monetize a fast-growing user base (check out Snap's key stats), following in the footsteps of rival Facebook while avoiding the pitfalls that plagued Twitter.In the middle of 2009, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was on track for $1 billion in sales over the next 12 months, and three years later it went public at a valuation of $104 billion. Now that Snap is nearing the $1 billion mark, public investors who think it's the next Facebook may buy into Snap's $25 billion valuation on its potential for a 300% return over three years."
4040829,24473,2017-01-30T19:00:04-05:00,"Snapchat is preparing to make its S-1 public as it gets closer to its highly anticipated 2017 IPO.Zuckerburg is coming directly for Spiegel, with both Instagram and Facebook launching copies of Snapchat's core Stories feature.Personally, I've seen a lot of my friends migrate from producing content from Snapchat to Instagram Stories.However, Snapchat is still growing revenue rapidly and is led by a visionary CEO, making it one of 2017's most intriguing IPOs.","HyperChange 9 - Snap Filing For IPO As Instagram Eats Its Lunch With Stories ProductIntro - Speigel Vs. ZuckerburgLaunched in September 2011 by Stanford student Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's (Private:CHAT) mobile photo messaging app has enjoyed incredible success.The app's focus on sending disappearing images and videos to friends and followers resonated with consumers, who were used to the permanence of content on other social platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Facebook quickly began to take the threat of Snapchat very seriously, and in late 2013, even offered to buy the company out for $3 billion. Speigel said no.Ever since then, Facebook has been attacking Snapchat from multiple angles by launching similar features in both its core Facebook and Instagram apps.In August 2016, Instagram launched its own version of Snapchat's core Stories feature. Just six months later, Instagram Stories boasts over 150 million daily users, making it nearly as widespread as Snapchat itself.If Google Trends data is any indicator of popularity, it looks like Snapchat is quickly losing its shine as Instagram becomes the new ""it"" social network.$25 Billion IPO Around The CornerRumors are now circulating that Snapchat could make its IPO filing public as soon as this week. When this happens, all the company's financials will be public and the official analysis can begin.In the meantime, TechCrunch obtained a copy of a leaked deck when the company was raising its Series F funding round in early 2016, with some financial data. This holds several clues about the size and growth rate of Snapchat's business.Screenshots from the deck show rapid growth in both users and revenue during 2015.According to the slides above, Snapchat only produced $59 million in 2015 revenue. Included in the leaked deck was guidance for 2016 revenue of between $250 million and $350 million. About four months later (September 2016), TechCrunch reported that the company's 2016 revenues were, in fact, going to be closer to $350 million.Even if we assume the high point of $350 million and a low-end valuation of $20 billion post IPO, Snapchat's 2016 price/sales ratio will be a whopping 57X. Sure, the company will be growing quickly, but justifying that high of a multiple is tough, no matter how you slice it.Facebook, though it's much more mature than Snapchat, trades at a 2016 price/sales multiple of 13.6X (assuming a $375 billion market cap and $27.5 billion in 2016 revenue).If we look at 2017 price/sales estimates relative to its peers, Snapchat's still looks quite expensive. Even though the company is supposedly projecting sales to grow a whopping 186% in 2017 to nearly $1 billion, its price/sales ratio remains a lofty 25X.Personal Anecdote: Snapchat App Is Buggy, And Friends Are Gravitating Toward Instagram StoriesMy current smartphone is a beat-up iPhone 5, and for some reason it continues to like Snapchat's app less and less. About two months ago, it became harder and harder to watch both incoming direct Snaps from my friends as well as my friend's Stories. In fact, now the app is so slow and the chances of it successfully loading a Snap so low that I deleted it from my phone altogether (it was taking up memory I needed). I'm not alone in this. Just a month ago, Fortune reported that many Snapchat users were tweeting their frustration about the app's recent glitches as well.This has occurred right as Instagram's own Stories feature is gaining a lot of traction. Just as a I check my Instagram app now, 27 out of the 207 people I follow have posted a Story in the last 24 hours (a solid 13%).Many of my close friends who used to post a lot of content to Snapchat have begun shifting their daily posts/vlogs to Instagram Stories. Whether this is because of similar frustrations with the app's functionality or simply because they like Instagram better, I don't know. Regardless, I see a worrying trend among my peers (23 and 24 years old) of content creation moving from Snapchat to Instagram.Conclusion: Lots of Potential, But I'll Be Watching From The SidelinesSnapchat's highly anticipated IPO is finally upon us. When the company's S-1 filing comes out in a week or two, we are due to find out a lot of juicy details surrounding its official financials.Based on the sparse and speculative data we have now, it looks like Snapchat will be one of the market's fastest-growing tech companies and one of the most expensive.Snapchat's IPO comes at a critical time, as Instagram is closer than ever to poaching a significant chunk of its user base and content.The company's rich valuation and the expectations that come with that make me tentatively bearish on Snapchat's IPO. I believe Zuckerburg will continue to steal Speigel's thunder."
4027426,91585,2016-11-30T19:00:40-05:00,"Snapchat has already established an impressive user base.Discover, Memories, and Stories build an interactive experience for Snapchat users.Successful and unintrusive advertisement has started to generate revenue.Snap has shown impressive innovative ability in the past and present.","Snapchat (CHAT) currently holds an enviable market share and impressive following that should intrigue investors as its initial public offering approaches. Though current concrete numbers are hard to pinpoint, it has over 150 million daily active users according to Bloomberg Tech and over 1 billion snaps are created a day according to Snapchat's marketing material. These numbers in their own right garner value, as they place Snapchat in the top 15 social network sites/applications worldwide by active users as of September 2016 according to Statista. Though it is often difficult to value a company before going public, especially this early in the process, Snapchat certainly has value as a major player in the social media field.Fellow Seeking Alpha Author Ravi Bala recently wrote a lengthy article on why he feels ""Snapchat is worthless"". Though Snapchat currently does not turn a profit, one simply cannot write it off as a loser without first investigating what it has to offer investors. Ravi states that one shouldn't ""look at Snapchat as having future growth potential"", but conversely I feel it is necessary when looking to invest in most IPOs and certainly a company which doesn't make money. Imagine if investors had that same mentality with a company such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN); 19 years and $356 billion later, AMZN is doing quite well.So yes, Snapchat has had an impressive first four years, but growth is needed to maintain belief in a company which is losing money. Once again, to compare, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) took over eight years to turn its first profit. Fortunately, the growth and interest in Snapchat fueled by consumers and advertisers is phenomenal! According to Nielsen (Source: Nielsen Media Impact, Reach Duplication, Nielsen Total Media Fusion/GfK MRI Survey of The American Consumer 9/1/2015 - 9/30/2015 (Television, Internet, and Mobile)), 41% of 18- to 34-year olds in the U.S. are daily active users. A remarkably hard feat to accomplish; Snapchat has attracted an impressive chunk of young adult and teenagers while continuing to grow. As businesses look for ways to target younger audiences, Snapchat is now one option they must consider. This younger audience is important because as they leave home and continue to grow up, they must make decisions on what products they will use.Growth is occurring everywhere as last year Snapchat saw video views increase to 10 billion, up 350% in one year. Growth in the billions doesn't take place without a product consumers believe in. Snapchat can now benefit from word of mouth, the best free advertisement around, as those who do not use the service feel left-out as peers use it to interact. Snapchat has certainly not reached a point of over-saturation, its strong growth in multiple categories leads one to believe there is much more left in the tank.It certainly seems nearly impossible for revenues of less than 100 million to grow to over a billion in two years, but surprisingly this astronomical growth is happening before our eyes at Snapchat. According to ""two people familiar with the matter"", Snapchat is already ahead of its top end forecast of $350 million in 2016 and has projected as much as $1 billion in revenue for 2017 during a meeting with investors. This is possible because CHAT waited to monetize its user base. Similar to Facebook's strategy with Instagram, Snapchat built a product that hooked users before attempting to monetize. Instead of distracting and losing users due to ads, waiting has allowed the company to learn about its audience and deliver an advertisement in a way that is beneficial to itself, consumers, and advertisers.The same team which designs Snapchat's consumer products makes its advertising products. By specifically targeting advertisements to users by attempting to provide content users are interested in allows Snapchat to make money while not disrupting a user's experience. CHAT uses two big methods to currently monetize its Snapchat platform. The first plays on Snapchat's ""Lenses"" feature (user can give themselves dog ears or turn into a rainbow spitting unicorn), companies can make a filter using something about their product and brand. For example, Taco Bell used this feature to project users faces into a taco, which users interacted with and sent to friends ""resulting in 224 million views in one day"" via AdWeek.Picture via Taco BellThe second more common type of snap-ads is 10-second full-screen videos which allow a user to swipe up and continue watching a longer length video, or visit a company's mobile site while staying within the Snapchat App. Snapchat has trumpeted a swipe-up rate 5X higher than click-through rate on other social media. This could be due to the fact that a user simply can swipe down and they are immediately back at their place within the app. No separate app or website is launched, allowing an easy return to their previous task for users. Making the interaction with advertisers as easy as possible is vital for success.It is exciting to see a company that has continued to successfully innovate from its initial offering of disappearing photos. Ravi talked about recent IPOs which have seen their fortunes fall on hard times such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Square (NYSE:SQ), GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT). But all four of these companies have failed to significantly innovate from their initial offering to continue to impress and demand consumer attention.In 2013, Snapchat introduced stories which are a collection of snaps that play in chronological order and expire after 24 hours. A feed which contains all of your Snapchat friend's stories can be perused at any time, simply a left swipe away from one's personal Snapchat feed. Discover introduced in January 2015 includes publishers such as CNN and ESPN, providing content to users. Snapchat states that more people watch coverage of events on snap then TV such as college football games and presidential debates. The aforementioned Lenses feature was introduced in September 2015. And most recently Memories allows users to save pictures and videos they take on the app.Though I have alluded to the company as Snapchat throughout this article, the official company name of Snap alludes to a desire to be more than its app Snapchat. This has been evidenced by its recent and limited release of camera-equipped classes called ""Spectacles"". An impressive ad campaign and sold out limited releases have shown promise for this product, which, among other features, records and wirelessly shares media with one's Snapchat account. Overall this shows how Snap is looking to expand outside of its application.Snap also acquired Bitmoji, a popular personal emoji application, earlier in the year for $100 million, further signaling its dedication to growth in new avenues. This app still acts as a standalone, but is now also integrated into Snapchat itself. Users are able to drag, drop, and resize emojis and Bitmoji onto photos without leaving the app. It was not long ago that Facebook was attempting to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion in 2013; this reversal in roles in such a short period of time is quite impressive.When perusing the comments of Ravi's article, Seeking Alpha contributor Christopher De Sousa asked ""Instagram today just announced features that Snapchat has what makes Snapchat so different, and how will it come out with features that Instagram (can't) easily adopt as their own"". Certainly, a valid question, what is going to stop the top dog in photo sharing from stomping on Snapchat? From personal experience, no one sends photos to each other privately on Instagram, and the minimal use of Instagram's take on Snapchat Stories is often just Instagram users posting their Snapchat usernames.This occurs because Snapchat has established an economic moat in its space, and it's not going to be an easy task for anyone to invade it. Think of Instagram as the Dad trying to come and play with the kids who already have a game going that they like. Snapchats are often taken when something interesting is occurring or seen, mobile users are only going to be able to select one and that is going to be the one that their friends are already using. Snapchat is using Discover, Memories, and Stories as a way to keep consumers glued to a variety of interconnected options built into one ecosystem.Ultimately, investors should take a look at Snap and the value it offers. Though it certainly might not be worth the estimated $20-25 billion IPO valuation, it certainly makes a case for a high valuation due to its growth, innovation, and economic moat."
4038749,102232,2017-01-23T14:02:09-05:00,"Snapchat is a social-media platform with bright future prospects. It has been moving along with its IPO process and is on pace for a 2017 offering.Let's compare Snap's estimated IPO valuation to some previous online/digital advertising companies at the time of their IPO, particularly Facebook, to get an idea of the expectations for the company.Snap has many things going for it, but it also has some very high expectations. I'm not ready to just assume it will be as successful as Facebook.","Introduction And Company DescriptionSnap (CHAT) Inc. is a private company whose bright future prospects have been well-documented. It became known for its disappearing private photos, but in the business world its ability to reach coveted demographics through advertising has drawn a lot of attention:Source: TechcrunchWhile the disappearing photos were the initial idea, Snap (more commonly known as Snapchat after its most well-known product) has numerous features which also include videos that can be re-viewed (i.e. not disappearing instantly) over the course of a 24-hour period. Here is a good graphic of the Snapchat interface:Source: Business 2 CommunityGoing from left to right, we have the chat and inbox features. You can chat with a friend just like on many other platforms. The inbox is private pictures/videos (the ones that disappear) from your friends. Moving to the right, this is where we move from private to public. As you can see, the user has the ability to select multiple content providers which will have ""stories"" that usually consist of multiple short video clips/pictures embedded into one longer video.So for example, I could choose to have ESPN, WSJ, Fortune, etc. as tabs that would show in my stories page. There are also more specific categories of ""stories"" that will cover an individual event such as the Olympics or the NBA Finals (as pictured above). These public videos can be re-viewed multiple times but then are changed each day.Snapchat's platform has some additional features, and this is where the company gets creative for both users and companies. If you are looking for a brief description, this link is pretty good. From the Investopedia article:""Snapchat offers brands different options for gaining exposure to young impulse-buyers. GeoFilters are set to display branded images when the user is within the vicinity of a certain location; for example, fries pouring out over the user's head when they stray within range of a McDonald's Corp. location. Sponsored lenses allow users to play with an image a brand has created. You might raise your eyebrows to turn your head into a taco, for example, and then - if so moved - send the lens along to a friend.""A few examples of GeoFilters for brands:Source: All pictures were obtained from Marketing Land. The link to the article is here.Business, Valuation, And IPOAs Snap continues to move along in its IPO process, let's take a look at its estimated IPO valuation and compare that to a few online/social media advertising behemoths who have gone public in recent years:Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - Social Media (Went public in May of 2012)Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) - E-commerce (Went public in September of 2014)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) - Search Engine/Online Advertising (Went public in August 2004)Note that these three companies I picked don't necessarily do the same thing, but they are all competing for online/digital advertising dollars. Also, I chose these three companies due to their bright future prospects at the time of their IPO, which I view as similar to Snap.As its valuation has ballooned over the past few years, there was a time when any hint of revenue or profit was scant. That has changed recently, with projections for the company to earn about $350M in revenue in 2016. There are different estimates out there, but I have chosen to use e-marketer for Snap's estimates. Note that e-marketer's estimates are at the higher end of the varying range of estimates. For example, while a leaked presentation deck from Snapchat predicted revenues between $500M and $1B in 2017, e-marketer estimates just shy of $950M for 2017.Here is a table with the estimates for 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively:As you can see, growth is not a problem. For investors, though, the question is about whether the shares represent a good value.Valuation ComparisonI have created a table here including Snap and the comparable companies mentioned earlier. I have included revenue in the year of the IPO (I assume Snap IPO's sometime in 2017) as well as revenue the following year (or estimated revenue in Snap's case).Source: e-marketer, WSJ, Annual Filings, Author's workFor Facebook, Alibaba, and Google, I used actual revenue numbers and IPO market valuations. For Snap, I obviously used estimates for revenue from e-marketer. For valuation, multiple sources have cited a range between $20-25B. I simply used the midpoint as an estimate.Takeaways From TableOther than Google looking like a relative bargain based on the table at 7.5x IPO year sales and a 93% growth rate the following year, we can see that Snap has some high expectations. Facebook is probably its most comparable company, and Snap's multiples are even above FB's 20+ sales multiple at the time of its IPO. Based on an estimate of next year's sales (2018) though, we can see the valuation is about the same.To the point about Google, I don't have the full explanation for why its valuation was significantly lower than Facebook and Snap. I could guess that part of it had to do with the tech bubble bursting in the early 2000s, so investors were not willing to pay as much per dollar of earnings or sales for tech companies in 2004. If you have anything to add on this, your feedback is welcome.What is clear is that the social media space in general has higher expectations for growth, at least in the near to intermediate term.ConsiderationsWhile Snap may look expensive from this angle, you first must consider the size of the companies at the time of their IPO. Snap is by far the smallest of my comparable group. This matters because a tech company (and any company, for that matter) will generally have an easier time growing revenues from a smaller base. Doubling revenues in a single year from $5B is usually going to be tougher than doubling revenues from $936M (which makes Google's performance in 2005 that much more impressive). That is why I included the sales growth rate in the last column of the table. With that being said, I don't think it is warranted to say Snap must be overvalued solely because its sales multiple is higher than the other three.That's the numbers. What about looking at some qualitative factors? Snap currently is and has the potential to grow into a much bigger company than disappearing photos. There are certainly some unique features that the Snapchat interface presents for all parties involved. The geofilters are very creative, but more importantly this is a great video advertising platform. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg has recently ackowledged the shift to video (and the shift to mobile has been well-documented), and Snapchat has some inherent advantages in both respects. As mentioned earlier, it also has a great advantage with the demographics of its user base.Source: comScore via Bloomberg GadflyNot only does it have a good chunk of 18-24 year-olds using its platform, it has significantly increased its penetration across demographics over the past three years.ChallengesNo matter how bright their future, the company does have challenges. Let's discuss them from both a qualitative and quantitative standpoint.An article on Recode discussed what it saw as the two primary challenges facing Snapchat today:1. Poorly measures the success of ads2. The CEO doesn't like targeted adsThe first one is straightforward; Snap has yet to find a way to measure the success of ads for its advertisers. At the end of the day, like anything in business, advertisers will eventually be looking for a return on investment. The company has, however, begun partnering with third party companies to try and fix this issue.The second one doesn't sound like such a bad thing. In fact, there are probably a lot of people who don't like targeted ads either, and this could potentially be seen as a plus. The big benefit of targeted ads though is the advertising companies are able to know exactly who they are reaching. Facebook feels like it has an advantage in this respect. In fact, Facebook, Alibaba, and Google collect vast amounts of data on their users. This data is a big part of the reason they have been able to successfully leverage their user base.Both of these issues I view as fixable in the long-term. But for now, they lead me to perhaps the biggest challenge facing Snap, and also the reason I would be hesitant to throw my money at Snap in hopes that it is the next Facebook: Turning all these users and potential into profit.Source: Annual Filings, InformationWeek, Author's workFacebook, Alibaba, and Google didn't just have high growth rates at the time of their IPO. They were for the most part tremendously profitable. I calculated an average profit margin based on the average profits for the two years divided by the average sales for the same two years.2012 was actually a low year for FB in terms of profit; in 2011 it earned $1B on $3.7B in revenue. If the $1B is instead used, its average profit margin would be around 20%. For Alibaba, I used its Non-GAAP net income in FY 2016 which was actually lower than its GAAP result.Again, Snapchat is much smaller. There were certainly years where the above three companies were not as profitable or not profitable at all. The point here is that not only do the high expectations relate to revenue; based on comparables there are high expectations for profits as well.That is the danger in assuming Snap's stock will follow a similar trajectory to Facebook's. While a lot of people are probably aware of FB's incredible run these past few years, less probably are aware that it has adjusted net profit margins of near 40%. That is no easy feat. Facebook has proven to have a durable competitive advantage. Snapchat surely has a competitive advantage, but in order for me to invest I would have to see that it is a durable and sustainable advantage. I would have to know that it would be able to monetize its users to Facebook's ability.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is an example of a company that at one point had plenty of growth and favorable prospects. However, its user growth has more-or-less plateaued, and it has not been as successful at monetizing its user base as Facebook.Here is a chart from Bloomberg Gadfly that has a different comparable group, but nonetheless shows Snap's high expectations:Source: Bloomberg Intelligence, WSJ via Bloomberg GadflyConclusion and Closing RemarksIn my experience, a company like Facebook doesn't come around too often. It's not that nobody else tried to do the same thing (MySpace). Social Media is a fast-growing industry, and Snapchat has surely caught some eyes and captured a space. This will be a question of monetization, because it looks like Snapchat has the user base to be successful.Maybe you see evidence of a durable advantage already, or maybe you think we are in a day and age where not having profits won't stop a company from being a good investment. Maybe you're right. But in this situation I will heed some Warren Buffett advice and ""wait for a better pitch."" I missed the opportunity to buy FB a few years back, but it would be a mistake to buy Snap with the hopes of getting similar returns. After all, Facebook had the advantage of not having to compete with Facebook.I will say that management has done a good job of going public when expectations are high. While it may not be a good investment at this time, it is good for the company in terms of raising more cash.I used Snapchat for a year, but I have not been on it for about 2 years now. I went off my past experience with it and from my friends who have it now. If I am materially off in describing any features, please feel free to comment on where that is and I will be happy to fix it. Thanks for reading."
4025066,69145,2016-11-21T05:04:04-05:00,"Snapchat is worthless.
        This euphoria for an unprofitable company is getting ridiculous.
        The are countless examples of hyped private companies that fail once they go public.","Love him or hate him, Kevin O'leary's theory applies here. Snapchat (CHAT) is worthless.The concept is very simple. You go to a bank and ask for a loan, the bank will not look at how much you make (revenues). It will look at how much you earn monthly. So, if SnapChat has negative earnings as indicated in this 2014 report, the company is frankly worthless.Don't look at Snapchat as a having future growth potential, look at the company like mortgage applicant. No money, no loan. But people don't follow this at all. Hopes and dreams of grandeur come into play. Why? It makes no sense.To make things even worse, the revenue projections are wacky. Jefferies has optimistic projections, but let's call it for what it is, delusional! I have yet to see a revenue projection that is realistic. Revenues cannot go up exponentially unless you have something phenomenal that people want. That rarely ever happens. Ask yourself how can a picture company have revenues that go from less than 100 million to over a billion in 2 years. It cannot and Jefferies will blame the company when it does not hit such flawed projections. It is attribution bias, which is normal.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Case in point, look at Facebook up to 2012. It's old but it makes the case. Look at how its revenue increased.(Source: Statistica)Now look at the amount of users it had to achieve the revenue growth. One billion users for 4.2 billion dollars of revenue. Compare that to the Snapchat projections.(Source: Statistica)Additionally, we are being told that 60 million daily active users in the US is an accomplishment? Twitter has more than that, and the stock is suffering. However, since Twitter seems to be the social media punching bag of WallStreet, look at Facebook's Instagram. 500 million monthly users and revenues of 1.5 billion. Do you see how the Wall-Street projections make no absolute sense?If that is not enough, remember the Twitter pre-IPO buzz, Square, GoPro, and Fitbit? Look at where they are now.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Lastly, these analysts fail to understand is the conceptual nature of the business model. It is a two way street. The company has a perception of its business model, but so does the consumer. For instance, if the a company creates a phone that can levitate and they consider it an innovation. The consumer may not care about the levitation feature and just see it as another phone. If that is the case, they will not purchase the phone or buy an off-brand cheaper model.Think about how competitive the social media space is. Think about the differentiation of products. To the consumer in this space, there really is no difference. Honestly, it feels like the social media products are bundled. If you follow the social media scene, you will probably recognize this sentence: ""Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat."" These seem like a necessity. I guess that may be the only thing Snapchat has going for it.As an investment, wait for the company to be public for a while, don't fall for such deep and convoluted analysis. Remember, these analysts do not know the future. These type of projections unfortunately play to our psychological need for assurance and certainty. Only certainty is death, not your return on this investment."
4020838,26891,2016-11-07T22:40:37-05:00,"Starting in 2017, Tesla will no longer allow new customers free charging on its Supercharger Network.Alibaba's Singles' Day sales could hit $20 billion this year. Is a rally in store?Snapchat's founders will control 74% of the company post-IPO. Windstream and Earthlink merge, while Priceline tops earnings and Samsung has another recall.","Tesla Will Charge for a Supercharge?That's the plan for customers buying a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle after January 1st, 2017. Those that purchased their vehicles before then (and takes delivery before April 1st, 2017) will be grandfathered into the current model, which allows Tesla owners to use the Supercharger Network for free.However, those that do order the vehicle after January 1st will have some leeway, as they will receive ~1,000 miles per year of free Supercharging credits.It seems like there sure is a lot of noise being created about this news - perhaps not a surprise, given that it's Tesla. But at face value, this doesn't seem like a very big deal.Bears argue it hurts the brand and will turn customers off, while bulls argue about financial savings and how it may boost sales this quarter.Tesla will not operate the network as a ""profit center."" As I interpret this, it means the company will operate at breakeven, only passing along its expenses to the users. The amount of those expenses, though, are not yet known. This could be an important factor later if it's indeed material to the customer.From a business perspective, this is a good choice. The company will stop losing money on its charging network, which will help bolster the bottom line and get its finances in order.From a customer perspective, this is obviously a loss. Charging will no longer be free, and the 1,000-mile credit will only take you so far. Of course, if the cost is relatively low, then perhaps this is no big deal for many - especially because they can charge at home, like most do anyway.But those taking a road trip in their new Tesla might feel let down that what once appeared to be free is no longer so.Personally speaking, I don't think that will shutter demand the way some extreme bears are hoping. But given that it's a negative for the consumer, I would imagine it does impact some enough to make them reconsider.At the end of the day, the company only needs the decision to be a net positive. Should demand remain relatively strong for the vehicle, and the Supercharger Network starts operating in the black rather than in the red, I would suspect Tesla will be the beneficiary, and so too could its stock if other catalysts fall in line.Can Alibaba Keep Momentum?Although the stock has faded almost 10% from its recent highs, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is showing the most momentum it's had since its IPO in 2014. Shares topped out around $120 on Singles' Day of that year, but the company is hoping to capitalize on the holiday once more.While the U.S. has its Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, China celebrates its Singles' Day earlier in the month, on November 11th. Last year, Alibaba casually generated sales of $14.3 billion on that day alone, more than double the coveted Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the U.S. for 2015, which total ""just"" $5.8 billion.That should give you an idea of just how big this one day is for Alibaba. But why stop there? The company plans to expand beyond mainland China, into Hong Kong and Taiwan for the first time. Combined, it totals about 30 million people in these locations.Will it enormously move the needle? Probably not. But given that last year the company boasted a sales gain of 57% from 2014 to 2015 for Singles' Day, I would suspect this year's gains should be impressive as well. Even assuming a 50% decline to that growth rate, we're still talking about total potential sales for 2016 being north of $18 billion.It seems like a tough metric to hit - I mean, $18 billion in one day is nuts! - but honestly, it's conservative by some estimates. This one calls for Alibaba to hit $20 billion on Singles' Day this year.Picture this: The election comes and goes, with the market hopefully reacting positively - by Wednesday we'll know what's going on. The 52-week high on Alibaba is around $110. If buy the rumor, sell the news is intact, a move from current levels to its recent highs doesn't seem unreasonable in anticipation of Singles' Day, provided that the overall market is working with and not against us.But then if Alibaba hits that $20 billion mark? I remember what I just said - sell the news - but it seems like good earnings results and $20 billion in sales in one day could fuel this to be a solid year-end play. Just some thoughts.Some Days Are Juicy, Some Days Are NotToday is not one of those days. There's nothing to really sink into in the tech world. But there are a lot of appetizers.For instance, Windstream (WIN) and EarthLink (NASDAQ:ELNK) combined together in a $1.1 billion deal. The tie-up creates $125 million in annual synergies and should help bolster the companies' cash flows, which of course, will trickle down to the ever-important dividend.It's reminiscent of the CenturyLink (CTL) deal with Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT), where the former could see a safer dividend as a result of improving cash flows. For the record, the company pays 9.3% dividend yield, which is a bit concerning.Even the AT&T (NYSE:T) deal for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) sort of has ""dividend protection"" written on it. Although the juggernaut picked up the company with a great number of properties, it too said it will help bolster cash flows.One has to wonder if Frontier (FNT) will be next.Snapchat Loves ControlOr at least, its founders do. If you think Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founders craved control, or that Under Armour's (NYSE:UA) Kevin Plank and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Mark Zuckerberg did, then you haven't seen Snapchat's (CHAT) duo.In this case, CEO Evan Spiegel and co-founder and CTO Bobby Murphy will control 74% after it goes public.For comparison purposes, after their IPOs, Google's Page and Brin controlled 41% of the company, while Zuck controlled 56% of Facebook. So it's substantially higher.Some people may not like that structure, but after all, it is the man who turned down $3 billion from Facebook - which was considered absurd by most investors just a few years ago - and is now staring at a valuation reportedly between $25 billion and $35 billion.I personally would think investors would take a bit more caution with social media stocks after seeing how some of them pan out - aka Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Snap's growth is impressive, and while it is possible that Snap generates $1 billion in revenue next year, it only saw revenue of ~$360 million for this year.Call me crazy, but at the midpoint valuation based on a best-case scenario, we're talking 30x 2017 sales for this bad boy. There better be some saucy margins in there, and that growth better not slow down.Again, for comparison purposes, Twitter's market cap is just $12.9 billion.ElsewherePriceline (PCLN) climbed 4% on Monday, then delivered a top and bottom line earnings beat after the close. The 5% after-hours move is blasting the stock through its old 52-week highs.*Face palm*Although Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has replaced about 85% of its Note 7 smartphones in the U.S. and plans to use A.I. as a big selling point in its Galaxy S8 device, the company suffered another setback: Samsung is now recalling 2.8 million washing machines.Oy.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4023734,26891,2016-11-15T18:20:14-05:00,"Facebook, Google and Twitter all take steps to curb fake news, questionable content and abusive behavior.Conveniently though, they waited until after the election to do so.Apple is reportedly working on new wearable glasses, Jaguar introduces a new electric SUV, and Snap files for its IPO.","Fake News for Facebook, GoogleThe fake-news issue surrounding Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been garnering a lot of attention lately. Perhaps rightfully so. Many argued that the companies should have cleaned up these acts a long time ago, but the amount of phony sources and questionable content hit a fever pitch during the election cycle.Now, both companies have announced measures that will target these sources and will hopefully curb the amount of fake news found in search and news feeds. Some have even blamed these platforms for swaying the presidential election.So if it took Facebook and Google this long to try and clean up the fake news issues, it must be a pretty tough fix, right?Not quite, especially after four students built an algorithm-based sorting mechanism in just 36 hours aimed at labeling ""verified"" and ""not verified"" news sources. While that doesn't solve everything, it certainly shows that the companies could filter these stories if they wanted to.Perhaps even more interesting is the developments out of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Earlier this month, we talked about the company's temporary release (or accidental release) of a ""muted words"" function.As it turns out, Twitter is in fact implementing that function, allowing users to block out tweets based on specific keywords or phrases. This comes alongside an overhauled user policy, which looks to crack down on hateful and hurtful content and makes it easier to report abusive tweets, even from bystanders.So let's get this straight: now I can finally mute out words like ""Trump,"" ""Clinton,"" and ""election,"" have a more constructive conversation, and stop seeing fake news plastered all over the web after the election is finally over?Quite honestly, it's totally disgusting.These platforms could have fixed these issues long ago. Does anyone else find it ironic that these three companies happened to stumble upon a solution just a week after the election was over? I call B.S.On the one hand, we could argue that the election prompted the companies to look into this type of content and behavior and has since found a fix. But seeing as though Twitter accidentally released its muted words function in late-October, and complaints had been raised on Facebook's political coverage far prior to election day - and some kids made a fix in less than two days time! - leads me to believe all of them failed to implement a solution solely because the election was driving results for them.After all, Facebook recorded more than 700 million interactions on Election Day while Twitter experienced more than 75 million tweets on Nov. 8th, more than double the prior election.Apple's New Smart Glasses?Just yesterday we talked about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and discussed whether it missed out on buying Harman (NYSE:HAR), which Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) scooped up for $8 billion.We said the company needs to find a way to grow, and if it can't do so on its own, then M&A is the next logical step.But alas, reports are now surfacing - because obviously the always-secret Apple would never tell us! - that the company is working on wearable glasses. Details are super thin on this, of course, but given other forays into the same arena (think Google Glass or Snap (CHAT) Spectacles), it's not impossible to think it could happen.Reportedly, 2018 could be a timetable for when the product becomes available, but again, details are thin.So what's the impact? Personally, I'm not a huge buyer on the hype train of wearable devices. In theory, yes, the potential of the Apple Watch and Spectacles or whatever else can now be worn is neat. But in practice, I don't need to view the world through a computer/glasses screen, take phone calls on my wrist or know what my heartbeat is for 16 hours out of the day.For some people, it's a great addition. No doubt. And commercially, these products have a purpose. But we've seen it with Google Glass, and we've seen it with countless wearable watches. The broader public just isn't buying into it in the massive way tech companies were hoping for.In essence, it's not the next iPhone. If Apple's goal is to build a suite of wearable products, then glasses would be a reasonable next step. If it's a profitable endeavor, who are we to complain?Like everything else Apple has revolutionized, maybe it won't be the first, but chances are it could be the best. And maybe everyone will want it then, but I won't hold my breath.Will Jaguar's New Car Stand a Chance Against Tesla?Jaguar's (NYSE:TTM) new I-PACE concept car is an electric powered SUV capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in roughly four seconds. Currently, the company estimates it will have a range of more than 310 miles and the capacity to recharge 80% of its battery in just an hour and a half.Jaguar is hoping to bring the vehicle into production sometime in 2018.This sort of fits into the argument against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - at least the ones that don't have anything to do with CEO Elon Musk.It goes something along the lines of when Mercedes (DDAIY), Jaguar, BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) and other carmakers enter the space, Tesla will be done for. Sort of like it's an annoying competitor that can be crushed, but right now, there's just no point because it's too small. Once it gets bigger and truly gets on Mercedes/BMW/GM's (NYSE:GM) nerves, then they'll squash it like the cockroach that it is - in the words of Kevin O'Leary.But that's the wrong take on Tesla. If Tesla's going to fail, it's not going to be because its competitors finally caught up; it will be from its own failures.Like we've said over and over again: Tesla can succeed, but it has to maneuver a tightrope in order to get there.First, several of these competitive threats won't even start production until 2018. Tesla has already been producing cars for years and is looking to ship about 80,000 of them this year.Let me know when BMW sells 80,000 electric cars. At last check, the i3 had sold 6,205 in the U.S. through October, which is down about 30% from last year. The i8 has sold a little under 1,300 so far this year, which is down 13% from last year's figures.We can call that cherry-picking I suppose, but the point is clear: Tesla has a huge head start over every company looking to get into the space. By the time Jaguar and other companies start producing these vehicles in 2018, Tesla will have churned out even more of its own.It has successfully carved out the top spot in a niche category, but a category that all the majors are poised to enter. Germany banned internal combustion engines starting in 2030. That sounds like a long ways away, but it's really not for something so bold.Maybe that will force German carmakers to make a superior electric car. Or maybe, that will draw more attention to Tesla, which will boost sales. Most likely, both will happen, but Tesla won't disappear.I'm just saying that we've seen a number of automakers come out with electric car prototypes and had some commentators instantly deem them as Tesla-Killers. But from the looks of it, Tesla won't be swallowed up in competition.It is vulnerable and has its obstacles without a doubt. But I wouldn't look for this to take it down.Quickly Speaking on Snap…The company has reportedly filed for its IPO.The valuation range is apparently targeting between $20 billion and $25 billion. Given how other hot IPOs have gone, I wouldn't be surprised to see it trade through that valuation, assuming the markets are still trading well come that time.Still, the actual valuation is perplexing to me. I previously laid out my case when the company introduced its Spectacle Glasses less than a week ago.Essentially, the company seems overvalued and here's why. If the company has a lights-out year in 2017, we're talking about $1 billion in sales. Taking the low end of the range - $20 billion - we're pricing Snapchat at 20x sales.Even with strong margins and assuming the company is profitable, this is more expensive than the industry-leading Facebook. I know Snap is the hot name with the hot growth, but choosing between the two, Facebook is definitely more attractive.Unless Snap shows us strong margins and earnings - or the potential for earnings - alongside continued strong growth both for users and revenues, this one is definitely overvalued.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4024996,97386,2016-11-20T19:25:48-05:00,"History repeats itself. To look at Snapchat's future, we must look at the history of other social media IPOs.Facebook had a rocky start, but today the shares trades at almost 3X the IPO price.Twitter had a promising start, but now trades lower than its IPO price.","History repeats itself. The age-old mantra. Snapchat's parent company Snap (CHAT) recently filed for an initial public offering. It's on track to be the largest domestic social media IPO since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Snapchat's largest user demographic is Generation Y (Millennials) and Generation Z (iGeneration) and it has roughly 150 million users.The service debuted in 2012, known for its photo messages that deletes after a few seconds, James Bond-style, without the fireworks. Today, users can post their ""snaps"" on their stories that their friends can view for 24 hours, or do private photo messages that still disappear after seconds. Last month, Snapchat started a featured section that shares articles and videos from popular sources, such as CNN, Cosmopolitan, People, BuzzFeed, Wall Street Journal, National Geographic, Food Network, ESPN and many more.How will the stock market react both short term and long term when Snapchat does go public? It will be hard to say due to several factors, such as continued growth in its user base, the newly elected president and revenue sources. However, we can get a sense of how the market will react both short term and long term by looking at the stock market history of Silicon Valley social media giants Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).FacebookFacebook filed with the SEC on February 1, 2012. It went public on Friday May 18, 2012 with its initial public offering at $38 a share.Image: StockCharts.comAround 600 million shares changed hands on the first day of trading. However, the stock quickly started falling and closed a week later at $31.91Image: StockCharts.comNow, let's fast forward a year to May 17, 2013, when shares of Facebook closed at $26.25. The shares still haven't hit the original price of $38. However, they did hit a low of $17.73, almost half of what they started trading for.Image: StockCharts.comToday, almost three and a half years later, Facebook is trading at $117.79, which is three times as much as the IPO share price of $38. The spike is due to a surprise on EPS when the company reported its quarterly earnings in July 2013. Since then, the stock has been on a roll.TwitterTwitter filed an S-1 with the SEC on September 12, 2013. It went public on November 7, 2013, with the initial public offering set at a price of $26.Image: StockCharts.comTwitter started strong at $43.50 when the shares started trading on the market. Over 25 million shares traded hands on the first day. Unlike Facebook, the shares ended the day below what they started at. However, if you had bought TWTR shares at $26, you would have ended the week in the black, unlike Facebook.Image: StockCharts.comA year after going public, the TWTR chart resembles a roller coaster ride. Ultimately, a year after going public, the shares were trading at $40.31, while peaking at almost twice that. Still, they have been a decent return on your money if you bought at $28.Today, two years after going public, TWTR stock is trading at $18.73. In contrast to FB, which picked up steam after the first rocky year, TWTR wasn't able to keep up with the same momentum. This led to a plunging stock price, roughly 75% of its original IPO price.Facebook vs. Snapchat vs. TwitterFacebook prospered in the long term, while floundering in the short term, while Twitter did the opposite. Snapchat's current revenue sources are similar to both Twitter and Facebook - utilizing ads.Snapchat will be publicly traded in the first quarter of 2017. The IPO price will probably be between $25 and $35. It will also have a popular first day of trading, with probably close to 50 million shares trading hands.Facebook became so popular that the entire family jumped onboard, including the family dog. But Generations X and Y didn't care to share their drunk party moments, inside jokes and lifestyles where their families could publicly comment. Instead, they flocked in droves to other social media, including Vine, Twitter, Instagram and, recently, Snapchat.Last week, Snapchat started selling glasses that capture videos out of vending machines for $130, called Spectacles. It's an interesting concept that utilizes scarcity marketing, because the pop-up vending machines are only in a location for 24 hours and sells a maximum of 2 pairs per customer.While I see Spectacles as a short-term way to boost its revenue in preparation for the IPO, Snapchat will have to do something game changing if the company wants to continue to grow its user base and achieve the long-term stock market success of Facebook."

Amid the relative weakness the IPO market has experienced this year and, in particular, the tech IPO market, a possible IPO of high-profile, millennial-related social unicorns excites most tech investors. Most investors dream of an opportunity to grab a piece of Snapchat before it surges like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) (before the catastrophic plunge). However, when putting some rationale into the decision to invest in a Snapchat IPO, looking at the valuation, growth potential, competitive landscape, and funding alternatives, I am not so sure that Snapchat is an investment most investors would like to make.Snapchat has some great features and advantages over the competition. It was the first to introduce a self-disappearing message, and it perfected image editing and add-ons in a way that created a signature style; it was also the first to enable live video and video messaging. These innovative features have made Snapchat a very popular messaging app for users below the age of 18 years old. Users below the age of 18 account for 23% of Snapchat's user base, while 60% of Snapchat users are below 25, and 86% are below 35. When looking at other players like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, users below the age of 35 account for only 47%, 48.5% and 50% of their user bases respectively; we can thus see Snapchat's strength in attracting young people.Competitors Close The GapAfter years of watching Snapchat grow and slowly develop into serious competition that could risk Facebook's MAU growth, Facebook has recently launched a number of similar features. Instagram has also launched, Instagram Stories, which, just like Snapchat Stories, allows users to create a slideshow consisting of short videos and photos taken in the last 24 hours, which then disappears. Facebook Messenger launched a Snapchat-like instant video feature that allows two parties in the same conversation to share short videos as part of the conversation. The latest part of Facebook's war against Snapchat was releasing new Snapchat-like stickers and photo-editing features in WhatsApp.Besides Facebook, other players like Line (NYSE:LN), WeChat, and Viber released many similar features that could convince users not to adopt Snapchat so fast. However, it's not clear how many users will return to use these apps after switching to Snapchat and whether these features attracted users to Snapchat in the first place. I believe that this process will continue, and looking forward, more and more players in the social media and messaging market will introduce Snapchat-like features that diminish Snapchat's advantage in this area.Non-core OfferingMost of Snapchat's competitors have a diversified portfolio that includes, besides a social media offering, other hardware or software offerings that decrease their social media dependency. The best example is, of course, Facebook, which has expanded its ecosystem to include several social platforms, P2P payments, VR products, and other innovative ideas. Snapchat's first attempt to penetrate new markets outside of the comfort zone of its core business is with the new affordable recording sunglasses called Spectacles. Spectacles is a low-cost AR device targeted at the low-end segment of the market and has only a single feature - the capability to make 10-second video recordings that could be embedded into Snapchat.The simplicity of Spectacles (some might call it outrageous) is following the same line of its messaging app with simple, engaging, and fun products that will appeal to a particular segment of the population. This is a very nice business model for an emerging startup, but for a mature company it might be problematic to monetize, and I am very doubtful that the Spectacles launch will move the needle for Snapchat's revenues.Steep P/S Ratio On IPOSnapchat's revenues, as appeared in a leaked document earlier this year, revealed that Snapchat expects to generate a small amount of revenue - between $500M and $1B - in 2017. An eMarketer report suggests a more accurate figure of $936M in 2017. However, both figures reflect a steep IPO valuation.According to the various estimations published in the media, Snapchat will raise $4B in a valuation that ranges between $25B and $35B, which is a substantial increase on the latest $17.8B of the series F this year. Taking the revenue assumptions mentioned above and the valuation estimation published in the media, we receive a steep P/S ratio that ranges between 27 and 47. In the past, Twitter went public in a P/S ratio of 27.7, and Facebook went public in a P/S of 20, so I believe that Snapchat could pull it off and even generate a decent amount of demand for shares by institutional investors.However, as competitors adopt many Snapchat-like features that reduce its uniqueness, challenges to monetizing its dominant position and its questionable plan to generate long-term growth - I believe that retail investors do not want to be on the side that buys the shares from institutional investors on the IPO day. Indeed, Facebook and Twitter also went public in steep P/S ratios; however, with growing macroeconomic concerns, an investment that risky might not be a good fit for most investors at this time."

Last year's volatile political situation meant uncertainty continued to take centre stage. This kept IPO investors, and companies thinking of launching themselves on the market, more often than not on the sidelines in terms of launches. Partly as a result of Trump's expected pro U.S. business platform, and also because it certainly feels like many of the big shocks have had their day, there may be space for a turnaround in IPO-related confidence. With 2017's first major IPO likely to be Snapchat's in March, this article runs the rule over this decacorn, asking if an investment is worth the risk.IPOs in $bn raised - 16 years. Source: Dealogic/Wolfstreet.comIf 2017 does buck, what the above diagram shows is a two-year trend, it might be worth remembering that this does not mean that IPOs are an opportunity that can't be missed. The graph below shows in fact that very often they should be avoided, with companies launching with values often at the high end of the spectrum, meaning that between 2000 and 2015 (the years covered by Paul Marsh and Elroy Dimson of the LBS in their study) smaller companies, after their IPO underperformed the market by around 25%. If it were all bad news, however, the fanfare around IPOs simply would not exist. In 2016, whilst there were flops, like PhraseRX, down 73%, according to Dealogic, 81 of the 111 IPOs that made it to the market, are trading above their offer price. Though investors may feel companies are overvalued, and be wary of getting their hands burned, shrewd research, and even something as simple as a feel for a potential stock, can generate significant returns. As everyone knows, if you had invested in Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) IPO, your shares would since have trebled in value.Returns after IPOs - '87 on. Source: FTDealogic IPO data - 2016. Source: DealogicSnapSnapchat Ad Revenues - Source: emarketer.comSnap, the owner of Snapchat, from humble beginnings, a story most are likely already familiar with, has grown and grown, and become 2017's expected hot IPO offering, with a March date expected. The company, known as being popular with key younger demographics, but yet to crack the over 30s market, has been pushing a series of monetisation schemes, from in-app applets which can be bought, to advertisement. These schemes are ""expected"" to see the company's profits surge. Snap's IPO is expected to be valued around the $25bn to $35bn mark, and the key question is whether an investment is worth it, and how such an investment might be seen.Snap Revenue Forecast - Source: BloombergSnapchat has nearly 150 million daily users, and the positive case for investing is certainly there to be made. Initial investors have supported the company strongly, and are strong believers in its potential, Facebook tried to head off Snap's potential as a competitor with a $3bn buyout offer, advertisers see a method of reaching the key 18-24 year old demographic, and Snap's key product, disappearing messages, for the moment is only increasing in popularity. Contrastingly, a huge amount of its credibility comes from its cultural cachet, and should Snapchat lose its ""cool,"" it has much less to fall back on that its competitors, being essentially, for the time being at least, a single service offering. When Facebook stopped being viewed as an upstart and made the transition into ""uncool"" corporate behemoth, its huge user base, and its wide offerings as a platform and web portal ensured its survival. It is all too easy to view Snap's increased in-app offerings, for instance those related to emojis, as little more than faddish. In terms of investing in Snap's IPO, there is a case for, and a case against, and also the possibility that ""stagging"" the IPO might prove the most profitable course of action.Snapchat Millenial Popularity - Source: StatistaThe Case In FavourAs far as the company's future is concerned, Snap is well aware that it needs to broaden its product offering, having shown an interest in developing technologies such as its Spectacles glasses, and in the augmented reality market in general. In terms of its development, the company has grown over its short years to become a major competitor in social media terms, and the buzz around it suggests that Snap has both plenty of room to grow, and the necessary energy and vision, especially if you buy into the ""visionary"" hype around its founder Evan Spiegel. The company's daily-user figure of 150m is impressive, but so too is its much larger monthly active user figure of 301m. Over 9000 snaps are shared per second through Snapchat, and more than 30% of American millenials use the service. It also does seem to be an advertising goldmine. This latter point is even more pertinent when you consider the company's innovative advertising ideas, such as tying advertisements to a user's location, or its rumoured patent application for a technology which can identify objects in pictures and deliver ads around them. If the buzz is right, and the company can convince investors and consumers that it is the next Facebook, as against the latter half of millennial generation's Bebo, then getting on the Snap gravy train is a simple choice to make.Snapchat Infographic Edited from FDI Website.The Case AgainstBeginning with Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as a comparison, it is worth remembering that whilst Facebook grew and grew since its IPO, still having several bumps along the way, Twitter, the globally popular social media platform, continues to be valued at almost $10 lower than its initial valuation. Simply, there is absolutely no guarantee that Snapchat will be the next Facebook, or even the next Twitter; it has yet to suffer a real series of setbacks, and cannot claim to have had its mettle truly tested.Snapchat Valuation Speculation - Source: Dealogic/WSJThe word unicorn is used around IPOs for the simple reason that massive investor returns often prove to be entirely illusory. University of Florida's Jay Ritter found, for instance, that average investors in IPOs usually lose money over the five years following an IPO. This, of course, is not company specific, and Snap may be yet another example of a company that bucks such trends; however, it is certainly reasonable to be cautious.Snapchat User Penetration June '13 & June '16 - Source: ComscoreStill more potentially troublesome is that the future direction of Snap remains uncertain. Outside of its millennial demographic, and its messaging service, what exactly can the company do to grow? Instantly deletable messages might prove popular with people going through the throes of maturing, but it is difficult to imagine one's grandmother enjoying having a deadline for reading a message. Further to this, 150m users in social media terms is not actually, so to speak, all that. Instagram, a rival owned by Facebook, reached the same number of daily users since launching a Snapchat-like service: Stories. Snap's sole major conceptual offering, outside of its core application, its Spectacles glasses product, which re-pitch the company as a ""camera company,"" also might not prove popular, being as likely to flop as not. It is after all not Google Glass that powers Alphabet's global reach.Purely economically, the numbers also do not quite add up. Its current operating profits lag well below its valuation. If it floats at the $25bn mark, the company will be valued at around 500x its after profit earnings, and although it may succeed in its monetisation of its service, with 2023 profits expected to reach approximately $400m, even that level of profit is sixty-three times its IPO valuation. Furthermore, the fact that only a little over a year ago Fidelity marked down its then recent investment into Snapchat by 25%, could certainly be read as a sign that Snap is not quite the perfect investment opportunity it markets itself as.The last case against a Snap investment is the argument that the company is essentially operating as a free R&D centre for Facebook, with the technology behemoth simply adopting a variation of every single product Snap launches that might fit well with the Facebook offering, from Instagram's Stories, to Messenger's timed messages. What Snap can do, even if better, its already highly subscribed to rivals can imitate and offer. This may mean that user uptake, outside of Snap's current demographics, may prove difficult to ensure.If you are an ardent believer in Snap's future, then none of this analysis will change your mind, but if you are sitting on the fence, it does seem that there are significant risks in taking a position in what remains essentially a single-service company.The Case For StaggingStagging, the buying of shares in an IPO with the intention of selling for a quick profit, might be the most shrewd move in terms of Snap's IPO. If you compare the company's product offering with the two IPOs which generated a similar buzz: Twitter and Facebook's, as a single-service company, Snap has a lot more in common with the former than the latter. If this analogy holds, Snap's value is likely to peak early on, and then see a steady decline. In the case of Twitter, stagging the company would not have earned you as much as hanging on for the two-month high of $69 per share, but a 160% return for a day's investment is hardly to be sniffed at. Similar gains may be on offer the day after Snap's launch. Whilst not the most exciting strategy, if you are interested in Snap, but don't want to go all in on a long holding, stagging may just be the approach for you."
4010729,91965,2016-10-07T02:44:57-04:00,Snapchat needs to re-shift its focus back to enhancing its core offering.The heart of Snapchat is its ability to allow a user one quick and easy platform to personally send or receive a disappearing photo/video.Creating customizable groups and showing sports highlights would further solidify Snapchat's core offering.,"It's been a while since Snapchat has raised capital; at least as far as tech valuations are concerned. The company's last funding round totaled $1.8 billion, implying a valuation of $18 billion. With 2015 revenue said to only be $59 million, Snapchat's 300x revenue multiple closely resembles the predicted champions of the dotcoms in the early 2000s - most of which have now become worth less than the paper their unrealized gains were once printed on. The question any investor should ask when investing in a social media start-up is, how strong is the core offering and does this offering provide a sustainable network effect for the company 5, 10, 25 years into the future?In answering this question, I believe Snapchat has not yet solidified its offering and needs to shift its focus back to its core product - one quick and easy platform for an individual to personally send or receive a disappearing photo/video. By further leveraging this core product offering, this will keep the valuation ball rolling and it gives it enough time to figure out the rest. In the meantime, here are two obvious no-brainers I see for Snapchat to enhance that core offering:1) Create Customizable Groups - The best part about Snapchat is undoubtedly receiving a personal picture/video from a friend that soon after disappears forever. That's really the aspect that brings the most joy to a user's experience. Even knowing that a picture or video may be sent to other people, the idea that the person sending this picture trusts you enough to send you that Snapchat personally resonates with our innate human psychology. The company must not forget its original purpose. A Story is fine and there is a time and place to post a picture or video for the whole world to see, but a Story focus gives Snapchat essentially the same offering as all other social media feeds that consume today's youth. The focus should be on sending peer-to-peer pictures/videos that disappear. This fosters the strongest inter-user connection and is the reason why Snapchat is cool. The problem with the existing user experience is that Snapchat makes it so tough to send off that Snap to friends personally; it makes users more inclined to just Story it if they are sending something to more than, say, 5 people. Users are organized both alphabetically and individually, so if you have 100 or 200 friends on your Snapchat, personally sending any variety of them a Snap takes a near eternity.I suggest creating groups. University buddies, Work Colleagues and Potential Wives are three examples of groups that I would have ready for use throughout the day. Groups would foster the peer-to-peer messaging aspect of the app. A picture says 1000 words and this could even make Snapchat a much better alternative to text messaging in the future.2) Sports Highlights - In recent news, Twitter acquired the broadcast rights for 10 Thursday Night Football Games for around $10 million. While watching the whole game on Snapchat may not be ideal, showing the highlights seems to me to be a fantastic idea. Teams could have their own accounts, and you could follow your favourite teams and be sure that you never miss any of the action. It would also provide the teams with the opportunity to showcase the personalities of their stars off the field to build brand equity amongst new and existing fans. This is a concept that seems like a logical fit as the short nature of highlights seems very conducive to Snapchat's existing platform. Sports are a cultural staple all across the world. There is football in America and football in England, and both countries have fans that go crazy for their team.To take this sports highlight concept one step further, think of this. No sports fan cheers alone - after all that's what makes a team. Most fans cheer for their favourite team with other friends and family members. And Snapchat's quick and convenient access to picture/video is what could provide a sustainable advantage to sports fans across the world. But it would have to be conducive to peer-to-peer sharing as well. If there's a highlight worth talking about, why not give the user the ability to personally send a friend that team's Snapchat, so fans can personally chat about their favourite player's performance. With sports the possibilities are endless, but the implication here is that peer-to-peer connection compels users to keep using Snapchat in order to stay on top of their team.The VC keg is tapped and running as Snapchat seems to be doing just fine. But just like all great parties, at some point the keg dries and the irrationally exuberant guests quickly turn sober and sensible. While I believe my suggestions have merit in improving Snapchat's core offering, it is very possible that I just don't see the bigger picture the way Evan Spiegel does. However, after seeing many of these dotcoms go from trading 300x Revenue to trading 300x0, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see Snapchat's $18 billion valuation disappear into thin air faster than a 10-second selfie."

It beat on earnings and revenue, raised its buyback and dividend, and laid out a much better-than-expected Q4 guidance.Alibaba saw another record Singles' Day, but the stock fell on Friday.Snapchat dropped its new wearable glasses, Spectacles.","Nvidia's Stunning MoveIf you flipped on CNBC and saw the ticker tape across the bottom of the screen and saw Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - a $35 billion market cap company before Friday, mind you - trading higher by some 30%, you would assume it was just another takeover.But there's no takeover here. This baby is up on earnings.Yeah, a 30% rally on positive earnings results. Now I don't alter my positions too much, but Nvidia is one of the few stocks I wanted to initiate a position in a few months back when it was near $60.I didn't want to buy the stock because it was a hot tech play. In fact, the stock's crazy momentum is why I ultimately avoided it. That, and although its growth is really strong this year, that rate is set to slow substantially next year. Assuming the analysts are the least bit accurate.What I did like was all of the company's business segments, including data centers, gaming/virtual reality, deep-learning/A.I., and automotive/self-driving. I love those segments and see plenty of growth in them down the road. Not just this year or next year, but long-term secular plays.I guess that's what makes missing out on this one all the more painful.Nvidia blew through EPS estimates, posting 94 cents per share, vastly ahead of expectations for 57 cents per share. Revenues handedly topped estimates too, growing ~54% YoY. That alone wouldn't be enough to catapult shares higher by this much though.But it helps when a company also boosts its buyback and ups the dividend by 22%. And, oh yeah, when your Q4 revenue guidance of $2.1 billion is almost 25% higher than analysts had expected - What we're we saying about them being the ""least bit accurate"" again? - then your stock screams like this.Despite all the great numbers, it's so hard to get behind a stock that's up 164% this year. It's up 185% over the past 12 months and 339% over the past two years.Talk about alpha.Alibaba's Record Singles' DayEarlier this week, we talked about Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Singles' Day momentum. During that conversation, we pointed to some analysts who were expecting the company to report sales of $20 billion during the day-long event. Our guesstimate was for $18 billion and that call turned out to be pretty lucky, as BABA racked its total up to $17.8 billion.Perhaps that's why the stock is down on Friday, although it's certainly off its lows. We're people expecting $20 billion?The stock has been under continual pressure all week. In fact, it's down almost 5% over the past three days and 12% over the past month. That comes as a bit of a surprise, partly because the company reported such strong earnings growth the past two quarters (the most recent one earlier this month).Given that, coupled with the selling that the stock has seen from its recent 52-week high of about $110, I thought a good Singles' Day result could give the stock a rebound.Of course, $17.8 billion only sounds good if you were looking for a similar result. If the market was expecting $20 billion, then this of course would be a disappointment.But revenue growth is growing at an amazing clip for a company this big, and with a PE ratio that's only in the double digits, rather than triple, one could surely make a case for owning Alibaba.The Chinese consumer company continues to show its strength, whether it's with Nike (NYSE:NKE), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) or e-commerce. While there could be some political headline risk here, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me for Alibaba to at least get back to $100 per share and maybe even retest its 52-week high should the overall markets play ball.Did You See Snapchat's New Wearable Glasses?Amid all the political hoopla over the past few days and weeks, Snap (CHAT) unexpectedly dropped a new talking point into the world when it introduced its new wearable device, Spectacles.A mysterious yellow vending machine appeared near the company's headquarters in Venice, CA, on Thursday. The machine called a Snapbot sells the wearable sunglasses for $130 that customers can use to capture 10-second clips and upload them to the app.Snap will give its users a ~24-hour heads up when the Snapbots are headed their way.And that's the thing. The company didn't roll out the device online nor did these machines pop up all over the country. Instead, users will have about a day's notice when it's coming to town, and if they don't get there within 24 hours, the device is gone once more.Of course, if money isn't an issue, you can always buy them on eBay for about $1,000.It's definitely an interesting way to launch a new product, and this company has gotten very good at its ""rebellious nature."" Remember when seemingly everyone called the company crazy for turning down a $3 billion bid from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)? Even though those same people called Facebook crazy for offering such a large amount.The question then was how will Snap make any money? Well, the company is expected to generate $750 million or more in revenues for 2017. So I guess it found a way.And while its popularity has surpassed Instagram for the top-spot among teens for social media platforms, one has to question the company's value. Even optimistically speaking, the company might do $1 billion in sales next year. But the IPO range has it valued between $25 billion and $35 billion - an expensive valuation even under impressive margins.Facebook boasts profit margins of about 34%, and even if Snap can replicate those margins, we're still talking about an expensive stock.On an optimistic $1 billion in sales and at the low end of the range with a $25 billion market cap, we're still talking about a stock trading at almost 75x earnings. And that's based on a lot of assumptions, the first being that it can achieve Facebook's margins. A higher market cap drives up the valuation even more, and its revenue is already based on an optimistic note to begin with.There's also the fact that Facebook is trying to replicate and therefore crush Snapchat with its own features.The Snap IPO will be hot, no doubt. And I don't mean to sound overly critical, because the company's growth and user engagement are really impressive. I just can't fathom paying 25-35 times sales (or more!) no matter how good it is.Perhaps its glasses will increase user growth, user engagement and revenues like no one had expected. Will Facebook or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) follow up with their own products? Will Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Glass make another appearance?If Snap's product is a success, it creates a lot more questions than answers."
4011785,102101,2016-10-12T17:18:03-04:00,Snapchat's 2017 IPO valuation is bloated.Snapchat needs to demonstrate unparalleled value creation to advertisers and users.Valuation is only justified on premium ad pricing and upsides in ARPU.,"Snapchat (CHAT) recently got valued at $25 billion. Yes, $25 whopping billion for an app that made a meager $59 million in 2015 revenue.The fact that new innovation creates value doesn't mean we should jump on every bandwagon that has technology written on the number plate. Most of these rides just lead straight down to hellholes. The smoothness of the rise can be likened to the melodious sounds the Odysseus sailors heard right about the time they met their waterloo between Scylla and Charybdis.As unhelpful as history can be to future events in the stock market, using the lesson from Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will not be that much of a bad example.When Twitter IPOed in 2013, the narrative was that Twitter will be the next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).However, Facebook did not get its value by merely attracting users to its platform; it was rather a combination of user growth and an efficient advertisement model.Squeezing the dollar out of ad load takes a patient and concerted effort - an uphill task requiring some sort of unfair competitive advantage. Facebook was lucky because it was a first mover in a greenfield market it created for itself. It is this greenfield market that Snapchat is trying to disrupt. For Snapchat to be successful, it has to identify Facebook's unique selling points and beat it at its own game.Snapchat should be prepared to face fierce ad pricing competition from Facebook and Google.How will Snapchat stand out?Ads are irritating and nobody loves them. However, to successfully create a multi-billion dollar ad machine, you need to help users generate value for themselves in a substantial way.In essence, people flocked to Facebook because they wanted a faster and more effective means to communicate. Facebook soon became the go-to communication tool for individuals and businesses to sell their brands to the world. The instant effect of growing your brand by adding more friends and reaching out to more people with the click of a button and a couple of profile updates compelled competitors to try to replicate the Facebook model.Since anyone can now build a brand by leveraging what is regarded as the Facebook effect, Twitter decided to recreate the special feeling by calling the friends people have, followers. People with big egos (mostly teens) who couldn't spin a successful brand for themselves flocked to Twitter, Foursquare, and other social sites that tried to make users feel special by giving them ego-boosting titles and avatars.While people flocked to other social sites, advertisers could not. Facebook had a first mover advantage and was able to leverage that by helping advertisers grow their brands. Facebook was helping advertisers via free business pages with the option of running an advertisement campaign to accelerate followership growth. This worked a lot for advertisers because they could connect with millions of their followers via their Facebook page.To increase ROI on ad spend, Facebook created an analytics engine to enable more accurate audience targeting. All these did not happen overnight.A $25 billion valuation on Snapchat is a bet on it to replicate the value generating capabilities of FB. The same bet was made on Twitter years ago. As of today, Twitter has been able to play Robin to Facebook's Batman.Here is where it gets interesting.Facebook faced serious pushbacks from Google, which was generating value to advertisers using the CPC bidding metric. When you make a Google search, the search algorithm churns the most relevant websites to those keywords, affording advertisers the opportunity to put their brands in strategic SERP positions for brand keywords. This method had its limitations because advertisers needed to connect with millions of users and not just a single user making an unpredictable search query.Using the CPM (cost per thousand impressions) bidding, Facebook allowed advertisers to pay a competitive rate to reach a thousand people at a time. This advertisement metric helped propel Facebook's ad revenue while it received pushbacks from the Google display network, which also leveraged a CPM bidding metric to sell ad spaces to advertisers.In recent years, the massive improvement in network speed, bandwidth, and connectivity helped propel a new form of social media usage. Users were no longer content with status updates or 140 characters to grow their personal brands. They found a more convenient capability in pictures and short videos. Facebook grabbed Instagram as a weapon to fight the new battle for ad load space. Snapchat saw this opportunity and decided to monetize its platform by placing ads in stories. Investors need to consider a few risks before buying into the Snapchat advertising prospect.Facebook is creating value for advertisers in a cost effective way. For Snapchat to be worth 25X 2017 sales, it needs to demonstrate the ability to add users at a significantly higher rate than Instagram. This is one of the headwinds Twitter highlighted in its 2015 annual report. Facebook easily picked the low hanging fruits making it hard for competitors to break even with users outside the US. These users have low purchasing power, poor internet connectivity and penetration. Selling the Twitter ad platform was daunting due to the unprofitability of online ads in most developing regions outside the US.The low hanging fruits mostly consist of early adopters in the US and Europe. As soon as Snapchat has maxed out ad load on those users, the story will change. Reality will dawn and the battle for operating efficiently while expanding Snapchat to less developed regions will push headwinds into Snapchat's ROIC.There are hundreds of ad platforms in the world. The online ad industry is all about increasing ROI to advertisers. Businesses mostly put their money where their mouth it. They want to do more with less. This means more conversions at a lower CPC/CPM/CPV. Currently, Snapchat offers limited analytics capabilities for advertisers to target users for improved ROI. While Snapchat can easily fix that issue by acquiring a third party analytics platform or leverage in-house talent, this would come at a huge cost. This might lead to the unattractive ritual of recording GAAP loss and hopefully non-GAAP profit.There are also limitations to targeting certain audience cohorts. Investors need to factor in these limitations when valuing Snapchat.Targeting B2C companies is quite easy but B2B ads won't be as effective on a platform like Snapchat. It's not prudent to place ads on Snapchat targeting law firms, telecommunication giants, investment banks and other B2B companies. Interestingly, these B2B companies go for a higher CPC/CPV rate compared to B2C companies. There are cases of placements on the Google network costing up to $50+ per click for keywords like ""insurance"", ""tax lawyer"" and ""CRM solutions"". This is going to be a big drawback for Snapchat to fully monetize its premium ad platform.ValuationAssuming Snapchat grows revenue at 3X the industry projected growth rate of 10%, according to eMarketer, this will give it a valuation of 8X 2021 revenue. Facebook IPOed at 4X 2016 revenue with 1.71 billion MAUs to show for it.Snapchat either has to charge a 200% premium on all basic ad rates (CPM, CPV) or grows its user base twice as fast as Facebook to justify the current valuation.The valuation is only justified on paper when you use the ARPU metric. Assuming 250 million users heading into 2017, a projected quarterly revenue of $250 million gives an ARPU of $1. Given that Snapchat plans to be a premium ad platform, growing ARPU to $4 seems easily achievable.However, we wouldn't be giving investors a napkin of mathematical calculations when they start asking for returns.These numbers are based on projections with the assumption that competition (Instagram & Vine) wouldn't cause much attrition and users wouldn't find bloated ad load irritating on Snapchat."
4010831,101421,2016-10-07T11:36:12-04:00,Snap is the operator of Snapchat and manufacturer of Spectacles.The company is forecast to reach nearly $1 billion in advertising revenue in 2016.It is laser focused on user experience for its communication and video sharing app.It is rumored to expect a $25 billion valuation in an IPO in early 2016.Whether that valuation is reasonable will need to wait for hard numbers from the company's S-1 filing.,"Quick TakeSnap, Inc. (Private:CHAT) is reported to be in talks for a Q1 2017 IPO valuing the company at up to $25 billion. The company is showing tremendous revenue growth and is forecast to potentially reach $1 billion in 2017.Snap has shown it understands how younger users want to make memories and share them.Its bold Spectacles launch is positioning the company to own its user's experience, and is perhaps an entrée into augmented reality.CompanySnap, Inc. (f.k.a. Snapchat) is the parent company of the popular mobile app Snapchat and more recently of a picture taking sunglasses product called Spectacles.The Venice, California-based company was founded in 2011 by CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Bobby Murphy.Snap has raised in excess of $2.6 billion in financing from a syndicate of top-tier venture capital and corporate investors that include Benchmark, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Alibaba and Kingdom Holding Company.TechnologySnap has developed two primary technologies: a mobile app that users know as Snapchat and a new electronic device that enables users to take pictures and short video from their sunglasses, or Spectacles.Below is an extended interview in 2015 of CEO Evan Spiegel and Snap's three-part business model:(Source: Recode YouTube)The three parts of Snap that CEO Spiegel refers to are:So in that light, the company's recent soft launch of its Spectacles sunglass product, which allow users to take short videos of up to 30 seconds and upload them via their mobile phone is a bold effort to make their own ""Camera"" and to make it highly personal...and to ""own"" their user's experience.Snap has also launched an API (Application Programming Interface) to help provide advertisers with real-time data on their campaigns.MarketSnap operates an advertising-based business model.Its primary user base are young people aged 12 - 25 and it is estimated to have 150 million daily users.According to an eMarketer projection, the company is expected to book $348 million in revenue in 2016 and reach $1.3 billion by 2018:(Source: eMarketer)According to a report in Adweek, Snapchat only accounts for ""2.3 percent of total social ad dollars compared to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others,"" so there is ample room for share of advertising dollars growth, especially with the highly coveted younger demographic.CompetitionSnap's competition is primarily two-fold: social networks and communication applications.Social networks such as industry giant Facebook have their own picture-taking and communications apps, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.Facebook has made a point of blatantly copying Snap's functionality, in a bid to deny it a breakout growth opportunity. The jury is out on whether they've been successful.Twitter has essentially stalled as a network, and is viewed by many younger users as less personal and less of an 'in the moment"" communications tool.Other communications apps have picture taking, editing and sharing functionality. LINE (NASDAQ:LN) is one example of a company that is built on ""stickers"" or emoji/text that users can use to communicate.Those apps tend to be more general purpose, while Snap's CEO Spiegel says he thinks it's important to not lose focus on its core memory-creation and sharing usage by adding too much other functionality.Financials & ValuationIn early 2015 Snap raised $1.8 billion in its latest financing round at a reported valuation of $16 billion.Notably, major investor Fidelity kept its valuation unchanged in its most recent Q3 2016 publicly disclosed valuation mark.(Source: WSJ Startup Tracker)Below is a graphic indicating Snap's valuation growth over its history:(Source: SharesPost)CommentarySnap is attempting to become the modern day version of Polaroid by creating software and now hardware to enable users to retain their memories in the most fluid and effortless way possible.While the Snapchat app has been viewed as ""ephemeral"", the company now has built a variety of tools, some of which are short term communication-based and others where users can retain their videos indefinitely.But, Snap needs to prove they can deliver the kind of advertiser ROI that will be necessary to continue its revenue growth juggernaut.The company is developing the business side of its operation, so this will take some time to see fruition.With its bold Spectacles initiative, which has generally been well received by the fickle tech press, the company is clearly on the cutting edge and willing to take risks to differentiate itself from other social networks and communication systems.Additionally, a perennial question is whether or not Snap can stay on top of how younger demographics want to express themselves and communicate and keep memories.Snap has shown real insight into how younger people value ""experiences"", giving them the ability to express themselves in myriad ways.Finally, if the Spectacles initiative begins to work in the marketplace, it could provide a platform for Snap to develop the Spectacles as an Augmented Reality platform.As technology continues its march to miniaturization and users become more comfortable with wearable devices, having learned how young people want to use and interact with a facial wearable is just the kind of knowledge needed to expand the use case to a wider world.Think Pokémon Go meets Spectacles.

4008824,73185,2016-09-27T21:24:42-04:00,"GoPro and Snap are both attempting to control the entire storytelling process within a single ecosystem, from content capture to content distribution.Although the current target audiences do not have overlap, as each company expands, Snap and GoPro will develop into direct competitors.We believe, though, the two could form a strategic partnership and dramatically grow the AR content capture and distribution market.","When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed the iPhone 7, investors worried that improved durability and camera functionality would thrust the smartphone into competition with GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). We thought that fear was unwarranted, noting that iPhones and Hero cameras are fitted for different purposes. A few weeks later, though, we believe a true GoPro competitor that investors should watch closely has emerged from the social media space.In the past week, Snapchat (CHAT) has essentially transformed its entire image from a teen-centric, social media obsession to a reinvented camera company. Management recently unveiled the company's first hardware product, Spectacles, and it's essentially a gateway to AR, allowing for content capture through a pair of glasses and subsequent offload to the Snapchat app. To complement the new product launch, the company re-branded as Snap, and is now calling itself a ""camera company"" on its website.Snap's sudden transformation comes only a few weeks after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) launched Instagram Stories, a near-identical replication of Snapchat's core feature. As one would expect, consumer surveys following the launch of Instagram Stories exposed Snapchat's narrow moat and indefensible value. In this sense, we do view Snap's recent transformation largely as a defensive move as the company seeks some sustainable and protected value.On the other hand, we also see the move as somewhat offensive, as Snap has thrust itself into a collision course with GoPro. In an attempt to develop a moat and capture protected value, both GoPro and Snap are trying to create an end-to-end storytelling experience within a single ecosystem. In our opinion, the storytelling experience is a 4-step process, from content capture to content management to content editing to content distribution. Both GoPro and Snap have made recent aggressive moves to capture this whole process within the same ecosystem, but interestingly, they started at opposite ends of the process.GoPro started on the capture side with its iconic Hero cameras. The company then moved into content management with GoPro Plus, content editing with its Quik and Splice apps, and content distribution with its GoPro VR app. Snap, meanwhile, started on the distribution side with its Snapchat app (while some will argue Snap also dealt in capture, we don't think that is true, as content capture was done with a different device, such as a smartphone). Snap then moved into content editing by buffing up its Lenses and Filters add-ons, and recently dived into content management and capture with the new Spectacles product.Currently, there remains a significant difference between the two storytelling ecosystems in terms of function, target audience, hardware durability, and price point. GoPro has this extremely durable product with a high-quality camera. The new cameras are equipped with some advanced specs like water-proofing and voice commands, cost several hundred dollars, and are targeted at extreme sport enthusiasts. Snap, meanwhile, has this trendy fashion item with very little durability. It's not a highly advanced product with great specs, costs only $130, and is targeted at a more mainstream demographic comprised of Snap's youthful core demographic.Despite these differences, it seems pretty obvious to us that these two are on a collision course, given their almost identical attempts to control the storytelling process within a single ecosystem. Any attempted expansion beyond their core markets for either company would make the two direct competitors.On the other hand, there could be some strategic benefits to the two companies working together. They are both rather ""cool"" companies with lots of consumer appeal, dominate a niche market (action sport athletes for GoPro, teens for Snap), and specialize in different parts of the storytelling process. GoPro specializes in creating a durable tool for capturing content, while Snap specializes in creating an engaging tool for distributing content. They specialize on opposite ends of the spectrum of the storytelling process, and that means the two companies could help one another grow the entire AR content capture and distribution market.Right now, the two are positioned to be direct competitors in the near future, but there is no reason they can't become strategic partners. Snap could be GoPro's ticket to extending its naturally niche market, while GoPro could be Snap's ticket to adding value separate from its hardly defensible value tied to fleeting teen eyeballs.Regardless of whether GoPro and Snap partner or compete, GoPro's market landscape has dramatically changed. We think the company could be a big winner if management tries to partner with Snap, but this is pure speculation at this point. As such, until this story plays out more, we maintain that GoPro is worth somewhere around $16 per share on a normalized basis. We will closely monitor Snap's emergence, and will make adjustments to our GoPro value based on Snap's hardware developments. We recommend investors and those who follow GoPro stock to do the same."
4008461,99506,2016-09-26T11:22:11-04:00,"Snapchat surprised the world this weekend by changing its name to Snap, Inc. and releasing a stylish, new wearables device called Spectacles.Spectacles follows the unfortunate mis-steps made during the original Google Glasses product launch in 2012, but precedes the anticipated launch of Google Glasses 2.The release of Spectacles may provide a bridge in between Googles past failed launch of the original Glasses and a more successful future launch of Google Glasses 2.The wearables category continues to expand rapidly as technology advances and new entries continue to enter the marketplace.","Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) may have just received a big assist from the private company formerly known as Snapchat (CHAT). Private company Snapchat just announced its name change to Snap, Inc. Also, Snap has surprised the world by releasing a new hardware wearables device called Spectacles. Spectacles is the hardware on the front-end of the Snap ecosystem with the company's app (Snapchat) on the software side of the ecosystem.The Spectacles glasses are a fun and exciting addition to the wearables category as innovation continues advancing incrementally forward into the future of wearables technology. The release of Spectacles may actually provide a boost for the anticipated launch of Google Glasses 2 (actually referenced as ""GG1"" in Google documents). After the original Google Glasses launch failed, the company rebooted the project by assembling a team to work on what became Project Aura, the next generation of glasses. Heading the team is a key player named Tony Fadell who helped build the iPod, iPhone, and the Nest thermostat. Fadell's job of bringing an attractive Google Glasses 2 product to the consumer may have just gotten a little easier thanks to the market penetration work that will be done by Snap's Spectacles.Alphabet may find a much more receptive media and consumer marketplace due to the release of the stylishly designed Spectacles. Snap's Spectacles are fashion forward, fun, and likely to become a well-received product by consumers. The release of Spectacles has been well-timed as we are about to enter the holiday shopping season over the next 60 days. This new, wearables device may be one of the products in high demand for some time as Snap has stated that it will only be manufacturing ""small quantities"" of this product initially.By incorporating the cool factor, Snap's Spectacles may bridge the consumer divide between the unpopular Google Glasses worn by ""glassholes"" after the 2012 release of the failed original product and the upcoming Google Glasses 2. Spectacles are relatively simple and fun in both function and design. Likely to become popular among millennial consumers, Spectacles may prepare the consumer for a more sophisticated device to be released into the consumer marketplace by Alphabet in the future: Glasses 2 or GG1 as referenced in corporate filings.While the name of the new Alphabet wearables device may be Glass Enterprise Edition, the earlier releases are likely to be geared towards commercial use, as the name implies. However, the announcement of Snap's Spectacles should have Alphabet's full attention as they monitor this product's reception in the retail marketplace by consumers. The information gleaned from the Spectacles product release may provide Alphabet with an assist as they develop a timeline for the release of their consumer edition of Google Glass 2.Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal reported in November 2013 that Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel declined Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB) $3 billion cash offer to acquire his company. It was then reported that Google attempted to outbid Facebook with an offer of $4 billion that was also declined by Spiegel. Now it may be that Alphabet will receive an unintentional assist from Snap, Inc's release of Spectacles as Alphabet prepares for the future release of Google Glass 2 to the consumer retail market.

4010707,26891,2016-10-06T22:51:55-04:00,"Twitter shares plunged 20% on news that Alphabet, Apple and Disney all look to be out as potential buyers of the company.Snapchat is looking to IPO, but Facebook's properties are quickly picking up success duplicating Snapchat's features.Wal-Mart is looking to build on its e-commerce platform to better adapt to 21st-century retailing. NXP and Qualcomm appear closer to a deal than many had thought.","TwitterAt times, a predominate theme seems to embed itself in the tech sector. In this case, the current theme is Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and all the drama that is surrounding its potential acquisition.Both Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are no longer expected to place a bid, and nor is Disney (NYSE:DIS), according to the latest reports. That leaves Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) as the supposed front-runner for Twitter, although rumors still exist for companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).Of course, with the development that Google, Apple and Disney are supposedly out, the formula for a bidding war has died down, dragging shares of Twitter - which just yesterday hit new highs for the year over $25 - down more than 20% to sub-$20 levels.Ouch.Of course, Apple was never really a serious thought (its largest acquisition was for around $3 billion), and Disney just didn't seem like the right fit to drop ~$20 billion.If this is the case, perhaps SunTrust's Bob Peck is right that a moving average model could be applied to Twitter's buyout price. I still can't imagine management taking less than $26 per share - its IPO price. If Salesforce only has to negotiate with Twitter, the company should consider itself lucky. It did miss out on LinkedIn (LNKD), so perhaps Benioff & Co. are anxious to lock up another social media property before someone else does.There's question marks as to a supposed buyout deadline too - if it exists, when it is, etc. Should no deal materialize, investors can bet this stock will get hammered. But as of now, it has serious traction that there is at least one seriously interested buyer. Whether they crack open their wallet is a different story.On a side note: The NFL's Thursday night match-up between the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers will air tonight on Twitter.Wal-Mart vs. AmazonShares of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are slipping on Thursday, no doubt in reaction to the company's Investor Meeting. As you may recall, Wal-Mart announced its $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com (JET) earlier this summer so that it would stand a chance against the relentless retail assault by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).From the SA News Alert:The big question, of course, is: Can Wal-Mart compete? Can the company go head-to-head with Amazon and not necessarily win, but not get slaughtered? I think so (at least to the second question).Think about it. One of Amazon's biggest selling points for success is its infrastructure. The company's Web Services division has propelled its growth and bolstered its bottom line. Why can't Wal-Mart have a similar outcome, provided it starts moving in rapid fashion?The company already has sound infrastructure in place, and rather than cloud-based services bolstering its income statement, its traditional bricks-and-mortar operation will.It will cost money in the short term, and investors may pooh-pooh the move in the interim. But it's pretty key for Wal-Mart's multi-decade plan that it has a viable e-commerce strategy.If you think e-commerce has disrupted retail in the last two years, wait another two. Wait another 10 or 20 years. It will continue to make up a larger and larger part of retail. it makes no sense for Wal-Mart to ignore this trend, especially when it has the resources to join in on it.No, Wal-Mart won't be the next Amazon. But it doesn't have to be. It just needs to have a strong infrastructure, compete on price and ship in a timely manner. Order and pick-up or some other combination between its bricks-and-mortar business and online could possibly work too.None of it is easy, but Wal-Mart has the resources to at least try.End of Snapchat?Not yet, but Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram platform - which openly admitted that it made a ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" move by copying Snapchat's (CHAT) Stories feature - is gaining some serious momentum.Instagram Stories has now garnered 100 million daily active users. Although the figure dwarfs in comparison to the platform's overall 500 million DAU, it's still an impressive figure just 60 days after launch. It's even more impressive considering Snapchat currently has about 150 DAU.Snapchat is, of course, much more than just Stories. It's messaging and communicating as well. But Facebook isn't stopping with Instagram. Its Messenger and WhatsApp platforms are also tinkering with adding Snapchat-like features.Like I said, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.Will Facebook's efforts be too little, too late, or will it eat into Snapchat's lunch? I don't know whether Snapchat is headed for a Myspace-like ending. But I don't think Facebook is doing too little, too late either. The rapid adoption of its Instagram Stories proves that it's still quite relevant. Of course, it helps when you have massive scale.Snapchat will have to rely on not having its lunch eaten. In a study this past spring (done every six months), Snapchat was actually the favored platform among teens, with Instagram a very close second.Obviously, Facebook is looking to retake the throne with Instagram, while Snapchat is looking to distance itself from the pack. It will need to if it wants to garner $25 billion in an upcoming IPO possibly as soon as March. Maybe the IPO was in the plans all along. Or maybe - conspiracy time - management is feeling the heat from Facebook's copycat moves and is looking to get out while it can.While Snapchat's growth is impressive, as highlighted here, some may question a $25 billion valuation. Even though Twitter is having a hard time with its growth, it could be argued that its platform isn't worth $10 billion, or 40% less than Snapchat.Will NXP Garner More in a Takeover?If only Twitter had this problem. Shares of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) shot higher in late September after it was reported that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was interested in purchasing the company.Investors didn't know how much the deal would go off for, but the ensuing rally to about $100 per share from the low $80s didn't seem like enough. Analysts didn't think so either, especially considering the stock was trading near $115 in early 2015.A potential deal actually seems to be moving along pretty quickly, with NXPI apparently wanting $120 per share and Qualcomm looking at $110.Shares of Qualcomm are up considerably on the news too, as investors see the potential of a tie-up. NXP is benefiting from a number of strong cycles within the semiconductor space, and its valuation was compelling to many investors before the potential deal was announced.Conversely, as many know, Qualcomm has suffered from a lack of growth. I personally don't own NXP, but considered it a great company before this deal. I would think it's a good fit for Qualcomm."
4005301,26891,2016-09-09T17:12:12-04:00,"Amazon may be looking into the prospects of live sports streaming while Snapchat may be mulling an IPO.Apple's jet-black iPhone 7 is garnering plenty of demand while mobile carriers look to take market share with attractive iPhone offers.HP, Inc. may be in the market to buy Samsung's printer business for about $1.8 billion.","Amazon to Stream Live Sports?As much as this week has belonged to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its new iPhone 7, 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced a number of new initiatives and products too, like its new Fire 8 HD tablet as well as Amazon Restaurants delivery service in London.On Friday though, reports have surfaced suggesting that the company is looking to get into streaming sports. While many investors and Prime members would likely hope that those sports include leagues like the NHL, NFL, NBA and MLB, that mix seems unlikely.Of course, I'm sure Amazon would love those leagues to be included. After all, what does the company love more than disruption? Getting live-streaming sports would certainly cause disruption in the traditional media space. But there's a reason why it hasn't happened yet, as the traditional players have paid big bucks to lock these sports into longer-term deals.Because if it was so easy, wouldn't it make sense for companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) via its YouTube property to already be in the mix? Surely, companies like Apple and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would have the firepower to get involved too.I think live-streaming sports is a when, not if, situation for tech companies (or possibly tech-savvy media companies?). It's just a question as to who will get to it first and how much will it cost. For its part, Amazon is reportedly looking at garnering streaming rights for sports that are more popular around the world and not necessarily the four core sports that are popular in the U.S., that being football, hockey, baseball and basketball.Instead, the company is looking at sports like soccer, tennis and golf, among a few others. Remember, while these sports may not be the most popular in America, doesn't mean that rests true for the rest of the world. And with Amazon building out its Prime service in other countries, perhaps this would be a wise move to attract users - provided that these streaming services are available to them.Snapchat IPO On Its Way?If history is any indicator, perhaps a poorly received IPO would be best for Snapchat (CHAT). Of course, neither investors nor management would hope for such a thing. But instead it's a reference to Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), as the former struggled mightily after going public while the latter was greeting with a much more successful public debut.Of course, we all know how it has worked out.Anyway, no one hopes for a bad showing for Snapchat, should the company ultimately decide to go public, and that appears likely given recent reports. One report was a leak of the company's presentation deck that showed Snapchat had generated over $360 million worth of revenue in 2016, above the its original $300 million to $350 million expectation and far above its $50 million in revenue for 2015.For 2017, management expects revenues to fall between $500 million and $1 billion, with one analyst expecting the figure to top $900 million. That's a pretty impressive growth rate and one that investors would likely cheer in an IPO.Like most private companies, Snapchat has had to rely on selling equity for cash in order to raise the necessary funds to grow its business. However, the company has now opened a line of credit with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), which should help fund its operations and growth initiatives until it IPOs (assuming it does).How will Wall Street welcome Snapchat? When it was first reported that Facebook tried to buy the company a few years ago, most investors scoffed at the attempted buyout of the revenue-less entity. That's not the same attitude anymore, but I would be curious to see if investors still view this as a ""fad,"" rather the preferred social platform for a number of teens and young people.Back in BlackApple is Back in Black and looking to Shoot to Thrill with its latest announcement of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as it unveiled not just the black, silver, gold and rose gold iPhone colors, but also the high-gloss ""jet black"" one as well.So far, customers are Givin' the Dog a Bone, so to say, as the new iPhone color is the most popular demand in Friday's opening day of pre-orders. In some cases, consumers will have to wait until November in order to get the iPhone in the jet black color.This actually isn't too surprising. Whenever the company issues a new color (gold, for instance), it seems to instantly generate higher demand from customers.Separately, phone carriers are looking to spur demand too. They must be asking, ""What Do You Do for Money Honey?"" because new offers from mobile carriers like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) offer a somewhat tricky, but possibly rewarding proposal.The offer requires customers to trade in their old devices. If it's a working iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s or 6s Plus (no broken screens or water damage), they can get up to $650 for it. The turn-in value will then be flipped into monthly credit, which will be applied to the customer's bill over the next 24 months.The 32 GB iPhone 7 starts at $650, so in effect the phone is ""free"" for users provided that they don't opt out of the deal over the next two years.Beyond the 32 GB iPhone 7 though, users will have to pay the difference, (i.e. A $770 iPhone 7 Plus minus the $650 trade-in credit equals $120 out of pocket). Other iterations of the iPhone fetch a decent trade-in value as well - $400 for the iPhone 5, 5c, 5s or SE - so other customers could consider this plan as well.Well, Have a Drink on Me, that doesn't sound all that bad if you're a fan of the iPhone 7 and want to get your hands on one. The only thing I would question is those who want to wait for the iPhone 8 to come out next year. The deal would leave them stuck for 24 months, but that would likely be same problem for many who chose to upgrade anyway.Either way, Apple could be ringing Hells Bells if this plan works out well enough to spur strong demand of the new device.Samsung May Sell Printer Business to HPHP, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) could be the buyer of Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) printer business, with an announcement that could come as soon as next week.Both Samsung and HP have been in the news recently, but for massively different reasons. After surging to record highs, shares of Samsung have been on the decline since the company had to recall its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.The device was prone to battery fires, which for obvious reasons, made it unsafe for consumers. In response, Apple upped the orders for its phone and the FAA issued a warning to consumers about using the device aboard aircraft.The other side of HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) earlier this week announced a big, $8.8 billion software sale when the company reported earnings.Tying it all together, the printer deal between HP, Inc. and Samsung could be valued at around $1.8 billion, so it's still rather sizable. The sale obviously isn't related to the company's Galaxy recall, but it would mark a shift in focus for Samsung, as it looks to put a larger emphasis on its core businesses.HP is looking to focus on its core too, perhaps most notably by splitting into two companies.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Facebook's Instagram Stories feature getting traction from content providers.Mondays have been a popular day to announce big M&A deals over the past month. Will this Monday feature the same?","Why Would Anyone Think Twitter Is Shutting Down?While management has had quite the struggle growing monthly active users and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by no means is considered the top social media company out there, the idea that it would be shut down is ludicrous.First, let's not forget that MySpace - yeah, MySpace! - is still up and running. And I can't think of a soul I know who uses it. That alone should be reason enough to dismiss any ""Twitter shutdown"" news as pure and utter nonsense.Furthermore, the company grew revenues 20% last quarter and showed a slight profit for the quarter (albeit in non-GAAP terms). While user growth may be stagnant - not plunging - that doesn't mean it's a cause for shutting down. Maybe if the company didn't have almost $300 million in cash and $3.5 billion worth of cash and short-term investments, then maybe you could consider the idea of a shutdown.But even then, the recent M&A chatter and the return of Jack Dorsey (and all of his recent deals) wouldn't make sense either. So why then, would anyone believe the shutdown talk?I can't answer that. But I can point out that enough people believed in it to send the stock down by about 4% at one point Friday. Of course, traders could have just taken off with the concept and pushed it lower, knowing that some weak hands would probably fold based on confusion and panic. Given that the stock is still up more than 16% this month, you know there have been chasers.There's reason for #SaveTwitter to trend, but not for fear of it shutting down.Nvidia's Earnings Too Hot To HandleIt's worth mentioning Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) here, if for no reason other than its share price, has risen 165% over the past year. Where have I been? The stock is up more than 90% on the year and more than 5% on Friday alone.Fueling the rally is the company's beat on earnings per share and revenue estimates. Earnings of 53 cents per share blew past estimates of 37 cents per share while revenues climbed by more than 24% vs. the same quarter last year.The company has impressive growth in a slew of secular, hyper-growth segments, including gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive, the latter two of which saw revenues climb 110% and 68%, respectively.Not only was the year-over-year growth impressive, but also each segment boasted sequential growth as well. Record revenues and gross margins and a more than 50% increase to earnings shows just why the stock has been so strong. It also shows how much is already priced into the stock.Shares could have likely rocketed on a report like this - it was damn impressive - but given the big rally already, it's getting harder and harder to impress it seems. For new investors to be hesitant is understandable. With that being said, this company clearly has several growth levers to pull and should these trends keep up, it will likely be a BTD (buy the dips) type of stock.Check out: Nvidia's Ludicrous Mode and Nvidia's Pascal Clobbered AMD.Stories on Instagram a Hit or a Dud?Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram recently introduced Stories, which yes, is a copy right from Snapchat (CHAT). The company added the feature and Instagram's CEO wasn't shy about it, saying Snapchat ""deserves all the credit"" for the product's creation.According to some recent studies, Snapchat has overtaken Instagram as the most preferred social media platform among teens. That likely incentivized management to find a way to take back share. In any regard, it's still too early to say whether this initiative is a success or failure.However, it at least appears to be a popular among content providers. Perhaps not surprisingly, given that they want to capture as much attention as possible - especially from young and engaged users. Content providers like CNN, People, Cosmo and many others have all taken to Instagram's new Stories feature.Facebook and Instagram are hoping that this is able to spur increased engagement and user growth, seeing as though the Instagram property is viewed as major growth lever for the company over the coming years. It's doubly important to keep its core users engaged, seeing as though Snapchat has successfully begun prying users' time away as it becomes more and more popular.You know Zuck is wishing the company's previous attempt to buy Snapchat had worked out.Will We Awake to a New Deal?I've been writing the Eye On Tech Newsletter now for almost a month, which has so far encompassed four Mondays. In each of those Mondays, we've seen one or more notable M&A deals announced:July 18th - Verizon (NYSE:VZ) buys Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets for $4.83 billion; E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) buys OptionsHouse for $725 million.July 25th - Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) is acquired by SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) for ~$32 billion.August 1st - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) agrees to buy SolarCity (OTCQX:SCTY) for $2.6 billion; Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Didi Chuxing (DIDI) agree to a complex deal that ends the companies' price ware in China and results in Uber ceasing its operations in the country. For doing so, Uber will receive $1 billion from Didi, as well as 17.7% stake in the company.August 8th - Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) announces that it will indeed buy Jet.com (JET) for $3 billion in cash and $300 million in stock.Those are all pretty notable deals I'd say!

It was already announced that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) would buy Silicon Graphics (NASDAQ:SGI) for $275 million, but that deal came Thursday and isn't very big.We'll see on Monday if anything materializes over the weekend, but if the trend sticks, investors could expect some M&A waves in a few days."
4004855,101879,2016-09-08T06:36:51-04:00,"Snapchat's ephemeral premise is a big advantage, but also a critical risk.
        Snapchat's features could hurt long-term advertisement growth.
        Snapchat faces external threats that are novel to its model and needs to adapt.","Snapchat:The ephemeral nature of the Snapchat CHAT experience is what has made the platform successful. Intuitively, Snapchat's primary user base ages 13 to 30 want an experience where they can lower their inhibitions and have a fluid experience. Simply, unlike Facebook FB users, users of Snapchat do not feel the embarrassment of looking back at old ill-advised posts or posting the live stream of a Saturday night party. Snapchat is riding a wave of success and has exponential growth (an estimated 50 million users added this past year). Moreover, Snapchat's IPO is expected within a year, which would give it an arsenal of capital.However, this article will argue that the model of disappearing content poses a major threat in the long-term. Simply, Snapchat is far more precarious then it seems. Inherently, Snapchat's ephemeral nature will be incompatible with its advertising efforts and will be misaligned with keeping a long-term repetitive user base.Advertising Efforts Threatened:The allure of Instagram is that advertisers can release appealing and seamless advertisements that receive a considerable percentage of clicks, testifying to their effectiveness. For example, Instagram has a click through rate (NYSE:CTR) of 2.48%, but Facebook has a rate of approximately 1%. Twitter, is thought to be even four times lower than Facebook. Hence, Instagram's effectiveness is the reason why its revenue is projected to reach $3.2 billion in 2016. Even more impressive, Instagram added its advertisement services just two years ago. Snapchat, on the other hand, will have an estimated $350 million in revenue 2016. Yes, Instagram is larger with 500 million users, but Snapchat is formidable with 200 to 300 million users. My contention is that advertisers currently prefer Instagram because it allows for the following:Community: Pages on Instagram allow businesses to interact with users and receive feedback through comments. Also, Nike, for example, is able to reach 50 million plus followers at any given moment through its own page. These features are, of course, free and a strong complement to Instagram's paid for offerings. Snapchat on the other hand only allows content to remain on a page for 24 hours. Also, the lack of commenting and like features creates a scarcity for consumer rapport opportunities. Hence, advertisers, especially small regional ones, will continue to maintain their Instagram pages and drive traffic through paid advertisements. Snapchat, on the other hand is positioned for a more niche market of large advertisers like McDonald's, Coke, etc.Seamless Nature of Advertisements: Snapchat's video advertisements have recently started to appear in between user videos. In terms of engaging consumers this could be a nuisance. That is, this model harkens back to the YouTube model of skip or full- length advertisements before content. Sometimes a catchy or creative advertisement will be effective, but generally these advertisements are viewed as a nuisance. Instagram advertisers seamlessly integrate content into a user's timeline (usually with very eye catching photographs). This seamless integration is a testament to Instagram's superior CTR rates. Consequently, in the long term, Snapchat might peak with an increase in advertisements(as more advertisers test it out and adapt to it), but Instagram will remain the market leader because of its inherent effective advertising options. This could post a serious external threat to Snapchat's ability to grow or maintain advertisers over time.User Base Externalities: When it comes to Facebook or Instagram users are able to build a history, experience nostalgia, document life events, etc. For example, when Google Plus was launched the externality affects of Facebook were so deep/advanced it made Facebook impervious to its new competitor. Moreover, content on Snapchat is simply not there 24 hours later, so it positioned around in the moment experiences. Hence, will 13 to 30 year old users feel the constant need to post content in perpetuity? This critical question is exasperated by Instagram adding features similar to Snapchat in recent months.Facebook and Instagram have continuous communication tools and time lines that make ""quitting Facebook"" easier said then done. However, the only permanence of Snapchat is a list of followers (who you are already probably friends with on Instagram, Twitter, FB, etc.). Consequently, for the lack of a better term, Snapchat does not have a nostalgic or practical everyday purpose that will keep users coming back (i.e. content sharing, chatting, community pages, weddings pictures,college pages, etc.). This makes Snapchat's user base more susceptible to changing trends, such as Instagram's new features or Masquerade app.In Summary: Snapchat's model does not provide the intuitive features, advertising capabilities, or network externalities that perpetuate a social network. Consequently, I would be wary of purchasing Snapchat post IPO. No, I'm not saying Snapchat will disappear overnight like a ""fad,"" but I do believe it has inherent features that make revenue generation and user base maintenance difficult. Rather, I want Snapchat to layout plans to diversify and grow outside of their primary platform. I think Twitter TWTR went down this lack of diversification path and made ill-advised acquisitions later on to catch up. Therefore, Snapchat is tremendously successful and still growing exponentially, but to be a great investment post-IPO it needs to strategically deploy capital to preempt its fundamental flaws."
4001160,56192,2016-08-22T01:14:52-04:00,"Comment on Snapchat's Acquisition of Vurb ($110 million) and advantages over Facebook Messenger's chatbot strategy.Buying Vurb was a strong move that staked a new direction in mobile messaging: in-chat search (centralized, curated and controlled by Snapchat).With users able to trigger their “known intent” and find highly relevant results, advertising in Snapchat as result of search will soon become: not ads but answers.","Why Vurb Was A Smart Buy for Snapchat (And Why Messenger Must Follow Suit)Snapchat's (CHAT) recent acquisition of Vurb for $110 million was a strong move that staked a new direction in mobile messaging: in-chat search (centralized, curated and controlled by Snapchat).Highlighted by WhatsApp's mantra of No Ads! No Games! No Gimmicks! it's clear that instead of display ads (no matter how native), mobile messaging monetization will be dominated by new strategies around in-stream user activity, and new ways to find information without leaving the conversation, so you can now search with friends.With the purchase of Vurb, Snapchat continues its unique strategy of centralizing and curating key functions, in stark comparison to WeChat and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger (opened to 3rd party developers in March 2016) who are pushing the path of chatbots as friends.These messaging players all share a definitive platform or market-aggregating strategy that lets users shop, discover, send payments, and even hail taxis entirely from within an app they already spend hours-a-day on and love.The key concept centers around gardening users (prevent user from leaving app to Google something - giving away revenue), advertising in non-invasive ways that don't alienate users, and capturing generational and behavioral change trends to attack and win areas (like search) that would otherwise not be possible/practical.Mobile messaging apps are made better by search (while search is better with the social amplification of messaging).Search as a part of the chat conversation has the potential to drive the biggest reinvention of user discovery since Google-ing. Being in-stream (inherently easier and faster) causes the messaging app to assume the role of traffic director, later creating options and possibilities as a marketplace for the emerging on-demand economy best illuminated by Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (AIRB) (personal chefs, bands, individual service providers, salons, etc.) With users able to trigger their ""known intent,"" and find highly relevant results, advertising becomes not ads but answers.In-chat search further addresses an audience of a billion+ smartphone users in developing BRIC countries. Owning budget smartphones, these users carefully limit activity to calling and OTT mobile messaging. Given their high data costs and poor bandwidth, they have been largely inaccessible to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Yahoo (YHOO). Therein the unique opportunity: deploying data-lite messaging search from within the mobile app they already use. Addressing this unserved audience block offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to induct users into a new set of online and search behavioral patterns.Ecosystem With vs. Without SearchIn-message search enables an ecosystem where users don't have to leave for an activity they will do over and over. With that recurring economic stream added back, user lifetime value can be expanded by multiples.Beyond merely replicating search and moving it into the messaging apps, the new forms of search are a seamless experience that doesn't disrupt the social UI and experience, coupled with architectures that can deliver results up to twice as fast as Google Maps (and in less steps).Social amplification (and group search for the first time) lets users discover content alongside friends/family in real time. No need to copy and paste (which often ends up with a user being lost along the value chain.) Results are more relevant because in-message search often processes contextual information embedded in mobile messaging simply not available on standalone search engines (such as location, time of day, and up to 17 other sensory data inputs, as desired).Easier and faster are valuable advantages, that coupled with a more social experience implies much greater engagement. Searches shared in real time with friends are just more actionable.Local Markets, Previously UnreachedMobile messaging + search as a platform is ideal for solving the conundrum of local business marketing, which now includes individual service providers (think Instagram stylists), and emerging market smartphone-only users for whom ""traditional search"" was atypical before. (Note that in developing markets users have little-to-no benefit from searching, as 1) information is always sparse/inaccurate for their region, and 2) scrolling through Google or Maps results quickly eats data, which already costs more as % of annual per capital income.)In-message search systems are designed for real-time activity all via smartphone, typically spitting out lite results with very low data consumption, (delivered in KBs, not MBs).Embedding search extends mobile messaging into a new form of advertising as discussed, but further enables marketers (anyone) to reach their target audience frictionlessly for the first time.Key differences (between in-message search and status quo local players like Google Maps) lie in degree of user access and control, real-timeliness, conversion rates, speed-time-data costs, ease of use, and frictionless virality of content. Results can get delivered with real time matching - results filtered by such parameters as keyword and tag association, location, rating, distance, time of day and more.While the underdeveloped local and on-demand market is the next great marketplace, messaging users benefit the most. They never get hit with ads or fees, see filtered results, and are always on the same page to socialize decisions live. In-message search results give just enough detail (directions, web-links, reviews, and telephone), so users can follow through with action.Value Chain of MonetizationSearch acts as a traffic director pointing users to preferred or affiliate sites. Search data can come from Google, or Bing. This becomes strategically valuable if a messaging app has a more attractive (or paid) affiliate arrangement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for example. Searches can be conducted for any and all keywords, hence the results can range from products and deals, to events and links, to rich visual content on YouTube. Major partnership opportunities become available for messaging apps without disrupting the user experience (in fact the opposite - improving it).The current value chain of mobile encourages users to stray (typically via googleing) and thus offers no curated, or walled garden, which users have traditionally enjoyed the simplicity of.With ""known intent,"" search results are not ads but answers. Social amplification means messages become product conversations about what to do, where to go, and what to buy; within the stream of the conversation flow, so friends can explore together (more fun, and hence more likely to convert).For the advertiser, it's more likely that the right ad will be delivered to the right person at the right time, and with this very unique and compelling social enhancement factor.Besides making search more accessible, and eliminating superfluous steps for users (each key press results in about a 50% user drop-off, so this matters,) in-message search promises to bring search to a whole new mobile messaging generation, inevitably to be joined with on-demand commerce. Search coupled with mobile messaging will help change the valuation proposition for Snapchat."

Another report by GlobalWebIndex reveals that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger is the most widely used mobile app followed by Facebook-owned WhatsApp. Together, the two account for 70% of the user base globally. While Snap (CHAT), formerly known as Snapchat, accounts for a modest 7% of global internet users, more than 40% of teenagers in mature markets like the UK and US use it.Snap's FinancialsLos Angeles-based Snap has seen a meteoric rise since it was founded as a Stanford class project by Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown and Bobby Murphy under the name Picaboo. Based on its initial success, it set up shop as Snapchat. As of December 2015, the company claimed to have a following of more than 110 million daily active users who were using its ephemeral photo and messaging app. In March 2014, that number stood at 50 million. Recently, Snap also has said that its users are viewing more than 10 billion videos a day. Recently, it announced plans to diversify out of pure chat offerings and rebrand itself as Snap.Snap operates on a freemium model. It earns revenues through in-app purchases and premium services such as replays, along with advertising. The idea of earning revenues has been rather new to Snap. It was only in October 2014 that it began to experiment with revenue generation opportunities. Being venture funded, Snap does not disclose detailed financials. Analysts estimate that it earned $59 million in revenues in 2015 compared with earlier estimates of $100 million. Revenues are projected to grow to $250 million-$350 million this year, and up to $1 billion by 2017.Based on these phenomenal revenue estimates, Snapchat's valuation also is on the rise. It has been venture funded so far with $2.65 billion in funding from investors including Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), General Atlantic, GSV Capital, Fidelity Investments, Glade Brook Capital Partners, York Capital Management, August Capital, Yahoo! (YHOO), GIC, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Coatue Management, Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), SV Angel, Benchmark, General Catalyst Partners, Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Lone Pine Capital.Its last round of funding was held in May this year when it raised $1.8 billion at a valuation of $20 billion. An earlier round held in March last year had valued it at $16 billion. The company is now rumored to be gearing up for an IPO.Snap's AcquisitionsSnap has been using its latest funds to acquire other companies. Earlier this year, it acquired Toronto-based maker of personalized emojis Bitstrips for an estimated $100 million. Bitstrips's emojis are known as bitmojis and are customized and shareable cartoon avatars. Users can download an app and choose from a wide variety of face shapes, skin colors and other features to create their caricatures. Bitmojis can further be enhanced through different poses and accessories and can be used in mobile messages. The acquisition will help Snap continue to deliver a messaging service that continues to be more fun. Soon after the acquisition, Snap also released Stickers that users can send to each other.Another acquisition this summer was that of 3D photo app maker Seene, also known as Obvious Engineering. Terms of the deal are not known. Seene is best known for its computer vision technology that powers 3D facial capture, 3D scene reconstruction and augmented reality capabilities. This is the second acquisition that Snap has made in the 3D space. Last year, it had acquired Looksery and then integrated it with its service to allow users to create 3D facial tracking masks, known as Lenses. Seene's acquisition will help further Snap's 3D and augmented reality ambitions.Finally, last month, Snap announced the $110 million acquisition of mobile search app Vurb. Vurb's search engine is extremely social. For instance, if a user searches for a movie, it will show movie times, theaters that it is playing at, and even nearby restaurants that the user can go to eat. Results are even personalized to the user's tastes. It then allows the user to combine these options together and share with friends. It relies on its search results from other review sites like Yelp and Rotten Tomatoes and has also integrated well with Uber and Google Maps. It is not known how Snap wants to leverage Vurb's capabilities on its platform.Snap's Hardware ForayEarlier this week, Snap announced its plans to go into a new territory for its business - wearables. After rebranding itself as Snap, it announced the release of its first hardware offering - Spectacles. Like Google Glass, Spectacles will allow users to take videos and images of things around them. The sunglasses come with the ability to record up to 30 seconds of videos and will enable viewers to store these images and videos as memories in their phones and Snap accounts.They come equipped with a 115 degree camera lens that will be able to capture images very much like the human vision and that boasts of being the smallest Wi-Fi camera in the world. The sunglasses will retail at $129.99, making them more affordable than Google Glass. They will be available for users to buy later this fall.Snapchat finally looks to be making interesting moves to justify its valuation. The recent acquisitions coupled with diversification into the hardware segment appear to be promising strategies, although we need to wait and see how the market responds to these moves."
3997425,73185,2016-08-08T18:27:10-04:00,"Facebook and Snapchat have big deals with NBC for the 2016 Olympics, while Twitter does not.Facebook also has a big deal with the International Olympic Committee.While Facebook has an early lead on Snapchat, both platforms will emerge winners from the 2016 Olympics.This is just a preview of what is to come for how users consume sports media.","While the world's greatest athletes compete for gold in Rio, the United States' biggest social media platforms, namely Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat (CHAT), are competing for audience engagement during the Olympics. It is a year of several firsts in the sports media space, and a year that marks a crucial turning point in how users consume sports media.Following Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) striking several sports content deals related to MLB, NBA, NHL, and NFL content, NBC has struck Olympic content deals with Snapchat and Facebook, marking the first time that NBC has released Olympics highlights to non-NBC networks. Interestingly, TWTR did not make a formal partnership with NBC this year despite having one in 2012 (the platform is likely focused on the upcoming America sports season). Beyond NBC, Facebook inked a deal with the International Olympic Committee, marking the first time the organization has collaborated with a social media platform.To provide more context, we have broken down what each platform will be delivering to users by way of Olympic content. Here's what Facebook and Instagram are offering:Here's what Snapchat is offering:It looks like Facebook has the early lead here. Before its partnership with the IOC and other broadcasters, it looked like Facebook and Snapchat were about even in terms of volume of added features and content (both just had NBC deals in place). The recent IOC deal, however, added a chatbot to Messenger and lots more content to Facebook's entire ecosystem, giving the early lead to Facebook/Instagram.Beyond these features, though, each platform will be able to leverage their Olympic athlete user base to generate unique and more personal content. It seems like athlete-generated content is mostly a competition between Instagram and Snapchat. Articles are circulating around the Internet about which athletes to follow on Instagram and Snapchat, but no such articles exist for Facebook.Nonetheless, the world is interacting with the Olympics primarily through Facebook. Facebook generated 109 million interactions from 52 million users on opening night. A majority of that use was Latin American usage, with 13% of Brazilian MAUs, 7% of Mexican and Argentinean MAUs, and 5% of Peruvian MAUs interacting with Facebook on opening night. That usage will likely accelerate with the new IOC deal.As with the Snapchat versus Facebook battle at large, Olympics coverage seems to be a tug-of-war between informal but more personal silly pictures and videos with fun filters (Snapchat) and more formal but less personal serious news coverage and interviews (Facebook). Facebook, though, is making attempts to be a source of more personal silly pictures and videos with fun filters. Recently, the company essentially copied one of Snapchat's core features and incorporated it into Instagram. During these Olympics, Facebook is testing a fun filter open camera while delivering a differentiated chatbot, and is aggressively tapping into live content.While Facebook does appear to have the early lead over Snapchat in terms of sports content, this competition is far from the Medal round. We are still tracking early in the story of users consuming sports through social media. This is, after all, the first year NBC has made such content available to non-NBC networks, yet it is already having a material ripple effect. TV ratings of the Opening Ceremony in Rio were down 35% from London in 2012 and notched their lowest total since Athens in 2004. This is entirely due to changing media consumption habits, and means a promising opportunity for both Snapchat and Facebook into the foreseeable future. Both platforms stand to be big winners as a result of these Olympics.It is interesting to note that Facebook was unusually quiet about its user engagement at the 2012 Olympics, so the fact that the company is boasting its 109 million impressions on opening night in 2016 implies this time around is proving to be a lot more successful. This also is supported by the IOC finally collaborating with Facebook. This all makes sense, as 2016 is a different world than 2012. Cord-cutting is much more prominent, and mobile media consumption has just exploded in terms of growth. As media consumption continues to shift to mobile, Facebook has a promising opportunity to engage sports fans in a succinct, convenient, and meaningful way. For all social media platforms, the 2016 Olympics serve as key transition to a new era of mobile sports media consumption."
3987629,101096,2016-07-11T14:15:43-04:00,Snapchat Memories re-defines Snapchat.Snapchat is doing this to appeal more to the masses (older users).Facebook will be directly impacted if this initiative is successful.,"Snapchat (Private:CHAT) Memories is a massive update for Snapchat because it redefines what the app does, just like stories redefined it. If Snapchat is successful with its initiatives, one could make the argument that Snapchat is social media 2.0, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and Twitter being social media 1.0. I'll go over the features in this article and what they mean to the social media landscape.The new update can be looked at from two different perspectives: that of Snapchat and that of its competitors. From Snapchat's perspective, it is risky because changing its core premise can alienate its original users. From a competitor's perspective, this is bad news because Snapchat is already capturing user's time, so any new success can take more share from the other players. When Snapchat introduces a new feature, it is able to compete in a different way. The social app with the most to lose is Facebook since it is the biggest.The memories update has a few features to it. It has the ability to save photos/videos in Snapchat in the section called ""My Eyes Only."" This category is similar to a cloud storage setup, making it a place where you can keep personal photos away from the eyes of others. This feature is in tune with Snapchat's original motto which was built off a sense of privacy as photos/videos automatically deleted after they were seen. Having this ""My Eyes Only"" adds to the time users will spend on Snapchat because those photos/videos will likely be the ones taken on the app originally, meaning this will be the only place a user can access them.The most important new feature is the ability to upload a photo from your camera roll to your story. This makes it easier to share content on Snapchat. For example, before this update you had to film videos with your hand holding the screen. Now videos you took while setting the camera down can be added. If you're a musician, you can add content without having someone else hold the phone to record you. In a general sense you can now take videos you took on your phone that were meant for multiple social media platforms and share them on Snapchat. Thus it adds to the total content that can be shared on the app.The negative to this new feature is it opens Snapchat up to having the same content users post on other social sites, making it become like everything else. The strategy Snapchat is banking on is in the beginning it wanted to force users to post from the app to gain notoriety. Now that Snapchat is a teen's favorite social app, it can open itself up to being more similar to other apps to grow itself. Snapchat had to start out as unique, to gain early adopters and is now becoming less unique to gain the masses. The original users may now leave, but Snapchat is banking on them staying as having more users gives early adopters a wider audience to share their content to.Another feature is the ability to create your own customized story from within the app using snaps you've taken along with the photos and videos from your camera roll. Snapchat has been built off the premise of being an unfiltered look at your life. The ability to draw on pictures and add filters encouraged users to post content which was somewhat silly. Now that Snapchat gives users access to make their content better, it changes the dynamic of the app. It introduces the concept of perfecting what you post to the app. It's arguable that this was already in place as more users' friends began downloading the app and watching stories.Obviously having better content on the app where stories are complete adds to the allure of staying on it. The risk of raising the bar to produce content is less content is posted. This is the problem Instagram and Facebook are facing. One could argue that an additional reason for their decline is the lack of excitement surrounding them as Snapchat has stolen the momentum.The way Snapchat combats the increased difficulty in posting is by doing what I mentioned earlier which is to allow users to upload content from their camera roll to the app. By combining these two features, more content will be shared and it will be unique and compelling.As I said, the app most affected by this change is Facebook as Snapchat is using these updates to appeal to older users which Facebook has a lock on. Snapchat has already been able to use 24 hour stories to focus on being live opposed to Facebook which has become stale. Snapchat is now trying to make stories the best place for someone to get to know you digitally. Any improvement to this feature is a shot across the bow at Facebook which is becoming like a resume where it lists information about you. It's arguable which process is better for getting to know someone, but it is not arguable which is more user friendly. What would you rather do? Look aimlessly at a list of when someone graduated and what their favorite movies are or view a video of their most recent day which paints a picture of who they are?Snapchat is all about video and pictures which is what the millennial generation is about as well. While Facebook can integrate video capabilities, it can never say this type of content is weaved into the fabric of the network. With Snapchat's ability to re-imagine sharing personally created content, one can only imagine how they will innovate on sharing posts. As of now, articles, videos, pictures, etc., that you've found online cannot be shared with your followers. With Snapchat showing its goal of becoming more mainstream, this is the next logical step in this process.ConclusionI had previously posted negatively about Snapchat saying it was over-hyped. This stems from my skepticism surrounding the social media industry as a whole. The industry relies on ad spending and I think that spending cycle is headed lower. In the end, this is mainly a theoretical task since the stock doesn't trade publicly yet. I don't see a problem with looking at it in various perspectives as we try to figure out what Snapchat's future will look like.What's not theoretical is Facebook stock. I remain bearish on the stock with the ad spending cycle in decline as it follows the economy lower. If Snapchat can take share from Facebook and Instagram, the stock becomes a sell based on macro and micro factors. Facebook is a story stock. If the narrative of Snapchat taking share gains hold, the stock can fall fast. This update by Snapchat goes a long way toward pushing Facebook in this direction."

Salesforce shells out more than $500 million for Quip, adding to its recent cloud-based acquisitions.Instagram adds Stories to its features, a notable feature on Snapchat.Twitter's head of communication steps down, adding more churn to the company's management team. Fitbit tops EPS and revenue expectations.","Samsung UnpackedWill Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) be able to turn the tide in the smartphone market? Well, at least in the U.S. that is? Globally, the South Korea-based company shipped some 90 million handsets in the second quarter - 80% of which were smartphones - with an ASP of $210. This compares to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recent quarter, where it sold 40.4 million iPhones, although the iOS-maker toted a much higher ASP of $595.While Samsung may have a tighter grip over the global smartphone market, it hasn't dominated the U.S. market in quite the same fashion. Apple, which controlled 43.9% of the market, according to comScore, tops Samsung's share of 28.4%.For those interested, LG was third with a 9.7% share (makes you wonder where the other 18% is spread).Anyhow, Samsung is hoping to boost that share, as it unveiled its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone at its Samsung Unpacked event in New York. The large-screen device boasts a slightly curved 5.7"" screen and has packed in some features that it's hoping will appeal to consumers. It's got a stylus pen for its pressure-sensitive screen, retina scan and fingerprint reader, and a water-resistant display.""The premium end of the smartphone market is the part that's growing,"" said David Lowes, Samsung Europe's chief marketing officer. ""So we took a strategic decision to focus on the premium segment with the S6 and 7 Series, and they've done incredibly well for us.""So far, the strategy seems to be working, as revenues and profitability have seen a bump as a result. And while perhaps attacking the premium smartphone market is wise, it brings into question whether the company can start to erode Apple's market share or if it's fighting a losing battle.Some may argue that Apple's year-over-year decline in iPhone sales is a sign that it is working. However, others will argue that Samsung is not taking share so much, as Apple had an enormous year of upgrades in 2015, making for far-too-difficult comps in 2016. I think it's the latter, but the holiday season will be more telling. Apple's iPhone introduction in September will also be a key event to watch.Salesforce Snaps Up QuipThe M&A story line - following a number of headline-worthy deals on Monday - remains intact as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) gets in the mix as well. The company jacked up the final bid for LinkedIn (LNKD) by $6 billion or so, which was ultimately purchased by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for $26.2 billion.Shortly after that deal, Salesforce announced the acquisition of another company, Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) for roughly $2.8 billion in an all-cash deal last June. Now, Salesforce has announced that it will buy Quip for a reported $582 million in an all-stock deal.Given that Salesforce was prepared to spend big bucks on LinkedIn - like, way more than the roughly $3 billion it spent on Quip and Demandware - it shouldn't be too surprising to see the company going on a bit of a spending spree.It also shows where management's focus is. Demandware provides cloud-based digital commerce solutions, while Quip provides cloud-based word-processing and document-editing services.In other words, the company is simply building out its cloud-based solutions. No surprises there. The question now becomes, is there another company on Salesforce's radar and if so, who?Instagram Is Copying… Snapchat?Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) continues to gain momentum, particularly among the younger demographic. Last fall, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram platform was the most preferred social media platform among teens, garnering 33% of first-place votes. That figure dropped to 27% in the spring, knocking the app from the top spot.Instead, Snapchat took over the leaderboard, albeit, barely with 28%. Still, it's an impressive move, considering the same platform garnered just 19% of first-place votes six months prior.In 2013, Facebook tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion. The idea (which didn't pan out) was met with a lot of opposition, with investors questioning how Snapchat can provide revenue, let alone earnings. (This argument went along similar lines when Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, which was initially booed by Wall Street).At its latest funding round, Snapchat was worth around $20 billion, while estimates for Instagram have valued the property at more than $30 billion. Clearly, Zuckerberg is a genius.Although Snapchat is quickly gaining ground, that hasn't stopped (and won't stop) Instagram from being an ad-displaying machine. Similarly, it also won't stop Instagram from borrowing some of the former's success.The picture-sharing leader is launching Instagram Stories - yes, the strikingly similar feature found on Snapchat. ""They deserve all the credit,"" said Instagram's CEO Kevin Systrom. At least the guy's honest. He went on to say that, in so many words, every platform is great for something and that borrowing features from each one is both common and acceptable. They're used in different ways on different platforms.I like this guy - he tells it like it is. In any regard, Instagram is surely looking for a way to keep its users engaged. Not that it's doing a bad job by any means, as Facebook did grow revenues 60% last quarter. But still, the Zuck will want to keep all of his properties running at full speed and this is just another way to do so.Twitter Management Continues to ChurnTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) is no stranger to C-suite churn, but the latest departure is somewhat surprising, perhaps just because of how long she was there. Natalie Kerris, Twitter's head of communications, has left after just six months of working at the company.Leslie Berland, the company's chief marketing officer, will assume Kerris's communications responsibilities.The reason for her leaving is unclear, but it doesn't shed the best light on a company that has reflected a lack of control towards Wall Street. Twitter was struggling near the end of former CEO Dick Costolo's tenure and the board searched and searched for a new CEO.They insisted they wanted a full-time CEO, before ultimately bringing its founder Jack Dorsey back to the helm. Dorsey, of course, is the CEO of Square (NYSE:SQ) as well.In late-January, the company had four senior executives leave, while two new board members were added. Jeff Seibert, the company's head of consumer products as of September 2015, left his role in June for Twitter's new app, Fabric. Others, like Jana Messerschmidt, head of business development, and Nathan Hubbard, head of media and commerce, left in May.It doesn't help that Twitter's most recent earnings report missed revenue estimates and sales guidance fell well short of analysts' expectations.As much as investors are hoping that the company's platform tweaks and new streaming deals spur user growth and increase user engagement, it still seems like the company is searching for rock bottom; searching for the right people that can form a team to lead Twitter's recovery. With the continual churn, though, it's hard to say that that's happened. The question is, has Wall Street already priced it in?Fitbit Sees an After-Hours RiseShares of Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) are catching a boost after the close, currently up over 6% after the company reported earnings. Fitbit topped earnings per share and revenue expectations for the current quarter.Revenues climbed some 46% from the same quarter in the prior year, but gross margin slipped 500 basis points to 41.8%. According to the press release, gross margins were impacted by an increase in ""warranty reserves for legacy products."" The company expects gross margins to return to a more normalized level next quarter.Management expects revenues of $490 million to $510 million for next quarter and $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the full year.While margins were somewhat concerning, the explanation makes sense, and the guidance came in about where analysts expected. That, and the fact that the stock has been such a dog, has likely got shares moving higher in what many could call a ""relief rally.""Depending on where investors got long, the stock is either doing great, or doing terribly - most likely the latter. With a low of $11.65, the sub-$12 buyers have seen a double-digit return so far with the after-hours move toward $14.But with a 52-week high north of $50, many investors are likely under water on their investment. When Fitbit came to market, it toted remarkable, triple-digit revenue growth and showed its profitability potential. That and the booming smartwatch/devices market enticed a lot of investors.However, the story hasn't quite panned out as many had hoped. As of now, the after-hours gains are holding, and investors are hoping that the conference call doesn't reverse their fortune.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3996396,65973,2016-08-05T11:51:26-04:00,Instagram copied Snapchat's story feature in what I am calling 'InstaStory'.The product is a flop as users are using it to promote their Snapchat account.Facebook is losing its hold on young social media users.,"In my article ""Instagram Sees Posts Slowing,"" I discussed why Instagram was losing out to Snapchat (CHAT). To summarize, Snapchat is the equivalent of a doodle pad, while Instagram (NASDAQ:FB) is like a resume. You add to a doodle pad without thinking, while you don't change your resume unless something important happened in your career. Because of this use case, Snapchat has more content uploaded to it.Instagram is aware of this problem. In order to combat this problem, they did the unthinkable. Instagram attempted to copy Snapchat with the mindset ""if you can't beat them, join them."" The one thing that I am now certain of with this launch is Snapchat is causing a decrease posting on Instagram. There were some stats on this topic. This move supports their findings.What is 'InstaStory'?If you don't use Snapchat every day, I'll clarify the important points of what happened, before we get into what this change means for Snapchat and Instagram. Snapchat started as a messaging app, but now messaging is a secondary feature. The main differentiating feature Snapchat has is the ability to post videos and pictures to a story which deletes every 24 hours. There are no likes and comments, so there's no judgment. The only feedback you get is who viewed your story.Instagram decided to take this story feature and put it on top of the newsfeed. There are some small differences, but the only thing I noticed was the lack of lens filters. I consider lens filters to be the best part of Snapchat because they encourage you to post even if you aren't doing anything interesting. Snapchat monetizes this feature by allowing firms to sponsor filters which gets users to willingly post ads on their story because they are so engaging. It takes a lot more effort to create a filter than a tweet or a Facebook post, but it has shown to be worth it from the initial results.I wouldn't go as far as saying this 'InstaStory' (my name for it) feature will be dead on arrival like Facebook's previous failed attempts at copying Snapchat only because it doesn't have filters. To me, it shows that Instagram doesn't understand why users are on Snapchat. Snapchat will always understand their users better than Instagram simply because it was the original creator of the product. That being said, the reason why 'InstaStory' isn't dead on arrival because of the lack of lenses, is because I'm pretty certain Instagram is working on creating them. I can't see why it wouldn't just go through with a complete copy of Snapchat.The reasoning behind why Instagram would go through with this initiative is the platform has a structural problem with posting. It doesn't want to necessarily create a better mouse trap than what Snapchat has. It wants to provide a home for users to post more content. It wants to increase posting incrementally without making a change to the news feed. This would be the same as if Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) provided a separate part of the app to house long form content. This longer form blog wouldn't rival the top blog sites, but it could provide an increase in posting.For those who have huge following on Instagram, but not on Snapchat, this is a great alternative. Instagram has suggested this as a reason for the 'InstaStory' feature. There is no way for me to compare the following of various celebrities on Instagram to Snapchat because Snapchat follower counts aren't public information. However, I would say Instagram is a few years too late as users with Snapchat probably have already built up a following. From my personal experience, my Snapchat friends are more engaged than my Instagram followers. This new 'InstaStory' feature can reengage followers. It's too early to tell because the feature is going to get heavy usage in the first few days after it is launched because of curiosity with the product. The key will be if users keep engaging with the product over time.While Instagram wants users to incrementally increase their posting on the app, it's not a lock to actually happen. Firstly, users weren't exactly clamoring for another version of Snapchat as Snapchat works just fine. In the previous analogy, I described Twitter expanding the character count on a separate part of the app. If you remember a few months ago, when this was mentioned as a possibility by Jack Dorsey it was rejected by users. There is a risk that users on Instagram switch from posting on the newsfeed to the 'InstaStory'. If original posting decreases more on newsfeed, than it would relegate Instagram as a Snapchat knockoff.Anecdotal EvidenceMy initial evidence, based on the users I've spoken to, is the feature is not something they're satisfied with. Sometimes users like to complain about a new feature on Facebook, but then continue using it anyway. Therefore, initial gripes aren't a death knell. However, what I did found shocking was almost all my friends posting on 'InstaStory' uploaded a picture telling their followers to add them on Snapchat, including their username. I would call that a major backfire as Instagram's attempt to compete with Snapchat actually helped Snapchat.ReviewsA big problem with 'InstaStory' is how blatant of a copy it is of Snapchat. It's not like when Facebook put trending topics in the corner on the desktop. This is so obvious, that users are noticing and they aren't liking it. As you can see from the App Store, users are not pleased with the new update. One reviewer said it best ""I like both, but I don't want Snapchat to be Instagram, and I don't want Instagram to be Snapchat."" Users also seem to be disappointed with the previous update to the app where the chronological order of newsfeed was replaced by an algorithm. This makes the 'InstaSttory' update even more despised because it makes it seem like Instagram is trending in the wrong direction. To reinforce my previous point, a reviewer wrote ""The new stories is a direct stab at Snapchat, but an epic flop that no one uses except to shoutout their Snapchat.""What it meansThis update is great news for Snapchat as users are being encouraged by their Instagram friends to share their Snapchat username on Instagram. It is better marketing for Snapchat than the company could have done itself. Anytime Instagram alienates its users, it is a big win for Snapchat as it makes them spend less time on the app. Instagram has already lost out to Snapchat as the favorite social media app among teens, but this may accelerate its downfall.The update is a negative for Instagram. The fact that it was done shows how the company lacks innovation. Like I said, Facebook has been able to copy some Twitter features. However, they were small changes. It's not as if Facebook decided to institute a 140 character limit. That would obviously be a bad idea because it would change the makeup of the network. Just as I am betting Instagram is going to add new lenses, I am pretty sure the company will not be eliminating 'Instastory' unless the results are disastrous. At that point it would be too late to salvage the problems it caused.TakeawayInstagram was Facebook's connection with younger users as the main app is more popular with the older generation. Now that it is losing popularity, it will be harder for Facebook to convert young people into users on the main app. This can't come as shock to investors. Did anyone think that an industry rife with innovation and change would be easy to compete in? As I mentioned in my last article, Periscope is now losing out to Live.ly in the live streaming category. If Live.ly continues its success, it can take away potential young viewers who would be watching Facebook Live."
3994649,73185,2016-08-02T14:47:50-04:00,"Facebook launched Instagram Stories, and it is essentially a mirror image of Snapchat Stories.How relevant does Snapchat remain if Instagram replicates its core feature?Snapchat's demographic moat (older audiences don't use it) will wither with time, as no social media app maintains an exclusively young demographic forever.Long term, this move positions Instagram to consolidate its user base and mitigate competition.","In response to upstart social media platform Snapchat (CHAT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has launched Instagram Stories, which allows users to post photos and videos to a story which will disappear after 24 hours. Looking at TechCrunch's visual walkthrough of Instagram Stories, it looks essentially like a mirror image of Snapchat Stories, the mega-popular feature Snapchat launched in 2013, which has supercharged user growth. Although the move feels defensive, we think it is actually offensive, and favor it on the view that it is another natural step towards consolidating the user base and minimizing competition.It is no secret that Snapchat has gained significant momentum recently. It is an app designed for the Millennial audience, and as parents, aunts, and uncles begin to adopt Facebook and Instagram, kids are flocking to Snapchat as a safe haven to express themselves without parental oversight. According to eMarketer, 59% of Snapchat's user base is under the age of 24, and that mix is expected to shrink only marginally to 52% by 2020. The anti-parent, ephemeral nature of Snapchat has propelled it to become the most important social media app among teens, according to Piper Jaffray's Taking Stock With Teens Survey.Even with all of that, Snapchat only has 150 million daily active users to Instagram's over 300 million daily active audience. This discrepancy, though, is to be expected. Instagram is naturally much larger because it attracts younger and older crowds, as well as has much more significant international reach than Snapchat. When looking at the comparable Millennial audience in the US, Snapchat is actually bigger. Research firm eMarketer predicts Instagram will have 48.2 million US Millennial users by year end while Snapchat will have 49.4 million US Millennial users.Looking at this data, it is easy to label Facebook's move as a strongly defensive one to regain Instagram's popularity among the Millennial audience. We simply don't view it as such. After all, Snapchat barely beat out Instagram as the most important social media app among teens, with 28% of the vote to Instagram's 27%, and the two firms have fairly similar scale when it comes to the US Millennial audience. For all intents and purposes, Instagram remains a growth machine even with Snapchat competition.But how relevant does Snapchat remain if Instagram replicates its core feature? Roughly 50 million US Millennial users for each platform implies a significant user overlap in the US, so many Millennials have both Snapchat and Instagram. Right now, this works because each serves a different purpose, but Instagram's latest feature somewhat mitigates the necessity of having both platforms.This fits in perfectly with what we have addressed several times before and what industry experts call the app enigma. It is a nearly inevitable trend that app usage will consolidate into a few apps with incredibly diverse functionality. Facebook is doing this in several places, and so it is only natural that the company attempts something similar with Instagram.Snapchat still has a moat with its demographic. Whichever way you slice it, parents still aren't using Snapchat in droves, and this could keep a good portion of users from switching to Instagram Stories. The difference with Instagram, though, isn't that drastic. Roughly 31% of Instagram's user base is 45 and up while that figure stands at 17% for Snapchat. We argue, though, that with time, parental and older audience adoption of Snapchat will grow. History shows no app maintains an exclusively young demographic forever. Just look at Facebook and Instagram.As this demographic moat withers, Instagram will consolidate users because there will remain little reason for teens to have both a Snapchat and an Instagram. From this perspective, we think Facebook's move to add Instagram Stories is actually an offensive one, and one that will mitigate Snapchat competition in the long term."
3981660,101096,2016-06-13T11:07:03-04:00,Snapchat cannot monetize the way Facebook can because it can't target ads.Twitter is the better comparison. Snapchat will actually have even less targeting than Twitter.When Snapchat's hype dies down after the IPO in 2017 (or later) the stock will drop.,"This article is going to be a combination of the past two social media articles on the Scout account, this time with a focus on Snapchat (CHAT). The point made in the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) article was that social media is in competition with other websites/apps such as messengers, news websites, and entertainment. Snapchat does have a messenger built into its app, but users are now using the story feature more. Even Facebook, which is the king of monetizing usage, hasn't been able to monetize WhatsApp and Messenger to the level of Facebook itself. The reasoning is simple. Ads cannot be targeted to users unless the app reads messages to see what the conversation is about. That would make users uncomfortable and shun the app, so it's not a viable business operation.The point made in the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) article was that Twitter is not profitable because it cannot target ads the way Facebook can. If Twitter isn't profitable at this point, when will it be profitable? It needs to cut costs and figure out better targeting methods like Facebook has done.Snapchat has both problems listed above. Snapchat existing in the social media space has taken share from Facebook, but the inherent concept that social media usage will grow forever and never decline is flawed. As I showed in the Facebook article, there was a total of 22.4 minutes less spent on social media in America in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015. U.K. usage is considered a leading indicator for future trends in social media. Usage on Snapchat in the U.K. fell from 18.32 minutes per day to 15.45 minutes.Current installs also declined for Snapchat in most markets. The side metric on the graph below is the percentage of Android smartphone users with Snapchat installed on their phone. In the U.K. the percentage of smartphone users with Snapchat on their phone fell from 24.34% to 18.36%.Snapchat is in a similar position to Facebook as I'd reckon very few users are on Snapchat specifically to check the news. This means original sharing is the glue that keeps users coming back to the app. Users just happen to be on the app, so they tap on various functions such as news and entertainment. Showing additional content to users represents Snapchat's goal to incrementally increase usage and to become more relevant as sending selfies to your friends isn't exactly a pivotal part of society.The point of Twitter having less ability to monetize users is even more prevalent for Snapchat. Snapchat has no ability to find out information about users in order to target ads to them. Even worse Snapchat doesn't have a place for advertisers to put links in order to direct them to their websites to spend money. The funnel doesn't exist. Also a conversation about the product cannot occur as there is no comment section. It doesn't take an expert to figure out a disappearing ad is simply not that valuable to firms. There are also sponsored lenses which are a unique way to capture users' attention. This cannot be scaled as it is a difficult process to create a lense as firms can't onboard marketing projects used on other platforms. Also only one or two can be shown at a time. The more sponsored lenses there are, the less each is worth.Snapchat has even tried charging for its service such as for different lenses, but it stopped doing so as it didn't work since other social media apps are completely free. To me this shows the firm is having trouble monetizing. Snapchat may be used for more time than Twitter, but its monetization challenges are even more difficult.You can see the charts of both Twitter and Facebook below on the Scout Finance app. Facebook is up 43% in the past 12 months and Twitter is down 61%. Based on this inability to target users with advertising, I see Snapchat as following the trajectory of Twitter instead of Facebook.Snapchat is currently being valued at $22.7 billion in the private market. The company is projecting revenues of $300 million in 2016 and $500 million to $1 billion in 2017. If it does hit its lofty expectations, its valuation will grow. Snapchat is a story stock, so if it does go public in 2017, then I'd expect the valuation to rise further at the IPO price. We don't know the specifics of Snapchat's bottom line until it files with the SEC, but judging by the type of business it is in, I'd expect the valuations to be absurd.ConclusionSnapchat is closer to Twitter than Facebook in terms of monetization potential. Even if Snapchat can grow its total users and time spent to reach the heights of Facebook, it will never be as profitable. When the hype surrounding the company fades after the IPO a realistic valuation will take hold sending the stock lower."
3979725,21797,2016-06-03T12:46:22-04:00,"I believe Snapchat has a unique opportunity to help marketers move the needle.But for now, that needle is stuck on empty.There are still several changes that must be made to the platform in order for it to be a viable marketing solution.","Dear Snapchat (CHAT) marketers,I'm going to tell you the truth.You tell me you're tired of marketing gurus that tell you one thing then do the other. You say you want me to speak brazenly and bluntly and ""tell it like it is"" about the real truth behind marketing solutions. Well, according to a recent report by Shift Communications, ""There is no current business case for Snapchat."" Which matches our experience with the solution as I wrote about in March.Personally, I believe Snapchat has a unique opportunity to help marketers move the needle - but for now, that needle is stuck on empty. There are still several changes that must be made to the platform in order for it to be a viable marketing solution. Let's examine some of the data from the report which surveyed Snapchat users that use the platform frequently:Shift CommunicationsMore than 60% of people who follow at least one brand have not interacted with a brand in the last three months. I can hear the Snapchat protagonists now, ""If brands are not producing quality content then of course users won't interact with them."" But, as the Discovery tab has shown with its staggering view counts, some of the best content is being created by brands.Shift CommunicationsThere are some life support signals in this result, but still far below those you find on other social platforms. Over 50% of Snapchat users have not purchased anything they saw on Snapchat over the past three months and less than half of frequent brand-friendly users have purchased something they saw on a brand Snapchat account in the last three months. That's a terrible ROI result for anyone offering a product for sale on any platform offline or online.Does Snapchat Encourage Brand Loyalty/Evangelism?A frequent rebuttal to my marketing arguments has been ""but what about brand loyalty and evangelism."" The survey answers that question when they asked frequent Snapchat users how many brands they have recommended to a friend because of that brand's Snapchat account.Shift CommunicationsThe result: Less than 50% of frequent users have recommended a brand to a friend based on the brand's Snapchat account in the last three months. In terms of the loyalty and the customer journey, this result is ""devastating."" According to the marketing research, Snapchat does not appear to significantly boost customer loyalty or evangelism.So What Does It All Mean?I'm just telling it like it is here. I'm sharing with you my experience and the blunt truth from Snapchat users themselves. I'm being completely and excruciatingly honest with you. I know you want a ""no-brainer"" solution to target today's youth, a marketing panacea, and a tool that puts your product on the screens of an increasingly difficult consumer to reach. But it's not working yet.If you're taking this seriously, you'll keep an account on the platform, check in once in a while and wait for Snapchat to make this a marketing friendly tool. But you won't invest any marketing dollars.And if and when it does become a viable marketing solution, I'll be the first to report on it."
3978921,72745,2016-05-31T18:13:51-04:00,"Why is Snapchat highly valued?Revenue estimates are for $250-350 million in 2016 and up to $1 billion for 2017.From 50 million daily active users in March 2014, Snapchat has grown to 110 million users by December 2015.","Snapchat (CHAT) filed with the SEC this week its latest fundraising. According to TechCrunch, $1.8 billion cash was added to the company, bringing its current value to the range of $18-20 billion. Not bad for a company with 2015 revenues of about $59 million. And quite a high valuation for a one-product company that probably nobody who reads this column has ever used, or even knows anything about.So why is Snapchat so highly valued? Because revenue estimates are for $250-350 million in 2016 and up to $1 billion for 2017. From 50 million daily active users in March 2014, Snapchat has grown to 110 million users by December 2015 - a growth rate of about 50% per year. And this growth has not been all US. Over half the Snapchat users are from Europe and the rest of the world, and the non-US markets are growing the fastest. Clearly, at 20 times 2017 revenue estimates, investors are expecting dramatic growth in users and revenue. Numbers of the magnitude that drove the valuation of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) (over $500 billion) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ($340 billion).So what is Snapchat? It is the complete opposite of this column. Snapchat is like Twitter, only without the text. Of course, most of my readers don't tweet either, so that may not help. It is a picture or 10-second video messaging app. But most of my readers don't use messaging apps either.Think of texting, only you don't actually text. Instead, you send a picture or short video. That's it. Pretty simple. Just a way to send your friends pictures and videos with your phone - although you can be creative with the pictures and make changes.People who use Snapchat find it addictive. They may send dozens, or hundreds, of pictures daily. To single friends, groups or even all their friends, since users can pick who gets the picture.For my readers, this must seem ridiculous. Who would want to send or receive several pictures every day from some, or many, of your colleagues and friends?In 1927, Fred Bernard popularized the phrase we use today ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" And today, that is more true than ever. Pictures are replacing words for a vast and growing segment of the population. This is now a very fast-growing trend, and it is projected to continue.""Why is this a trend, and not a fad?"" you may ask. The answer goes to the heart of how we use language and images. For thousands of years, very few people knew how to read or write. To promulgate information, religious and government leaders would have artists paint images that told the story they wanted spread. These images were then taken from town to town, and people were taught the stories by having someone explain the picture. Then, the image would be recalled by the population. It was only after the advent of mass education that using written words became the primary medium for providing information.Simultaneously, paintings were really expensive. And early photography was expensive. Both mediums were used primarily to memorialize a story or event. Thus, there were relatively few of these images, and they were often treasured, hung on walls or kept in albums for later review.Today, images are extremely cheap and easy. Almost everyone has a phone with a camera. So, it is easy to take a picture and it is easy to view a picture. Pictures have become free. And if you can replace a thousand words with one photo, it is far more efficient - and thus, from a resource perspective, it is far cheaper (think of how long it takes to write an email as opposed to taking a picture.). Given that this flip in resources required has happened, and that the use of mobile technology is growing worldwide and will never revert, we know that this is not a short-term fad, but rather a trend.Once we communicated by telephone calls. That has dropped dramatically because real-time communication takes a lot more effort to coordinate and implement than asynchronous communication. I can email or text any time I want, and my friend can receive that message when it is convenient for her. And she can choose to respond at her convenience, or not respond at all. Thus, email and texting exploded due to the technical capability and their improved economy. Today, we have the ability to communicate in pictures or short videos, which is even more information-dense and even more economical.I'm sure many of my readers are saying, ""Well, that may be good for someone else, but not for me."" And that's good, because you read my columns. But factually, the number of readers is destined to decrease as the number of viewers go up. There's a reason every time you open an online magazine column, you are bombarded by short video ads. They are more communication-dense and are more successful at capturing attention, even if they do irritate you. There's a reason fewer and fewer people read books and rely instead on columns like this one to gain insights. And there's a reason more and more people connect on Facebook rather than sending emails - and rather than sending snail mail (when was the last time you actually mailed someone a birthday card?) While you may not imagine using pictures to replace language, the fact is lots and lots and lots of people are making the switch, and thus, it is a trend that will affect how we do many things for many years into the future. Haven't you ever watched a YouTube video rather than read an instruction manual?Snapchat has capitalized on this new trend by making an app which allows you and your friends to communicate far more information a whole lot faster. Rather than interrupting your friends with a phone call (they may be busy right now) or writing them an email or text message, you can just send them a photo. Have you ever used your phone to photo a label and sent it to someone who's shopping for you? Or taken a photo of an item so you can find an exact replacement? That same action now can become your way of communicating, of telling your current story. Don't tell your friends what you had for lunch, just send a photo. Don't tell your friends you are shopping on Madison Avenue, just take a picture. Pictures are not archives, but rather just a fast, more compact and information-filled form of communication.Snapchat did not discover a new biopharmaceutical. It did not create a breakthrough new technology, such as extended battery life. It did not identify a sales opportunity in a far-flung country. Nor does it have a breakthrough manufacturing process. Rather, merely by being the leader at implementing an emerging trend, Snapchat's founders have created $20 billion of current value.Now that you know this trend, what are you going to do so you can capture additional value for your business?"
3981525,40691,2016-06-13T04:29:43-04:00,"Snapchat is going to win the war through photos and videos.
        Snapchat has 150 million active daily users, beating Twitter by 10 million active daily users.
        Slowing growth equals lower multiples which equals lower stock prices.","Since the start of the year, shares of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are down an astounding 40%. Slowing growth, human capital disasters, and a lack of enthusiasm has plagued the once loved social media company. Despite Twitter's structural problems, investors are remaining positive. Just this morning I voted in a sentiment poll here on Seeking Alpha:Seeking Alpha user's are remaining remarkably positive with 79% of voters reporting a bullish sentiment.For each and every stock, Seeking Alpha provides a little company description. I stumbled onto Twitter's company description over the weekend and it got me thinking. Here it is:Twitter was the first social media company to embrace short, real-time, thoughts and news. While Twitter may have been first, Twitter is certainly not going to be the last platform to embrace this type of social interaction. I believe Twitter is already on its way to being replaced by Snapchat (CHAT). In this article I am going to use Twitter's very own company description to explain why I believe Twitter is going irrelevant in the face of Snapchat.What is Snapchat?Writing this in the nicest way possible, the Seeking Alpha readership demographic is a little on the older side (I am 22). So if you haven't heard of Snapchat it is OK.Snapchat was launched almost 5 years ago by a few students at Stanford University. Wikipedia offers this great description:The concept is simple yet sticky. So sticky, late last month TechCrunch reported that Snapchat's valuation had grown to $22.7 billion.Snapchat is a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time.TechCrunch went onto say that Snapchat had about 100 million daily users in May, with around 10 billion video views per day.Much like Twitter users, Snapchat's users want quick and pointed entertainment. But Snapchat is doing it better by using photos and videos, instead of 140 characters. A lot of older individuals believe that Snapchat is just a sexting tool, but isn't. A 2014 study found that only 1.6% of respondents reported using Snapchat primarily for sextingInstead Snapchat is a tool to tell your friends what you are doing and thinking with photos and videos. And, Snapchat is a tool to see what your friends are doing and thinking with photos and videos.According to ComScore, Snapchat's U.S. monthly mobile app user count cleared 50 million in April, surpassing Twitter for the first time, highlighting the video-messaging service's rapid growth.Every single day, I see Millennials on Snapchat. Rarely do I see Millennials on Twitter. In June, Bloomberg reported that Snapchat has 150 million active daily users, beating Twitter by 10 million active daily users.It is really very simple. Snapchat and Twitter have the same core theory. But in this day of age, photos and videos are better than 140 characters.Snapchat provides a network that connects users to people, information, ideas, opinions, and news.Twitter is loved by reporters and news addicts. Twitter is great at providing real-time news before any of the major outlets.But over the last year, Snapchat has really improved its news service, Discover, which launched in 2015:Major news outlets are now using Snapchat as a channel. Over time, I expect Snapchat to eventually become the source for real-time news via photos and video.Snapchat can also be used as a marketing tool for businesses.At the end of the day, social media companies do need to make money. It is no secret that Twitter has struggled to build stickiness with its advertisers. In an April interview with Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, Noto said ""We had lower demand than we expected from our branded advertisers … Can we turn it around? We're driving very strong revenue and revenue growth with these advertisers, they just didn't spend as much as we had thought they would spend, and we're in a transition period.""Here is an interesting chart:Slowing growth equals lower multiples which equals lower stock prices. From personal experience, I can tell you that Twitter ads are dramatically lower quality in comparison to Facebook and Adwords. By lower quality, I mean dramatically lower conversion rates.Snapchat is much more creative and engaging. Snapchat placements engage into the stories of its users. Snapchat offers a variety of filters and geotags which allow users to naturally interact with advertiser content. Again from personal experience, it feels much more natural for the advertiser and user.ConclusionSnapchat is stealing Twitter's growth, engagement, and advertisers. Both companies have a very similar theory to social media. That said, Snapchat is going to win the war through photos and videos. According to a recent Seeking Alpha Market Challenge, 30.3% of respondents believe that Twitter is a speculative buy based on a possible takeover. You should never buy a company solely on the back of a potential takeover. Twitter is in a position where it can't grow. Users and advertisers aren't enthusiastic. Twitter has value but is not worth $10 billion today. Twitter will be acquired, but at a much lower valuation."
3964524,65973,2016-04-11T17:33:20-04:00,The total number of daily active users isn't as important as the amount of time spent and the amount of original content shared on the app.Snapchat has almost 100% of its content originally uploaded to its app meaning it is stealing share from Facebook.Snapchat users engage with video at potentially a 15 times higher rate than Facebook users.I'm short Facebook and have traded around this short bias successfully.,"Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) share price has mimicked its rapid growth in monthly active users and daily active users. Most bullish individual investors cite these statistics. I have done the same in my articles about any of the social media companies. From an investor relations standpoint, these stats are excellent because they post a very rosy picture of the business. Who wouldn't want to invest in a company with the chart below? There's nothing like uniform constant growth without any blips.Even Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) chart of its monthly active users doesn't look that bad. If you were looking at this chart, you would have missed the stock's peak in early 2014. From Q3 2013 to Q4 2013 Twitter's monthly active users grew 4%. This was the latest report going into the stock's peak. Facebook's monthly active user growth last quarter over quarter was about 3%. This isn't to say that Facebook's stock is guaranteed to peak this quarter just because of similar monthly active user growth metrics. My original point is to argue against this stat which the founder of Seeking Alpha, David Jackson, described as a vanity metric. The point is merely that Facebook has been better received than Twitter ever was besides the IPO time period.The reason for this article is the recent news reported by The Information which said Facebook was meeting in London to combat the original sharing problem. 57% of Facebook users accessing the app every week posted and 39% shared original content. Original broadcast sharing was down 21% as of mid-2015 and down 15% as of earlier this year. Total sharing was down 5.5% because of the outperformance of third-party sharing.These data points are a better way to measure social media websites than the number of users. They can be considered a leading indicator to the total daily active users. The ratio of daily active users to monthly active users basically tells investors how many of the monthly active users are real users, as someone who checks Facebook once per month for 15 minutes is almost worthless to the firm. Facebook should do a better job of reporting the amount of time spent on its properties and the quality of content shared.As you can see from the chart below, mobile users spend the most amount of time on Facebook. The problem with this statistic is that it means there is a dramatic difference between what is categorized as a user and the amount of time the average user spends on its site. Another way of saying this is that the total time spent on Facebook could go down from 30 minutes to 20 minutes while the number of monthly and daily active users increases. While it is great that Facebook is popular currently, investors care about the rate of change. Twitter stock went down as its monthly active user count increased, so the same thing can happen at Facebook. In a sense Facebook has more to lose than Twitter ever did because it already has a huge percentage of time spent on its app out of the total time users spend online. It is important to measure these stats more than even profitability and revenue because like Twitter, Facebook can increase the advertisement load per user even while users spend less time on the property. This would mask weakness.Losses in original content for sharing is most likely due to the growth in Snapchat (Private:CHAT). Snapchat's users skew younger. Younger users are the most likely to use social media apps heavily. Snapchat has the inherent advantage in original content sharing because almost all of the content on the app is original. Snapchat only allows users to use photos and videos from their camera roll in the messaging part of the app. It doesn't allow users to post previously taken content onto their stories. There are third-party apps which allow you to upload previously taken pictures like the one below, but they don't work well.As you can see from the review below, the app doesn't work. The only reason why it has five stars is because users are given coins on the app if they rate it highly. It costs money to use the app. In my anecdotal evidence from using Snapchat, I have never seen any of my friends use this app.The knowledge that Snapchat needs live content has changed users' behavior as they become more likely to open Snapchat than any other app to capture a moment to share on social media. This is why you can see pictures taken on Snapchat on other apps such as Instagram. You can tell pictures are from Snapchat because of the format such as the filters or the captions. Snapchat's lack of functionality actually works to its advantage. Another example of this is the 24-hour window for viewing stories. It encourages users to watch their friend's content as it will soon be deleted. It also encourages users to upload more since Snapchat gets rid of the content. No one wants to have an empty story.This is a virtuous cycle because as more friends upload content to the app, the more time you will spend on the app. A more cynical observer of social media may say that teenagers and other web savvy social media users are simply trying to evade advertisements and parents/bosses which are more prevalent on more mature social media apps such as Facebook and Twitter. In my perspective as a millennial who observes what his friends use, I would say people are flocking to Snapchat because it is more fun to use. It isn't about trying appear a certain way like other social apps tend to be. There is no judgment because there are no likes or follower counts. You get to see who is viewing your content. This feature is something Facebook users clamor for in the way Twitter users clamor for an edit function. The filters are also unique - they bring me back to the app the check for new onesFacebook doesn't want to become the next LinkedIn which has plenty of users but little original content outside of someone automatically alerting you of their work anniversary which as a function always seemed pointless to me. Facebook also doesn't want to become Reddit. Reddit is a great website for sharing third-party content on the internet, but Facebook's competitive advantage is the connections users have on the platform. If the prevalence of third party content and photos taken originally on another app such as Snapchat begin to outweigh original content, it diminishes the reason to use the app.One of the ways Facebook is planning to improve this declining original content creation is by advancing live video features. The reality is this is the moment in time where live video is taking off, meaning Facebook is merely advancing along with the current trends more than actually responding to its declines. Facebook faces competition from Periscope in this venue. Facebook shows top celebrities getting millions of views on its live platform, but is it really surprising a celebrity with millions of fans would get a lot views on the most popular social network in the world? I think Facebook would have released stats on the usage if it were doing excellently. My theory is that Periscope is flatter than Facebook, meaning the average Periscope user does better than on Facebook. The difference between the top Periscopers and the average user is likely smaller than on Facebook live.Periscope is the best app when it comes to releasing relevant stats. Periscope reports watch time per day which is much better than the number of downloads, number of accounts created, or total number of daily active users. As of March 28th, 110 years of content is consumed on Periscope daily which means it has nearly tripled from August 10 when it said 40 years of content was consumed daily. I called Periscope one of the top apps of 2016 even before it was named the ""App of the Year"" in 2015 by the App Store, so I remain positive on its momentum as new features roll out and it maintains its low latency.Getting back to Snapchat, the app has 8 billion daily video views which was the same amount reported by Facebook in November. Since Snapchat has 1/15 th the total monthly active users, it is reasonable to say Snapchat has around 15 times the engagement level than Facebook has. Facebook also counts videos in a way which inflates its numbers since a view is counted after it auto-plays in news feed for 3 seconds while Snapchat videos have to be tapped to count as a view.Snapchat has yet to unveil a live video feature to stories. I would expect it to provide the best experience out of any other apps because its core product closely relates to what Periscope offers. Because Periscope is more public than Snapchat most broadcasters should obtain more viewers, but Snapchat would be more likely to get friends and family to watch. This is the exact category Facebook live is attempting to service.On a final note, YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is about to unveil a new app called YouTube Connect which will have live streaming. YouTube's live capabilities aren't up to par. From what I have observed, only YouTubers with a high number of subscribers use YouTube live. YouTube Connect would directly compete with Periscope. The jury is out on which app will prevail as Periscope has had a one-year head start. That being said, Twitch had a head start on YouTube Gaming and YouTube Gaming caught up in terms of features. When it comes to Facebook, any time YouTube gains viewers it competes with Facebook's video initiative even if their live products aren't in direct competition.How I'm TradingI'm sure some commenters will see a negative article on Facebook and recant that I'm just a stubborn short who has lost money. This would not be true. The last time I wrote about Facebook I was short at $97. I was able to cover up that mistake by doubling down on my short at $115. I had an average short price of $105.70. I covered this short position profitably at $99.77. I then recently shorted Facebook again with the average price of $113.40 which is higher than the stock is at currently.My short on Facebook has to do with my Q2 or Q3 recession call which I made in January. Facebook is an advertising company meaning it is cyclical even though those daily active and monthly active user charts may lead some investors to believe it will grow forever. My negativity on the economy has been reinforced by the GDP Now forecast which predicts 0.1% growth for Q1."
3975455,101409,2016-05-16T17:21:51-04:00,"The Snapchat IPO is near, and putting some cash aside for its launch seems to be a good idea.The growth in user-based content creation is the beginning of a long and profitable road.Snapchat will eventually control the user-based content creation business specific to sports and live events.User celebrities like DJ Khaled and various athletes are changing the way we consume content.","Start allocating cash for an imminent Snapchat (CHAT) IPOIt is still unclear when the Snapchat IPO is coming, but I am certain it is coming. As Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) blow out their recent earnings and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have poor earnings, my big question is ""where is Snapchat?"" Social media has exploded over the last decade with the rise of Facebook. While MySpace did hit the streets first, Facebook has proven that first doesn't always mean the most successful. Snapchat, originally a Stanford class project which then student and now CEO Evan Spiegel created, now has over 100 million active users and 7 billion daily video views. This tremendous growth in only four short years only hints at what is possible for the future of this social media powerhouse.Snapchat is both simple and complex, like many of the great tech companies, it can execute one specific task very well. It generates and distributes content, the best part being it is only the infrastructure. Like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it generates content and distributes it to its users, but unlike NFLX, it doesn't have to spend billions to create it; its users do all the work. While the app is targeted towards the younger generations, older users are also signing up in an effort to connect with young people. Specifically, candidate Bernie Sanders, who needs the young person vote, and the White House. These efforts to connect to the younger generation are no different than a college professor telling jokes in an effort to make ""learning fun"".Content creation has been identified as key to the future of media. Netflix, HBO (NYSE:TWX), and Amazon have been spending hundreds of millions on content creation. Traditional media stocks like Disney (NYSE:DIS) and CBS (CBS) still create original content, but have shifted their business models to reflect reality TV and live sports in an effort to prevent cord cutting. Snapchat is unique in this way; it can spend nothing and create as much if not more content. Another benefit from this model is that the content is both organic and personal to the users. You can see what DJ Khaled had for lunch or your close friend's cute new puppy. Look at the new pseudo-celebrity that just hit one million Instagram followers or use a new filter and send funny pictures to your friends. This is a key uniqueness to Snapchat; its ability to generate content using your own contact list as well as celebrity accounts can generate time spent on the app. It has been able to monetize these features with ads in its curated stories that are continually added upon. A great example is the New York Snapchat story which gives New Yorkers insight into what happened around the city.Another great content creator with huge monetization value is the sports stories. In today's social media culture, odds are that if you go to a sporting event, you want everyone to know about it. This gives Snapchat a unique opportunity to advertise in between snaps on its curated story for each event. The NFL Draft, which just occurred, had its own story; the opportunities extend to all live events which are now seen as the best content to advertise on. Concerts, sporting events, movie premieres, and daily life in a specific city have become great advertising opportunities and Snapchat is right there to capitalize on all of them.Snapchat is firing on all cylinders with a first of its kind deal with NBC (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to show highlights from this year's Summer Olympics. The Olympics have historically been showcased exclusively on NBC, and this will be the first time an outside content distributor has any access to the premium content. Not only will athletes post to their own Snapchat accounts and to the curated stories for the event, but also viewers will be able to get NBC content through the app. This type of content distribution could be a new way to monetize the app and bring about a much larger valuation long term.Another great way that Snapchat has made money is having premium content on its app through its discover feature, with big names like the Wall Street Journal, Vice, CNN, National Geographic, Cosmopolitan, VOX, and ESPN. Journalism is another area of Snapchat that offers potential revenue sources. All of these firms have their own viewership through print or the Internet, but Snapchat offers them another portal to gain potential readers. These new readers could use both Snapchat and their own viewers to consume this newly found media. ESPN in particular could have enhanced value to both Snapchat and ESPN. As I stated, live events specifically live sporting events, will be a key long term to big ad dollars. The Super Bowl, the World Cup, the Olympics, and the other major sports events usually get the best ratings and the best ad dollars.While this trend will continue the opportunity to create unique content for both players and fans, it generates another opportunity for monetization. This most recent NFL draft shines a light onto what original content can look like: inside the home of a hopeful draft prospect, an Olympic athlete snapping a practice run a few days before their event? This will be the first Olympic games with the modern Snapchat. Not just the athletes, but the celebrities also go to these events, and the average consumer cares a lot about where famous people are and what they are doing. It is reality TV without the production costs or season commitment. This field of content creation is still relatively new and celebrities like Kim Kardashian and DJ Khaled are the first professional Snapchaters. They create premium content for their viewers; building a brand and attracting viewers is only part of the game. The ability to promote products through Snapchat is another form of advertising that helps build out its usage.Allocating cash for the imminent IPO is prudent, it will be hard to predict when this IPO will occur because of the limited information over the last six months on the subject. It will be hard to predict exactly when this IPO will occur, but It is clear that there will be an IPO. To prepare for this investment opportunity allocating cash specifically for the Snapchat IPO is a strong idea. Since there is still limited information, it is hard to gauge Wall Street interest, but I believe there will be high interest both at the IPO inception and in the long term. With less than 10% of the average monthly users that Facebook has, there is still a largely untapped total addressable market (TAM). While Snapchat is targeted towards younger users, there will not be a massive transition from older Facebook users, but as more children grow up with a smartphone in hand, the TAM will grow.Snapchat has strong long-term prospects as a growth stock. Its large TAM combined with its innovations in live media paints a strong picture for potential changes in social networking and social media. Like the other big tech giants, it has invented tools like geotags and animated filters, which we didn't know we needed. More and more users are spending more time on the app, creating more content. The combination between content creation and event creation will be key for the forward movement of Snapchat. Between events like the release of the new Drake album, views from a few weeks ago and the EDC New York story regular events like a concert or record release provide revenue for Snapchat that other firms can't obtain.On 5/14/16, there were six curated Snap stories on my Snapchat. I live in North Jersey, so the Last Night in New York curated story is always available, but the other five stories were EDC New York, BBQ Showdown, Graduation, Turn Up: Miami, and Food Trucks. Each one of these stories is worth $750,000 and that is only one day's worth. The company has over 130 million daily active users, which grew from 100 million last year. Another strong feature ""discover"", which I mentioned above, has premium content from WSJ, Vice, and Comedy Central (NASDAQ:VIA) (NASDAQ:VIAB) as well as many other sources.The company's user growth rates, ability to create content through its users, and its ability to generate Snapchat stories out of ordinary life events like graduation or a BBQ shows only the beginning of its potential. The future is bright for this firm, and when the stock is offered up on the Street for its IPO, I forecast a strong long-term return for all investors. I will be buying stock on the day of the IPO because I do not see this stock having an initial slump like other big tech IPOs in the past.If we look at what happened to Facebook, the offering was mismanaged initially, but over time, it was a home run, bringing in more than 3X on the opening price of $38. If you had bought FB at the bottom where the stock traded at below $20, you would have made 6X. Because Snapchat will take much more time to break the $100 billion level maybe after the first 2-5 years after IPO we could see a 2 or 3X return, but that is all guessing. Of course, we don't know the initial share price. We don't know the projected valuation outside of the news from March where Fidelity paid $30.72 per share up from $25.75 in March of 2015. So maybe the price per share will be $40 per share; maybe it will be more? The point is to get ready for this IPO is likely to a long-term monster hit."
3777196,92296,2015-12-27T03:32:48-05:00,Snapchat has become one of the most compelling Unicorns of 2015 experiencing rapid user growth and engagement.Snapchat is an effective way for businesses to advertise in a non invasive and organic fashion.2016 will be the year of the Snapchat election as candidates utilize the platform to reach key voter demographics.,"Snapchat (CHAT) has become one of the most compelling Unicorns of 2015. The app has been growing significant momentum ever since the company's introduction of several new features, including Live Story and Explore. Users are recognizing Snapchat's unique value in showing a more accurate representation of social interaction and experience, opposed to Instagram and Facebook where users posts are often carefully crafted to portray a calculated representation of themselves.Businesses are now getting in on the action because Snapchat is fulfilling a void that cannot be reached through the other social media platforms. We have seen several companies cross promote their brand by displaying a snap code logo as their Twitter/Instagram/Facebook profile avatars.Snapchat has been an effective outlet for businesses to advertise in a non invasive and organic fashion, which is a problem for the other Social Media giants. Snapchat has found an unique way to appeal to advertisers though sponsored Geo-filter tags that don't interfere with the user experience or content but can rather enhance it. Snapchat has been charging companies upwards of $750,000 per day for a sponsored Geotag.Another OneSnapchat has been a new avenue for celebrities and influencers to connect with their following and even reinvent their careers. We have seen this with the resurging popularity of DJ Khaled, now hailed as the biggest Snapchat star in the world. Khaled has found new ways to use the app while showing other influencers how they can benefit from the platform. DJ Khaled is receiving millions of view per snap providing great product placement opportunities. The app has elevated DJ Khaled's career to a new level while seeing plenty of news coverage on his newfound success.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) gained popularity initially from users following influencers because it was the first look in to their thoughts as they were happening. It connected the fan base. However, that novelty has worn off in text format and people want to see the live video look ins that Snapchat provides.2016: The Year of SnapchatBy showing offline events live on Snapchat through its Story function, it brings new sponsorship and other event specific advertising opportunities. The NFL has partnered with Snapchat, the first sports member to do so in their Explorer service, showing live look ins of top highlights. Snapchat is a natural fit for sports and as it can give quick highlights in an ESPN like style. Expect other top sports leagues and media outlets to follow suit in 2016.2016 has been deemed the year of the Snapchat Election. Previous Republican and Democratic debates have already been featured on the live story function. Expect candidates to utilize Snapchat to reach a critical voter demographic during the upcoming election cycle. How potential candidates use social media trends can make or break a campaign, much like how Barrack Obama leveraged Twitter and Facebook to build a following in the past two elections.The unique element of Snapchat is that it combines transparency with privacy, which has become a trend in social media user engagement. Snapchat has great versatility with its combination of 1:1 and 1:many sharing functions. Snapchat has also become an innovator by providing curated live event coverage on its platform. You can see that Twitter (with Moments) and Instagram is playing catch-up in this arena with attempts that have not hit a critical mass. Twitter and Instagram have not entered this space successfully without bombarding its users with advertising. Their platforms have not been set up with these new additions in mind so they have been unable to accommodate them appropriately.Snapchat has been particularly useful for showing the behind the scenes of the lives of its users. Snapchat has innovated the trend of social networks data disappearing, much like the CyberDust App created by Mark Cuban. CyberDust is also a 1:1 and 1:Many platform, which takes privacy a step further as content is not saved on its servers. It is promoted as the ""Most Personal Communication Platform Ever"". As the Social Media industry evolves, users will demand a more personal experience and Snapchat offers just that.Snapchat is also beginning to grow its demographic, it started out popular with the youth and is now expanding to all ages, much like Instagram did year's prior. The company has emerged as one of the most viable candidates to disrupt the Social Media empire of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). While both have inherently different uses and values, Snapchat cannot be ignored as a major player in social media moving forward.Company StatsIn 2015, alone Snapchat has experienced immense growth in its user base and the amount of content shared on the platform. Snaps and videos in the app are now viewed over 6 billion times a day, a 300% increase since May. To put in perspective, Facebook currently handles 8 billion video views daily, twice the amount the company received in April. Much more content is shared per user on Snapchat than on Facebook. Snapchat's 2015 revenue is expected to reach $100 Million with a estimated valuation ranging from $15-20 Billion. With the rapid growth and significant potential, 2016 is poised to be the biggest year yet for Snapchat.As with every Social Media outlet, there are a few drawbacks to Snapchat's platform. It is difficult to build a following without cross promotion on other social media networks. The focus is also much narrower than other networks and there is not as much interaction and engagement with other users. Many feel that disappearing content is antithetical to advertising. These challenges however, can be solved in innovative ways and Snapchat has demonstrated that they can break through these barriers and extend their growth.The Amazing part of Snapchat is that the company has only just scratched the surface of what the platform is capable of and how it can evolve. A new study has shown that it is becoming a useful tool for prospective employers to reach out to millennials. While 2015 has been a year of significant growth for the company, expect 2016 to be the year of Snapchat."
3962117,101429,2016-03-30T18:40:26-04:00,"Snapchat released a host of updates to its app that adds more practicality to the app and increases engagement with users.Due to the similar nature of Snapchat's content to Twitter (recent, quick), it will continue to steal away content and users to its site.The updates also put Snapchat in a position to challenge Facebook in the future.","On Tuesday, Snapchat (CHAT) released an update to its app which will have large implications for its future and the direction of the app. Rather than gradually modify parts of the app, Snapchat has revamped nearly all aspects of its platform in one sweeping motion. Here's what's new:Snapchat Stories now auto-advance.After you view one person's story, Snapchat will now automatically play the next story unless you direct it to stop. This will lead to increased video views, as users will be persuaded to watch stories of people they may not usually watch.More Stickers!Snapchat has added over 200 stickers to its chat feature. Users can send stickers with images that say phrases such as ""I love you"" or ""I'm coming!""Video and Audio NotesWithin the chat feature, users can send a video or audio note. By holding down a recorder button, Snapchat takes a ten second or less video and inputs it into the chat as a replaying gif. Recipients of the video note simply have to tap on the GIF to hear sound. The same can be done with just audio.Video and Audio CallsYou can now initiate a call with another Snapchatter, with either video or just audio. During these calls, you can simultaneously send pictures or text to the recipient. Pictures from your camera roll are included now as well.The company that should be most nervous about these updates is the ailing social media platform Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The new features make Snapchat a much more practical application that either is a direct competitor to Twitter's services, or an all-out alternative. To begin with, Snapchat is encouraging users to stay on its app longer and interact more. Snapchat reported this past February that users watch 8 billion videos a day. With the new auto-advance feature, we should expect to see this number drastically increase. While it is too soon for official statistics, I've already witnessed around a 20% increase in views on my stories.The same reason as to why Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is so successful is the reason Twitter is in serious trouble. Facebook recognized that video is the preferred medium for content, and has worked tirelessly to update its site to adapt to this change. It has tweaked its algorithm to give video content premium positioning towards the top of its newsfeed and now provides viewer statistics. Instagram, owned by Facebook, has also seen explosive growth in its video content, citing a 40% increase in time spent watching videos by its users in the past 6 months. Furthermore, it has just extended its video time limit to 60 seconds. Facebook is even looking to livestream several NFL games in the near future. On the other hand, Twitter has only been moderately successful in encouraging users to share video content on their platform, and its Periscope division shows promise. However, its quick, personal content is in direct competition with Snapchat, whereas Facebook video is mostly longer and curated by third parties.The video and audio calls pose more of a threat to Facebook. This adds a new element of practicality to Snapchat, for users can more effectively communicate with one another. Essentially, the new features make Snapchat a communication center and more closely similar to a phone. Facebook-owned WhatsApp introduced voice calls last year, but has yet to add video calls. Snapchat is beginning to offer nearly all the features provided by Facebook through its Messenger and WhatsApp platforms. In order to ensure that Facebook remains the dominant platform, it will have to innovate and add more features to its messaging platforms.In essence, the networking effect will ultimately decide the fate of social media companies. This is why Facebook, with 1.6 billion users remains safe for now. However, Twitter only contains 305 million users. This is an anemic 0.99% increase from a year ago, which signifies that new members aren't signing up for the service. Twitter is faced with a vicious cycle in terms of users and content. Users share content so that their friends can view it. If more of their friends are on a different platform, such as Facebook or Snapchat, they will choose to share their content there. When users begin moving their content elsewhere, Twitter members aren't as enticed to use the service and will leave the site, thus propagating the cycle.Twitter is a site that has plateaued in user growth, stalling at approximately the 300 million mark. While amassing this base is praise-worthy from a company, the stock market values companies with growth in mind. Twitter's growth looks dismal at best, with few new users and increased competition from Snapchat and Facebook. Advertisers are going to choose the platform that keeps users the most engaged, and this is another element where Twitter does not thrive. It will be interesting to monitor Facebook's response to Snapchat so that they do not end up in Twitter's position in the future."
3716526,65973,2015-11-30T08:00:00-05:00,Twitter's biggest competitive threat is Snapchat.It still has a lane for success if it continues to innovate.Twitter should follow Google Plus's latest update to increase traffic on its website/app.,"Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock is languishing in a range with the upper bound being the low-$30s and the lower range being the mid-$20s. As a shareholder, it can be frustrating, but it is more important to focus on 2016 than worry about the current stock price. 2016 could be a make-or-break year for Twitter as investors decide if the stock belongs in a category with successful tech firms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or the litany of unsuccessful internet companies such as Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), and Yelp (NYSE:YELP). Currently, Twitter is in between these two groups. It if it can reinvigorate its user base, it can move toward Facebook. If it doesn't, the stock will go much lower.In this article, I discuss why I believe Snapchat (CHAT) is Twitter's biggest competitor. Snapchat is working on creating a similar product to Twitter. It will provide user-generated, curated content that can bring the viewer to an event without physically being there. I think Twitter will be able to grow alongside Snapchat if it executes properly. If you look at the past few years of social media firms, Snapchat and Instagram have been able to grow simultaneously. The time spent on social media apps is growing, so Twitter can reach similar growth levels if it improves the product.I am writing this piece because of Snapchat's Story Explorer announcement. If you aren't familiar, Snapchat has a tab of stories on the top of the app. If you tap on a story such as ""New York"" it shows you a curated video/picture stream of content about the event. Story Explorer allows the user to swipe up to view another perspective of a particular moment in the story. This initiative does a few different things. First, it lets Snapchat put more content in a story without it feeling too long. It also encourages users to engage with the content. Finally, it allows for self-curation within content selected by Snapchat. I expect Snapchat to allow liking and commenting on this content to expand engagement.This advancement shows Snapchat is leading the charge in this curated events category, which is why I feel it is a bigger threat to Twitter than Facebook. Twitter's traffic peaks during big events and Moments is similar to Story Explorer.If you look at the three players (Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter), Instagram is probably the furthest behind as it has only done two of these events on Halloween and Thanksgiving. Instagram and Twitter have strategic advantages over Snapchat because they are open platforms. Users can tap on a tweet or Instagram video within the event to have a conversation about the content. This causes an increased level of interaction. Snapchat's initial differentiating factor of being secretive with deleting messages is now a hurdle that could hamper growth. Snapchat has been able to innovate around this problem. For example, it has countered the inability to search on the app by having scannable profile images.The Snapchat Story Explorer is similar to what Periscope integration with Moments will look like. If a moment is appealing the option to watch the event live on Periscope will be provided. As Periscope gains more users providing great content, it can provide a better experience than Snapchat since the content is live and conversations can occur on it. The race of innovation will be whether Twitter can integrate Periscope faster than Snapchat can up with a live product of its own. Besides the technical challenges, Twitter has to make sure the experience is great. This is the same issue Facebook is having. It doesn't want to bombard users with live streams and endless notifications.While Snapchat's innovation is a problem for Twitter, I think the firm's destiny is in its own hands. We have seen Instagram and Snapchat grow at breakneck speeds simultaneously among millennials even though they provide similar functions. If Twitter continues to make changes such as Moments it can regain its mojo. Moments should only be the tip of the iceberg of the changes that will occur.The problem Twitter has is the amount of content on its platform. Companies have a lot of automated tweets that can overload the user experience. Twitter doesn't want to change the reverse-chronological order it has because it serves the purpose of providing the quickest possible information. Just as Snapchat has innovated around its limitations, Twitter has been trying to do this with the ""While You Were Away"" function, Moments, trending topics, and lists.The biggest problems with Twitter are users don't know what to tweet and they don't find value from the reverse chronological feed. Both of these problems can be solved by following Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Plus's lead. While you might be skeptical about this potential move because of Google Plus's lack of success, I think the latest initiative to focus on Communities and Collections is worth following. I'm not sure if this will revive Google Plus, but it would increase Twitter's traffic.Hashtags attempt to bring users together to have conversations about their interests, but this requires a user to look through the tweets about the hashtag, searching through a ton of content. It is somewhat awkward to respond to someone's tweet on something you are interested in. If Twitter organized these interests it would be less awkward. It would allow you to have a personalized place to read and tweet about your interests. This also will make it easier to find new accounts to follow. This is similar to Facebook groups except Twitter could do it better because Twitter is a public forum. Users would be able to follow a community group just like they can follow a Moment.The reason why I know this initiative would be successful is because of the popularity of StockTwits. StockTwits is a Twitter-like app that lets traders converse about stocks. The app organized by cashtags (e.g. $FB). If Twitter were to simply create a section of its website dedicated to finance, it could steal this traffic back. This finance grouping would be one of many places for tweets to be organized.Next quarter will be the first quarter where results from Jack Dorsey's initiatives will be scrutinized. This could bring even more volatility than after previous reports. The initiatives are still in their beginning phases, but if no acceleration in monthly active user growth occurs I will have to reevaluate my bullish stance. One good quarter doesn't guarantee the turnaround is working. The Moments ad spend could have improved user growth temporarily. We need to see a further continuation of growth before investors show the same belief in the turnaround that they are applying to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).I am excited by management's use of Periscope to engage investors and improve their understanding of the company. Most investors have put the stock in the penalty box. At least Twitter executives are making ardent attempts at explaining why it should be a 2-minute minor penalty and not a 5-minute major and game misconduct. I think Twitter will be let out of the box in 2016."
3981124,88686,2016-06-09T18:31:00-04:00,"Snapchat has been grabbing headlines as the fastest growing social network.However, Facebook has staying power and network effects working for it.Snapchat is ultimately a fad and Facebook can integrate its acquisitions to make it more powerful.","Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been facing some competition as Snapchat (CHAT) has been snapping up (bad pun intended) headlines as it continues to grow in value to absolutely ridiculous valuations. The latest round as well values Snapchat at a ridiculous, absolutely mind-boggling $20B. The main selling point of Snapchat is that it has essentially taken over the teen segment and it is rising quickly as well, as seen by the graph below.As a side note, I wonder which teens chose Google Plus (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)...Anyways, as many of you know, teens and millennials are the most valuable demographic by far, and advertisers are spending dearly to get them. In this article, Adweek notes that advertisers spend five times as much to reach millennials as all other age groups combined. This bodes well for Snapchat, which has seen its valuation bloom and its revenues explode. Source: TechcrunchBulls also point to the massive engagement that Snapchat manages to suck from its users. Snapchat also has over 10 billion video views a day compared with Facebook at 8 billion only, with a much smaller daily average user base. The argument is that Snapchat's ""videos"" are short, but they have guaranteed engagement.The thing is though, for everybody worried about Snapchat, they are completely missing the point. Facebook's value isn't that it's the most engagement-heavy, valuable social network, nor is it the hyper niche one of something like Slashdot or Reddit. The value of Facebook is that it is by far the dominant one. Facebook is the first social network that everybody gets exposure to and sets expectations for how the experience should be.Facebook kind of operates in the background of most people's lives and it is there that lies its strength. As the background operator, it stays hidden. But as seen from the graphs above, most people do in fact end up using it more often than most other social networks. People spend an average of 40 minutes on Facebook every day. Even Snapchat only manages to get 25-30 minutes of usage per day, according to Business Insider.The main point is Snapchat is simply a fad and serves a very niche purpose as of now. As monetization ramps up, more and more users will get steadily more annoyed with Snapchat, as seen here in a Reddit post about the growing uselessness of Snapchat. More complaining follows in the comments, and the highest rated comment is one saying that each iteration of Snapchat has only made it worse.As time goes on, not only will Snapchat start to fade, but Facebook will be retrenching its strengths in international growth and monetization. Facebook has thousands of engineers working on wringing every bit of money out of users and has been doing it for almost a decade now, so scale and experience benefits apply. And as it keeps perpetuating its advantages, Facebook can start to integrate its platform with the multitudes of acquisitions that it has made over the years, such as Instagram, Oculus and WhatsApp, to make it so that it can take over as much as your life as possible (bad for consumers but great for Facebook investors).Facebook doesn't need to worry. It's doing fine just by itself and can still make for a smart investment."
3684896,90695,2015-11-14T09:00:00-05:00,A recent report states that Snapchat has reached six billion daily video views. This closely rivals Facebook's eight billion daily video views.I touch on some of CHAT's newest features and explain why the app is so attractive and sticky.I explain the appeal of advertising with Snapchat and how it could pose a threat to Facebook.,"Halloween may be over, but the Snapchat (CHAT) ghost certainly is not. News was recently released that shows just how much of a disruptor CHAT truly is. Earlier this week, FT reported that Snapchat tripled its daily video view count to six billion, which closely rivals Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) eight billion daily video views. The latter's daily video view count has doubled since April.It is worth noting that to tally a view on FB, it must be watched for at least three seconds. Comparatively, on Snapchat, it is reported that only a few milliseconds count as a view.While this may seem like a ludicrous amount of time, especially when compared to Facebook's perhaps more legitimate length of time, Snapchat is founded on the concept of short bursts of content. When sending videos to friends or posting to a story, the maximum amount of time allotted is 10 seconds.This is why, in my opinion, tallying a view at nearly one-third of the total video length available seems unreasonable, and it is needless to say that the average video length on Snapchat is less than 10 seconds, which makes this proportion even higher. On FB, the average video length is 44 seconds (as of August 2014). So, when measuring what counts as a view, I think both view times reflect the essence of each social media site, and serve as reasonable means by which to track engagement.Before I get into why Snapchat's rapid increase in video views even matters, I'll quickly discuss why the social media platform is so popular. Snapchat is an app that adds new features at a rapid cadence. Within the last few months, CHAT has added a facial recognition element to its camera. The new feature allows the user to press and hold on his or her face, and select - from seven different choices - the distortion that they would like.Source: Business InsiderWhile this is a silly feature, it makes Snapchat incredibly sticky. Each day a new distortion is added, making a compelling case for the user to return.The newest features that have been added are slow motion and sped up video. These features have been heavily requested by many users, and they present an even stronger case to use and keep using the app.Lastly, the Live Stories and Discover sections provide an endless stream of visual content, and make this app a threat to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). With media from National Geographic, Daily Mail, and CNN, the user is able to access a large portion of the world's news. While Snapchat is certainly not the primary outlet for this, it does take users away from Twitter and is yet another feature that gives them a reason to return day after day.But back to video. Why, exactly, is it that Snapchat's strength in video poses a threat to Facebook? First, realize that Snapchat only operates in portrait mode (the way you would hold your phone to field a phone call). Many have griped over the fact that there is no landscape mode, but I believe that this is one feature on which Snapchat will not bend. The portrait-only platform is too vital to its appeal to advertisers.Snapchat's portrait-only platform ensures that ads are always vertical and full screen. By offering full-screen ads, CHAT gives advertisers a better way to engage with consumers. Facebook and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube do not offer full-screen videos in portrait, which means ads can only be displayed on a small portion of the screen. I know that while ads are playing on YouTube, I often find myself scrolling through the comments rather than watching them.Source: SnapchatThe drawback to Snapchat's platform is that, unlike YouTube, users can skip ads the moment they show up. The trade-off is the amazing capability for the ad to instantly fire on all cylinders. This plays into the short length of time that counts as a video view. It may be short, especially when compared to Facebook, but to an advertiser, those milliseconds may be worth far more than seconds on Facebook. I see this as a preferred feature for advertisers.So does all this mean death to Facebook? No, not at all. Facebook knows advertising better than any other company, and it has the ability to tailor ads based on users' interests. One thing Snapchat advertising lacks is the ability to target ads to certain users based on their interests. Snapchat has yet to implement a feature that provides such information. I think that the only way for CHAT to significantly rival Facebook's momentum in the advertising world is to add a feature that gathers information about its users.An idea I have is for Snapchat to enable polls. Given how well-received Twitter polls were (measured by engagement as a percentage of impressions), I think Snapchat would have no problem cleverly adding polls to its app. With more information on users, they present a stronger case to advertisers and will be able to take even more market share.The SkinnyIf you're currently long Facebook, I wouldn't touch your position. It will take a great deal of time before Snapchat is able to learn as much about its users as Facebook. While CHAT has the portrait-only advertisements going for it, I do not see the company being a major threat to Facebook until it can successfully integrate a feature, such as polls, to learn about its users. With the portrait-only advertisements and an equal amount of knowledge about its users, Snapchat becomes a much bigger threat. So, in a sentence: I do not recommend selling or shorting FB based solely on competition from CHAT.Moreover, Snapchat has not filed for an IPO, but many think that the company will one day hit the trading floor. Simply due to its popularity and brand, I believe investors will be quick to pounce on Snapchat in its first moments as a public company. Am I one of those investors? Not right off the bat.Previous IPOs that were incredibly hyped include Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Facebook. While it is not necessarily fair to predict Snapchat's potential performance based on how these stocks fared, all three were/are highly coveted stocks. The initial pop that BABA and FB saw (though the latter's was very short lived) ended with their depression to new lows. The aura surrounding these types of stocks, in my opinion, makes them tricky to trade right out of the gate. This is why I suggest waiting.When Snapchat hits the tape, be patient. The IPO could come at a time when the company has further developed its advertising strategy which, as I highlighted above, would pose a serious threat to FB. To me the long-term story of CHAT is extremely compelling, and I would be willing to wait to get in on the deal. The high risk associated with making fast money, in my opinion, is supplanted by the long-term opportunity. Patience is key."
3921276,20521,2016-02-23T14:41:55-05:00,"Last year, Snapchat commented about its intention to go public.If Snapchat cannot significantly increase monetization, the valuation will further drop.It may need to work harder on its revenue model before it finally decides to take the plunge.","According to a recent eMarketer report, the global mobile phone messaging app user market was estimated to have grown 32% over the year to 1.4 billion users worldwide in 2015. The sector is dominated by Whatsapp, which recently announced a milestone membership of more than 1 billion active users, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger - both of which have presence in more than 20 countries worldwide. By 2019, eMarketer expects this number to grow to 2.19 billion users.Snapchat's FinancialsWhatsapp may be among the biggest mobile messaging apps, but Snapchat (CHAT) is probably one of the more controversial ones. Pacific Palisades, California,-based Snapchat was founded as a Stanford class project by Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown and Bobby Murphy. Like other mobile messaging apps, Snapchat sends mobile messages including photographs and videos over the Internet. The difference being that Snapchat allows the message to be viewed only for a few seconds before it self destructs. The ephemeral nature of the messaging service has made it a preferred app among teenagers. It has led to the evolution of ""sexting"" where users are able to send messages without worrying about consequences.The Snapchat app is available for free, but it earns revenues through in-app purchases such as lenses for photo-shopping selfies and features that allow replays and advertising. The company began experimenting with monetization in October 2014. It does not disclose financial details, but market reports suggest that in 2014 it earned $3 million revenues and lost $128 million. In 2015, revenues were trending at $100 million.Snapchat is venture funded so far with $1.2 billion in funding from investors including Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Fidelity Investments, Glade Brook Capital Partners, York Capital Management, August Capital, Yahoo (YHOO), GIC, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Coatue Management, Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), SV Angel, Benchmark, General Catalyst Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Its last round of funding was held in March last year when it raised $537 million at a valuation of $16 billion. Valuation has grown significantly since the $10 billion valuation as of December 2014 and $2 billion as of December 2013.Snapchat's Monetization FocusSnapchat has been focused on improving monetization capabilities since last year. The app has over 100 million daily average users and would like to leverage this pool to earn revenues. Snapchat is counting on advertising as its revenue driver and it is seeing mixed reaction from advertisers. According to management, Snapchat gets 7 billion daily video views and is selling ad packages for as much as $10 million. But its ad business isn't very stable. Unlike other media companies, Snapchat does not offer targeting and analytic capabilities for ads delivered through its network. It makes it difficult for advertisers to ascertain the true impact of the ads. That is one of the reasons why there are days when a user doesn't see any ad at all.It is hoping to improve this with products like Live Stories, Discover and Local. Discover is a content discovery site that allows users to see updates on news, sports videos and micro television channels through its tie-ups with media companies like CNN, ESPN and The Food Network. Live Stories allow users at an event or a location to contribute Snapchats of the same story and Snapchat Local gives users access to localized information. Snapchat is using these tools to help advertisers deliver their ads to a target population. It is also working with third-party ad effectiveness measurement partners to help advertisers understand the benefits of the ads.But the efforts aren't helping Snapchat much. According to recent news reports, Fidelity Investments, an investor in Snapchat, wrote off a 25% valuation on its investments, thus reducing Snapchat's valuation to $12 billion. Last year, Snapchat commented about its intention to go public. It may need to work harder on its revenue model before it finally decides to take the plunge.Currently, the market is in a correction mode. If Snapchat cannot significantly increase its monetization, valuation will further drop. A $100 million revenue run rate company will not be able to sustain a $12 billion valuation in the current condition. Furthermore, profitability is still a concern, as is the wobbly, unconvincing nature of the revenue model.This company is one of the worst examples of the unsavory Unicorn mania that we have seen in the technology industry over the last couple of years. If it tries to go public, it will be hammered. And I don't know if there are any suckers left who would want to invest in it in the private market anymore either.Tough days ahead!"

        Software integrity was supposed to deliver the next phase of growth but a 3.8% yoy growth fell short of the target.
        Shares are trading back above its mean P/E valuation, implying that the market buys the back half rebound story.","Synopsys (SNPS) reported both revenue and EPS upside to estimates for 1Q20. As I have written before, I believe Synopsys has had market share losses to its rival, Cadence Design Systems, particularly as the latter has done well with its solvers which eat into Synopsys' core EDA tools. Overall, 1Q20 has been robust but the miss in Software Integrity segment may not be the perfect long story for investors.The stock has traded well before the plunge relating to broader economic implications due to COVID-19, but has since recovered rapidly.And if we look at the past 3 months along with its peers, we can see that Cadence is edging out slightly.Large hardware shipments which were delayed in the closing of 2019 has yet to make an impact but revenue was still in the strong end of the guidance ($805m-$835m.) That means even without lumpy hardware sales and significant Huawei orders, core EDA sales managed to remain growing between the 5-10% range which is slightly higher than the long term target in the mid-single digit. Generally, the management stated on the recent earnings call that they were confident in their hardware and that hardware verification was in very high demand.Margins were strong allowing the company to deliver bottomline upside. In addition, strong bookings in 1Q20 helped improve cash flow.Software Integrity includes the tools that test software code for security, vulnerabilities and quality issues. These are in strong demand and are targeted for 15-20% long term growth with the ability to expand operating margin above 20%. However, 1Q20 software integrity revenue only grew 3.8% yoy which was way below the said targets. I suspect that there might be some delays in the Polaris platform development which may have caused the rollout of new integration of various applications to be pushed back or that its customers aren't fully ready to adopt it. That said, it's too early to tell as these platforms can live up to 10-15 years.Source: CompanySource: Bloomberg...but the management guides strongly for the next quarterOn the call, the company has mentioned that software integrity business levels are off to a good start for the year, highlighting 30% growth in bookings volume. This is in contrast to the weak current quarter so we might need to adopt a 'wait and see' approach to see if the upside in revenue actually materializes next quarter.If we compare Synopsys' 1Q20 (Jan'20) with Cadence's 4Q19 (Dec'19), despite that the period doesn't fully align, we can still see that Cadence grew 5.2%, ahead of Synopsys' 1.7%. Operating margin for Synopsys is about 20% compared with Cadence's 30%.In terms of valuation, the company is already trading back to one standard deviation above its mean which implies that the market is already accounting for a strong back half rebound, making the risk-reward profile weaker.To conclude, I think Synopsys has a strong set of products but when compared to its competitor, Cadence, I suggest that the latter has a better long-term growth story.Source: Bloomberg"
4350104,105306,2020-05-26T13:55:37-04:00,"Quarterly report surpassed estimations, with several project wins during the quarter.With a strong backlog and a stable business environment, Synopsys raised EPS guidance for the year.The company offers a combination of business resilience and growth while trading at attractive valuation multiples compared to its peers.","Synopsys (SNPS) released another strong quarterly report, beating expectations and also raising earnings guidance for 2020, as demand for design, verification, and IP solutions remains strong to attend the semiconductor industry. As valuation multiples are still attractive on a comparative basis, Synopsys is an interesting name in the technology sector, as the company combines growth potential and business resilience in these uncertain times.Revenue came in at $861.3 million, up 3% over a year ago and surpassing expectations by 3% as well. The biggest contributor for revenue was the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) business vertical, which totaled $511.4 million, nearly up 4% over a year ago. Excluding the hardware part, which faced tough comparisons given strong Q2 2019 results, growth was within the company's long-term financial objective of mid to high single-digit growth for this vertical.Revenue of Intellectual Property & System Integration business vertical remained stable at $260 million and Software Integrity increased to $88.3 million, up 6% over a year ago, despite the impact of business decision delays, as companies were in the process of adapting to working restrictions after COVID-19 outbreak.As costs and expenses were little changed over the last twelve months, non-GAAP operating margin came in at 25.7% and remained on track to generate a 200 bps increase for FY 2020. Splitting by segment, Semiconductor & System Design segment, which is formed by EDA and IP & System Integration verticals, delivered adjusted operating margin of 27.1% from 26.8% a year ago, and Software Integrity was 13.3% from 10.1% a year ago.As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.22, handily above expectations of $0.99 and up 5% over a year ago, driven by operational execution, as the company managed to contain costs and benefited from top-line growth.Synopsys has also expanded its customer base during the quarter. In EDA, Synopsys Fusion Compiler won key undisclosed deals in 5G, edge computing, graphic gaming GPU, and mobile semiconductor business. Meanwhile, Synopsys expanded the collaboration with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which already deploys Synopsys Fusion Design Platform in large scale.In addition, Synopsys Verification Platform finished deals with 13 new customers for its hardware products and also expanded its verification software in hyperscale, semiconductors, and systems segments. Further, the IP vertical got competitive wins in a major internet services and AI company as well as in a fabless semiconductor company, and the Software Integrity segment broadened current agreements, adding new products available to customers.This positive business momentum is also evidenced by the current non-cancelable backlog that reached $4.8 billion in the quarter, representing roughly 142% of the revenue recorded in 2019. This backlog, alongside Synopsys's recurring revenue around 90%, provides a relatively stable business environment to the company, as companies continue to invest in new technologies in artificial intelligence, 5G, IoT, and cloud end markets, driving demand for Synopsys's solutions, despite the uncertainties with regards to the pace of the economic recovery.Underscored by this scenario and assuming expectations of revenue more concentrated in the second half of the year, Synopsys reaffirmed its revenue target in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion for the fiscal year 2020, representing a growth of 7.1% to 8.6%, consistent with the company's long-term objective of high-single-digit revenue growth.Furthermore, the company also reaffirmed its non-GAAP operating margin target of 27% and raised fiscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS target to $5.21-5.28 range, which is $0.03 above the original target and represents a growth of roughly 15% over 2019.In my view, the EPS target is still conservative, as market consensus is currently sitting at $5.39. That said, we can also see below that consensus points to EPS double-digit growth for the coming years, in line with Synopsys's long-term financial objective.Source: Seeking AlphaSynopsys has been able to sustain the operating margin above 12% over the past 5 years. It is encouraging to see tough, operating margin near 16% in the recent quarters, as a reflection of gross profit margin expansion and decreasing SG&A expenses during the period.Source: YChartIn order to assess Synopsys's profitability on a relative basis, I will compare the company with other two system design enablement peers (Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) and Cadence (NASDAQ:CDNS)) as well as the technology broader sector, using as reference the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) and the application software segment of the same ETF.This comparison is clearly unfavorable to Synopsys, as its gross profit margin, operating income margin, and ROIC lag direct peers (Ansys and Cadence) and the broader sector as well.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorShifting to the valuation analysis, Synopsys trades at significantly lower P/E, EV/EBITDA, and EV/Revenue multiples compared to Ansys and Cadence. On the table below, we can see that the valuation gap varies broadly, ranging from 14.1% (as compared to Cadence EV/EBITDA multiple) to 112.5% (relative to Ansys EV/Revenue multiple). On average, the valuation gap is 47.7%, taking into consideration all three multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and EV/Revenue) for Ansys and Cadence.As long-term earnings growth forecasts of both Synopsys and Ansys sit around 15% and Cadence is expected to growth at a more modest 11%, I see current analysis quite applicable, if not a little conservative, taking into consideration Cadence's lower growth forecast, which suggests an upside as high as the valuation gap, or 47.7%, from Synopsys's current price level.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorOn the other hand, as long as Synopsys continues to show weaker profitability metrics compared to Ansys and Cadence, Synopsys may keep trading at a discount to its two direct peers, although probably not as much as it is at the moment.In terms of price action, shares of Synopsys have recently broken the resistance from previous highs in February and continue to trade above 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages, giving no sign of losing momentum so far. While some price consolidation is possible at this level, given the strong surge occurred since lows seen in March, the scenario remains positive for a sustainable uptrend trajectory going forward.Source: YChartUnderscored by continued demand for new technologies, Synopsys remains a solid business, with several project wins during the quarter and forecasts of high-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth for fiscal 2020.As Synopsys's business outlook is not expected to be seriously affected by the ongoing pandemic or the pace of the reopening of the economy, the company offers a combination of business resilience and growth going forward, in addition to be trading at attractive valuation multiples compared to its peers."
4360476,105759,2020-07-23T22:35:39-04:00,Both Synopsys and Cadence are leaders in a market I believe can exhibit strong secular growth in the years to come.A cleaner sales mix and less variability in cash and earnings generation tilt my preference toward Synopsys.Long-run shareholder returns will emanate from growth in sales and margin expansion.Current valuation leaves very little left for investors and I would like to see a slight de-rating in order to entice me into initiating a position.Currently rating the Synopsys stock at neutral.,"Source: Synopsys.comSynopsys (SNPS) is highly levered to the secular growth trends within IoT, 5G networks, AI, Cloud and connected autos verticals. This exposure to long-term growth, especially with less cyclicality than peers, is a reason why I believe the company to be one of the better options within the EDA software space. Nonetheless, due to the somewhat stretched valuation and strong run in the stock as of late, I am placing the company on a neutral rating until the multiple becomes more enticing and the ability to generate long-term mid-double-digit returns isn't placed squarely at the door of earnings growth.Synopsys is one of the leading manufacturers of Electronic Design Automation software and services that allow the makers and designers of Integrated Circuits (IC) and System on Chips (SoCs) to develop, simulate and test the tangible design of their works pre-production. The use of Synopsys software allows businesses to test their chips for potential security vulnerabilities and integration effects with other electronic devices. Customers come from a variety of industries, but particularly the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing sectors, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), being one of its top customers, representing ~12.8% of 2019 sales.Looking at the composition of revenues from the 2019 financial statements, EDA continues to dominate sales for Synopsys; however, this has transitioned down through the last 3 fiscal years from 66% of sales to 59%. This loss of market share can most likely be attributed to Cadence Design Systems’ (CDNS) growing slice of the pie. Nonetheless, this loss of share within the EDA market has not translated into reduced revenue growth or profitability, but has in fact shifted to less cyclical and semiconductor cycle dependent IP & System Integration and Software Integrity segments. This greater cash and earnings robustness is why the stock is my preferred long-term play as I believe this will reduce the chances of significant earnings degradation in slower growth years.Source: 2019 Financial StatementsIn order to get a better understanding of key performance drivers, I aim to utilise a bottom-up perspective for the stock and also a more top-down viewpoint for the sector as a whole in order to break apart the components of ROE:The tax burden imposed on Synopsys for 2015 through 2019 comparative to Cadence has been a little more onerous and has contributed to lower returns on equity throughout the period. Through all years apart from 2018, Synopsys has had a greater share of its earnings being paid out in tax. Whilst both companies have large subsidiaries in low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Hungary, Cadence books more of its sales through these geographies, comparative to Synopsys. To note, the one-off 2018 relative outperformance for Synopsys was in large part due to increased deferred tax assets amounting to $397m included on the balance sheet; this DTA significantly lowered EBT and thus, increased net income and the tax burden ratio. While the burden is lumpy through years 2015-2019, it is consistently below close peer Cadence and is a detractor to earnings; it is one of many reasons why I believe the stock trades at a discount to some of its peers. In order to justifiably trade in line or at a consistently reduced discount to the sector, the tax burden gap has to be closed. Over the last 2 fiscal years, this has exhibited a positive trend; nevertheless, the data is too sparse to yet draw any firm conclusions. It is something I will be watching closely in the next few quarterly reports.Source: Respective Financial Statements 2015-2019Similarly, analysing the Interest Burden vs. Cadence, the metric is tilted toward Synopsys. Both EDA heavyweights have very little by way of debt on their respective balance sheets, with Synopsys averaging $232 million through the 5-year time period, whereas this averaged $524 million for Cadence. Looking at these debt figures in a little more detail relative to the balance sheets as a whole, Total 5-yr avg Debt to Total 5-yr avg Assets was 0.21 for Cadence and 0.04 for Synopsys; implying that the makeup of Synopsys’ balance sheet relative to Cadence includes a greater proportion of equity. As a shareholder, I like this balance sheet mix as it effectively reduces variability in key line items due to leverage - it essentially gives you a cleaner bottom-line figure. The habitual nature of the burden is extremely appealing, especially in a Covid-19 milieu where the siphoning of cash flows to fund debt is being severely punished by the market. This high-quality focus by management is something I very much look for in a business and partially explains the premium the stock trades at vs. the market.Source: Respective Financial Statements 2015-2019Moving through the Income Statement and looking at the Operating Profit Margins of Synopsys against Cadence, this metric, I believe, uncovers a lot of the underperformance in shareholder returns between the two companies over the last 5 years.Source: Respective Financial Statements 2015-2019Cadence has consistently generated superior margins vs. Synopsys. Further analysis points to a far better grasp of costs. On the Operating expenditure side, both companies are very similar with Opex representing on average 63% of sales for Synopsys and 69% for Cadence; this instantly shifts focus to a disparity in costs further up the income statement. Synopsys has a larger COGS as a % of sales, therefore affecting its gross profits. Although on a 5-year average, Synopsys has managed to execute a better Opex strategy - reducing this by ~9% vs. Cadence - it hasn’t been able to make up for what it initially loses in COGS.As pointed out previously, the sales makeup of Synopsys is heavily tilted toward EDA, with IP & System Integration and Software Integrity growing and now making up ~40% of sales. Whilst this portion of sales is far less volatile, it is lower margin. When breaking down the contribution to sales from Service/Maintenance and coupling that analysis with the study of Cost of Sales, it could not be more evident. S&M represents ~13% of sales yet accounts for 25% of costs. This is much harder to scrutinise for Cadence as the company lumps maintenance sales with products and leaves service separate. Nonetheless, I believe the greater impact of one larger customer, Intel, on sales comparative to a more disparate customer base for Cadence means Synopsys provides larger discounts, thus lowering the ASP for its service and maintenance contracts and increasing the potency of its cost base.From an analytical standpoint, it is very hard to suggest Synopsys move away from this current model, as Intel has one of the largest R&D budgets in the semi-space. However, it does highlight the impact larger, albeit less volatile, customers can have on efficiencies. The spread in gross and operating profit margins in my view has to close for the stock to trade at the multiple of an ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) or Cadence, for that matter. Until the business efficiencies and profitability are tangible, I do not believe the stock closes the valuation discount gap.Source: Respective Financial Statements 2015-2019Due to the larger equity slice on the balance sheet and therefore greater assets, the Asset Turnover for Synopsys is lower than Cadence's. A lighter balance sheet would obviously help Synopsys, but the composition of assets as previously touched upon is not something I am too concerned about, nor does it alter my thesis. Whilst it does lower ROE, I believe the reasons are justifiable.Moreover, a lower proportion/usage of debt vs. Cadence means leverage is also lower. These two ratios matched with the prior analysis result in Return on Equity for Synopsys being on average 67% lower than Cadence or 9.0% vs. 28.0%. Whilst the returns are lower for Synopsys, it doesn’t alter my view that the company is for me the better, more stable play. A majority of the discrepancy is due to a business model that isn’t as levered to segments that offer greater variability. Looking at EPS alone, the variability is meaningful; the standard deviation of EPS from 2000 through 2019 for Synopsys vs. Cadence is 106% and 189%; it is key to note this standard deviation looks at upside and downside variability. The downside variability is far greater for Cadence than Synopsys and gets to the crux of my argument. Furthermore, the volatility for Cadence is not helped by the fact it has slightly more leverage in its capital structure vs. Synopsys. Ultimately in years when earnings are down, this is only amplified. As a long-term investor, I aim to minimise drawdowns in earnings of my portfolio companies as much as possible, as I am a firm believer in robust and less variable profitability.Trading on a 34x forward multiple vs. the sector of 39x that includes Cadence, Adobe, ANSYS and Intuit (INTU), the stock is at a ~15% discount to peers. Nonetheless, the average 5-year discount to the sector has been 25%. All technology stocks and software in particular are currently riding the Covid wave; due to this I am placing the stock on a neutral rating until the valuation becomes more attractive and euphoria subsides. Whilst earnings are a lot more stable due to a mix shift, I believe the multiple expansion YTD has fully priced in the expected earnings growth in 2020 and 2021, leaving very little margin for error or return potential. A de-rating of the stock back to around 28-30x forward earnings I believe is a better entry point and leaves investors with greater probability of achieving mid-double-digit returns.Owing to its greater prudence in shareholder returns and cash flow generation, my favoured pick in the EDA space is Synopsys. AI, IoT and 5G will be at the heart of technology in the next decade and choosing the appropriate semi-manufacturer is littered with problems. EDA and IP Integration along with Software authentication is a very neat, less cyclical way of levering a portfolio to these major growth drivers. A slight de-rating would trigger me to initiate a position and make me more comfortable in assuming the risks."

Although the headline figures look strong, ASC 606 helped recognize record IP bookings upfront due to the strong IP market in 2019. Core EDA revenue were in fact down about 0.9% YoY and 1.8% QoQ on a reported ASC 605 basis, but up about 2.7% YoY if we compare ASC 606 on ASC 605. Further, 1Q20 guidance is a bit soft and implies prolonged slowdown on the revenue. Recently, I wrote about Cadence's market share wins and I believe that it was at the expense of Synopsys. I suggest waiting for a better entry price to buy the shares as current valuation appears to be high. Long-term prospects are solid as EDA and IP markets are growing healthily due to upcoming end-markets in IoT, 5G and AI etc.Core EDA revenue reached $489.2m in 4Q19 on a reported basis which is up 1.6% QoQ but if we compare like-for-like with ASC 605, it was down 0.9% YoY and 1.8% QoQ.IP & system integration revenue reached $275.5m but actually declined 3.7% QoQ on a reported ASC 606 basis. The IP market have been very strong in 2019 so a pullback here in the 4Q is a bit of a negative surprise.Source: CompanyRegional breakdown shows weakness in APACI believe the softness in APAC sales were partially related to the export control set by the United States to China. APAC sales fell from 33% of total in revenue in 3Q19 to 28% in 4Q19.Source: CompanyQuarterly revenue trends are slowingIf we look at the revenue trends each quarter from 2018Q1, we can see that both the YoY and 2-year growth rates are slowing. I believe it is because of the competitive EDA market where Synopsys has lost share in.Source: BloombergCompared to the Street estimate of $870m, 1Q20 revenue is guided between $805m-$835m with the midpoint implying flat YoY growth. This guidance assumes no revenue from companies currently on the U.S. government’s entity list. I believe the low guidance will be a disappointment for investors. The company still targets in the long-term for total revenue to grow in the high single-digit range with EDA increasing mid-high single digit, IP & System Integration revenue in the low double digit range and software integrity revenue in the 15-20% range, exceeding industry growth.With a slowing revenue growth rate and competitive share losses to rival Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) as the latter is growing into EDA with its Clarity 3D solver, I think the current valuation is too high given that it is trading at more than 1 standard deviation above its historical mean if we look at the forward P/E ratio.I suggest to wait for a more attractive price level to buy as I believe Synopsys still has market leadership in EDA and that this industry is still projected to grow healthily with the boost from end market demand like IoT, 5G and AI etc.Source: Bloomberg"
4310987,104812,2019-12-06T01:56:19-05:00,"SNPS released its fiscal Q4 results and set 2020 guidance presenting continued momentum in earnings growth.Company is benefiting from increasing complexity of electronics including trends in AI, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, and 5G wireless technology.Financial margins expansion will be a key monitoring point going forward.","Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a leader in software and hardware used by the tech industry for designing, manufacturing, verifying, and the integration of silicon chips in a variety of applications. The company highlights how its solutions are behind current innovative trends, including artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and 5G wireless technologies. Indeed, Synopsys with a history going back to 1986 has presented strong growth in recent years and an impressive share price performance, with the stock up over 55% just in 2019. The company is benefiting from accelerating earnings and higher cash flow in an overall positive industry environment. This article takes a look at its latest quarterly report along with our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: Finviz.com)Synopsys reported its fiscal Q4 earnings on December 4th with non-GAAP EPS of $1.15 which beat expectations by $0.02 while the GAAP EPS figure of $1.04 was $0.27 ahead of estimates. The spread here was related to stock-based compensation and some restructuring charges. Revenue in the quarter of $851.08 million increased by 7% year over year and was also slightly ahead of expectations. For the full fiscal year 2019, the adjusted EPS increased by 17% to $4.56 while GAAP EPS also surged by 22%.(Source: Company IR)Management highlighted how the results were strong considering what was a challenging macro backdrop and weaker chip industry sentiment particularly back in the first half of the year. The story here has been the ongoing momentum across its business segments. For 2019, there was a 6.5% sales growth from its 'Semiconductor & System Design' segment which represents the bulk of the business at 90% of all revenue while 'Software Integrity' segment grew by 20%. Favorably, software integrity has been able to turn an operating profit compared to a loss in 2018 and is now supporting firm wide margins.(Source: Company IR)The other positive trends here are lower debt which has declined to $136 million to end the fiscal year from $469 million at the end of 2018 and accelerating operating cash flow which reached $801 million in 2019. The pace of operating cash flow has exceeded that of capital expenditures, suggesting strong free cash flow.The company issued guidance for full fiscal year 2020 with a revenue estimate in a range between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion, which if confirmed would represent an increase of 7.8% compared to 2019 at the midpoint. On one hand, this is a deceleration compared to 14.5% in growth rate of 2018, but as mentioned above, is coming with higher margins. The EPS target between $5.18 and $5.25 represents an increase of 15% at the midpoint.(Source: Company IR)Furthermore, the company is setting a long-term financial objective that is targeting ""double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth"" on a multi-year basis. Management sees earnings benefiting from higher margins overall and strong growth in its software integrity segment in the range of 15-20% as the market evolves. M&A activities and ongoing share buybacks remain a priority.(Source: Company IR)Synopsys highlights trends towards greater complexity in electronics, including the accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) deep-learning capabilities in chipsets as the company's main growth driver over the next decade. The company believes it is well-positioned to benefit from growth in AI applications for mobile devices and technologies, data centers, 'internet of things', and autonomous vehicles.(Source: Company IR)Advanced silicon process innovation is another exciting area for the company. Announced plans by some of the leading players and Synopsys' customers, including Intel Corp. (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) and ARM Holdings (OTCPK:ARMHF), with next generation chip technologies are expected to support growth. The company claims ""all leading semiconductor companies in the world"" use its technologies.(Source: Company IR)We view Synopsys as a sort of 'service provider' for the chip industry benefiting from the same trends regardless of which customer is building market share. Favorably, year to date 2019, SNPS up 58% has outperformed some of the industry tracking benchmarks compared to 51% for the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and 48% iShares PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index ETF (SOXX). Compared to traditional 'chip stocks,' Synopsys benefits from a high level of recurring revenues based on its licensing business model representing 88% of total revenues.Data by YChartsThe valuation metrics we are looking at are the firm's price to free cash flow at 34x and forward price to earnings at 26.1x. This is in the context of 2020 expectations for EPS growth of 15% and higher free cash flow on more moderate CAPEX. The company sees a more material decline in CAPEX for 2021 which should further support free cash flow generation. Overall, the numbers are reasonable, but we question how much of this growth story and earnings momentum is already priced in following what has been an exceptional year for the stock price. The stock is now down about 10% from its all-time high, which we view as a technical pullback while Q1 guidance was slightly weaker than expected. The long-term outlook remains solid.Data by YCharts2019 was a strong year for Synopsys as it was able to accelerate profitability from its Software Integrity segment which is now the growth driver for the firm. Recognizing the company's strong leadership position and market opportunity, we take a neutral view and rate shares of SNPS as a hold at the current level while looking for some further near-term weakness possibly towards the $120-125 level as a better buying opportunity to improve the risk-reward setup. Investor monitoring points going forward include the evolution of financial margins and it will be important for the company to maintain top-line momentum."

(NASDAQ:SNPS) has a solid history of revenue growth, but I think its stock is too expensive to buy at current prices. In my opinion, the stock is overbought after a 50% rally so far this year, so I’m on the sidelines. The stock is priced for perfection which makes it vulnerable to a significant correction if investors lose confidence in the company.Synopsys has produced decent revenue growth over the last decade and the analysts are expecting this growth to continue heading into 2020. The company’s earnings have been subdued over most of the last decade, but they did surge higher in the 2018 fiscal year. Synopsys operates with decent profit margins which have reached 19% and the company’s return on equity has increased to 17%.The company’s balance sheet shows low debt levels with a long-term debt of only 2% of the its total asset value and the company’s total liabilities are a reasonable 40% of the its total asset value.With the low total debt level the company can easily take on more debt if needed (for any future acquisition plans the company may have). I prefer companies with total liabilities under 50% of the total asset value - as this gives the company plenty of leeway before debt becomes excessive. When debt levels raise so does the bankruptcy risk which is something I like to avoid when investing with a long-term view.Synopsys operates with a minimal amount of working capital (with a current ratio of 0.9) meaning that its short-term assets (such as cash and deposits) do not quite cover its short-term liabilities (bills the company has to pay). I personally prefer current ratios above 1.0 so that the company’s bills can be paid with cash rather than having to dip into its long-term finances.Based on earnings from net income (rather than operational), Synopsys’ forward PE multiple is 34x with a stock price of $121. The company’s trailing PE multiple is 42x and its book value multiple is 4.8x. These multiples imply that Synopsys is expensive.Synopsys has a solid history of revenue growth with its revenue increasing 10% per year over the last decade. The chart below visually shows Synopsys’ revenue and earnings trend over the last decade along with the next two years of consensus forecasts. The earnings per share used are net income (they are not operational earnings which some forecasts state).Synopsys data by ADVFNAs the above chart shows, Synopsys’ revenue has consistently increased over the last decade and the forecasts show this trend continuing into 2020. The earnings have broadly ranged from $1 to $1.50 over most of the last decade, but they did surge higher over the 2018 fiscal year. The analysts are expecting Synopsys’ earnings to continue increasing through to 2020.Synopsys is the world's 15th largest software company and a global leader in electronic design automation. The company’s growth is largely inorganic with acquisitions. During 2018, Synopsys acquired three companies and over the last decade Synopsys made a whopping 42 acquisitions.Some of the more notable acquisitions in recent times include,Synopsys relies on its acquisitions for product releases. The companies acquired help it gain access to markets and products that could not be achieved on its own without a substantial investment in time and money.While investors are divided amongst the benefit of acquisitions, I think they are a cost effective way to obtain new products and penetrate new markets. If Synopsys where to develop everything on their own, they would need to employ a significant design team. With acquisitions, Synopsys simply buys companies which include the design team and their products. Another benefit with acquired companies is that they already have an established market share. If Synopsys where to develop the product themselves they would also have to find a market for that product and employ a sales and marketing team. With an acquisition, Synopsys knows in advance how the product performs in sales terms. Synopsys’ success in integrating their rather extensive list of acquisitions is somewhat problematic. While Synopsys’ revenue history (shown in the financial section above) has averaged a fairly consistent 10% growth per year, Synopsys’ earnings have not shown any real growth over the last decade - other than the earnings surging higher last fiscal year. I would have though that Synopsys would produce better earnings growth from all of its acquisitions.Spending on IT will continue and a significant portion of this spending is on software. A survey for worldwide IT spending produced by Gartner shows software spending is expected to increase from $397 billion in 2018 up to $431 billion in 2019 and $466 billion in 2020. This represents a 9.3% increase for 2019 and an 8.2% increase for 2020. If Synopsys simply maintains its market share it stands to increase its revenue by at least 8% per year for the next few years.While software spending increased by 9.3% in 2018, Synopsys’s revenue actually increased by 14.5% in 2018. An older Gartner survey from 2017 showed that software spending increased 5.6% in 2016 and 6.8% in 2017. For these two years, Synopsys increased its revenue by 8.1% in 2016 and 12.5% in 2017. Therefore Synopsys has the ability to generate more revenue growth than what the industry provides.This means that Synopsys has a market share that’s larger than what it should have. While Synopsys’ significant acquisitions have not produced reliable earnings growth, Synopsys’ has produced higher revenue growth than what the IT software market offered. This tells me that management is indeed efficient at integrating its acquisitions.While I personally prefer growth companies with reliable earnings growth trends, not all growth companies can produce consistent earnings growth. I still classify Synopsys as a growth company, even with is subdued earnings growth, as its revenue continues to increase at a higher rate than what the IT software market offers.Synopsys has a history of revenue growth. The company’s earnings have increased, although this mostly occurred in the last fiscal year. The forecast earnings growth rate is 10% heading into 2020. The PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) can be used to arrive at a valuation based on its earnings growth.Using the forecast earnings growth rate of 10% gives a forward PEG of around 3.4 with a 2020 PE multiple of 34x.It’s commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which means that Synopsys is overvalued with a stock price of $121. Its fair value would be around $36.Most good growth stocks usually have forward PEG’s in the 1.5 to 2.5 range. Synopsys’ forward PEG of 3.4 is expensive, especially considering that the earnings growth history has been subdued over the last decade (with the exception of last years earnings surge).As an active investor I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.Synopsys chart by StockCharts.comOver the last decade Synopsys’ stock price has surged higher to peak in 2018. The stock pulled back late last year as the stock market pulled back from its all-time high. The stock market resumed its rally this year and Synopsys rallied back up along with the market to make a new high.In the short-term, the stock looks over bought as it has surged 50% higher so far this year without a pause. All stocks need to rest with a pause or pullback after strong rallies and I think that Synopsys’ is due for a rest. The stock could rally some more, but sooner or later it will take a break. In the short-term I think the stock is at risk of a decline, especially considering that the stock is expensive. After a rest I suspect that enthusiastic investors would continue driving the stock higher over the longer term. However, the stock is expensive which makes it vulnerable to a significant correction if the company disappoints the market.Synopsys derives its grow inorganically, having acquired 42 companies over the last decade. The companies acquired help Synopsys gain access to markets and products that could not be achieved on its own without a significant investment in time and money.The survey produced by Gartner shows software spending is expected to increase 9.3% in 2019 and 8.2% in 2020. Over the last couple of years Synopsys' revenue has consistently increased at a higher rate than the increase in software spending.While Synopsys’ earnings growth has been subdued over the last decade, I still classify Synopsys as a growth company due to its solid and consistent revenue growth.The analysts are expecting earnings growth heading into 2020, but the growth still leaves Synopsys with a forward PEG of 3.6 and a forward PE multiple of 34x (earnings based on net income). The stock price has surged 50% higher so far this year and I think the stock is overbought and due for a pullback. While I think Synopsys has plenty of growth potential, I think it’s too expensive to buy at current prices."
4316805,104720,2020-01-14T14:18:02-05:00,"Synopsys' EDA and IP businesses are currently fueling its stock.IoT is Synopsys' primary growth driver, and big data and analytics are also its growth drivers.Long-term growth-oriented investors can buy the stock around the current price.","Synopsys (SNPS) is a technology company that primarily offers tools to design and test integrated circuits (ICs). Synopsys' revenue has grown at a CAGR of 10.31% in the last five years. The company's EDA and IP businesses are currently driving its revenue growth and driving the growth of its stock. I believe the company's revenue will continue to grow at a CAGR of around 10% in the next five years. I am bullish on the stock around the current price and believe that long-term investors can buy the stock around the current price.Synopsys offers its products and services to its customers who manufacture ICs and develop software. The company offers electronic design automation (EDA) software which is used to design and test ICs. The company also offers pre-designed circuits, which are semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products used as components of larger IC designs. It also offers software testing tools and services that improve the security and quality of software code. Synopsys has two reporting segments, (1) Semiconductor & System Design, and (2) Software Integrity. Its Semiconductor & System Design segment consists of EDA tools, IP products, system integration solutions and associated services, and Software Integrity segment consists of security and quality solutions for software development.Source: PixabayInternet of Things (IoT) is Synopsys' primary growth driver. The company develops its EDA products targeted at IoT-related ICs. Chip designers use the company's EDA products to automate the IC design process. In addition to IoT, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are also driving the demand of Synopsys' EDA products. These products address the needs of digital and custom IC design and field programmable gate array (FPGA) design. The global EDA software market size is expected to reach $14.54 billion by 2025 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9% during this period, according to a report. Synopsys' EDA revenue is expected to grow accordingly.The growth of big data and analytics are also creating growth opportunities for semiconductor makers and for Synopsys. In the formation of big data, once data is collected, it is transmitted over wireline or wireless data networks. The data is then processed in data centers. As a result, the demand for CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs is rising. GPUs and FPGAs have been optimized to perform massive parallel processing that is behind the processing of big data. Synopsys' EDA and IP products can be used to design and test the parallel processing chips, also known as data center accelerators. According to a report, ""The data center accelerator market is expected to grow from USD 2.84 billion by 2018 to USD 21.19 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 49.47% from 2018 to 2023."" This is a huge growth opportunity for Synopsys' EDA and IP business.The company's another growth driver is its software testing platform, which is known as Software Integrity platform. The platform offers security, quality, and compliance testing. One of the major growth drivers of the software testing market is the integration of AI and machine learning. Another driver of growth of the market is the growing adoption of test automation services. According to a report, ""Software Testing Market size exceeded USD 40 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 6% from 2020 to 2026."" Synopsys' software testing revenue will grow at a similar rate.Synopsys' competitors include Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Mentor Graphics Corporation (now a part of Siemens AG) in the EDA business. In the Semiconductor & System Design segment, the company competes with Cadence Design Systems and numerous other IP providers. The company's Software Integrity segment competes with Checkmarx Ltd., Veracode (now part of Thoma Bravo, LLC), and Micro Focus International plc (MFGP). The company generally competes with its competitors on the basis of product quality, product features, and product ease of use. The company's competitive advantage is that it offers a wide range of products that helps designers to design individual ICs as well as larger systems. The company's products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating most of the tasks and reducing errors.Synopsys' revenue for the fourth quarter of FY 2019 came in at $851.1 million compared to $795.1 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 7%. Revenue for FY 2019 came in at $3.361 billion compared to $3.121 billion for FY 2018, an increase of 7.7%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter came in at $177.1 million or $1.15 per share compared to $119.6 million or $0.78 per share in the year-ago period, an increase of 48%. Non-GAAP net income for FY 2019 came in at $702.5 million or $4.56 per share compared to $599.7 million or $3.91 per share for FY 2018, an increase of 17%. The company delivered strong results amid a weak macro backdrop, which is encouraging. The strong results were driven by growth in the automotive sector, and the advent of 5G, IoT, and cloud. The company's EDA and IP businesses remained its primary growth drivers in FY 2019.Synopsys' competitors include Cadence Design Systems, Keysight Technologies, and Micro Focus International. Synopsys' non-GAAP forward PE ratio is 28.40x compared to Cadence's 33.39x, Keysight's 19.52x, and Micro Focus' 9.52x. Synopsys' trailing 12-month price to sales ratio is 6.62x compared to Cadence's 8.65x, Keysight's 4.38x, and Micro Focus' 1.44x. Synopsys' trailing 12-month price to cash flow ratio is 27.92x compared to Cadence's 29.18x, Keysight's 18.95x, and Micro Focus' 5.88x.Synopsys is fairly valued compared to its competitors. The company has a strong balance sheet consisting of $728.60 million of cash and $137.71 million of debt. Considering the fact that the company has a strong balance sheet and strong EDA and IP businesses, the company's current valuation is appealing. The company will acquire certain IP assets of INVECAS, which will further strengthen its IP business by expanding its DesignWare IP portfolio. The acquisition will address the needs of chip designers of various sectors, such as consumer, IoT, and automotive. In this scenario, I believe the company should enjoy the valuation of Cadence in the near term.In the last five years, Synopsys' revenue increased at a CAGR of 10.31% and EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 13.50%. I believe revenue will continue to increase at such a rate in the next five years. Synopsys' trailing 12-month revenue is $3360.7 million. At a CAGR of 10.31%, its 2024-end revenue will be $5,490 million or $36.47 per share. In the last one year, Synopsys' stock has traded between the price to sales ratio of 4x and 6.8x. Applying a price to sales ratio of 6.8x on Synopsys' 2024 revenue per share, I get $248 as the stock's 2024 price. If the price to sales ratio expands further, there will be more upside to the stock.Consolidation among semiconductor companies, including mergers, asset acquisitions, and strategic partnerships, leads to fewer customers for Synopsys and increased customer bargaining power, which is a key risk. In addition, the company depends on a relatively small number of large customers. If it loses one or more of such customers, its revenue growth could be negatively impacted.The company has made substantial investments in developing new products and making enhancements in existing products. However, the industry in which Synopsys belongs to, is characterized by rapid technological changes. If the company fails to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner, its products may become obsolete sooner than anticipated. As a result, its revenue growth could be negatively impacted.Although Synopsys is fairly valued compared to its competitors, I am bullish on the stock. I believe its EDA and IP businesses will continue to drive its revenue growth. In addition, its software testing platform will also drive its revenue growth. The company delivered strong results in FY 2019 and in the fourth quarter of FY 2019. Revenue for FY 2019 came in at $3.361 billion, and the company is now targeting $4 billion of annual revenue, the management said. Synopsys is a good business to own for the long term."

Looking forward, the company should continue to benefit from the trends towards artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and autonomous vehicles as these applications all require sophisticated ICs. The company's entrance towards software integrity market is also beneficial as it adds another growth driver to its business. Despite the positive outlook, its shares are richly valued. We think investors may want to wait for a pullback.Data by YChartsSynopsys released its Q3 F2019 results on August 21, 2019. The company delivered a 9.4% growth in revenue, and its net income increased by 25%. We are pleased to see that the company also increased its guidance for the fiscal 2019. As can be seen from the table below, its fiscal 2019 revenue guidance is now increased to $3.34-3.37 billion. This was higher than its previous quarter's guidance of $3.29-3.35 billion. Synopsys also expects to generate operating cash flow of about $750 million. This guidance is much higher than its prior guidance of $670-700 million.Source: Q3 F2019 Earnings PressRecurring revenue model with high switching costsSynopsys is a Software-as-a-Service company. It generates a stable and predictable recurring revenue from its customers. In fact, about 90% of its revenues are recurring revenues. The company's EDA business is basically an oligopoly business with three major players Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), and Mentor Graphics dominating the EDA market. We do not think its customers will easily switch to its competitors (especially smaller competitors) as it usually takes a while to get familiar with a new EDA software. Switching to other firms may significantly delay their chip designs as the design process is time consuming already. In addition, the risk of a defect in the design process can result in significant delays. If a defect is undetected and the final design was sent to manufacturing, the loss can be humongous.Well-positioned to capture several megatrends: Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and Autonomous VehiclesSynopsys is well-positioned to benefit from several technology trends such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, and autonomous vehicles. In order for these technologies to happen, integrated circuits are necessary. In addition, these ICs are becoming more sophisticated with much higher transistor density. Therefore, the need for EDA softwares will not diminish. Synopsys' customers will continue to rely on its EDA software to design ICs for these applications.Source: Q2 2019 Investor PresentationSoftware Integrity platform, a new growth driver in the long termOver the past 5 years, Synopsys has acquired a portfolio of software firms to grow its software integrity platform (see chart below). This platform now represents about 10% of Synopsys' total revenue. We like Synopsys' entrance into this space as software security issue has increased in both number and severity. It is not only needed in electronics and ICs, but also for software developers in financial services, medical, automotive, industrial applications.Source: Q2 2019 Investor PresentationWe like Synopsys' entrance into this market as this market is set to grow from about $7.9 billion in 2018 to $20 billion in 2026 (see chart below).Source: Fortune Business InsightsStrong balance sheet to support future acquisitionsSynopsys has a strong balance sheet with total long-term debt of only $126.2 million. This only represents about 2% of its total assets. Management expects to generate about $750 million of operating cash flow in 2019. This healthy balance sheet has supported more than $1.6 billion in stock buybacks since 2015 (which generally represents about 80% of its free cash flow per year). The company also has excessive cash flow to pursue accretive acquisitions to grow its business. In fact, Synopsys has recently just announced to acquire QTronic GmbH to strengthen its automotive software and systems developments.Source: Q2 2019 Investor PresentationSynopsys is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 29.9x. While this is two multiples below its peer Cadence Design Systems' 31.91x, it is still much higher than its 5-hear average of 20.27x. Therefore, we think Synopsys is richly valued at this price.Data by YChartsCustomer concentration riskThe consolidation trend in the IC design industry has resulted in several major players dominating the market. Therefore, Synopsys is exposed to customer concentration risk. In fact, over 15% of its total revenue comes from one single customer, Intel (INTC).Competition from its peersThe semiconductor industry is changing rapidly with new technology nodes. Therefore, Synopsys must spend significantly to retain its competitiveness. In fact, R&D expenses represent about 34% of its total revenue in the first half of 2019.We like Synopsys and its business growth outlook. However, its shares are trading at a premium valuation already. We think a pullback will provide a better risk and reward profile."

The net result is that the likes of SNPS only get skimmed milk after NVDAs of the world have feasted on the cream.The complexity in the chip design has been going up. The dynamics in the autonomous driving (AD) is a case in point. The benefits of AD outweighing the costs have led to huge demand (ever heard of a company called Tesla?)Some of AD's software requirements are the abilities to marry machine learning with machine vision, incorporate the derived intelligence into real-time decision making, optimize engine performance to environmental conditions, connected monitoring among others. Furthermore, the rate of progress of self-learning technologies has been incredible, which assured auto manufacturers to continue their laid-back approach of letting their suppliers handle the software-hardware interactions.However, the velocity of AD demand and the ensuing complexities seem to have shaken the auto manufacturers out of their slumber. Coupled with SNPS’ efforts of the last many years to reach out to auto manufacturers, the growing complexity in the AD has led to SNPS getting direct deals with auto manufacturers (albeit in the software integrity business).Well begun is half doneWhile autonomous driving in itself is a multibillion-dollar market, SNPS may be planning to spread its wings across more of its presence.

Despite a sell-off today (Tuesday) the stock is up 40% YTD, and up over 80% from the March low. The most recent earnings report was a beat, but the P/E=50 appears to be very generous and the stock does not pay a dividend. The question becomes: did the earnings report rationalize such a rich valuation?Synopsys released a strong Q3 EPS report on August 19th. Results were considered to be a top-line beat of ~$70 million and a bottom line beat of $0.40/share. Let's take a look at the results:Source: Q3 EPS ReportI'll analyze the YTD results (i.e. last night months) to smooth out any short-term volatility. Revenue of $2.66 billion was up 6.0% as compared to the prior year 9-month period, total cost-of-revenue was relatively flat, and as a result gross margin was up 7.8%. Operating expenses were up 7.5% as the company continues to plow capital into R&D to stay on the leading edge of semi technology. There was a $62.5 million swing on income tax provisions ($0.40/share) that led to a 24.4% increase on the bottom line, or $3.01/share.My opinion: the 6% increase in revenue and the 24% increase in net-income do not support a P/E=50, especially if the $0.40/share income tax provision benefit is backed out.But that's not to say that Synopsys doesn't have a great business - it does. Synopsys high-level synthesis tools are critical to speed up time-to-market for engineers, as are their core IP building blocks, which are increasingly being outsourced to third parties like SNPS. In addition, anyone who has been reading my technology sector articles on companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) knows I am bullish on the key drivers of technology: 5G, the Cloud, the Internet-of-Things (""IoT""), and AI. All of these sectors require semiconductors and the great majority of them will be designed and tested using EDA tools from Synopsys.Another key technology that should be a catalyst for growth is electric and autonomous vehicles. Synopsys is making a push for a new architecture for automobiles:Source: August Presentation (available here)And no doubt the company wants to define the functional building blocks of the compute and smart sensor architecture so they can not only provide the IP building blocks (i.e. its ""DesignWare"" IP) so they can increase licensing revenue, but also provide much of the testing support to integrate the blocks into a consolidated platform. This is a big opportunity for Synopsys, but there are likely many competitors. That said, Synopsys has a leg up because so many design engineers are already so familiar with their tools. Indeed, in that same presentation Synopsys says 11 of the top-15 automotive OEMs use Synopsys Software Integrity to insure quality, safety, and security.Another tailwind, which has been a tailwind for Synopsys since the company's inception, is the on-going advancement of semiconductor process development, which is easier shown by use of another one of the company's slides:Source: August Presentation (available here)As can be seen in the graphic, Synopsys reports that all 2020 iPhones will be shipped using 5nm technology, while Tesla (TSLA) is reported to have a designed a very large SoC in-house, and Intel (INTC) will launch a 7nm chip in 2021. Meanwhile, TSMC (TSM) - which typically leads the industry in semiconductor technology, is planning to roll out 3nm chips by 2023.The point is: dimensions keep getting smaller, speeds keep rising, and more-and-more functionality keeps getting crammed onto SoCs. All of these trends means a solid future for the company that provides the critical design and testing software that speeds development of these chips. Time-to-market is a key metric in the highly competitive world of electronic chip-design.R&D budgets and new SoC projects can be affected by the global economy and consumer demand. The software integrity market has much more competition in it than what Synopsys faces in its traditional EDA market.Intel accounts for ~15% of Synopsys revenue and therefore it is critical that SNPS keeps the Intel account.Trade tensions between the US and China could have a direct impact on high-tech and retard growth for the sector.I don't quite understand the ""Silicon to Software"" moto underneath Synopsys Logo (see top of the article). That's because I still remember the very first time in the early 1990's I wrote some RTL (register transfer logic - effectively lines of software) code to describe a bus-interface chip and pushed a button on Synopsys' synthesis tool to have that code turned into logic gates that met my timing constraints. No more drawing schematics by hand! It was great. So from my standpoint, Synopsys will always be ""software to silicon"", not the other way around. Regardless, what the moto means today is that Synopsys is providing tools that take users all the way from silicon to software (i.e. the software integrity market). Time will tell how successful the company will be in that goal, but no doubt it is a leading EDA tool provider in the market today. And that market should see strong demand due to the 5G, Cloud, IoT, and AI tailwinds.But the stock is expensive and I am not a buyer here. A P/E=50 for a company that is growing revenue in the high single-digits is too pricey for my taste - especially with the broad market still quite near all-time highs in a market where Wall Street is totally disconnected from Main Street.

There are no dividends to this equation - stock appreciation is the only game on offer. That said, consumers in search of ever-faster performance from their electronic devices, from computers and smartphones to driverless cars and cloud providers, will forever capture the imagination of investors wanting a piece of a $378 billion worldwide market with a projected annual growth rate of 11.5%, according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics data. While chips for whatever application will cycle in and out with demand by device manufacturers and consumers, pricing power is likely to continue to reside with material producers. One such material producer is Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS).Synopsys lays claim to being the 15th largest software company in the world, according to company statistics. SNPS provides software across the entirety of the software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers programming the highest level of quality and cyber security into their applications.The company's ongoing growth model centers squarely on its proprietary electronic design automation (EDA) software that allows engineers to both design and test integrated circuits or chips. Another important component of the revenue mix is the company's pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components for larger chip designs. The company also provides software, hardware and ongoing technical support that brings these designs together as working applications for not only the electronics industry but also for financial, automotive, industrial and energy sectors of the greater economy worldwide.Cyber security is a critical and ongoing concern. As an example, today's average car has more than 100 million lines of code with automakers predicting a time in the very near future when that number doubles. The average level of defects per 1,000 lines of code ranges from 15 to 50, according to industry statistics. While the statistic most certainly carries meaning to a software engineer, in lay terms a security breach of a data center is the loss of data. A security breach of a driverless car application, the threat is exponentially greater - the possible loss of life. Cyber security moving forward becomes all the more daunting as greater portions of our lives become dependent on computer programs.The company derives revenue from three broad business segments:Time-based product revenues hit $1.911 billion through the end of the company's fiscal years in October 2016, just shy of 79% of total revenue for the year that came to $2.42 billion. Upfront products added $248.14 million in revenues for the period, about 10% of total revenues, while maintenance and service contracts supplied the remaining 11% of revenues for the year. Time-based revenue grew 6.62% YOY from FY 2015 $1.792 billion and just over 19% since 2013 for an average annualized growth rate of 6.11% for the period. Upfront applications registered a considerably stronger growth through the end of the company's fiscal year at 26% over 2015 at $197.33 million. The category was up 45% YOY on fiscal year 2015 and almost 85% on fiscal year 2013. The average growth rate for the entire period was 25%. Maintenance revenue grew at an average annual rate of 5%. Overall revenue growth for the entire period came to 7.29%. The cost of revenues is a consistent 22% except for fiscal year 2015 when one-off maintenance expenses and restructuring costs caused an uptick in the cost of revenues for the year of 23%, sending gross margins down to 76% of revenues from a very consistent 77% of revenues. Net income through the end of the fiscal year came to $266.83 million in 2016, up 13% YOY and 3.29% annualized since 2014. Earnings per share increased 21% for the year to $1.76/share, averaging 3.99% over the period. The added maintenance expenses and restructuring costs caused net income to fall 13% in 2015 to $225.9 million YOY from income of $259.1 million posted in 2014. EPS fell 13% to $1.43/share YOY from $1.64/share in 2014.Figure 1: Synopsys and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index with Selected Ratios, 2015-16Synopsys fell steadily throughout the calendar fourth quarter of 2015, nudging its 200-day trading average by the close of that year. Investor support for the stock largely disappeared. Still, the stock maintained a positive spread against the S&P 500 of roughly 9% through the close of 2015 (see Figure 1, above). Meanwhile, the US economy had also largely ground to a halt, posting an annualized GDP growth rate of 0.9% in the fourth quarter and an even worst GDP post of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016. Corporate spending on equipment, fixed investment and inventories were all negative for both quarters while spending on structures eked out an 0.1% increase in the first quarter after falling negative for the entirety of the year, culminating with a 15.2% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) plunge in the fourth quarter of 2015. It took investors about six months to reverse course which began in mid-February 2016 which began a six-month breakout which caused the stock to surge almost 58% by the end of the year. Synopsys had still managed to outpace the Philadelphia Semiconductor index by 1.59%, while surging well past the S&P 500 by 29% over the period.By the end of Synopsys' first quarter in January, total revenue was up 138%, net income was up 44% and EPS at $0.56/share was up 44% on January 2016 YOY. The stock price climbed equally as fast as investors piled into the stock through the first week in March, outpacing the S&P 500 by about 15% since mid-February (see Figure 2, below).Figure 2: Synopsys and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index with Selected Ratios, 2017By the end of the company's second fiscal quarter through the end of April, total revenue has slowed precipitously YOY to 12.41%, still a fairly strong, above-trend performance - but far from the heady 138% romp through the end of the 1st quarter YOY. Net income had fallen 23% on April 2016 while EPS fell 24% over the period. Investors broke innumerable keyboards pounding the sell button for a two-day stretch that sent the volume of shares sold through 30 million, leaving the stock to trade sideways through the second week in April. Another investor surge sent support scooting along the upper reaches of the RSI range through the second week in May before support literally evaporated, sending investor support levels to the bottom of the RSI range with another flurry of sustained selling which this time proved short term and overdone. The stock has gained almost 10% in market value since the third week in May, outpacing the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index by 3% while breezing by the S&P 500 by almost 19% over the period (see Figure 2, above).The stock is currently up 27% on the year and currently carries a 42.47 price/earnings ratio. I would project EPS for 2017 at $2.02/share, a 15% premium. I would project a 12-month target price of $87, which gives the company an earnings per share of $43.02."

However, the company managed to surpass EPS estimates.Synopsys remains a buy but the upside is curtailed due to lower cash flow guidance.Consequently, price target is reduced to $51. One-time cash outflow was not anticipated in the initiation report.","Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), an electronic design automation company, recently reported results for the fourth-quarter of its fiscal 2014. Revenue increased 7% year-over year to $539 million, missing analysts' consensus by $2.85 million. However, full-year revenue of $2.057 billion is almost in line with Wall Street's expectations. Non-GAAP EPS increased 14% year-over-year to $0.64, beating consensus estimates as analysts were modeling for EPS of $0.61. Full-year EPS, $2.53, came ahead of consensus of $2.50. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $173 million and Synopsys ended the quarter with $985.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the company is guiding for revenue of $535 million-$545 million, which is well above the analysts' consensus of $518.4 million. EPS is expected to be around $0.61-$0.63 mostly above Wall Street's expectation of $0.61. More importantly, management expects cash flow from operations to be $450 million, down 18% year-over-year, for the full year of fiscal 2015. This calls for an adjustment to the price target of the company. Anyhow, the stock is up 0.05% in the after-hours.Revenue growth primarily derived from IP and software solution segment, which registered 28.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. Note that Synopsys is trying to increase its exposure in IP licensing in order to sustain growth. The company offers IP for SoC designs to reduce customers' design risk and time-to-market. Anyhow, core EDA registered a nominal 2% year-over-year growth during the quarter. EPS growth was supported by the combination of revenue growth and decline in the cost of licensing revenue. ""Cost of revenue - License"" declined 4.6%. But, the most important figure revealed in the press release was cash flow guidance for the next year. Operating cash flow is expected to shrink, thanks to expected one-time disbursement of $35 million and higher cash taxes during 2015. Consequently, the price target should be cut on the basis of this development.Synopsys remains a buy amid new EDA products that will drive multi-year product upgrade cycle, thanks to FinFET and beyond. Moreover, IP licensing holds promise as Synopsys is the #2 IP provider after ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH). Further, acquisition of Coverity expands Synopsys' total addressable market through software testing offerings.

The deal price appears to be reasonable in the fast-growing global application security market.Burlington, Massachusetts-based Black Duck was founded in 2003 to improve security for open source software installations.Management is headed by CEO Lou Shipley, who has been with the firm since 2013 and was previously CEO of VMTurbo.Below is an overview video of Black Duck’s Hub system:(Source: BlackDuckSoftware)Black Duck’s primary offerings include:Black Duck investors funded over $75 million since 2004 and featured a large syndicate of institutional and strategic investors.According to a 2017 market research report by Gartner, global spending on IT security will reach $86.4 billion in 2017, a 7% increase vs. 2016.The main drivers of this expected growth will be security testing, DevOps, security services from IT outsourcing, consulting and implementation services.Additionally, the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) 'will also have a global effect since multinationals will also need to adhere to the new law.'Notably, the report describes the transition toward bundling of managed security services with broader IT outsourcing projects.In the Asia Pacific region, the report said that by 2021, over 80% of large Chinese businesses will use network security hardware from a local vendor, requiring software to be compatible with the local hardware, likely favoring Chinese security software firms.Synopsys is paying $548 million net of cash for Black Duck, which it expects to contribute $55-$60 million in fiscal 2018 (July 31) revenue.Black Duck generated trailing twelve months' revenue of approximately $76 million, and Synopsys is, therefore, paying a Price/Sales multiple of 7.2x, a not unreasonable multiple given forecasted growth of the global IT security market.As of July 31, 2017, Synopsys had $1.3 billion in cash and short-term equivalents, so appears to have ample resources to pay for the deal without undue hardship or taking on debt.Management expects Black Duck to be dilutive by 12 cents to 2018 non-GAAP EPS. GAAP effects are likely worse.The combination of Black Duck stands to both broaden Synopsys’ product offerings and expand its customer reach by giving it a significant open source system.As Andreas Kuehlmann, SVP and GM of Synopsys Software Integrity Group, stated in the deal announcement:Synopsys is acquiring Black Duck because it enables businesses to identify security and compliance issues earlier in the development process, reducing costly mistakes and re-development.Although the transaction was likely valued on a strategic rather than revenue accretion basis, the deal appears to be fairly valued and should pay dividends for Synopsys over the medium term as it integrates the technology into its offerings.Special note: Readers who like my IPO analyses and related articles on fast-growing technology companies should be on the lookout for my new Seeking Alpha Marketplace service, ‘IPO Edge.’ It will provide in-depth analyses and ratings of upcoming IPOs, ways to invest, post-IPO activity, industry & macro trends, and expert interviews.

As expected, the company posted decent results beating both the revenue and EPS estimates for the quarter. Although earning guidance for the fourth-quarter is weak, full year guidance is in line with analysts' estimates.The company posted revenue of $521.8 million as compared to $482.9 million on a year-over-year basis. This translates to a growth factor of 8.05%. Segment revenue is as follows:Source: Financial Disclosure Supplement Third Quarter Fiscal 2014EDA grew by 7.2% while semiconductor IP segment posted growth of around 16% on a year-over-year basis. Semiconductor IP growth reflects that the company is taking interest in IP lately. This is a positive factor as semiconductor IP is set to grow, thanks to proliferation of portable devices. Anyhow, the management expects low to mid single digit organic growth in EDA on a multi year basis. As far as EPS is concerned, the company posted EPS of $0.65 as compared to consensus estimate of $0.60, consistent with our initial thesis i.e. growth of valuation amid strong and consistent quarterly performance going forward. The company posted earnings-growth of around 18% on a year-over-year basis.Source: Financial Disclosure Supplement Third Quarter Fiscal 2014As far as design is concerned, small dimensions (node-shrinkage) will continue to drive growth of EDA. Management mentioned in prepared remarks that Synopsys is tracking 150 FinFET design tapeouts worldwide, and the company is integral to more than 95% of them. It is worth mentioning here that Synopsys announced broad foundry support for Intel's 14nm Tri-Gate platform in this quarter. So, node shrinkage is expected to be fruitful for the company in future. Furthermore, the new EDA IC Compiler II is gaining traction. Earnings remarks mention that this tool delivers 10X improvement in throughput. A very important customer of the company reported that difficult placement and clock optimization runtime is reduced to six and a half hours by IC Compiler II as compared to 45 hours previously. Hence, Synopsys' offerings seem to be differentiated in EDA industry. On semiconductor IP front, the company is gaining significant traction in USB 3.0 as 100 million Synopsys-powered chips have already been shipped (according to earning transcript). IP acceleration program that includes complete set of models, FPGA, prototypes etc. has been witnessing strong customer reception according to the management. Moreover, Coverity acquisition will be accretive to earnings in 2016.The full year guidance of Synopsys is almost in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue will be in the range of $2.055-$2.065 billion and non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $2.48-$2.50.Source: Earnings press release and ReutersTakeaway All in all, Synopsys is set to grow amid favorable EDA market, growth of semiconductor IP, and product differentiation.

2443665,25120,2014-08-22T02:38:35-04:00,"Synopsys posts solid third quarter results, issuing a cautious guidance for the current final quarter.The company makes great products and has a bright future ahead.Despite this, the long term value creation track record is rather average.Given the already premium valuation I am cautious on the share prospects although I will add shares to my watchlist if a potential dip might occur.","Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) reported its third quarter results this week. Before I discuss the numbers and the latest trends, let's first introduce the company as it is relatively unknown.Despite the great business which Synopsys runs, I doubt whether this translates into a great investment opportunity at this moment, making me cautious and refrains me from investing at this moment.A Relatively Unknown PlayerSynopsys is not a household name, so for those of you being unfamiliar with the business here is a quick overview.The company is a player in the market for Electronic Design Automation which in turn is used to design chips. At the same time, it provides intellectual property which are used for the same purpose as well. These core competencies make the company a direct or indirect supplier of products used by the world's leading semiconductor businesses.For a long time the business relied on personal computers but the mobile and internet revolution is revolutionizing the potential applications of the technologies. Smartphones have been driving growth in recent years with data, cloud, the internet of things and other new technologies resulting in accelerating demand going forward.With these applications demanding greater energy and performance, developing these chips is costly and time-consuming. Synopsys states that new developments can take up to 2 years and can cost some $200 million, which is exactly the area in which the company comes into play. The company is the first to design 16/14 nm designs used by Samsung and Globalfoundries, among others.Nearly two thirds of revenues are being generated from the core EDA business, roughly a quarter from intellectual property solutions and the remainder from other businesses.Third Quarter ResultsSynopsys posted third quarter sales of $521.8 million, a 8.0% increase compared to the year before. Revenues were in line with consensus estimates at $521 million.Reported earnings rose by 25.5% to $65.7 million at the same time. As a result GAAP earnings jumped by 9 cents on a diluted basis to $0.42 per share. Non-GAAP earnings were up by 10 cents to $0.65 per share, beating consensus estimates by five cents per share.Looking At The Results..Synopsys provides very high quality services which are in great demand by investors. The already high gross margins expanded by another 180 basis points to 77.8% of sales. Unfortunately net profit margins are nowhere as high as it requires quite some effort to make sure the company holds onto its leading position in the future.To illustrate the focus on the future and the quality of the solutions, R&D is the company's biggest expense at $182.8 million for the quarter. As such R&D expenses make up 35% of total sales over the past quarter, which are simply astonishing ratios.All in all this results in still very nice operating margins, but not nearly as high as some investors might be anticipating after hearing about the very impressive gross margins...And The OutlookFor the current fourth quarter, Synopsys anticipates sales of $537 to $547 million. At the midpoint of that range sales are seen up nearly 4% on a sequential basis, and up roughly 7-8% on an annual basis. Analysts anticipated sales to improve to $547 million for the final quarter.The earnings outlook is a bit disappointing as well with GAAP earnings seen between $0.32 and $0.38 per share, as non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.59 and $0.61 per share. This implies a decline on a sequential basis as analysts anticipated non-GAAP earnings of $0.63 per share.ValuationAt the end of the quarter, Synopsys held some $903 million in cash while having just $82 million in debt outstanding. This results in a very healthy balance sheet containing roughly $820 million in net cash.With 157 million shares outstanding, and those shares currently trading at $39 per share, equity in the business is valued at $6.1 billion. This values operating assets at about $5.3 billion.Consequently, operating assets are valued at 2.6 times anticipated annual sales of around $2.06 billion and 21-22 times forecasted GAAP earnings.A History Of Growth Combined With Solid ProspectsOver the past decade Synopsys has roughly doubled its sales while it has improved its profitability significantly to about $250 million per annum at the moment. While sales which doubled looks very impressive, this implies average annual revenue growth of 7-8%.Important to consider for investors in light of this growth is the fact that the company held the outstanding share base rather stable, as it offset share-based compensation expenses, while bolstering the balance sheet.Of course, the company made numerous smaller and larger deals to aid growth in the process including the $334 million acquisition of Coverity which closed earlier this year.The contribution of this deal to current operations is still very much limited, with this particular deal only adding $20-$25 million to 2014's anticipated annual revenues.Final TakeawayBefore we get too excited about Synopsys, it is important to recognize that the company has been around for a very long time. Despite the reported growth and profits, long-term investors have seen very modest returns.Between 1995 and 2012, shares have traded in a $15-$30 trading range, before breaking out towards current highs at $40 per share. Recent organic growth, the Coverity acquisition which provides an entry into the software quality and security market, as well as general strong market conditions have lifted shares.Yet these returns have hardly been great to very long-term investors who have not seen dividends in the meantime. The more predictable current growth and current backlog of $3 billion at the end of 2013 have been comforting factors for investors however, especially as these orders are non-cancellable.While I believe the solutions are in great demand and the company commences high margins, the company continues to pour in great amounts of R&D expenses to remain relevant in the future and grow the business. Annual R&D expenses amount to roughly 3 times annual earnings, which is very high! While I generally like investments in R&D, the levels are quite leaving me wondering about the productivity to some extent.In that light, the current earnings valuation multiple in the low twenties is probably fair after backing out the cash holdings. A 20% premium versus the market is justifiable given the solid pace of historical growth and stable anticipated growth going forward. That being said, I miss the real appeal at the moment also given the relatively timid fourth quarter earnings outlook."
2554345,80135,2014-10-10T16:04:16-04:00,Active collaboration from foundries and designers signifies competitive strength of Synopsys.Acquisition of Coverity harmonizes with Synopsys’ business and consequently total addressable market is expanded.Synopsys stays a strong buy amid these developments.,"Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is an electronic design automation company providing tools for semiconductor chip-design and verification. Along with EDA, Synopsys also provides semiconductor IP including pre-designed chips. The company generates more than 50% of its revenue from EDA. Semiconductor IP, or SIP, segment contributed 25% towards the revenue during the fiscal year 2013. I initiated coverage with a strong buy rating due to the future growth of EDA and SIP, thanks to increasing node complexity and costs beyond 28nm. Further, design related activity in emerging markets and anticipated profusion of wearable technology along with embedded systems and increasing electronic component in cars make the buy thesis even more attractive. Anyhow, this piece an update on recent developments related to Synopsys. There is quite a healthy amount of collaboration going on with semiconductor foundries and chip designers.Recent developmentsSynopsys and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) signed a multi-year agreement that gives AMD access to Synopsys' design IP including interface, memory compiler and logic library etc. for FinFET process nodes. In return, Synopsys acquired rights to AMD's interface and foundation IP. Synopsys is also hiring a team of engineers from AMD with IP R&D expertise. Synopsys will help AMD in gaining cost efficiencies. AMD can focus on its primary designs while leveraging Synopsys expertise for complementary IP designs. The benefit for Synopsys is that it is a sticky subscription based business, and Synopsys will also gain additional semiconductor expertise from AMD R&D engineers.Synopsys and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) are collaborating to accelerate custom design productivity for 16FF+ process. According to the press release, the expanded custom reference flow adds new technologies to the schematic and layout environment to streamline and accelerate custom design for TSMC's 16FF+ process. Earlier in September, Synopsys' tools achieved certification for 16nm FinFET+ from TSMC and TSMC further extended its collaboration with Synopsys to 10nm process. According to Suk Lee, TSMC senior director, Design Infrastructure Marketing Division, ""Jointly, Synopsys and TSMC are addressing our customers' needs to deliver highly optimized design solutions for N10FF and N16FF+ process geometries."" TSMC also selected Synopsys as ""Partner of the Year"" for interface IP and joint development of 16nm design infrastructure. This is the fifth consecutive year Synopsys has received IP and EDA award from TSMC. Synopsys is winning new business with the leading foundry. This will give rise to stable subscription based revenue going-forward. Repeated use of Synopsys' expertise by foundries indicates that offerings of Synopsys are differentiated and the company's claim of being No. 1 EDA player is not refutable.Synopsys and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) are expanding collaboration to improve quality of results, or QoR, for ARMv8-A and ARMv7-A cores. Multi-year subscription agreement also gives Synopsys pre-production access to ARM cortex processors for the ARMv8-A, ARMv7-A, ARM Mali GPUs and ARM CoreLink system IP etc. This agreement allows Synopsys to further optimize its design flows for ARM based SoCs. And we all know that massive designing is happening using ARM architecture. ARM based processors are also being developed for embedded solutions and wearables. Designers will want to use Synopsys' tools given the complexity of designing small chips.HiSilicon, a chipset solution provider for telecom network, wireless terminal and digital media, has chosen Synopsys' PrimeTime ADV product for timing closure accelerating time to the market.Cavium, a designer of high performance processors, standardized on Synopsys' IC Compiler for high performance SoC designs. Generally speaking, Synopsys is locking into new contract with numerous players that could result in stable and predictable revenue due to subscription based nature of the contracts.Feedback about Synopsys' tools is also reassuring. Fujitsu semiconductors achieved over 30% reduction in leakage power consumption while maintaining performance of its application processor for imaging. ""We are pleased that we achieved the goals by the combination of our low power methodology and taking advantage of power-saving techniques and seamless UPF support in the Galaxy Design Platform."", says Tom Miyake, corporate vice president and executive vice president of System LSI Company at Fujitsu Semiconductor.Furthermore, Elmos Semiconductors is reporting a 10% reduction in gate count with Synopsys' design compiler. KYOCERA Document Solutions are referring to 10% smaller area. Synopsys claims that new area optimization engine is resulting in area and power improvements while preserving timing results.Synopsys' verification continuum seems promising. The company claims that the verification solution will increase the time to market by months. The press release mentions that the emulation compile time is increased by 3X. Alex Starr, fellow & pre-silicon solutions architect at AMD says, ""Our initial evaluation of the technology indicates it can accelerate design schedules with a more efficient and scalable platform optimized for complex SoC verification and early software bring-up.""Highlights from recent investor meetingFinal thoughtsEDA and semiconductor IP industry is set to grow. Recent collaborations of Synopsys with leading foundries and designers indicate that the company is offering differentiated solutions. User feedback points toward the same. In my view, Synopsys remains a strong buy due to its differentiated offerings, industry growth and expanded TAM via acquisition of Coverity.For the detailed write-up and valuation see ""Synopsys: 50% Upside In Sight"""
4014666,98236,2016-10-26T14:07:15-04:00,Synopsys is a software company that has been a category leader in electronic design for many years.The company has a business model that is primarily subscription-based.The company has had a business cycle that has been tied to the fortunes of its semi-conductor customers.There are signs that the company is seeing a revenue inflection with growth accelerating this year despite a relatively poor environment for semi-conductor vendors.Synopsys shares have been strong performers this year but the increase in business performance more than supports the valuation. There should be runway ahead into fiscal 2017.,"Tales of the IoT and much else besidesI get suggestions about articles to write from many sources. Readers, clients, friends. I have been asked on several occasions what is my favorite way to play the Internet of Things ((IoT)) The IoT is a very broad category and there are few tech companies who don't have some kind of solution that they are selling or are developing. As is the case for most of these hyped spaces, it can seem at times as though there are as many reports as there are objects to connect. A recent report sizes the market at $600 billion + by 2021 and talks about 30 billion sensors within connected devices. Whatever the number is, it is very large. The CAGR of the space is supposed to be 30% through the early 2020s.I think that the precise number is less important to investors who are more concerned about figuring out winners in the space that haven't yet appreciated beyond any realistic valuation. At the end of the day, the fact is that like it or not, almost all discrete devices are going to have some kind of sensor that is connected to some kind of data source to enhance its capabilities. In some cases, think streetlamps or traffic signals, the change in functionality is massive and of high value. In other cases, at least for now, the change in functionality is annoying, think toasters or garage doors. And some kinds of things like TVs are in-between - at least to this writer.Have investors decided that the IoT is for real? I am not too sure although I am sure that almost every tech company worthy of the name has decided it needs to participate in the space. Many people, myself included, have written about what are believed to be IoT plays. PTC (NASDAQ:PTC), LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) and Silver Spring (NYSE:SSNI) are all companies that have significant activities in the space that will produce varying amounts of revenue at various points in the next few years. Self-evidently, almost everything SSNI does can be called IoT; it will be a few years yet before either PTC or LOGM really have robust revenue streams from IoT solutions. It is very hard to ignore autonomous driving as part of the IoT.The autonomous vehicle is seen by many as the ultimate ""thing"" that will be connected to a network as autonomous technologies become pervasive. Even at this writing, 40% of the value of a passenger car is made up of semi-conductors and software and that proportion has been growing significantly for the past several years. (Some research reports include the value of the non-automotive technology in vehicles as part of their estimates of the IoT market size and that is one reason why the number may seem elevated to some.)One company that is often ignored in the discussion Of IoT beneficiaries is Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). Synopsys is neither a new company nor a particularly small one. It is the leading company in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field and was founded by David Gregory and Aart de Geus in 1986. Dr. De Geus continues to be the company's CEO. As these things go, Synopsys has enjoyed moderate growth in revenues in recent years, mid-to-high single digits with non-GAAP earnings per share following a similar path to that of revenues. Revenues are expected to modestly exceed $2.4 billion this year. CFFO has shown less growth over the period, rising from $497 million in fiscal 2013 to a projected level of $535 million this year. This year, however, cash flow growth has been very strong.The fact is that the growth of the IoT has been a force in decoupling the outlook for Synopsys from that for the overall semi-conductor market. The design of semi-conductors takes longer, is more complex and costs more and these trends have finally (apparently) started to show up in Synopsys financials, which are showing consistent improvement even during a difficult year for the semi industry as a whole. Are the fortunes of Synopsys completely correlated with the growth of the IoT? Self-evidently, that isn't the case. Is the correlation increasing and will that improve the Synopsys business model over time? That is essentially the theme of this article.The company's shares have shown strong performance this year, up almost 31% and are trading at an all-time high near $60/share. The company, even in the wake of its current share price performance, has a reasonable set of valuation parameters - reasonable but not deep value. At the moment, and using company guidance for revenues and using an enterprise value that calculates to be $8.1 billion, the EV/S is 3.3X expectations for the fiscal year that ends in a few days and about 3.1X for the new fiscal year. The P/E, again using company guidance is 19.1 and based on management commentary regarding high-single digit EPS growth, the P/E for the new fiscal year would calculate is 18X. This company mercifully forecasts its free cash flow and its expectations at the midpoint are for $535 million for the current fiscal year. That performance would produce a free cash flow yield of 6.6%.Free cash flow growth has been constrained relative to the growth in earnings until recently. This year, through nine months, CFFO increased by 28%. Much of that improvement came from better management of A/Rs, which declined by $77 million compared to a $17 million decline in the prior period and better management of other balance sheet components as well. Since capex declined by 29% in the first nine months of the year, free cash flow increased by 42% overall. That level of percentage growth is clearly not a sustainable performance - it is hard to reduce DSO year after year.During the conference call, the CFO Trac Pham implied that 2017 is likely to see somewhat stronger growth than the company had heretofore expected based on the success of some of the company's specific product offerings. In fact, he told analysts not to change their models until after the November analyst day, implying that they will need to do so at that point. Based on that commentary, I think it is reasonable to expect that free cash flow will increase low double digits in fiscal '17, which would bring the company's free cash flow yield to 7.3%. I think free cash flow yield of 7.3% for a company that is has a leadership position in its space, does present a very reasonable valuation. One of my votes for a way in which investors can benefit from the growth of the Internet of Things would be through taking a position in Synopsys shares.So Just who is this stealth company?As mentioned earlier in this article, Synopsys is the leading provider of Electronic Design Automation software. The software that Synopsis develops is used to design chips that are used in a wide variety of applications.The company has a business model that it mainly based on what they describe as time-based revenue - really subscriptions with a three-year average annual contract duration. The company had a $3.6 billion non-cancellable backlog at the start of this fiscal year and 80% of the revenue forecast was in hand at this point. Since that time the company has increased its forecast for cash flow, earnings and revenues twice, the latest time when it reported its last fiscal quarter although this is not and is unlikely to be a hyper-growth company. The company only reports the backlog metric once a year so quarterly derived bookings can't be calculated but comment during the call suggested to this participant that bookings growth is likely to exceed revenue growth and that the overall backlog is likely to rise some beyond $3.6 billion.The share price performance thus far this year has been correlated to the improvements in estimates over the period; it is reasonable to believe that further significant share price improvement will require further upward estimate revisions and those might happen in November. In addition, many observers consistently forecast that Synopsis is going to achieve the same margin profile as competitor Cadence (NASDAQ:CDNS), which is 30% smaller than Synopsis and certainly not taking share. I think the company will continue to outspend its smaller rival on research and development and that it does not have an aspirational goal to bring non-GAAP operating margins beyond the mid-20% range.There are two other major-named competitors in the market, Cadence Design and Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT). SNPS is quite bit larger than either of its two competitors, and also has notionally better valuation metrics and a comparable organic growth rate. But the company's largest competitor has been and will remain semi-conductor designers who use their own tools and don't buy third-party solutions. I don't think it is really possible to rate Synopsys as better or worse than its two major competitors. Most of the comments that I have seen describe the fact that each of the three has products in which they have unique capabilities. Synopsis is described on some sites as dominating such areas as digital flow, design compilers, and IC compilers. Cadence has different strengths and is claimed to be the leader in the analog area while Mentor has compelling options in layout extraction.Synopsys is in a variety of spaces of which the EDA market is the company's core, accounting for about 60% of current revenue. Another space is described as Application Security Testing and in that space, it ranks 5th of the vendors rated by Gartner behind both HP (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). The software integrity space has a TAM of $2.4 billion and a growth rate of about 20%. Synopsys sees this as a key component of its revenue growth story in the future and is making substantial investments to improve it solution set and market positioning. The final component of revenue includes outsourced IP where the TAM is $3.2 billion. The company does sell hardware, which allows it to simulate and emulate designs and that business has exceeded expectations and has become a significant demand growth driver.Overall, the company's strategy is pretty simple and pretty obvious. It needs to maintain its leadership in core EDA. It needs to develop more differentiation in IP and in systems and it must move up the MQ recognition criteria in quality and security. The company has always had a focus on technology (as commented below, it probably has the highest research and development spend ratio of any other company of its scale) and it probably needs to have more of a focus on marketing if it is going to have a chance of improving its competitive positioning.The space in which Synopsys plays has its own vocabulary that talks about trends and solutions in a fashion that is probably not totally comprehensible by many readers. I don't propose to provide definitions for things such as FinFET or TCAD. Indeed, I am not so sure I would do a decent job in defining all of the acronyms and product abbreviation myself. Sometimes company's seeking to enlighten and provide transparency can confuse investors and this is clearly such an occasion. My interest is Synopsys as a stock and not as a fountain of technology.What is more significant is the growth in the number of sensors that are being shipped which need specialized chips. The growth in sensors of more than 20% to 30 billion is one of the demand drivers for Synopsys software. The ""siliconization"" of vehicles to where 40% of the value of an automobile is in its software and semi-conductor content is another such example.In terms of what Synopsis solutions are used for, it is all about complexity and complexity. An advanced design today will take 18-24 months to complete and can cost over $200 million. The complexity has increased exponentially requiring more and more advanced EDA tools. As the complexity, has grown, an increasing amount of IP needs to be imbedded. The adoption of FinFET has led to further design challenges. And new designs feature exponential amounts of complex software, which create significant hardware/software challenges.I am not too sure why all of this doesn't add up to more than high-single digit growth - it seems as though it ought to be the case but that hasn't happened. Synopsis sells to just about all the major semiconductor firms with 20 out of the top 20 as customers. It has one 10% customer but it doesn't have significant levels of customer concentration beyond the fact that the industry to which it sells is concentrated.For a long time, Synopsys business has been thought to be strongly correlated with the specific fortunes of the semi-conductor industry. There have been signs that the correlation is breaking down. The following is part of the prepared remarks by company CEO Aart de Geus, ""In assessing the environment around us, we see continued volatility for semiconductor and system companies, juxtaposed with intense pressure to conceive and deliver the next killer products. While…the forecast for 2016 semiconductor revenue remains sluggish and actually worsened slightly over the past few months. Nevertheless, investments in EDA are robust, and Synopsys is both ideally positioned and executing well…While it's too early to talk about 2017 specifically, given the ongoing semiconductor volatility…I will say that we're optimistic about our business…as we continue a track record of executing well…in challenging markets. ""I think the significant commentary here is that despite the rather difficult business metrics in the semi-conductor space this year, the growth of the company's core technology, EDA has shown a significant growth spurt probably resulting from the trends in the end markets for semi-conductors that are calling for increased complexity and far greater development costs. Faster growth and modest but continued improvements in margins are going to drive positive earnings revisions despite some sluggishness in the semiconductor business.There are many other specific areas of differentiation that this company has built that are perhaps more detailed than might prove necessary to build an investment case. I will mention a few of the ones that seem of greatest interest. For readers who are users of this kind of software, I realize that there is some over-simplification here which is deliberate in the interest of clarity.Products change all the time and what is important today may not be so in a few quarters. As mentioned earlier, IC compilers have been an area of strength for Synopsys. The ICC II was launched in 2014 and continues to lead the market and is said to offer 10X throughput advantages compared to prior software designs. The company maintains that the ICC II has seen the fastest uptake of any product the company has ever offered. It expects that the strength seen in overall EDA revenues is partially a function of the success of the ICC II.Another specific strength of Synopsis is what is called verification. The company has been able to improve the verification process by six months overall and management maintains that the company is gaining in the verification continuum market space.The company also offers what it calls the ZeBu Server (hardware) which is a tool that is used to debug designs and to emulate the performance of what is being designed. Again, these are primarily claims that are hard to validate but the revenue record suggests that the company has enjoyed good success with its latest product in the space.Some Key Financial variablesSynopsys spends a higher ratio of its revenues on research and development than just about any other company of its scale and that percentage has actually risen a little over the last few years. As long as the current CEO remains at his post, I do not think investors should anticipate that the research and development cost ratio will contract from current levels.In the most recent quarter, the company enjoyed again exceeded expectations. The over-attainment was driven by growth in the IT space coupled with above-forecast strength in its prototyping and emulation solutions. The company has seen some moderate market share gains in the security space but it apparently has a long way to go to mount the steps of the Gartner MQ in the security testing space. The company made two small acquisitions in that space this past summer which should help improve the company's completeness of vision in the Gartner survey.All of the following metrics are GAAP in order to best capture the changes in real expenses in the different categories. In the latest reported quarter, the company spent 36% of its revenues on research and development compared to 35.6% in the prior year - and that despite the inability of the company to reach its hiring goals. The other expense ratios showed far better trends with sales and marketing expense at 20.6% of revenues this year as compared to 21% of revenues last year and the general and administrative expense ratio falling to 6.9% from 7.9%. Gross margins also showed favorable trends and rose from 76% to 77%., partially because upfront license fees were a bit stronger in the quarter than had been the case a year ago. In all, operating margins increased from 11% to 12.5%, on a GAAP basis.The non-GAAP net income margin, which excludes amortization of intangibles, a significant expense category for this company, as well as stock-based compensation, rose to 19% in the quarter compared to 18% the prior year. The costs of the acquisition retarded the growth in the operating income ratio this quarter.The company has accrued a significantly greater tax rate this year at 24% of revenues compared to 15% the prior year. The company has spent a very high proportion of its free cash flow on share buy-backs, which are running at 80% of that metric. As a result, the share count has decreased noticeably to 154 million from 158.5 million. Early last month, the company announced that it had reloaded its share repurchase fund and I expect that outstanding shares will continue their decline at visible levels for the foreseeable future.The company is forecasting high-single digit growth in EPS driven by revenue improvement, margin increases and share count reduction. It seems possible that at some point, the forecast might be exceeded although the company has valuation metrics that would support a positive alpha even without double-digit growth in earnings per share.I suppose there are many readers who are reluctant to make commitments in shares that have reached all-time highs. On the other hand, valuation metrics are not extended and the ability that this company has shown to accelerate its growth despite the weakness overall in the semiconductor market might suggest that a new set of valuation metrics might be appropriate. The company's very high backlog and the fact that 80% of its revenues come from the backlog in a given year are items that really seem to have been ignored by investors.Has this company reached a growth rate inflection point? I don't think that might be called as yet. Might it do so as the IoT and smart everythings proliferate. I think that it is a reasonable but unproven potential that would be lagniappe were it to happen. But positive alpha is not going to require that kind of a result. This is a classic GARP investment and investors can look at it in that light."
1062571,25791,2012-12-13T11:46:19-05:00,,"Synopsys Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) reports preliminary financial results for the year ended 2012-10-31.Synopsys Inc. recently reported its preliminary financial results based on which CapitalCube provides a unique peer-based analysis of the company. Our analysis is based on the company's performance over the last twelve months (unless stated otherwise).Synopsys Inc.'s analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: ARM Holdings PLC ADS (NASDAQ:ARMH), Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK), Ansys Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS), Cadence Design Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS), National Instruments Corp. (NASDAQ:NATI) and Mentor Graphics Corp. (NASDAQ:MENT). The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns.Valuation DriversSynopsys Inc.'s current Price/Book of 1.9 is about median in its peer group. The market expects Synopsys Inc. to grow earnings about as fast as the median of its chosen peers (PE of 26.5 compared to peer median of 32.3) but not to expect much improvement in its below peer median rates of return (ROE of 7.9% compared to the peer median ROE of 12.7%).The company employs relatively high amounts of assets (with a turnover of 0.5x compared to peer median of 0.7x) while generating profit margins of 10.4% that are only about median among its chosen peers. Synopsys Inc.'s net margin is its lowest relative to the last five years and compares to a high of 17.2% in 2010.Economic MoatSynopsys Inc.'s revenues have changed in-line with its peers (year-on-year change in revenues is 14.4%) but its earnings have lagged (annual reported earnings have changed by -17.6% compared to the peer median of 18.0%), implying that the company has less control over its costs relative to its peers. Synopsys Inc. is currently converting every 1% of change in revenue into -1.2% change in annual reported earnings.Synopsys Inc.'s return on assets is now less than its peer median (4.9% vs. peer median 7.9%) in contrast to its returns over the past five years which were around the peer median (6.4% vs. peer median 7.0%). Recent performance suggests that the company's historical competitive advantage is slipping away.The company's gross margin of 85.6% is around peer median suggesting that Synopsys Inc.'s operations do not benefit from any differentiating pricing advantage. In addition, Synopsys Inc.'s pre-tax margin of 11.5% is also around the peer median suggesting no operating cost advantage relative to peers.Growth & Investment StrategySynopsys Inc.'s revenues have grown at about the same rate as its peers (9.0% vs. 8.7% respectively for the past three years). Similarly, the stock price implies median long-term growth as its PE ratio is around the peer median of 26.5. The historical performance and long-term growth expectations for the company are largely in sync.Synopsys Inc.'s annualized rate of change in capital of 12.7% over the past three years is around its peer median of 11.4%. This median investment has likewise generated a peer median return on capital of 10.1% averaged over the same three years. This median return on investment implies that company is investing appropriately.Earnings QualitySynopsys Inc.'s net income margin for the last twelve months is around the peer median (10.4% vs. peer median of 10.8%). This average margin and relatively conservative accrual policy (17.3% vs. peer median of 11.3%) suggests possible understatement of its reported net income.Synopsys Inc.'s accruals over the last twelve months are positive suggesting a buildup of reserves. In addition, the level of accrual is greater than the peer median -- which suggests a relatively strong buildup in reserves compared to its peers.Trend ChartsCompany ProfileSynopsys, Inc. provides technology solutions used to develop electronics and electronic systems.

311448,22829,2011-12-02T05:23:06-05:00,,"By Tejas VenkateshAfter sitting out of the market for the first eight months of the  year, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is suddenly on a buying spree. Having snapped up two  smaller players in as many months, the largest electronic design  automation (EDA) player has announced a definitive agreement to buy  Magma Design Automation (NASDAQ:LAVA) for $7.35 per share in cash, representing an  enterprise value of $507m.Size matters in the mature EDA market, and Synopsys claims that the  combined company will be better able to invest more in R&D and  further ‘technology acceleration’ in areas such as mobile chips.  However, there are concerns about whether the deal will pass regulatory  muster, given substantial overlap in product offerings. That explains  the asymmetry in breakup fees – Synopsys will pay $13m more if it fails  to close the acquisition than what Magma would pay if it backs out ($30m  vs. $17m).The deal values Magma at a trailing sales multiple of 3.6, based on  reported revenue of $142m. That’s a handsome valuation compared to the  2.2x multiple that Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT), the next-largest player after Magma,  was offered by Carl Icahn in his unsolicited bid earlier this year.  Synopsys will use existing cash ($230m of which is onshore) and debt to  finance the deal. Qatalyst Partners banked Magma. We’ll have a full  report on this deal in tonight’s Daily 451."
2306995,80135,2014-07-10T19:01:02-04:00,"The electronic design automation (EDA) industry is set to grow. The semiconductor IP industry is also expecting growth.Synopsys is the number one EDA company. It is also branching out into the semiconductor IP industry, and hence it is exposed to the growth of both.It is positioned to capitalize on the growth of emerging markets and the automotive IC industry. IC node-shrinkage brings further benefits.PE and cash flow based valuations reveal an upside of around 50% in the next couple of years.","Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a technology company that belongs to the industry of semiconductor equipment and materials. The company provides electronic design automation, or EDA, software that is used by the designers of integrated circuits; commonly known as chips. The company also provides semiconductor intellectual property, or IP, products. They are pre-designed circuits that can be used by chip makers as a component of a larger chip design. Synopsys also provides related services. The company generated 63% of its revenue from core EDA services in the fiscal year 2013. The semiconductor IP made up around 25% of the revenue. These are the main revenue drivers of the company. Source: Synopsys second quarter fiscal 2014 financial disclosure supplement""BUY"" Thesis rationale Synopsys presents the investor with a unique growth opportunity and minimal downside risk. The EDA industry is growing and the semiconductor IP industry is also growing. Synopsys is extending its operations into semiconductor IP, and hence it is also exposed to the growth of the Semiconductor IP, or SIP, industry alongside EDA. Synopsys is the primary candidate which can capitalize on this growth because it seems to be number one in the industry. Moreover, the cash-flows of Synopsys are overlooked when it comes down to its market valuation. From a technical perspective, the forward P/E ratio of the company is quite decent as compared to its counterparts. All in all, the stock is a buy based on the growth prospects of the industry, the leadership position of Synopsys, and the fact that the cash flows and the P/E also point towards a material upside. So, let's get into the details.Industry prospects and Synopsys There are several factors that will drive the growth of the EDA industry going forward. First, new places, like India and China, are now doing design. Smartphone penetration stands at just around 10% in India. Emerging markets will drive the growth of smartphones in the future. Anyhow, EDA growth is correlated to the growth of new designs in emerging markets because new designs will require EDA tools and services to gain efficiency and power benefits. So, the EDA industry will benefit from emerging markets.Source: IHS Inc.Secondly, the wearable technology and the Internet of Things, or IoT, are on their way to explosive growth. According to IDTechEx, the market for wearable technology, currently around $14 billion, will reach $70 billion by 2024. On a shorter time horizon, IDC believes that unit-shipment of wearable devices will grow to 111.9 million in 2018 as compared to 19 million in 2012. As for IoT see the graph that follows: Source: GartnerThe point of mentioning all these forecasts is that the growth of wearable technology and IoT means more chips, more new designs; small chips, more third party EDA and IP services. Simply put, the growth of EDA is positively correlated to the growth of IoT and wearable technology. Given the size of unit shipments, the opportunity is a massive one for the EDA industry.Finally, semiconductor nodes are shrinking. 14nm products are rolling out. There is a lot of research out there that points out that beyond 28nm cost per transistor flattens, and overall costs of manufacturing at nodes beyond 28nm increase significantly. See ""McKinsey on semiconductors"" issue No.3, autumn 2013. Now, this increases EDA involvement in the design of a chip as more design-focus will be required to reduce the costs. Richard Wawrzyniak, senior market analyst, ASIC and SoC at Semico Research Corporation says,""The ecosystem enablement of advanced process technologies, physical IP and EDA, is necessary for the adoption of new process technology,"" says Ron Moore, vice president of marketing for the Physical Design Group at ARM.All in all, EDA growth goes hand in hand with node shrinkage. On the semiconductor IP front, the industry is set to grow at CAGR of 12.6%, and it will be worth $5.3 billion by 2020.Another growth area for EDA is the automotive industry. The electronic and semiconductor component of vehicles is increasing on a regular basis.Source: PricewaterhouseCoopersThis gives way for electronic design automation in the automotive industry. According to Serge Leef, VP of new ventures and general manager of the System-Level Engineering Division at Mentor Graphics:He further argues that impact of optimizing a car would save $50 on each car, and unlike the current technology of the automotive industry, the EDA industry has algorithms developed that can attack this problem today. With automotive IC industry set to grow at CAGR of 9%, the EDA growth thesis strengthens further.To review, emerging markets, smaller nodes, IoT and the automotive industry will drive the growth of EDA in the coming years. The growth is obvious, but why will Synopsys benefit from this growth? Let's take a lookSynopsys and emerging markets Synopsys is going after emerging markets with its 28nm portfolio of IP. The company recently made two moves that are enough to secure dominating position in emerging markets:28nm is a favorable process technology for emerging markets because of the lower manufacturing costs associated with it. By providing IP portfolio for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) 28nm HPC and Samsung 28nm FD-SOI foundry customers, Synopsys has found a decent entry point in the high growth emerging markets. Emerging market designers are keen on cutting costs and time; availability of a design IP does this job for them. Moreover, both the 28nm HPC and 28nm FD-SOI are highly optimized in the 28nm league and, hence Synopsys is well-positioned to grow in emerging markets.Synopsys and the leading edge process node As we have discovered in the industry prospects segment that node shrinking brings extra opportunity for EDA companies. Therefore collaboration with the leading edge foundries is the key to capitalize on this extra opportunity. Synopsys is exactly doing that.""The combination of Intel's 14-nm Tri-Gate process technology and Synopsys tools, memory and interface IP enables designers to create industry-leading SoCs for their target markets,"" said Ali Farhang, vice president, design and enablement services, Intel custom foundry.""The multiyear collaboration has resulted in silicon-proven solution that can enable Samsung foundry customers to achieve the maximum value from the latest FinFET processes. We will see the revolutionary 14-nm FinFET SoCs in our hands starting early next year."" said Dr. Shawn Han, vice president of foundry marketing, Samsung Electronics.Synopsys is poised to capture the high-margin growth from Intel and Samsung foundry customers because new tools will be required for the leading edge process technology. Designs are also complicated on smaller nodes and so, a lot more EDA work for Synopsys.Synopsys and the automotive industry Source: Synopsys automotive electronics overviewThe company is focusing on the automotive industry. Recent developments indicate that Synopsys has the potential to leave its mark on the automotive industry. The company recently announced the availability of AEON Trim non volatile memory (NVM) IP for high reliability applications. It is up to 75% smaller than alternative NVM solutions. This will reduce the cost and size of high reliability automotive ICs. The company mentions in the press release that, ""faster programming times reduce NVM test times by 3X compared to alternative NVM solutions, enabling designers to reduce production test times and minimize test costs for automotive and industrial ICs.""The company already ships around 500 million DesignWare IP ICs each year. The addition of Aeon Trim will boost the sales further, and it is the door to Synopsys growth in the $40 billion (2017) automotive ICs industry.Synopsys in generalsource: corporate overview Source: Synopsys investor presentation October 2013The company has been shifting its revenue toward semiconductor IP, as revenue from SIP grew by 10.2% in 2013. As third party semiconductor IP usage is set to double through 2017, the shift of business toward SIP bodes well for Synopsys. We all know ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) as the No.1 semiconductor IP company but do we know the company that follows ARMH? See for yourself: Source: semiengineering.comAll in all, Synopsys is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of emerging markets and the adoption of 16nm/14nm process technology in the mature markets. Furthermore, semiconductor IP revenue of the company will also increase as a result of SIP growth.Valuations and the size of opportunity In this section, we will look at the valuation of Synopsys, first using a PE based and then a cash-flow based methodology.PE valuation Synopsys posted consistent growth in EPS in the past few years, and it is expected to remain consistent in the future. Source: Yahoo FinanceSynopsys is trading around a PE TTM of 25 while the industry average is around 31. From a statistical perspective, the company traded around an average PE of 21 during the last five years. Given the growth prospects of the company, and a high industry average of PE, a multiplier in the range of 20-25 seems plausible for Synopsys. Focus Equity estimatesAccording the valuation, the stock has the ability to reach $60 by the end of fiscal 2015. This translates to 54% upside in a timeframe of less than two years.Cash flow based valuation Assumptions: Cash flows can be represented as a percentage of revenue. Growth rate of 7.7% is assumed up until 2019. Zero growth is assumed in perpetuity. It is assumed that CAPEX will increase in line with the historic CAPEX growth of the past few years. It is also assumed that the return on NASDAQ composite reflects the market return, and it is suitable to be incorporated in CAPM. Focus Equity estimatesThe cash flow based valuation also reveals a price target in the proximity of $60 conforming to the PE based PT calculated above.Currently undervalued but the investor's perception will change After reading the thesis above, a question naturally comes to mind: why didn't the market see the opportunity earlier if the stock is undervalued, and what events will change investors' perception resulting in stock appreciation? First, there are several factors that hindered the early identification of this opportunity. Synopsys doesn't have a great depth of coverage. Secondly, the trading volume is not very high and investors try to avoid low volume stocks amid liquidity concerns. But most importantly, I believe that most of investors didn't understand the business model of the company completely and the opportunity went begging.As far as investors' perception is concerned, this piece of research will change the perception of the investor regarding Synopsys. On a serious note though, Synopsys' quarterly results will force the investor to change their perception about the stock. Synopsys is a leader in EDA; it is branching out in semiconductor IP. Both these industries are set to grow. So, there is no reason to believe that Synopsys will not perform consistently in its quarterly results.Verdict Synopsys is a strong buy because of the company's leadership position in EDA. The growth of semiconductor IP will also add to the company's bottom line. Valuations based on conservative estimates reveal that the stock of Synopsys has a growth potential of around 50% in a time span of two years. As far as the downside risk is concerned, there is none other than the systematic risk, if any.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(See conference call transcript here.)RevenueRevenue in the third quarter was $336.9 million, down from $345.2 million last year. Revenue was in line with management's guidance range of $330.0 million to $338.0 million. License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $301.2 million, down from $303.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues were $35.7 million, down from $41.8 million.During the third quarter, more than 90% of revenues came from backlog created at the beginning of the quarter. Apart from this, the company's upfront revenue constituted 4.0% of the total revenue. During the recent downturn, the company had invested in acquisitions and expansion of the total addressable market, which is gradually generating results, although a meaningful growth has yet to be achieved.Operating ResultsTotal gross profit in the third quarter was $270.2 million (80.2% of revenue), down 1.8% from gross profit of $275.1 million (79.7% of revenue) in the year-ago quarter. Gross profit declined as a result of high cost of sales and a decline in revenues. Total operating expense was $219.4 million, up 2.5% from $214.1 million. The year-over-year increase in cost and expense was primarily due to an increase in research and development, as well as a rise in sales and marketing expense. Operating margin was 15.1%, down from 17.7% in the year-ago period.GAAP net income in the third quarter was $39.3 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to $47.4 million, or $0.32 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Including special items like amortization, in-process research and development, acquisition-related costs, facility restructuring charge, and tax benefit from IRS settlement, the non-GAAP net income was $47.8 million, or $0.31 per share, compared with $56.9 million, or $0.39 a year earlier.Balance SheetSynopsys has a strong cash position. On July 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.21 billion, compared to $1.07 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. Total deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $593.9 million, compared with $553.9 million reported in the previous quarter. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) remained flat sequentially at 40 days, reflecting superior quality of the A/R portfolio.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the company expects revenues in the range of $349 million–$357 million. Total GAAP expenses are expected to remain in the range of $291 million–$310 million. On a non-GAAP basis, expenses are expected to be in the range of $267 million–$277 million. The company has projected GAAP earnings per share of $0.21 to $0.27 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 to $0.39.For full-year 2010, the company expects revenues between $1.354 billion and $1.362 billion. Other income and expenses are expected to be in the range of $4.0 million–$7.0 million. The company has projected GAAP EPS of $1.61 to $1.67 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 to $1.60.Synopsys delivered decent numbers in the third quarter results, without any improvement in operating performance. The 2010 guidance does not reflect any meaningful growth. Although Synopsys is gaining traction from new products, acquisitions, and new EDA partnerships, we believe these factors will take some time to produce favorable results.We believe Synopsys' time-based license model has good visibility and the company has a decent cash position.

210127,20568,2010-06-15T09:12:10-04:00,,"recently disclosed that it was moving ahead with the acquisition of technology, engineering resources and other such assets of Synfora, Inc. The company provides C/C++ design technology, which is used to design complex system-on-chips (SoCs) and other such Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).Electronic design automation (“EDA”) software provider and IP service provider Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)Synopsis did not disclose the financial details of the acquisition but said that it expects the acquisition to strengthen its position in the FPGA-based prototyping solutions business. By using Synfora's technology, designers will be able to manufacture better ICs. In short, the acquisition will enhance Synopsys’ technical efficiency and augment its product and service portfolio. The company seems to be on an acquisition spree, as it is also acquiring a rival company Virage Logic Corporation, in a deal worth $315.0 million. This acquisition is expected to help Synopsys enhance its comprehensive set of software offerings, since the acquisition would provide Synopsys access to the technical expertise of the competitor company, with the option to utilize its customer base.This apart, Synopsys provides customers with increased hardware efficiency, enabling significant reductions in both CPU memory consumption and manufacturing turnaround time. Synopsys has extended its multi-core capability to VCS functional verification, which resulted in doubling the speed. VCS functional verification is a technology that allows designers to de-bug quickly and easily, significantly improving the quality of the most complex designs. As this multi-core technology is used in many of the advanced chips in the world, a speed-up of this magnitude has a major positive impact as customers are able to reduce expenses for costly computer hardware.On the other hand, Synopsys delivered mediocre second-quarter results, without any improvement in operating performance. The 2010 guidance does not reflect any meaningful growth. Although Synopsys is gaining traction from new products, recent acquisitions, and new EDA partnerships, we believe these will take some time to produce favorable results.We believe Synopsys’ time-based license model has good visibility and the company has a decent cash position.

This apart, the company is facing customer concentration risk.We currently have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the shares."
179124,20504,2009-12-21T05:00:36-05:00,,"Last week's Swing Trading Signals included an interesting mid-cap tech company. The company is Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS).Why do I question whether it can rise from the dead? Take a look at this chart:You can see that the stock got slammed in early December and was left for dead. The sell-off was induced by an earnings report where the company announced lower quarterly profit and sales as well as higher expenses.On Friday, the stock opened with an upside gap and at the time of writing was holding its gains.Company Background --Synopsys, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide electronic design automation (EDA) software and related services for semiconductor design companies in the United States, Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific. The software provides design and verification, optimization, simulation and timing analysis capabilities. The company supports both digital and analog chip design and provides professional services.Synopsys, a $3 billion company, is a clear market leader in the EDA field. The following chart compares by revenue Synpsys to its competitors:Financial Background --The company is not cheap but neither is it especially expensive. Value indicators are at moderate levels with a PEG of 1.4, price-to-sales at 2.26 and an Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio a little over 6.The company is cash flow positive and has no debt. The following chart shows revenue, net income and net margin over the last five quarters.As you can see, revenues sagged during the worst of the downturn but are making a comeback. The best you can say about net income, however, is that it has been stuck in neutral for the last few quarters. Margins have declined recently, as well. Even as the semiconductor industry has been picking up in the last quarter or two, Synopsys and the EDA sector in general have continued to struggle.The Outlook --Truth be told, Synopsys didn't do a bad job during the economic downturn, remaining profitable and comfortably in a leadership position in their industry.At the time of their last earnings report, Synopsys predicted for fiscal 2010 a profit of $1.01 to $1.20 per share, or $1.52 to $1.62 per share when excluding items, and revenue of $1.33 billion to $1.35 billion, essentially flat with the previous year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share on $1.37 billion in revenue.The fact that the company's earnings are lagging those of the chip manufacturers is not surprising. Before EDA vendors or semiconductor equipment manufacturers can see significant growth return, the chip manufacturers need to begin to exhibit stronger demand. Providing we don't see a double-dip next year, that demand should return and companies like Synopsys should be able to return to growth.As for Friday's move? I would be stunned to think that my simple site caused the buying so I am assuming that somewhere there is an analyst who upgraded the stock. Or perhaps management pre-announced better than expected earnings as we near the end of this quarter.In either case, the news has not been picked up by Google yet. Nevertheless, one could make an argument that decent growth in 2010 would mean the stock is cheap today. And technically, it appears the downdraft in the stock price has been arrested at the 200-day moving average so maybe it's just ripe for a swing trade.Disclosure: no positions"
80018,20521,2008-06-05T05:45:57-04:00,,"In continuation with the my EDA industry review of Magma (NASDAQ:LAVA) on Monday, here is the Q2 analysis for Synopsys’ (NASDAQ:SNPS) results that were announced last month. Synopsys, the second major player in the EDA industry announced revenues of $324.6 million. The company exceeded the market’s expectations of $321.3 million and recorded an impressive 11% growth over the year. Its EPS also grew by 17% to reach $0.41, which is much higher than the market’s expectations of $0.38.Up front revenue contributed 4% to the total revenue and the balance 96% was backlog revenue.Going forward, the company expects Q3 revenue to be $335-$343 million with EPS of $0.38 - $0.40. For the year, revenue is expected to grow by 9.5%-10.5% to be $1325 - $1340 million with EPS of $1.60 - $1.64.During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.8 million shares of stock worth $87 million.While the rest of the industry has been facing economic pressures, the Synopsys management continues to be optimistic about the economy. They feel that the demand for electronics is continuing to grow. Also, the growing pressure is pushing the industry into innovations to help get a bigger market share. [Yes, but see my analysis below on design starts, which is cause for woes for Synopsys.]During the quarter, the company did its share of innovating. It has made progress in the use of multi-core multi-thread computation which it claims will result in substantial speed-ups, such as a 2x performance boost using dual cores. The company launched Eclypse, a comprehensive suite of low power system level verification technology.However, its biggest move for the quarter was the acquisition of Synplicity for a cash transaction of $181 million. The acquisition is expected to generate $20 million in revenue for the year with EPS of $0.02 - $0.03. Synplicity is a strong technology leader in FPGA designs and hardware-based rapid prototyping.The FPGA market is rapidly adopting the most advanced design nodes. Adding Synopsys’ IP position and verification tools to FPGAs will also make the market all the more attractive. In addition, Synplicity has built a very interesting rapid prototyping verification business which aids interaction between hardware and software which would help improve productivity and predictability.The stock reacted positively to the results and after having slipped a couple of cents is now trading at $26.35 levels, which is 7% higher than before announcement of the results.The problem lies not so much with Synopsys as with the industry and the overall market. In fact, of the lot in EDA, Synopsys seems to be executing the best.EDA’s growth is based on Design Starts, and not the volume of IC shipped. While the IC shipped number has been growing at gangbuster rates with the surge in consumer electronics in particular, and the permeation of electronics into pretty much all aspects of our lives in general, design starts have not really grown at a comparable speed. In fact, the irony is that IC and system vendors are trying hard to make fewer designs become hit products, thereby controlling the cost of IC design that has sky-rocketed.I have written much earlier about the EDA industry and its woes. (Read: Future of EDA, Addendum) and the growing concerns with Synopsys’ chief rival Cadence (Read: Cadence Crashes, Now What? all of which point to the lack of leadership  in the EDA industry.I maintain that until the value erosion concerns are sorted, none of these companies – despite their good results is worth investing in. The only sign of a company trying to address the value erosion issue that I have seen so far is from a small company called BlazeDFM, that is tackling parametric yield loss due to power.Disclosure: None"

29206,20278,2007-03-11T15:29:42-04:00,,"Annotated article summary from this weekend's Barron's; receive all our Barron's summaries by signing up here: Designing New Profits by Leslie P. Norton Summary: Synopsys Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is second to Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) in automated chip design, and dominates the digital chip design market. In Aug. 2003 Barron's called it ""one of the best technology stocks you've never heard of;"" it jumped 17% in six months. But after operating margins fell from almost 30% to 10% and bookings dropped, share prices plummeted almost 60%. Much of that was due to an accounting change, and its present accounting methods make an earnings miss risk almost nil; its order backlog is $2 billion. And with current operating margins of 18% vs. Cadence's 30%, big institutional investors are correct on insisting Synopsis still has huge growth potential. Chip industry revenues have now returned to pre-2001 slump levels as strong chip sales are driven by the demand for video. In February Synopsis made $0.16 a share, beating analyst estimates. For 2007 (ending in October) it forecasts $1.23-1.31/share, up from last year's $0.77. It says it wants to boost margins to ""the mid-to-high 20s"" in the coming years. Shares could be worth 25% to 40% more than their current $25.15; Vishal Saluja of JW Seligman thinks the stock will find its way to $36.

58473,20521,2007-12-27T09:46:50-05:00,,"In our EDA review, Synopsys (Nasdaq: SNPS) is the second major player, and is always going neck-to-neck with Cadence. Synopsys announced Q4 earnings on December 6, 2007. Unlike the losses posted by competitor Mentor (NASDAQ:MENT), Synopsys executives were quite pleased with the company's results, and momentum throughout the year which enabled Synopsys to meet or exceed all of its original 2007 targets. Q4 revenues increased 11.2% to $315.2 million, and annual revenues grew 11% to $1.212 billion. Additionally, expenses were $277.4 million, which is only a 3% increase. Much of this cost control was achieved by sending work offshore and shifting one-third of its employee base to lower cost geographies. The company is currently sitting on $433.5 million in cash. Synopsys also announced guidance for 2008 Q1 with revenue expected to be between $308-316 million, and expenses are expected to be between $262-278 million. Net income is expected to be between $0.20 - $0.28 per share. However, it did state that the company expects 90% of the quarter’s revenue to come from backlog, which then leaves the outstanding question of whether the company will be able to replenish the pipeline for the remainder of 2008. For all of 2008, Synopsys expects revenue between $1.3 billion and $1.315 billion. As we discussed in the Cadence piece, these multi-year, all-you-can-eat contracts that are becoming the industry norm, are great for revenue predictability via backlogs, but they seem to be at the cost of the future. Synopsys has 146.4 million shares outstanding with a market cap of $3.75 billion, and a 52-week price range of $22 to $29/share. Currently priced at $26/share, and with a projected growth of 10% per year for the next few years, on paper, Synopsys appears to be healthy. The problem with SNPS as an investment is that the industry structure is broken, and the overall market shows very little momentum. EDA’s growth is based on Design Starts, not volume of IC shipped. While the IC shipped number has been growing at gangbuster rates with the surge in consumer electronics in particular, and the permeation of electronics into pretty much all aspects of our lives in general, design starts have not really grown at a comparable speed. In fact, the irony is that IC and system vendors are trying hard to make fewer designs become hit products, thereby controlling the cost of IC design that has sky-rocketed. All this bodes very badly for the EDA industry, and just as I have advised my readers not to invest in the online DVD rental business, I will advise you now to stay away from EDA as an investment category. As it stands, there is no money to make in these stocks. What is also immensely frustrating is that there is hardly any thought leadership from the leaders of the industry to adjust its dynamics. Change, it seems, comes slowly to an industry that once rose high on the wings of rapid and abundant innovation. It is a shame, since EDA is such a critical part of the IC Design value chain!"

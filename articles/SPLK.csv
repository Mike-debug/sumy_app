Before the session, Splunk was already doing a great job at communicating its evolving cloud strategy in the face of growing innovation from competitors. The session highlighted Splunk's progress towards achieving its cloud migration strategy. Splunk introduced a couple of innovative offerings during the session, provided a roadmap for its cloud migration, and highlighted the impact of the migration on its financials. Splunk also shared its long-term financial projections. This article explores the new capabilities and the implication of its improved go-to-market strategy and long-term financial forecasts.Splunk is an enterprise software platform that provides cloud and on-prem solutions for IT teams. The vision for its data-to-everything platform is to provide solutions that meet the data needs of its customers. This vision explains its recent expansion into the security operations and observability verticals. The goal, I believe, is to help customers make better use of their data.The growing volume of cyber attacks, data breaches, security regulations, standards, and the fast-evolving threat landscape are some of the trends driving the demand for cybersecurity solutions. Splunk provides solutions that address a wide array of problems in the cybersecurity space, including fraud detection, threat detection, forensics, security operations, security automation, instrumentation, response, and orchestration. At the heart of its security strategy is its cloud SIEM (security information and event management) solution. Splunk's unique capabilities in data analytics and log management have been differentiating factors as it enters new verticals. This isn't different in the security vertical as enterprises rely on its SIEM solution to correlate security logs, alerts, and analytics.In the observability space, the need to adopt agile software development methodologies to meet the fast pace of innovation in the IT space has driven the adoption of observability platforms. Enterprises now have to monitor apps, cloud infrastructure, user experience, and network traffic at a large scale with multiple development iterations. The need to monitor the reliability and availability of enterprise apps and workloads means observability vendors have to evolve their capabilities to provide valuable offerings to enterprises. These include the provision of flexible pricing options, extensible APIs for data sharing, cross-platform integration with other IT tools, and support for open-source platforms. Splunk has acquired capabilities to solve most of these problems largely from its acquisitions of SignalFx and Omnition in 2019.In IT operations, Splunk provides capabilities such as event analytics and management, service monitoring, incident response, and AIOps. Besides complementing DevOps and security teams, ITOps also helps enterprises to evolve fast in a workplace that is becoming more distributed. By providing intelligent IT services and support offerings, Splunk can help enterprises solve their growing IT challenges.Observability (DevOps), security operations, and IT operations are segregated into standalone categories called buying centers. In the future, the consumption of solutions in each of the buying centers is expected to converge in a trend called DevSecOps. This trend is expected to improve Splunk's platform strategy while aiding its cross-sell motion.Readers will recall Snowflake's (SNOW) recent IPO, which drove data platforms to the limelight. I expect Splunk to evolve capabilities similar to Snowflake in the future. Splunk already has a streaming engine, like an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool for moving data between cloud and on-prem networks. This capability gives a peek into how Splunk can play in the data management space.Splunk highlighted most of the benefits of being a cloud-native platform, including faster time to value, greater business continuity, accelerated innovation rate through faster releases, and tailored machine learning insights gathered from its customer base. Splunk highlighted some of the things it did differently when architecting its cloud platform, including the separation of compute and storage, improving its query language to include support for more languages, the improvement of its streaming engine, and new partnerships with cloud providers. Other updates are geared towards providing better value to customers in the area of platform performance and return on investment.Currently, over 50% of bookings are cloud-based. In Q2, cloud ARR grew at 89%. These impressive numbers ensured Splunk remains ahead of its cloud migration target. Splunk's current support for hybrid cloud deployments and on-prem deployments remains a unique capability as it increases the number of customers it can serve. This support is also critical to its competitive positioning, given the rise of cloud-native platforms like Datadog (DDOG) and the growing competition in the observability and security operations segments. While the market opportunity is huge, it is worth highlighting that competitors like Datadog, Sumo Logic (SUMO), Dynatrace (DT), and New Relic (NEWR) are laser-focused on innovating in observability. These competitors are expected to release new capabilities at a faster pace, given their huge dedication to research and development. While Splunk has been swift to respond to moves from competitors, I expect it to face intense pressure while expanding its innovation roadmap across the broad IT segments it serves.One way for IT vendors to add value to customers is to provide flexible pricing for the consumption of IT resources. The introduction of workload-based pricing puts Splunk at parity with most of its cloud-native competitors who have adopted this granular pricing model. Workload-based pricing means customers only pay for what they consume. Splunk highlighted some of its observations as enterprises adopt workload based pricing. This includes a growth in data ingestion, data search, and a drastic decrease in cost per gigabit consumed. This capability is important as Splunk migrates customers to the cloud as most cloud providers already provide competitive resource-based pricing options.Splunk highlighted the uniqueness of its strategy. Its ability to provide security, IT operations, and observability solutions for on-prem and cloud customers is a rare combination of capabilities. Readers will recall that Splunk's capabilities extend into the data management space where it can play in segments like data preparation and data analytics. However, breadth is not enough. After acquiring SignalFx to build its observability strategy, Splunk also added Omnition for distributed tracing in September 2019. Still, some capabilities appear to be missing. I highlighted some of these in my previous thesis, and Gartner also echoed it. The acquisition of Plumbr improves upon Splunk's APM capabilities in the area of auto-instrumentation, real user monitoring, and deep performance insights into enterprise apps. Real user monitoring involves the passive monitoring of the behavior of users as they navigate an app or web page. It helps to measure user experience by monitoring metrics such as page load time and failed login attempts.Rigor adds digital experience monitoring by providing advanced synthetic monitoring capabilities. Unlike RUM, Synthetic monitoring is an active monitoring technique that simulates the behavior of a user through a web page.With these capabilities, Splunk significantly closes its competitive parity with capabilities offered by fast innovators such as Datadog. Improving its competitive parity will improve the job of its sales team, selling its cloud offerings. It will also plug churn from customers expanding their digital transformation strategy. The prospect of losing customers to cloud-native platforms is one factor driving the depressed valuation factor of enterprises migrating customers to their new cloud architecture. Readers will observe that Dynatrace, Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Cloudera (CLDR), to name a few, all trade at a discount to their cloud-native competitors. Yet, taking a closer look, these platforms actually offer the cloud capabilities that are driving the momentum of their competitors.This is another area in which Splunk differentiates itself from competitors. Its ability to ingest and transform data means Splunk can also evolve solutions for data scientists and engineers. Splunk highlighted the continuous learning capabilities of its ML offerings. Since Splunk has a cloud offering, large enterprises can take advantage of its ML offering at scale and at a reduced cost. Other tweaks to this offering include the benefit of a 400% platform performance increase and the addition of more ML algorithms.Source: SplunkSplunk has a new Chief Revenue Officer. Christian Smith has over two decades of experience in the technology industry. He was previously the Chief Revenue Officer of Nitex, a workflow automation company. He has held leadership roles at Oracle and AT&T. He has also help internal roles at Splunk over the past four years. The CRO laid out the go-to-market strategy to help customers in their cloud adoption and migration journey. Besides helping customers accelerate their digital transformation journey, Splunk will also anticipate new use cases and evolve new capabilities. This is important to monetize its platform/other segments, pegged at a total addressable market of $19b.Splunk's platform already covers 90% of its anticipated use cases for its offerings. Anticipating new use cases means providing specialization at scale. This is a huge task given the volatile macro environment as customers demand fast solutions to their IT problems.Splunk plays in a lot of fast-growing segments in the IT space. Given its added capabilities in observability, security, and ITOps, its total addressable market now stands at $81b. This is projected to grow to $114b by 2023. The TAM breakdown included $28b from ITOps, $17B each from observability and security operations, and $19b from platform/other. The platform/other segments could grow even bigger, given the size of the data management market. Splunk has only penetrated 2% of its overall addressable market, demonstrating the ample runway ahead.Source: Author (chart from Barclays)Enterprises are in the early innings of their digital transformation and cloud migration journey. Therefore, I expect Splunk to continue to win new customers and experience strong usage expansion and cross-sell across its offerings.Growth is expected to come from a huge renewal base, driving a strong expansion opportunity. Splunk shared a cohort analysis that demonstrated the ARR expansion of its FY'19 already at 1.4x. The FY'10 cohort is already at 37x. This demonstrates the huge usage expansion opportunity for recent customer cohorts.Another area of growth is cloud migration. Unlike on-prem licenses, Splunk observed customers adopting its cloud solution growing ARR at a faster rate. Customers grow average ARR by 2.6x in the first year after their first cloud purchase. This expands to 5.4x by the third year. Going forward, Splunk is expecting cloud ARR percent of overall software bookings to be at 80% by FY'23. This metric currently stands at 53%, demonstrating the huge opportunity ahead.The cross-sell opportunity is also huge. Today, only 72% of customers have adopted one of Splunk's three buying centers (DevOps, SecOps, ITOps), while less than 10% have adopted all three. Splunk observed that average ARR grows by 2.3X when customers adopt more than one buying center. This grows to 6.3X by the third year.Key cloud activities like the ease of scalability, multitenancy, and elasticity are expected to drive gross margins in the long term. Splunk, currently, has a non-GAAP gross margin of 60% from its cloud business. This is expected to expand to 70% by FY'23. The long-term gross margin target is expected to exceed 75%.Splunk reiterated an attractive ARR CAGR of 40% into FY'23. This demonstrates its conviction in its products, sales, and competitive positioning towards driving solid growth. Due to the unpredictable nature of revenue, Splunk adopted the ARR (annual recurring revenue) metric. This metric was also used to forecast its long-term operating model. Non-GAAP opex % of ARR is expected to improve to 60% by FY'23 (versus 99% in FY'20). This improvement will drive FY'23 non-GAAP operating margin of 20%, which is expected to expand to over 25% in the long term.With its robust capabilities, Splunk can grow as fast as some fast-evolving cloud-native platforms. Splunk highlighted its attractive cloud dollar-based net retention rate (DBNRR), which stood above 130% despite its size. Most companies witness a significant decline in DBNRR as they approach the $1b ARR mark.Splunk's data platform remains a solid differentiating factor. This is complemented by its support for hybrid cloud workload deployment. This flexible cloud support opens up more monetization opportunities into highly regulated verticals that will keep workloads on-prem and across multiple cloud platforms. This strategy significantly expands Splunk's monetizable total addressable market. The market is currently expecting Splunk to grow at a revenue CAGR of 19% over the next five years. The ARR projection laid out at the investor day session suggests this estimate is conservative. This consensus growth estimate is also a function of the reduced revenue growth expected in FY'21 as Splunk completes its cloud migration. Splunk's guidance means ARR will compound to $4.6b by FY23. The consensus estimate put revenue at $4.6b by the end of FY'23, which is in line with its management's guidance. I think Splunk will grow faster than these projections, given the huge growth options to be derived from its data platform. These options are currently responsible for Snowflake's rich valuation.Splunk's adoption of workload-based pricing and the shift to cloud subscription means billings growth will be impacted. This impact will be felt on the operating cash flow line. The impact will be temporary as the anticipated usage expansion and cross-sell opportunity will drive margins expansion, ensuring Splunk meets its FY'23 OCF target of $1B. Assuming revenue of $4.5b to - $4.8b in FY'23, this amounts to an OCF margin of 20 -22%. Beyond FY'23, cash flow growth will be strong as the headwinds from cloud investment will be fully digested.To evolve its capabilities, Splunk has had to raise its cost of capital. While it has enough liquidity to keep executing, the debt on its balance sheet will continue to drive its risk premium.Competitors are innovating at a fast pace. This means Spunk has to keep investing in improving the depth of its capabilities. This will impact its operating margin and EPS factor.While Splunk can't be said to be cheap for short term investors, long term investors have enough reasons to stay invested given Splunk's robust capabilities. Investors should hold for the long term while studying Splunk's ability to match its competitors' pace of innovation, especially in the observability space. Currently, there isn't sufficient evidence to show that Splunk doesn't have the resources to match any new offering introduced by its competitors. The market size is also huge, ensuring there will be more low hanging fruit to be picked.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4378662,105757,2020-10-12T13:52:02-04:00,"Despite Splunk reporting a phenomenal quarter with accelerating cloud revenue, shares have underperformed since the August report with shares -4% versus Nasdaq of -2% and S&P500 of -1%.Cloud ARR grew 89% Y/Y, and Cloud revenue  grew 79% Y/Y. Splunk now expects Cloud bookings to be north of 60% by the end-of-the-year, two years ahead.Revenue fell short of expectation due to acceleration in cloud/subscription revenue. Dollar Based Net Retention Rate continues to remain above 130%, implying very high satisfaction with the product.Management's tone was bullish on the earnings call, with the company exuding confidence in its sales pipeline, growth drivers, and ability to execute on its opportunities.We recommend investors buy Splunk stock, given Splunk' pivot to cloud, multiple growth drivers, compelling valuation, and impending multiple expansion.","Since the company reported results on August 26th, Splunk (SPLK) stock underperformed both Nasdaq and S&P 500. Splunk stock is down 4%, while Nasdaq is down 2%, and S&P500 is down 1% since late August. The stock underperformance may have been due to the company reporting revenue that missed expectations. This underperformance is not warranted in our opinion, given Splunk's results were solid, and the miss on the topline is nothing to worry about and is easily explainable. The company continues to execute well and is aggressively accelerating its business model to Cloud/subscriptions. Cloud/subscription revenue is recognized over the term of the contract (typically in the two-to-three-year range), unlike perpetual revenue that is recognized upfront. The use of subscriptions understates revenue, given that every $6 in perpetual revenue translate to roughly $2 in subscription revenue that is recognized in year-1, given that subscription revenue is recognized over a three-year period rather than upfront.Splunk is considered the leader in log management and has expanded its offerings into adjacent markets such as observability, data fabric search, and stream processing by acquiring cutting-edge assets and integrating them into its product portfolio. Splunk is a reasonably valued cutting-edge software company that is putting up impressive revenue growth numbers at scale, solid and expanding customer base, and an industry-leading position, making the stock a buy.Splunk reported F2Q21 results that appear disappointing, given the company printed revenue that missed expectations by about $30 million. Revenue was $492 million and was down 5% Y/Y. Delving into the report closely, one can see that cloud revenue accelerated to $126 million and was up 79% Y/Y, from a year ago period of $70 million. More interestingly, Cloud revenue for FY20 was 13% of total revenue or about $307 million. YTD in FY21, the cloud revenue is already 26% of the revenue or about $238 million. In terms of transition to a subscription model, YTD, cloud generated 50% of total software bookings, up from 35% in the prior year. Splunk expects more than 60% of total software bookings this year to be from the cloud/subscriptions, two years ahead of the prior guidance. The following chart illustrates the acceleration of cloud contribution to software bookings. Source: Splunk presentationThe following chart illustrates the acceleration of the subscription model, with subscription revenue doubling from the prior-year period.Source: Splunk presentationThe important story here is the accelerating cloud transition is muting revenue growth. Splunk expects the cloud transition to accelerate over the next few quarters, given that the company is aligned with a ""cloud-first"" focus. To accelerate the cloud transition, the company is paying its sales force the same for selling the cloud product as it does for selling the product on-prem. At some point, we expect the company to pay a higher commission for selling the cloud product rather than an on-prem product. Revenue growth will remain muted until the cloud transition is significantly complete. Splunk expects cloud transition to top out at 80-to-90% of total software bookings. We believe Splunk can reach this high water-mark over the next two-to-three years. The following chart illustrates Cloud revenue growth.Splunk is bullish on its growth prospects, and it continues to expect its ARR to grow 40% until the end of FY23E to $4.61 billion, from $1.68 billion in F2020. Similarly, the company expects to generate $1 billion in cash flow from operations by the end of FY23.Source: Splunk presentationSplunk expects the gross margins for the cloud business to improve from the current 59% to over 60% in the current fiscal year and then to close to 70% by the end of the next fiscal year. The gross margin improvement for the cloud business is driven by higher utilization of the existing infrastructure. We expect an acceleration in cloud revenue to provide predictability in revenue, improving gross margins to drive leverage and earnings as we head into C2021 and beyond. The following chart illustrates the improving gross margin over the last several quarters.Source: Splunk presentationSplunk remains one of our favorite technology infrastructure companies, along with Vmware (VMW), Zscaler (ZS), and Microsoft (MSFT). Splunk is a pioneer in machine log analysis, and its software is considered the gold standard in obtaining insights from machine-generated log files. Splunk use cases now range from IT operations, security, DevOps, and user behavior analytics. Splunk's software can analyze data that is at rest (within a database/in an index) as well as data on the move (i.e., data traveling from a source to the storage destination) in a wire.Splunk's software makes Digital Transformation ((DX)) easy. As companies become more digital and use the hybrid cloud to deploy their IT infrastructure, troubleshooting problems can be challenging. The use of Splunk software makes it easier to troubleshoot problems. Splunk's software is becoming the nerve center in the enterprise with a wide variety of use cases. As they say in ice-hockey, Splunk is skating to where the puck is likely to be and is now firmly on the path towards real-time monitoring of applications and infrastructure.Splunk continues to use the cash on its balance sheet to acquire cutting edge technology companies to fold into their software stack. The company spent over $1billion to acquire SignalFx, Omnition, and Streamlio to get into real-time analysis and search (Data Fabric Search). Splunk's Data-to-Everything platform is now much more capable, giving companies such as Datadog (DDOG), Elastic Search (ESTC), Dynatrace (DT), New Relic (NEWR), and App Dynamics (CSCO) a formidable competition.Now with new pricing (announced in September 2019), customers can acquire Splunk either on the amount of data that is ingested into the index or via infrastructure based pricing. The new infrastructure based pricing removes a major irritant for many customers. It should help Splunk accelerate the growth of the company and remove the pricing umbrella, which competitors such as Elastic and Sumo were exploiting. Net-net, we believe Splunk is the best asset to own in the monitoring space, given its leading position in the enterprise, ease of use, marquee customer base, expanding use cases, and a reasonable valuation.When valuing SPLK, we use EV/Sales as the primary valuation metric. Given that many of the companies in the infrastructure and monitoring tools, peer group are currently transitioning to a SaaS/Subscription revenue model or not sufficiently profitable, EV/Sales makes the comparisons meaningful. Also, in a takeout scenario, one of the primary metrics used to evaluate takeout price remains EV/Sales. EV/Sales makes it easier to compare with historical takeout multiples.SPLK can generally be compared to infrastructure, security, and monitoring peer groups. Both security and monitoring peer groups are considered a subset of the infrastructure peer group. SPLK is relatively underpriced when compared to all the three peer groups. To make the comparisons meaningful and easier, I am only comparing security and monitoring peer groups here.SPLK is currently trading at 9.1x EV/C2022 sales, well below the monitoring tools peer group average of 11.8x, despite growing 22% faster than the peer group average. SPLK is forecasted to grow at 28%, versus the peer group at around 23%. Splunk's multiple is 30% lower than the monitoring peer group.Source: Author based on Refinitiv dataSimilarly, SPLK is trading at a 4% discount to the security peer group average of 9.2x despite growing 47% faster than the security peer group (28% versus 19%). The following charts illustrate the valuation of the SaaS and the Security peer group.Source: Author based on Refinitiv dataNeedless to say, SPLK is cheaper than many high growth companies in the tech universe on a growth adjusted basis.Despite the revenue miss, many well-known analysts on the Street raised their Price Targets ((PT)) for the stock. These analysts cited the strength of the cloud business as the reason to hike their price targets. According to Refinitiv data, the median PT on the Street is $240, and the mean PT is $231. The following table illustrates the changes in PT following SPLK's results.Source: Author based on Refinitiv dataBased on the same Refinitiv data, out of the 38 analysts covering the stock, 30 are a buy or a strong buy and the remaining are hold, as the following chart illustrates.Source: Author based on Refinitiv dataDespite the bullish outlook from the company and the general tone of the sell-side community, Splunk has underperformed the market since its report on August 26th and over the last year.Over the last 12 months, SPLK is up about 62%, while the Nasdaq is up only 40%, and S&P is up only 14%. This outperformance relative to indices does not really tell the story of the underperformance relative to its peer groups. SPLK significantly underperformed its peer group consisting of pure-play monitoring companies such as DDOG and DT. The following chart illustrates SPLK's performance relative to the market and its competition.As the cloud revenue becomes a more significant portion of the overall revenue (probably top out at 80-90% of total revenue), we expect SPLK to rerate as a cloud/subscription company, driving the stock higher. Given that we expect the stock to catch up relative to its peer group following the stock rerating, we would be buying shares of SPLK as opportunities present themselves."
4371963,103480,2020-09-01T14:12:35-04:00,"Splunk shares are trading near all-time highs thanks to the company's fantastic transition to a recurring subscription-based model.
        Though Splunk missed headline revenue results in Q3, this is less meaningful due to the larger-than-expected contribution from cloud (which saps near-term revenue).
        Instead, focus on the fact that even at a >$2 billion ARR base, Splunk is growing recurring revenues at more than 50% y/y. Q3 Cloud ARR also saw accelertion.
        The company's >130% net revenue retention rate also compares Splunk very favorably to fellow SaaS peers.","To the everyday consumer, the name Splunk (SPLK) may not mean much, but within enterprise software, Splunk has become a transformational company amassing users in virtually every industry. The machine data company - which essentially processes data generated by a company's internal systems and transforms them into actionable insights for senior corporate executives - has been growing like a weed despite its scale, and is finding tremendous success in converting its previously license-based software model into the recurring/SaaS subscription business model that investors particularly love at the moment.Shares of Splunk are already up ~45% year-to-date (though flat after a strong Q2), but I think there's still plenty of upside in this stock:I can think of very few software companies that I'm comfortable holding through the long term even as they see tremendous multiples expansion and no longer offer a reasonable value angle. Splunk is one of them, thanks to the sheer size of the market opportunity ahead of it (the company estimated its TAM at $62 billion a year ago) and the speed at which it is growing a recurring business to fill that market. The key points of the bullish thesis that investors should be aware of for Splunk:Investors should take note of Splunk's myriad strengths and stay long.Let's now parse through Splunk's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q2 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Splunk Q2 resultsSource: Splunk Q2 earnings releaseSplunk's revenue declined -5% y/y to $491.7 million in Q2, missing Wall Street's expectations of $520.4 million (or flat y/y) in the quarter. However, as seasoned Splunk investors are aware, Splunk's headline revenue figures form an incomplete story because of the transformational shift to cloud happening underneath. Under the old license-based model, Splunk would recognize a lot of its revenue upfront - but revenue would be lumpier, and over a customer's lifetime, switching to a recurring or cloud-based model will deliver more overall value. So ironically, the better that Splunk does in the cloud, the more its near-term revenue will suffer.So the best measure of Splunk's growth, in my view, is its ARR. ARR in Q2 grew at a stunning 50% y/y pace of $1.93 billion, barely decelerating from Q1's growth rate in spite of the coronavirus. Heavy backend data projects like Splunk tend to get pushed down the priorities totem pole amid macro uncertainty, but what has ailed many other infrastructure software companies has seemingly not impacted Splunk at all.The degree of revenue visibility Splunk has with this level of ARR is also impressive. We note that Wall Street analysts for FY22 (next calendar year) have a revenue target of $2.88 billion. At Splunk's current ARR (never mind the fact that it's adding ~$150 million in ARR every quarter), 67% of that revenue target is already ""locked in"" to existing contracts, with any new business providing pure upside. Figure 2. Splunk ARR trendsSource: Splunk Q2 earnings deckAnd as can be seen in the chart above, the cloud proportion of that ARR continues to grow at a startup-like pace. Splunk's 89% y/y growth in Cloud ARR, in fact, accelerated seven points versus 82% y/y growth in Q1. This is the major explanation why Splunk's Q2 revenue declined, due to the revenue/ARR mix shift toward cloud. The company also noted that cloud products drove more than half of total bookings in Q2 for the first time in the company's history. More good news to report: in Q1, due to the onset of the coronavirus, Splunk's contract durations took a sharp dip - which makes sense, as customers turned cautious on IT spending and opted for shorter contracts to take that uncertainty into account. But in Q2, we note that Splunk's average cloud contacts have rebounded to ~30 months (2.5 years), up three months from the low point hit in Q1. Figure 3. Splunk contract durationsSource: Splunk Q2 earnings deckAnd moreover, Splunk's existing customers continue to upgrade and expand their relationships with the company. Splunk has started reporting dollar-based net retention rates mirroring the metrics used by other SaaS companies, and we're impressed by the company's consistent 132% net retention rates that have maintained steadily over the past several quarters (many SaaS companies tend to report figures in the mid-110s). This number indicates that the average Splunk customer is ""upsold"" to a 32% larger deployment versus the prior year, proving the validity of Splunk's land-and-expand business model. Figure 4. Splunk net retention trendsSource: Splunk Q2 earnings deckDoug Merritt, Splunk's CEO, offers additional context on the Q2 earnings call which highlights his beliefs that the current pandemic environment is actually helping to accelerate Splunk’s push to cloud:Profitability metrics are slightly less meaningful due to the cloud shift, which has sapped near-term revenue and dropped overall operating margins. What we'd continue to focus on, however, is the fact that Splunk has managed to continue raising its cloud gross margins as it scales, up 620bps in Q1 to 59.2%:Figure 5. Splunk gross margin trendsSource: Splunk Q2 earnings deckAnd despite the shortfall in revenue versus Wall Street's expectations, it may also be worthwhile to note that Splunk's pro forma EPS of -$0.33 beat Wall Street's consensus by a penny.There's a lot to like about Splunk exiting Q2. The global pandemic has barely impacted Splunk's fantastic recurring revenue growth and cloud transition, despite bruising many other hardcode backend software infrastructure platforms (Alteryx (AYX) is one of the best examples of a company that has seen its growth utterly wrecked due to the coronavirus). Stay long here as Splunk continues to build the leading cloud-based machine data intelligence platform."
4379308,102101,2020-10-15T17:46:52-04:00,Splunk offers attractive and well-diversified products that play into favourable tech trends.It has been able to manage the volatile macro environment with solid resolve.Its impressive vision points to the potential for market share gain.Splunk's valuation offers an attractive entry opportunity as the growth story unfolds.,"Source: amazonaws Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) plays at the intersection of favorable tech trends that will drive sustainable growth. It has executed its strategy effectively despite growing competition and unfavorable macro developments. Having done the bulk of the heavy lifting, investors will only be worried about occasional earnings volatility as it completes the transition to cloud subscriptions. Splunk's valuation offers more potential due to the unique combination of its offerings. The current valuation is also attractive as Splunk as a lot of industry-leading cloud products that compete favorably with offerings by cloud-native competitors.Splunk is a commendable innovator that plays into multiple fast-growing segments in the tech space. Splunk plays in the IT operations, security operations, and the DevOps space. All three segments are growing at a fast pace. By market share, Splunk is a leader in the IT operations management space. It is a visionary in the APM (application performance monitoring) space. Given that its offerings are cloud-native, it is easily a leader in the market for enterprises that are geared towards adopting cloud-based APMs. Its SIEM (security information and event management) solution is also ranked as one of the best.Splunk has been able to diversify into multiple tech verticals using a combination of internal innovation and strategic acquisitions. Like most tech platforms, Splunk is currently transitioning from a licensing model to a subscription billing model. This transition has masked top-line growth metrics like revenue and billings. Going forward, I expect the transition to continue to drive growth volatility. This will impact its momentum factor as the market continues to digest the transition.Like most tech platforms, Splunk is expanding the breadth of its capabilities. Playing in multiple tech segments represents an attractive value proposition. Splunk's presence in ITOps, SecOps, DevOps, and AIOps is brilliant as these fields complement each other. This is also aided by its platform business model. The advantage of this platform strategy is the ease of consumption of offerings across these segments. Having an all in one platform for multiple departments to adopt tech resources comes with advantages in data aggregation and cost savings.More users are adopting Splunk's cloud subscription offering compared to its licensing offering. This means metrics like annual recurring revenue, dollar net expansion rate, and remaining performance obligation will serve as the best yardstick to measure growth. ARR has been growing at a fast pace in recent quarters. DBNER is one of the highest out there at 130%. COVID-19 has slightly impacted Splunk's growth rate in recent quarters. It has also improved the visibility of cloud platforms like Splunk.For companies with strong cash flows and easy access to cheap capital, managing working capital won't be an issue. For Splunk, the situation is slightly different. Currently, Splunk has two mandates, which explains why its cost of capital is slightly above its competitors.Firstly, it needs to manage the migration to cloud subscription to position itself as a cloud platform. Most cloud platforms are driving a new wave of innovation; as such, the market is rewarding them with attractive valuation multiples. This makes sense if you are leading the market into a new innovation cycle. Splunk's second mandate requires huge investment in sales and innovation to grow market share. This is important due to the rise of cloud-native platforms like Datadog (DDOG) and Elastic (ESTC). These tasks explain why margins have been volatile in recent quarters.Currently, Splunk appears to be managing its new reality successfully. It has acquired leading players in ITOps and DevOps to complement its SecOps offerings. Its SIEM solution is currently rated as one of the best out there. SignalFx also positions Splunk as a visionary in the DevOps space. It only needs to improve its DevOps capabilities in areas like business analytics to complete its competitive parity. To differentiate itself from competitors, Splunk acquired VictorOps, a leading ITOps solution. Most DevOps players don't have ITOps offerings. Splunk is also pulling ahead of its competitors by offering AIOps and data science capabilities. This is enabled due to its superior capabilities in data management via its logging and search solutions. As such, I expect these capabilities to drive sustainable double-digit growth in the long term. EPS will remain volatile until cloud ARR and the subscription shift becomes the biggest driver of revenue. I also expect COVID-19-related headwinds to wane. This will drive favorable working capital as Splunk's investments to grow its new offerings have been a major headwind to operating cash flows. Splunk will also benefit from its presence across all business segments. Its strength with large enterprises points to the potential for large deals and renewals to drive operating cash flows. As such, I believe it is highly plausible that Spunk surpasses its FY'2023 FCF target of $1b, given the breadth of its capabilities.Splunk sits in the middle of the cloud evolution with a fair blend of cloud subscription revenue growing at a fast pace and license revenue declining due to more cloud billings. The market is valuing Splunk for sustainable double-digit growth. The potential to expand margins in the long term is also attractive, as demonstrated by its current dollar net expansion rate. Therefore, I expect Splunk to trade in line with other cloud platforms with solid growth factors.In the bullish scenario, I am projecting double-digit growth and a 20% CAGR over the next 10 years. I see strong potential for Splunk to dominate competitors using its experience in melding SecOps and DevOps capabilities to drive solutions that will lead to huge cost savings for enterprises. Therefore, Splunk is expected to experience massive margins expansion as it scales its cloud revenue. This will drive FCF margin in excess of 30%. If COVID-19 persists, more demand for remote working solutions and the usage of cloud platforms will drive down the risk premium of cloud stocks. Therefore, I expect multiples to expand to 20x TTM revenue.In the base scenario, I am projecting mid-teens growth over the next ten years. I expect growth to be driven by usage growth and cross-sell. I expect Splunk to continue to trade in line with other tech platforms, making a transition to cloud subscription. This will drive occasional billings volatility and valuation corrections. I also expect the world to shake off the COVID-19 restrictions. This will cause tech players to spend more on sales and marketing, which will result in a headwind to margins expansion.In the bear case, I expect competitors to evolve cloud-native solutions at a faster pace. I also expect public cloud platforms to evolve more capabilities to play in the DevOps and SecOps segments. This will raise customer acquisition costs. This will also impact the IRR of its cloud bets.Splunk is well-positioned to capture market share in a lot of fast-evolving segments. It has the resources to keep executing, and the future roadmap is promising. I expect the market to be nervy as Splunk continues its cloud transition. This will result in occasional corrections and entry opportunities for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price."
4371094,69905,2020-08-27T10:39:43-04:00,"Splunk transitioning customers to the cloud is the biggest driver of the story but this appears to be factored in many times over already.Splunk's total revenue Q3 2021 guidance is unimpressive.Splunk's DBNRR is amongst the highest in the SaaS space.Nonethless, Splunk is most likely fairly priced relative to its full potential.","Splunk (SPLK) is in the middle of a transition away from upfront customer payments towards a ratable recurring business model. Splunk expects that in the middle of next year to start lapping its change in its business model and that its cash flows will then start to look meaningfully more attractive.Ultimately, by fiscal 2023, it's aiming to see its cash flows reaching $1 billion. However, not only is this goal a considerable while away but right now, investors are already pricing in the stock at 35x Splunk's 2023 cash flow target.There are better opportunities elsewhere.Source: Author's calculations; *** high-end company Q3 2020 guidanceAt the top end of Splunk's Q3 2021 guidance, it points towards this fast-growing SaaS business growing its revenues by 1% y/y.As far as SaaS companies go, given that I follow so many, I would question why Splunk has opted not to return to give investors full-year guidance. Considering that during its fiscal Q2 2020 (last calendar year) it was able to give investors the visibility they required.Indeed, wasn't the whole point of transitioning towards a recurring business model to give investors visibility?Moving on, Splunk's Total ARR remains steady with approximately 50% y/y revenue growth rates, compared with 52% in the same period a year ago.Source: Q2 2021 Investor PresentationGiven the tumultuous time Splunk has had to navigate, this small dip of 200 basis points in ARR growth rates is not much at all.During the earnings call, Splunk's CEO Doug Merritt noted that some customers were hesitant to commit to long-term contracts, but that overall there has been an acceleration in cloud momentum and that Splunk's long-term targets to reach 60% of its revenue from cloud sources is now two years ahead of schedule.Specifically, during Q2 2021, Splunk's cloud contributed 53% to total software bookings, compared with 36% in the same period a year ago.Cloud ARR was up an astonishing 89% y/y to $568 million. This the most bullish aspect of the story. However, for a stock valued with a market cap of roughly $35 billion, this appears to be a punchy price tag.Nevertheless, investors' sentiment is a very strong driver for Splunk's return, and for now, investors appear perfectly content with this approximately half a billion of ARR.As we can see below, Splunk's cloud contribution to total revenues continues to increase with the passage of time. Presently, just over a quarter of its cloud revenues contribute towards total revenues.Source: Q2 2021 Investor PresentationMoving on, a very positive aspect of Splunk is that it has a very high dollar-based net retention rate of 132%.This implies that the level of cross-selling and upselling on its customers is so high, that even without adding another single customer over the coming twelve months its revenues could still grow by 32% y/y (assuming no churn). This is no doubt very attractive, and investors will appraise this figure in support of their bullish thesis.Right now, the carrot for investors is that in fiscal 2023, Splunk expects to reach $1 billion of cash flows from operations and reverse its cash burn thus far.During Splunk's H1 2021, its cash flow was negative $124 million compared with negative $94 million in the same period a year ago.Taking a step back, given that the whole story here is focused on Splunk's cloud opportunity, Splunk's cloud non-GAAP gross profit margins are fairly middle of the road.Within the SaaS space, generating less than 60% in non-GAAP gross profit margins puts Splunk's gross profit profile towards the lower end of alluring SaaS revenues.Looking back to 2018, when Splunk made its transition away from billing customers upfront towards billing them over the term of their contract, Splunk was generating 20% cash flow margins.The idea being that by fiscal 2023, Splunk will be on target towards making $1 billion in cash flows before capitalization of intangibles and capex. This leaves the stock today trading for more than 35x its cash flows from operation more than 2 years out.Even within the incredibly hotly-priced SaaS space, paying 35x cash flows to years out is a punchy multiple.During the earnings call, Splunk's management contends that it's building one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses at scale, with investors for now appearing to be more than satisfied with this narrative.Having said that, given that its stock is already priced at close to $35 billion, I am struggling to see a lot more upside right now, asides from being a momentum stock. There are arguably more attractive opportunities elsewhere."
4354544,104099,2020-06-18T14:26:58-04:00,"Since I wrote my cautionary piece about this company, the shares have risen dramatically. The problems remain, though.Sales and net income are strongly negatively correlated, prompting the question ""if growing sales won't lead to profits, what will?!""Investing well is often about risk minimization, and I think call options allow investors to catch most of the upside while being exposed to far lower downside.","In the 638 days since I wrote my negative piece on Splunk Software (SPLK), the shares are up about 59% against a 6% gain for the S&P 500. I was clearly wrong at the time that the shares had nowhere to go but down, so I thought I'd look in on the name again to try to uncover if I made an error. I'll look at the financial history here, and will look at the stock as a thing distinct from the underlying business. I'll come right to the point. My criticism of 638 days ago stands. There continues to be a strong negative relationship between sales and earnings. This prompts the very simple (and still unanswered) question: if growing sales doesn't lead to profits, what does? I remain skeptical of this business, and I think investors should continue to avoid the name. I also think people who insist on staying long here, should buy call options on this name as they present much of the upside at far lower risk.I think we all have biases of one sort or another, and I'm no different in this regard. In an effort to be as straightforward as possible with you, dear reader, I'll express the relevant biases I know about up front. I think Splunk is an example of what I call a ""parent's basement stock"" because I think a strong simile can be made between companies that require outside capital for their ongoing survival and the neckbeard basement dwellers who rely on mom and dad to keep body and soul together. This business relies on external sources of funds for its survival in the exact same way that an underachieving man-baby does. This bias may taint my analysis of this company, and I should state it up front.In my previous article, I made what seemed to me at the time to be a bog simple argument. This investment is fundamentally troubled because the more this company sells, the more it loses, and there seems to be nothing on the horizon that is capable of ending the negative relationship between revenue and income. Specifically, over the past seven years, revenue has grown at a very impressive CAGR of about 34%. At the same time, net losses have grown at a CAGR of about 23%. I ran a regression on these two series (because I'm a nerd who finds that sort of thing enjoyable) and found a fairly strong negative correlation (r=-.659) between revenue and net income. Thankfully, net loss per share has grown at a slightly slower pace given the massive dilution that shareholders have experienced over the past several years. Specifically, share count has grown at a CAGR of about 5.75% since 2014.We see the song remains the same when we compare the first three months of 2020 to the same period a year ago. Specifically, in spite of a 2.2% uptick in revenue compared to last year, operating and net loss ballooned by 99% and 96% respectively.One group that has benefited fairly significantly over the past several years are the employees, and that must be very gratifying for shareholders. Specifically, stock based compensation has grown at a CAGR of about 34% over the past seven years, and stock compensation per employee has grown at a CAGR of about 4.44% since 2014. In 2019 alone, just over $94,000 was spent on stock compensation per employee, and just under $2.4 billion has been spent on employee stock based compensation since 2014. Over the same time period, the company generated losses for shareholders of just over $2 billion.I've read more than a few comparisons between Splunk and Microsoft, for example. Some readers have suggested that one must look beyond the current state and think about a time when Splunk will reach a level of profitability given the markets it serves and given its growth. In order to try to unpack this comparison more fully, I've gone to the effort of tracking down Microsoft's earliest financial statements and providing them to you in the table below. Some may call my ability to track down data from a bygone era ""superhuman"", but I think that stretches the point very slightly. I do this for you, dear reader, and your enjoyment and edification are the only thanks I need.Per the table below, I think the ""Splunk is like a young Microsoft"" simile is ludicrous on its face. For instance, Microsoft was consistently profitable pre-IPO and it didn't need to raise outside capital in order to grow. Also, post IPO Microsoft's growth rate was actually significantly lower than Splunk's, with revenue growing at a CAGR of ""only"" about 25% between 1993 and 1997. Finally, Microsoft was in some sense the negative image of Splunk in that the former saw net income growing at a faster rate than sales, while the latter obviously shows net loss growing at a faster rate than sales. To my mind, all of this indicates to me that making comparisons between our favorite tech companies of today with the tech survivors of the 1990s is an example of fairly lazy thinking. It is, specifically, an example of survivorship bias. Why not draw a comparison between Splunk and, say, Gandalf Technologies to pick a mildly painful example from my own past?SourceAfter a review of the latest financials out of Splunk, my questions remain unanswered. If sales growth of this magnitude doesn't lead to profits, what will it take? Since top line growth is dependent on sales and marketing, R&D, and G&A, in what world will this company be able to reduce those expenses in order to earn a profit? In my view, there isn't a coherent narrative about a future where Splunk can keep costs at bay while it continues to grow. I don't recommend investing in perpetually losing business, so I can't recommend buying this business. I don't think Splunk will ever leave the investor's proverbial basement?Source: Company filingsMy regular readers know that I like to look at the relationship between price and some measure of economic value. The problem in this case is that there are no significant measures of economic value to compare price to, so I'm left to move up the income statement to compare price to sales. I'd remind readers that I think it's free cash flow is the source of all investor returns. Sales growth is helpful in that it should abet free cash flow, and shouldn't be seen as an end in and of itself in my view. With that out of the way, here is a picture of the relationship between price and sales and enterprise value to revenue. While I don't happen to think these ratios are particularly helpful, I think they prove that Splunk is trading on the high side of these ranges. Someone who invests on the basis of sales growth must admit to themselves that these shares are trading on the high side relative to their own history.Data by YChartsSource: YChartsIn my view, investing is about achieving the greatest return at the lowest possible risk. One of the ways investors can mitigate the risks inherent in investing is by reducing the capital employed to achieve a particular result. For instance, if investor A employs $100,000 of capital to earn a $10,000 return and investor B employs $50,000 to achieve a very similar return, investor B is in a far less risky position than investor A. With that in mind, I would suggest call options as a proxy to those investors who insist on staying long in the teeth of my very powerful argumentation. Given that there's no dividend, the opportunity cost of call options relative to stocks is very low.In particular, I would recommend that people who insist on staying long here would do well to sell their shares and buy the January 2021 call with a strike of $185. These at the money calls are currently bid-asked at $25.10-$26.20. This means that the investor who sells their shares and buys this call gets virtually identical upside for 14% of the capital at risk over the next six months. In my estimation, achieving a near identical capital gain for a relatively small fraction of capital at risk is the definition of lower risk and I think the trade makes sense here.That said, everything comes with risk, and call options are of course no exception. The biggest problem with this strategy is that there's an obvious duration problem with calls. Stocks are (theoretically) eternal, while call options have an expiration date. Thus, if the shares flatline or fall in price, the investor may be out some or all of their investment. In my view, this risk is not that severe relative to stock ownership, though, as a drop in share price obviously hurts shareholders also. For instance, if the shares fall more than $26 over the next six months, it will be better to be a call owner than a stock owner. Also, if shares drop to, say, $150 by late January 2021, the call investor will have 86% of their capital as ""dry powder"", and will be able to buy more calls at more advantageous (i.e. lower) strike prices. Shareholders who see the shares drop just can do nothing but take a gravol and enjoy the ride.Regardless, if an investor agrees with me that these shares are overpriced, they will avoid the name. If an investor thinks the shares have further to run because of supportive underlying trends, they could do far worse than replacing their shares with calls.I think Splunk is a fundamentally broken business. I thought that over 600 days ago when I first looked into it, and I still think so today. That said, the market has obviously disagreed with me given the price performance over the past several months. Thus, I can write all I like about the negative relationship between sales and earnings and it won't mean anything because there's some other dynamic at work here. I think investors bid up these shares based on hope. Given that, I think it would be foolish for me to come out as overtly bearish on this name. I would suggest that people replace their shares with call options, though. These are ideal investments in this case because they give most of the upside with far less downside, given the lower capital investment. I think price and value can remain un-moored for some time, and I think investors would be wise to avoid this name until price falls to more closely match value. For those who insist on staying long, I think you have nothing to lose by selling your shares and buying calls."

For those of you who have not yet seen it, here's what it entails:Now, let's check out the results!Assumptions:Using the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, I determined that Splunk's fair value is $145.75, i.e., the stock is currently ""Overvalued"" by 20.07%Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelNow, a DCF illustrates whether a stock is over- or under-valued; however, it does nothing in terms of demonstrating what one can expect in the way of future expected returns. For that, we must employ step 3 of the LASV model, the results of which can be seen below.Step 3 entails a simple process of projecting intrinsic value via the growth of free cash flow per share. By which I mean we simply grow the initial free cash flow per share (shown in the above graph) by the assumed growth rate for ten years; at the end of which we apply an assumed price to free cash flow multiple (informed by Splunk's SaaS peers' multiples).Here are the results!Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelSplunk is closing in on profitability, and even with maturing revenue growth, the company is still expected to maintain growth at 20%+ CAGR for the next three years. Data is the most valuable corporate asset in the new digital economy, and Splunk is at the epicenter of this secular growth trend with its expertise in security, cloud, big data, machine learning, and IoT.Although Splunk's fair price is close to $145, i.e., it is currently overvalued from a DCF perspective, the expected return of ~14% CAGR conveys to us that it is a solid investment at about $180. Hence, I recommend a long-term investment at the current price of $180 and addition to the position on any significant dips.Key Takeaway: I rate Splunk a buy at $180 and below.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow, and happy investing!"

The machine data-mining company - which basically converts the data generated by internal corporate systems into actionable insights - is one of the few companies in the software competitor with no real close competitors and a clear value proposition to consumers, especially amid the rise of remote-work arrangements that require us all to lean more heavily on digital infrastructure.The coronavirus has barely dented Splunk's growth rates or its transition toward becoming a cloud-based subscription offering like most other SaaS companies in the market. A late adopter of the SaaS model, Splunk has now succeeded in building up a ~$2 billion ARR (annual recurring revenue) base with a target of growing at a rapid >40% y/y CAGR through FY23. The company recently released Q1 results that showed Splunk marching well ahead of this goal, sending shares skyrocketing more than 10%:Data by YChartsI last wrote on Splunk when the market was at its nadir in mid-March; since then, amid a ~20% recovery in the S&P 500, shares of Splunk have shot up an impressive ~70% and are reaching for new all-time highs. Despite now crossing the double-digit forward revenue valuation mark, I still believe Splunk to be a strong long-term investment.There's a lot to like about Splunk that makes the bullish case for this company quite clear. As already mentioned, Splunk's product is quite unique in the market. Its software essentially allows business leaders to glean undiscovered insights from their own data. In a world where most C-suites have championed the use of ""data-driven decision making,"" companies are now keen to find out what information they can squeeze out of the data they already have. Unlike many of the other large-cap SaaS companies like Salesforce.com (CRM) or Workday (WDAY), Splunk isn't in a crowded space with many companies pending CRM or HCM systems. In addition, Splunk serves an almost inexhaustible list of use cases, ranging from security to inventory monitoring and data visualization. Splunk is applicable to companies in virtually any industry. As a result, Splunk has a fairly uninhibited path to growth as long as companies' hunger for data insights continues.Splunk's SaaS transition also gives it a durable recurring revenue base. Splunk also has a history of being profitable and highly cash flow positive (aside from recent quarters as the company's SaaS shift has pushed out revenue over longer streams). In other words, it's easy to see Splunk joining the pantheon of large-cap, mission-critical enterprise software platforms.Stay long here and continue to ride Splunk's momentum upward.Let's now go over some of the key highlights of Splunk's most recent quarter. The key message here: Splunk continued to show impressive progress toward its long-term targets, even in spite of the coronavirus. Current-quarter results are less relevant for Splunk as they are for other companies, because Splunk's in-transition business model means that revenue/profits will get pushed out of this quarter in favor of longer and more sustainable revenue streams. This quarter's flattish revenues (+2% y/y) this quarter that missed Wall Street's expectations is simply a reflection of the fact that Splunk pushed more deals into cloud (and thus, deferred more revenue into the future) than expected.As such, ARR is one of the best ways to gauge Splunk's progress, and one that smoothes out the noise caused by Splunk's in-progress cloud transition and bookings/billings data. See the company's ARR trends in the chart below:Figure 1. Splunk ARR growthSource: Splunk 1Q21 earnings deckARR grew at a rapid 52% y/y pace this quarter, virtually unchanged from the ~50% y/y growth rate over the past several quarters. This tells us that, despite the onset of the coronavirus in March, Splunk has so far been virtually unimpacted. This positions Splunk well to achieve its stated goal of ""mid-40s"" ARR growth for FY21, and >40% CAGR through FY23.Interestingly, CEO Doug Merritt's comments on how Splunk's customers have behaved in response to the coronavirus are rather mild. Many other software companies like Alteryx (AYX) have reported that customers have lengthened sales cycles and postponed heavy IT projects, a category in which Splunk would fall into. However, Merritt says that customers have merely shortened their contract durations (average contract durations shortened to 27 months in Q1, versus 35 months in Q4) rather than completely pulling the plug. When excluding the length of these contracts, Merritt says that contract ACV signed in Q1 hit a four-quarter high - not exactly what we'd expect amid a global pandemic. Per his prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:This commentary helps to support the thesis that the coronavirus done limited damage to Splunk, with lower bookings from clients in heavily-impacted industries offset by a general need for clear data insights. We note as well that Splunk has seen terrific growth in its nascent cloud segment, supporting its transition to being a full software-as-a-service solution. Cloud ARR grew at a rapid 82% y/y pace, while cloud as a percentage of total revenues reached a sky-high 26% in Q1, nearly double the prior Q1. Merritt says Splunk is ""continuing to double down"" on cloud, as it accelerates Splunk's ability to reach new customers and offer greater flexibility, while also leading to longer-term deployments.Figure 2. Splunk Cloud mixSource: Splunk 1Q21 earnings deckSplunk's move upmarket has also been even more pronounced this quarter. In Q1, the company signed 81 deals in excess of $1 million in annual ACV, representing 76% y/y growth. Recall as well that Splunk is recent FedRAMP certified, meaning federal government sales are now also possible:Figure 3. Large ordersSource: Splunk 1Q21 earnings deckAnd in spite of any coronavirus headwinds that may have impacted billings and collections, Splunk managed to grow operating cash flows by 31% y/y in Q1. By FY23, when Splunk expects its subscription transition to be largely complete, the company expects to achieve north of $1 billion in annual operating cash flow. CFO Jason Child reiterated this target during the Q&A portion of Splunk's most recent earnings call:Figure 4. Splunk OCFSource: Splunk 1Q21 earnings releaseSplunk remains a rarefied growth story in the software sector, and one that is just beginning to show its potential as a true cloud/SaaS offering. The fact that its product is versatile and serves an endless number of use cases underscores our confidence in Splunk's ability to become one of the most significant and widespread software platforms. Stay long here."

As it does this, it has to overcome its headwinds from last year, as now it books its contracts annually rather than all upfront.This shift depresses its near-term revenue growth rates and cash flow generation. The idea behind that as we get closer to its long-term fiscal 2023 target, investors will see Splunk generating $1 billion in revenues and growing at a rapid clip.And while this is very alluring, indeed, I'm admittedly less bearish Splunk than I was, I continue to be puzzled by the multiple investors are willing to pay for participation in this company's future prospects.It appears that mentioning cloud growth is all it takes to see any stock that is not yet trading for 20x forward sales to reprice higher. And this is frightening.The discrepancy between old-era companies and new-era cloud stocks; if this doesn't remind you of that period in the late '99 and early 2000s, nothing will.And I'll be honest with you, Splunk's results are exciting. Yes, on a GAAP metric, its results are fairly unimpressive. But behind GAAP accounting, it is where the fun takes place. Come with me, and I'll show you.Source: Q1 2021 Investors PresentationSplunk guides to grow its ARR at approximately mid-40s percent for fiscal 2021.For this investor, paying north of 11x forward sales for a company that is expected to grow with a CAGR of 40% is simply too expensive.The video together with the article show that although I'm less bearish the company than I previously was, I still can't find enough upside potential that warrants my capital deployment here."
4350929,35181,2020-05-29T14:44:19-04:00,"Splunk is a leader in Big Data/SIEM and is transitioning to a recurring revenue business model.The recent pandemic-driven acceleration from a perpetual license to ARR skews revenue growth, making it appear to be flat.Fundamentals are strong and will carry the company through this time of uncertainty.My opinion is that the stock price is undervalued relative to its peers, making it a good buying opportunity.","In my last article on Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), titled ""Splunk: A Slam Dunk Buy,"" I issued a very bullish rating on this Big Data/SIEM company. One pandemic and bear market later, this stock is up 16% while the S&P 500 is down 7%.(Source: Seeking Alpha Premium)Similar to when I last wrote about Splunk, the stock is again in breakout mode. The stock has come a long way after bottoming at a price below $100 in March, and it recently touched a new all-time high and is now sitting at ~$182 for a gain of more than 80% in a couple of months.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)The question now arises: what now? The market for digital transformation stocks has been shaky this week with indications that ""return to work"" will happen soon. But Splunk stock has held up, maintaining its breakout posture. This is a good sign and suggestive of future gains to come.Splunk is one of the more difficult stocks to analyze, as the pandemic has accelerated this company's transformation to a recurring revenue business model which is distorting revenue growth. The YoY revenue growth for Q2 is expected to be flat.It should that guidance for the remainder of the year has been withdrawn. Despite the withdrawn guidance, Splunk has several positive factors going for it, including expected ARR growth of mid-40% for this year, consistent operating cash flow, and a strong balance sheet of $1.76 billion in cash and equivalents, it should survive the pandemic and recession quite nicely.(Source: Splunk)Given the stock breakout, undervaluation, and strong company fundamentals, I am giving Splunk a very bullish rating. This company will be around and in good shape once the pandemic scare subsides and global growth restarts. This company is one of my favorites.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. In Splunk's case, the revenue growth is distorted due to the transformation to a recurring revenue model. Therefore, I am using the growth in total ARR instead, which is 52% YoY.The company's TTM free cash flow margin dropped dramatically in the most recent quarter to -16%. I believe this is due to the margin compression associated to the big acceleration in conversions to ARR. (Source: Splunk/Portfolio123/MS Paint)The Rule of 40 calculation for Splunk is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 52% - 16% = 36%The score is slightly lower than the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb. But this doesn't bother me too much given the temporary drop in free cash flow that should recover to positive territory once the accelerated shift to recurring revenue subsides.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 150+ stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Splunk stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Splunk is positioned below the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is undervalued on a relative basis relative to its peers.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Splunk. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent of the Dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Back then, I quadrupled my investments in a few months. Technology stocks were hopping. But it wasn't long before the market turned into a disaster zone with the Nasdaq index dropping by ~70%.While Splunk is undervalued in my opinion, the same cannot be said for some of its software peers. Companies such as Zoom (ZM), Shopify (SHOP), Atlassian (TEAM), and Coupa (COUP) are extremely overvalued. A market crash led by these software stocks could cause Splunk to get swept along with the crowd.The biggest risk to Splunk's business is if customers are unable to continue making payments according to subscription schedules. Some of Splunk's customers are asking for shorter contract durations due to market uncertainty. Ultimately there could be some subscription defaults due to the pandemic and global recession.Splunk is a leading-edge company involved in the area of Big Data and SIEM. Splunk is in the midst of transitioning its business model to recurring revenue, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. This transition is clouding the company's financials, making it appear as if revenue growth is flat, and compressing margins. The transformation also causes Splunk to fail on the Rule of 40, although not by much, and I expect it to bounce back in future quarters.Given that the company's fundamentals are strong, and in my opinion, the stock price is undervalued, I expect that Splunk will emerge from the pandemic in terrific shape and continue to perform well thereafter. The stock price is pushing to new all-time highs, suggesting more bullishness to come. For these reasons, I am giving Splunk a very bullish rating."
4343147,69905,2020-05-05T14:27:18-04:00,"Splunk's revenue growth rate of 10% for fiscal 2021 is not likely to be met. Indeed, Splunk is likely to pull its fiscal 2021 guidance.Splunk's ARR is not the same as total revenues.This investment remains overvalued at more than 8 times forward revenues.","Splunk (SPLK) is a cloud platform that allows customers to harness the value of their data. And no matter how attractive and promising this may sound, this rhetoric is not being translated into its financials.Before COVID-19, Splunk's revenue growth rates were already pointing towards deceleration. The bullish argument has been that as Splunk migrates its customers towards a subscription-based business model, there is expected to be a period of deceleration and that Splunk should bounce back next year.But I fail to buy this argument. Here's why:To avoid confusion please note: Splunk's fiscal 2021 ends in January 2021.We are approximately 2 weeks away from Splunk's Q1 2021 earnings report. This report will show just how realistic its full year 2021 guidance has been. In the past, many investors positively charged that Splunk was low-balling its 2021 revenues to allow for plenty of room for beating estimates; but I do not believe that to be the case. In fact, I suspect that Splunk will pull its 2021 guidance.However, regardless of whether or not its guidance ultimately gets pulled, it shows that Splunk was on target to post just 10% of revenue growth in fiscal 2021.Again, the thesis is that Splunk is taking its customers away from one-off licenses, towards a subscription-based business model. This means less revenue upfront but more stability and predictability for Splunk as it books that revenue pro-rata.Indeed, herein lies the whole bullish thesis: If Splunk is able to successfully migrate its customers away from one-off purchases, towards being locked in over a period of years, then this investment could be rewarding at a certain valuation (more below).When Splunk had its earnings call at the start of March, CEO Doug Merritt was bullish about the company's near-term prospects. However, we obviously know what happened globally in the second half of March.Thus, at the time, Merritt noted that he believed that in fiscal 2022 (next year), Splunk should rapidly increase its revenue growth rates from this year's 10% all the way up to the high 20%s growth.Source: Author's calculationsConsequently, readers should attempt as much as possible to discern in the upcoming earnings call, just how realistic this target will be. Objectively, even the most bullish shareholders would probably admit that in fiscal 2021 (this year), Splunk is not likely to reach 10% year-over-year revenue growth rates. What makes me say so?IBM (IBM) is noted in Splunk's 10-K as being one of its main competitors in a few different avenues. Furthermore, we have recently noted in IBM's earnings how challenging the IT market is looking currently, and how business intelligence vendors are struggling. I believe that Splunk could be similarly affected as its customers cut back on all non-essential IT spend.Further complicating the overall picture, Splunk points investors towards its 40% ARR CAGR over the next three fiscal years.To be clear, this ARR is not total revenue. This ARR is simply for its software revenues or approximately 70% of its total revenue. Put another way, this ARR amounted to just $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020, meaning this potential is already priced in.As stated throughout, Splunk has positioned itself as a fast-growing company. However, aside from this rhetoric, its total revenues are not actually growing that fast.Presently, investors are considering paying approximately 9 times trailing revenues as a strong bargain opportunity. However, this is a trailing metric. We know that during the end of March and early April, many companies have had to decrease technology spending as their particular sectors compress in the face of the global recession.Indeed, looking ahead, I doubt that Splunk will reach its $2.6 billion revenue guidance. However, assuming that Splunk does indeed guide for $2.6 billion in revenues, this would imply that investors are paying 8 times forward revenues for a company that has not been able to generate any profits thus far.Investors have been seduced by Splunk's high ARR narrative while forgetting that ARR is not Splunk's total revenue. Splunk's ARR amounts to just 70% of its total revenues.Meanwhile, investors are paying more than 8 times forward revenues even though its revenue growth rates don't look all that appetizing at just 10% for fiscal 2021.With so many vastly better investment opportunities elsewhere in the market, investors are overpaying for this investment."

Big data is a huge and growing market, and tailwinds like 5G and IoT are likely to ensure Splunk's growth remains strong in the future. Splunk's valuation is modest given these factors and the potential for high profit margins through continued operating leverage.There has been an explosion in the growth of data in recent years, with this growth being dominated by unstructured data. Unstructured data includes text, images, video, audio, and sensor data from IoT devices and is currently growing at a rate of 26.8% annually compared to structured data which is growing at rate of 19.6% annually. Search and analytics tools for unstructured data are still relatively nascent, and Splunk is one of the leading providers of technology to extract value from both structured and unstructured data.Figure 1: Growth in Data(Source: m-files)There are a number of trends which are driving increased demand for data analytics technology, including:Splunk's solutions have a broad range of applications, and as a result, the addressable market is huge and growing rapidly. Elastic NV (ESTC) is a competitor with a similar suite of products and they estimated their total addressable market was approximately $37 billion in 2019. In comparison, Splunk estimated their total addressable market was $32 billion in 2012 and this opportunity will have grown significantly over the past 8 years due to a combination of market growth and Splunk's use cases increasing.Table 1: Elastic Estimated Market Opportunity(Source: Created by author using data from Elastic)Table 2: Splunk Estimated Market Opportunity(Source: Created by author using data from Splunk)Splunk is an enterprise software company whose mission is to make machine data accessible, useable, and valuable to everyone. Their software allows users to ingest data from a range of sources and turn that data into meaningful insights through analytics. Primary use cases for the software include infrastructure and operations management, security and compliance, software development and IT operations, applications management and business analytics, and to provide insights into IoT data. In addition to providing customers software solutions, Splunk also provides maintenance and customer support, training and consulting, and implementation services.Splunk's software collects, indexes, stores, and archives data from any source in real-time (websites, applications, servers, networks, sensors, and mobile devices). Some of the advantages of Splunk's software include that a data schema does not have to be pre-defined, APIs allow data to be forwarded to other parts of the IT network and machine learning is embedded in the software, although these capabilities are common across competitors. Splunk also includes a web framework and Software Development Kit (SDK) which allows developers to build applications on top of Splunk and allow integration with other applications and systems.Splunk EnterpriseSplunk Enterprise is a real-time data platform that is capable of data collection, indexing, search, reporting, analysis, alerting, monitoring, and data management. Splunk's technology allows them to deliver speed, scalability, and advanced analytics when processing massive amounts of data in applications like anomaly detection, event grouping, and prediction. In addition, users do not need to define or understand the structure of data prior to collection, indexing, and search. This allows users to rapidly begin utilizing data and allows the platform to employ a broad range of data. Splunk offers Splunk Enterprise as a cloud service which eliminates the need for customers to purchase, deploy, and manage infrastructure.Splunk PremiumSplunk Premium solutions are sold separately to Splunk Enterprise and extend the capabilities of the basic platform.AppsApps provide functionality in the form of pre-built workflows, searches, and reports that make it easier for customers to address specific use cases.Add-On CapabilitiesThe Splunk data platform can also be extended with optional add-on capabilities that enhance the ability to process and transform data in real-time.Splunk products are designed to enable low friction adoption by limiting the need for customization, long deployment cycles, and professional services during deployment. Other measures used by Splunk to encourage customer adoption include free online sandboxes and free trials of the on-premise and cloud products. While Splunk is focused on reducing friction during the purchasing process, they do rely on a proprietary search processing language which means their product has a relatively steep learning curve, although they also offer a drag-and-drop interface for non-technical users.Splunk uses a combination of direct and indirect sales which is typical of enterprise software companies with expensive products that require high touch sales. Sales partners (distributors, resellers, global system integrators and managed service providers) include large consulting organizations like Accenture (ACN), Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and contribute to sourcing, co-selling and fulfilling sales. Partners are an important distribution channel with the majority of Europe, EMEA, APAC, and U.S. Public Sector sales involving heavy partner engagement.Splunk continues to invest aggressively to address new use cases and drive enterprise-wide adoption within existing customers. Acquisitions are a significant part of this effort with recent acquisitions including SignalFx, Omnition, VictorOps, and Streamlio for their expertise in cloud-native and data streaming solutions. Splunk is also trying to foster its user community in the hope they deliver applications that extend the Splunk platform into new use cases. User communities also provide support and education and develop resources to support novel use cases.Splunk provides a number of pricing options that give customers flexibility, but these options are also generally aligned with Splunk's cost of service delivery.These pricing options are another method of reducing friction by allowing customers to choose a pricing option that suits their organizations requirements and encourages prospective customers to utilize Splunk's products.Splunk's revenue growth is declining but remains relatively robust for a company of its size and could benefit revenue tailwinds in coming years due to growth in data volumes and companies becoming increasingly interested in utilizing data. Splunk investors will face expanding revenue and compressed EV/S multiples in coming years and will need revenue to grow faster than multiples contract. If Splunk can stabilize revenue growth at current levels through new product initiatives and improved sales and marketing, then shareholders are likely to be rewarded.Figure 2: Splunk Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from Splunk)Splunk's gross profit margins for both subscription and services are high and the benefit of this is beginning to flow through to the bottom line as the company scales and growth moderates. High gross margins are likely reflective of Splunk's positioning as a premium product that aims to deliver rapid return on investment for customers, not necessarily low costs. Splunk's high operating leverage should result in continued improvements in operating profitability in coming years which is likely to be supportive of the company's EV/S multiple.Figure 3: Splunk Gross Profit Margins(source: Created by author using data from Splunk)Figure 4: Splunk Operating Profit Margins(source: Created by author using data from Splunk)For a subscription software company R&D and sales and marketing expenses can both be viewed as investments in future growth and Splunk's current level of profitability should not be a cause for concern at all. Much of Splunk's improvement in operating profitability is due to reduced R&D burden as the company scales. R&D spending is still high though and is likely to be reduced in coming years as Splunk's market matures.Figure 5: Splunk Operating Expenses(source: Created by author using data from Splunk)Figure 6: Comparable Company Operating Expenses(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Delivering real-time business insights from data covers a large number of use cases and will become all-encompassing in coming decades which is likely to attract competitors from a range of areas. Splunk groups their competitors according to the following:Splunk believes that competition is based primarily on product features, performance and support, product scalability and flexibility, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership and time to value and most of Splunk's recent initiatives have targeted improvements in these areas.Cloud computing giants like Amazon and Microsoft are a current threat to Splunk and edge computing vendors like Cloudflare (NET) and Fastly (FSLY) could become competitors in the future. Cloud compute and storage is a natural fit for data warehousing and analysis which covers a significant portion of Splunk's use cases. Cloud computing vendors are adding functionality like search and databases to their offerings to strengthen their competitive position in the cloud computing market. Software vendors like Splunk face the threat of becoming collateral damage as cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft compete for market share.The proximity of edge computing vendors to endpoints puts them in a strong position to compete in data logging and shipping, another of Splunk's core markets. Cloud computing vendors are likely to move into edge computing as the market develops, enabling them to offer full stack solutions. Competition from edge and cloud vendors may not pose a significant threat in the short-term, but Splunk needs to ensure it has strong products that are entrenched in their customers' systems, so they are not displaced when challenges come.Figure 7: Potential Strategies for Cloud Computing Giants(source: Created by author)Splunk faces a number of competitive threats from software vendors, which are likely to become more apparent as the market matures. Splunk's software meets a range of use cases across industries and in some cases supports other applications. This is similar to Datadog and Elastic although the scope of Datadog's software is narrower than Splunk's and the scope of Elastic's software wider. There is no inherent advantage to this as a broader scope creates a larger addressable market but leaves the company vulnerable to focused competitors who can better meet specific use cases.Figure 8: Splunk's Competitive Landscape(source: Created by author)In the future, Splunk is likely to face increased competition from companies moving into adjacent verticals. For example, cloud native cyber security vendors are likely to offer a portfolio of services covering all security use cases, including SIEM. Splunk must ensure that their software continues to better meet customer needs than competitors who can offer integrated solutions. If companies like CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) are able to add value for customers by offering a comprehensive suite of solutions, they could potentially lock Splunk out of important markets.Figure 9: Application Vendor Strategies(source: Created by author)ElasticElasticsearch was first publicly released in 2010 and Elastic was founded in 2012 to commercialize the opensource software. Elasticsearch is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine and datastore for exploring all types of data including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured and unstructured. Elastic promotes their product as being able to reliably and securely take data from any source, in any format and search, analyze and visualize it in real-time. Elastic's success has been based on providing tools that improve the speed, scale, and relevance of search for databases, websites, applications and mobile and connected devices.Elastic has taken an opensource approach as they believe it facilitates rapid adoption of their software which is evidenced by the 350 million downloads of the software between 2013 and 2018. Elastic's reliance on opensource software is a risk as other companies are able to adopt the technology for free. It is also a potential advantage as a large community has been created around the software which acts as a pipeline for future sales.The difference between Splunk and Elastic's strategy can be seen in the customer growth and average revenue for each company. Elastic has far higher growth in customer numbers but much lower average revenue per customer. Splunk's Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Lifetime Value (LTV) are both much higher than Elastic's although the difference between LTV and CAC for each company is similar. It should be noted that the LTV and CAC values are estimated using some large assumptions and are meant to be illustrative of the different strategies of the companies, not accurate estimates.Figure 10: Splunk and Elastic Customers(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Figure 11: Splunk and Elastic Customer Metrics(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Splunk has a relatively strong competitive position and should continue to benefit from industry tailwinds over the short-to-mid-term. In the long run, Splunk is likely to face increasing competition from cloud infrastructure vendors and a range of applications in addition to customers integrating backwards. As a result, Splunk needs to continue improving the functionality of their technology and reducing friction for customers to remain a leader. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, I estimate the intrinsic value of Splunk to be approximately $240 per share. They are a strong company that should continue to reward shareholders although I believe there are better investment opportunities in the big data space.Figure 12: Comparable Company EV/S Ratio(source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)"

Having landed over 90 of the Fortune 100 companies as its clients so far and reaching over $2 billion of annual revenue last year, the company will turn to the SaaS model to accelerate growth further. Upon the complete transition into SaaS, Splunk will benefit from a higher-velocity customer acquisition process and better pipeline visibility as opposed to its historical contract-based model. We will maintain our overweight rating on the stock.(source: company’s Q1 earnings call)Splunk is a deep-moat enterprise software company with ARR accelerating at +40%. Even without the transition to the cloud, Splunk is already one of the most well-performing and most innovative software companies with its ARR accelerating at +40%. Splunk’s core offering is equipped with a patented dynamic log search technology, which can query, ingest, and process heterogeneous data. This proves to be the company’s competitive advantage in the business, given the offering’s capacity to process massive amounts of real-time security, DevOps, and even business-related data. Given the big-data capability and variety of use cases, the company has established a niche in the high-valued enterprise segment. As enterprise customers like Intel, Shopify, Blackstone, Hyatt, Nasdaq, and more have come on board, the total number of orders > $1 million has increased by over 68% to 494 over the last two years.(source: company’s Q1 earnings call slide)However, with the company growing at a staggering 40% CAGR to potentially reach ~$5 billion of ARR and ~$1 billion of OCF (operating cash flow) in 2023, it will be harder and harder for the company to move the needle on growth.Consequently, the shift to the cloud-based delivery model will enable a higher-velocity sales process with better visibility, eventually accelerating overall growth. With the cloud-based delivery model, potential customers will have more frictionless access to onboard themselves into the product, have a look around, and try the product before arriving at the decision-making process: to have a chat with the sales team or purchase/subscribe directly from within the platform.(source: splunk.com)As illustrated by the hypothetical yet typical user journey, the decision-making process will happen at a relatively shorter cycle, eventually accelerating top-line growth in the long-run. Furthermore, the fact that all these trials are happening within Splunk’s cloud-based platform will allow for a more effective individual user tracking based on various parameters such as features used or usage frequencies, which will result in a more contextual lead qualification process and eventually better pipeline visibility.There are no major risk factors we see in Splunk at present, though in our experience, its strong value proposition in the enterprise segment has not been to relevant in the mid-size or SMB segments. Within those segments, we have seen various competitive offerings by players like Mixpanel, SumoLogic, Nagios, or LogDNA that target more specialized log management use cases at much more affordable pricing points. As such, Splunk’s recent acquisitions of VictorOps and SignalFx, which possess a more diverse customer base, appear as a lower-risk move to penetrate the lower end of the market while expanding into fast-growing DevOps Incident Management and APM segments.Given the transition period into SaaS that affects its revenue recognition, profitability, and visibility into the full year, it would be quite challenging to evaluate Splunk from a P/S perspective. The ARR acceleration and the overall progress of the cloud transition, however, have been very impressive. There are not a lot of SaaS companies that can confidently guide a mid-40% growth in ARR, let alone under the current circumstances. Using its expected FY 2021 ARR of ~$2.4 billion as a proxy to its revenue, the Splunk’s P/ARR stands at ~12x, considering its ~$30 billion market cap.

It is growing rapidly, it has a large total addressable market, and it has tremendous momentum from its exposure to industry megatrends (i.e. the cloud, big data, the ""internet of things,"" and security). Further, its strategy of continuous innovation is being validated as the company wins very large deals. Investors should not be distracted by a temporary slowdown in revenue growth, as the company has wisely transitioned to a subscription model. This article reviews the business, its strategy, valuation (the sell-off is overdone) and risks. We conclude with our thoughts on investing.Splunk is a big data company which provides real-time insights by analyzing machine data generated across devices. In addition to enterprise big data analytics, Splunk also offers security, application management, and compliance solutions. The company is transitioning to a cloud-based SaaS offering by switching to a subscription-based pricing model and away from a perpetual license model. While this transition will weigh on the company's revenue growth and profitability in the near term, we are encouraged by its long-term growth potential. An early look into fiscal 2021 and beyond should give investors some comfort, as the company is looking for mid-40% annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth for the next three years and operating cash flow of ~$1 billion by FY23. While there remains skepticism over guidance for continued cash burn in the next fiscal year, we see ARR as a strong measure of the business momentum.The company is transitioning to a cloud-first approach (and away from its traditional on-premise perpetual license model). Splunk noted that ~35% of its software business was cloud in fiscal 2020, and it expects cloud to ramp at a strong pace over these next few years, reaching over 60% of its total software bookings in fiscal 2023. In its latest Q4 earnings call, management noted:(Source: Company Presentation)Fiscal-year 2020 cloud revenue was $312 million, up 82% from 2019. However, ARR (derived from both its cloud and term license products) grew to $1.68 billion in 2020, up 54.1% from the prior year. We believe ARR is the most important metric to measure the health of the business. And Splunk is guiding for mid-40% ARR growth in FY21 and further anticipates sustaining 40% ARR CAGR through FY23. Additionally, it is looking to generate ~$1 billion in operating cash flow by FY23.(Source: Company Presentation)With current expectations that cloud will contribute to a substantially higher proportion to overall bookings in fiscal 21, it follows that revenue growth will slow in FY21 to ~10% YOY to ~$2.6 billion. And then snap back starting in fiscal 22, with annual revenue growth in the high-20% range in both FY22 and FY23. This could increase further as perpetual maintenance conversions to term or cloud is not baked into ARR guidance, a source of potential upside in ARR growth longer-term.(Source: Company Presentation)During Q420, Splunk won a mega deal, almost a nine-figure contract (the largest in its history) from a global online company outbidding 15 others. Additionally, the company won several other large deals (35 in total during Q4), which exceeded $10 million in contract value. We believe these deals validate the strategic perception of Splunk within the largest of enterprises and also highlight the importance of continuous innovation led by SPLK's Data-to-Everything Platform launched in September 2019. Additionally, acquisitions (such as SignalFx and Omnition) and innovative products (such as Splunk Data Fabric Search (DFS), Splunk Data Stream Processor (DSP) and Splunk Business Flow) have further enhanced SPLK's positioning across various areas (including Security, Artificial Intelligence, Operations and Application Development). In the future, we foresee increasing numbers of large enterprises engaging in strategic relationships with Splunk.(Source: Company Presentation)Splunk is present at the intersection of several industry megatrends including cloud, big data, IOT, and security. The company estimates its total addressable market opportunity to be around ~$62 billion (as per a March 2018 presentation). As per the company's estimates, by 2020, the digital universe will generate 44 zettabytes of data. The total data production will be 44x more in 2020 versus 2009, and the number of devices connected to IP networks will be more than 3x the global population by 2021. All these trends suggest an increase in demand to store, transmit, and analyze data. Additionally, the majority of data generated from devices is unstructured, thus making it harder for enterprises to use it. This is where Splunk comes in. By making it easy to capture unstructured data from any source and analyze it in real time, Splunk acts as a tool for providing operational and business insight and action. We believe Splunk is well positioned to benefit from the impending data explosion.CEO Doug Merritt noted during the Q4 earnings call:We compare Splunk to other cloud-based SaaS pure-plays (see figure below). Specifically, Splunk recently trades at a ~9.4x TTM EV to Sales multiple, representing a ~23% discount to its peer group average. We believe investors are skeptical given near-term growth challenges as highlighted by lighter FY21 guidance. However, this is primarily due to the transition to cloud and also the new accounting standard (ASC 606) adopted by SPLK (which impacts revenue recognition and makes growth seem slower than it actually is). That is why we think it is important to focus on ARR (up 54% YOY) which is a strong leading indicator of the health of the business. However, beyond FY21, sales growth is likely to accelerate into the mid-20s as the company begins to benefit from the renewal of previously booked contracts. We believe the company's current valuation fails to incorporate the very strong underlying business growth.(Source: Company data, Yahoo Finance)Coronavirus outbreak. While the coronavirus outbreak is already causing a dramatic impact on stock prices (including Splunk), Splunk has some advantages as a cloud-based SaaS business (i.e. social distancing). However, the outbreak will impact the company's short-term ability to close deals (considering travel and face-to-face meetings will decline). However, we believe companies with a high dependence on the perpetual license model are most at risk, as software sales and support staff are unable to travel due to restrictions (we note that Splunk has discontinued new perpetual licensing as of Q4).Increased competition. Splunk operates in an emerging and attractive market for cloud services which already boasts large established players, as well several small vendors. Given the attractiveness of the industry, we may see an influx of new entrants, which could adversely impact pricing.Splunk is an impressive rapidly-growing business with very large opportunities ahead. Further, the recent sell-off has gone too far, and its valuation is attractive, especially relative to peers. For these reasons, Splunk is one of our favorite investment ideas (a few of our others include Enphase (ENPH), Teladoc (TDOC) and China's Luckin Coffee (LK), which we've written about in detail here, here and here). If you are looking for powerful long-term growth, Splunk is absolutely worth considering for a spot in your prudently diversified long-term growth portfolio."
4331735,100666,2020-03-13T03:19:03-04:00,"Splunk reported its earnings after the market close on Wednesday. On Thursday, its stock price fell almost 10%.I first explain what the company exactly does to make money.The Q4 results looked less good but exceed expectations.The guidance numbers are completely obscured by a shift to a SaaS and cloud model.After the 40% drop, the company sells at a P/S of just 7. With almost 300% ARR growth over the next three years, it looks quite cheap.","Last Thursday, March 5, after the markets closed, Splunk (SPLK) reported its earnings. The stock dropped 14% after the market hours, recovered about 10% after the conference call and then fell almost 10% on Thursday when the broad market sold off. Together with the broader market, Splunk's stock price kept falling and it is now down 40% in just 17 trading days.Data by YChartsIn this article, I will try to give some insights into the earnings and the guidance, which is much better than it looks. The switch to SaaS and cloud revenue goes much faster than Splunk had foreseen and that obscures the numbers. But if you look deeper, you can see that the company is firing on all cylinders.What exactly Splunk does to make money is maybe not that easy to see for the average investor. I think many know that Splunk has 'something' to do with (big) data. But what exactly does it do? The short answer is that Splunk helps companies to make sense of their big data.We live in a world of huge data creation. Just think of smartphones, smart speaker and virtual assistants, wearable devices, the growing internet-of-things, and so much more data-generating devices. There is an estimate that there are about 50 billion connected devices now.Maybe if you hear 'data', you only think of the internet, mobile phones, apps, etc., and those generate a huge amount of data, of course, but there is much more. A lot of industrial equipment creates data too and they will create them more and more in the future, with sensors, smart meters, alarms, etc. Think of cars, they collect so much data: speed, fuel use, weather, your location and the way that you take to work, for example. But then think of airplanes and how much more data they collect.All those devices create an enormous amount of data, big data. Splunk can help companies to make sense of all those data to give them insights that they can use. Splunk uses AI (artificial intelligence) to sort and visualize data and pour them into insightful buckets. (Source)Splunk sets itself apart from other big data companies because it can handle all sources of data and that the applications are very broad: IT (of course), security, industrial processes, customer services, etc. Splunk can be used on-premise, on a private cloud or the public cloud.(Source)In March 2018, on its investor presentation, the company estimated that its TAM was $62B at the time but was still expanding.And customers seem to appreciate what Splunk does and really love Splunk's products. The company has had consistently high customer retention rates of 94%-95%:(Source)The stock price has done very well since the company made its debut in March 2012:Data by YChartsBefore the recent fall, Splunk tripled the market's return, but still, it underperformed versus its revenue growth over the last three years.Data by YChartsSplunk reported its Q4 2020 (yes, Splunk is a year ahead of the calendar) results last Thursday, March 5. The non-GAAP EPS of $0.96 missed estimates by $0.01, while GAAP EPS of -$0.15 missed by $0.17. Q4 2020 revenue of $791M was up 27.2% YoY and beat the estimates by $7.66M. But especially guidance underwhelmed investors. I think that was a mistake.Splunk guided lower for Q1 2021 and although its guidance for FY2021 was raised, at 10% it still couldn't make investors enthusiastic. But if you look under the covers, there is a lot more going on and the frog is actually a beautiful prince.Splunk is in full transition. CEO Doug Merrit on the Q4 2020 press release:The big shift? As for many companies, it's a shift to the cloud and a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) model and that transition was started in 2019. SaaS is a superb model because it gives companies a clear stream of stable and growing revenue and it reduces the lumpiness from year to year.Cloud products are projected to be responsible for more than 60% of the total software revenue of Splunk in a few years and that's very likely because the company has exceeded its guidance of 25% cloud revenue now. It already accounted for 35% of the revenue. That has consequences for the numbers, as I will explain later.In the past year, fiscal year 2020, Splunk's ARR (annualized recurring revenue) grew by 54% and that's the most important thing to look at right now.(Q4 2020 earnings call deck)The ARR growth even accelerated in each of the last five quarters, as you can see and the subscription revenue keeps growing at an impressive rate of 80%.The number of customers with big orders also grew impressively:(Q4 2020 earnings call deck)This allows Splunk to grow its already impressive gross margins even more:(Q4 2020 earnings call deck)Nonetheless, the stock is down a lot, and not just on COVID-19 fears. Splunk guided for 6% YoY growth in Q1 2021 and a negative operating margin of -25% and you can understand why investors sold off the stock. Growth seems to fall like a rock here. Splunk bought SignalFx for about $1B and you can see the easy picture to paint: Splunk can only grow with acquisitions.But that really is not the case. As we have seen in stocks like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), the transition from perpetual contracts to the cloud and to a SaaS model can really cloud the strength of the results for a few years. But compared to those transitions, Splunk's transition really goes very smoothly and at high speed. It has already almost eliminated its perpetual software licenses and 99% of its bookings now come from renewable contracts.With the new model, Splunk also had to introduce new accounting standards that cloud the numbers even more. Licensing is accounted for in another way than cloud revenue.Cloud was expected to contribute about 25% of software bookings, but it was much higher at 35% of the total contract value. That's very good for Splunk, of course, but cloud revenue recognition is divided over time and not immediately, as for term contracts. The much higher revenue from the cloud makes that the revenue growth seems slower than it actually is. Splunk targets to get 60% of its revenue from cloud contracts in 2023. That's why the company just shows a 6% revenue growth in its guidance for Q1 2021 and 10% for FY 2021. Remember that I said at the beginning of the article that ARR (annual recurring revenue) growth is the best metric to look at right now? ARR shows how Splunk really grows and at 54%, it's fast.High growth on top and bottom line.This quote from Splunk's CFO Jason Child on the Q4 2021 conference call is very important for long-term investors:The numbers (mid 40% for this year and then 40% for the next two) are very impressive. I repeat a chart that I have already used, but this time for another reason:As you can see, the ARR of Q4 2020 was $1.68B. With the projected mid-40% growth of 2021 (I took 45%) and 40% growth for the next two years, Splunk would rake in $4.77B in FY2023, an impressive growth of 284%.That ARR growth will be translated to operating cash flow that goes from negative to around $1B in 2023:With the current price of $103 (AH on Thursday, March 12), Splunk has a market cap of $16B, which means that it trades at a 2023 P/OCF of 16, quite cheap for a company that is expected to grow its revenue (and earnings) at a pace in the high 20% or even low 30%.After the big drop (the stock is down 40% from its top), Splunk only trades at 7 times sales. Given the high growth expectations, this seems a very reasonable price. Of course, if the COVID-19 problems keep bringing down the economy, the projections may be optimistic and the stock may sell off much more but that is a timing issue. For long-term investors, gradually adding to Splunk might bring excellent returns. I will keep a close watch on this one and if it becomes even cheaper, I might start a position.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from me, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4332170,104608,2020-03-16T10:09:33-04:00,"Splunk reported a strong Q4 with revenue coming in ahead of management's previous guidance and margins remaining healthy.
        FY21 revenue and operating margin guidance were well below expectations given the mix-shift to cloud revenue being recognized ratably over time.
        Stock has pulled back over 25% since reporting earnings a few weeks ago and long-term investors should be excited about growth prospects and profitability in the coming years.","Even though Splunk (SPLK) reported a better than expected Q4 with revenue and margins coming in ahead of expectations, the company's stock proceeded to trade down ~25% since reporting. The negative stock reaction was partially due to the broader market sell-off, but can also be attributed to the company's FY21 revenue and operating margin guidance coming in below expectations.The company's FY21 revenue guidance of ~$2.6 billion was ~10% below expectations, though management noted the mix-shift towards cloud revenue, which is recognized ratably over time rather than upfront, causes some inconsistencies in underlying revenue growth. Even with this mix-shift causing some revenue and profitability headwinds for the upcoming years, the company noted revenue will likely return to high-20% growth in FY22-FY23 with operating margins closer to 20% by FY23.SPLK currently trades ~6.9x FY21 revenue and has seen their valuation pullback in recent weeks given the negative stock movement. However, the company's medium-term targets of revenue returning to high-20% growth and operating margins close to 20%, I believe longer-term investors will be rewarded over time.The stock could continue to be volatile over the short-term as investors wait for the market to return to normalcy and they have a better understanding of the coronavirus and global economic environment. However, with the stock pulling back 25% in the past few weeks, I believe this could be a great opportunity to pick up a few shares for longer-term investors.Revenue during Q4 grew 27% to $791 million and came in above expectations for ~$785 million and well above management's previous guidance of ~$780 million. The beat during the quarter was primarily related to another strong quarter of software revenue, which grew 33% to $617 million, now representing nearly 80% of total revenue.Source: Company PresentationCloud revenue during the quarter remained very strong, growing 86% in Q4, accelerating from the 78% growth seen last quarter. Cloud revenue represents over 20% of total software revenue and as large enterprise continue to shift more of their workloads to the cloud, Splunk is sure to be a benefactor. Cloud revenue also typically comes with higher margins given the lack of hardware product and the high level of recurring revenue. While this revenue stream is only ~20 of software revenue, the hyper-growth and strong market demand will continue to drive Splunk's overall revenue growth.The company received their FedRAMP authorization a few months ago and has already started to reap some of the benefits. When it comes to deal sizes above $1 million, this area grew 23% compared to the year ago period, demonstrating the company's ability to go after a new subsegment of the market, that being federal and state governments. Even though this area of the market is not necessarily the fastest growth, it is a relatively untapped market with a lot of growth potential.Annual recurring revenue grew 54% during the quarter to $1,680 million, which showed some slight acceleration from the 53% growth last quarter. This metric accounts for subscription, term, and maintenance contract annual recurring revenue and investors will likely start to follow this growth rate pretty close.Source: Company PresentationGross margin during the quarter came in at 86.7%, which was down slightly from the 87.6% in the year ago period, though was better than the 85.8% last quarter. The solid gross margins led to operating margins of 24.1% during the quarter, which was slightly lower than the 26.8% seen in the year ago period. The company continues to reinvest in the business in order to expand to other geographies and ramp up larger deals. However, over time, I believe margins are likely to expand given the higher margins associated with cloud, software, and recurring revenue streams.Source: Company PresentationFor Q1, the company is expecting revenue of ~$450 million with non-GAAP operating margins of negative 25%, well below the past several years of solid profitability. The revenue guidance was ~15% below consensus in addition to profitability being well below.For FY21, the company is expecting revenue of ~$2.6 billion, which came in ~10% below expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be breakeven, which compares with ~14% operating margin profitability in FY20. The company continues to shift their mix of business to accelerate more towards the cloud, with cloud bookings expecting to be 60%+ by FY23.As a reminder, cloud revenue is recognized 100% ratably over time, which differs from historical revenue streams which can be recognized upfront. Thus, the greater revenue from cloud will cause lower initial revenue recognition, which is why FY21 revenue guidance was below expectations.While this mix-shift is expected to be detrimental to revenue and margins over the next year, once this laps, the company will return to strong revenue growth and profitability. The company noted revenue will likely return to high-20% growth in FY22-FY23 with operating margins closer to 20% by FY23.While the company's initial guidance came in below expectations, management noted this was largely due to how cloud revenue is recognized compared to their historical revenue streams. The company also noted revenue growth and operating margins will return to normality following a transition year period as the mix-shift moves more towards cloud revenue.Nevertheless, the company's stock traded down over 25% as investors needed to recalibrate the company's growth potential. While the revenue growth and profitability will remain under pressure over the next year, I believe the company will be able to reaccelerate their growth and profitability once the transition to more cloud revenue reverses in the outer years.Even though the company has a history of beating and raising their expectations, the transition to an increased amount of cloud revenue, which is recognized more ratably over time, caused management to provide revenue and margin guidance well below expectations. While this will return to normalcy after a year of transition period, revenue growth and profitability will be lower in FY21.With a current market cap of ~$18.0 billion, $1.75 billion of cash/investments and $1.7 billion of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$18 billion. Using management's FY21 revenue guidance of ~$2.6 billion, this implies a FY21 revenue multiple of ~6.9x.Even though revenue growth came in below expectations due to mix-shift to more cloud, the company did not they believe revenue growth will return to high-20% in FY22-FY23 as well as operating margins return to ~20% by FY23. Rather than looking at revenue growth in FY21, I am more inclined to use the next few years of revenue growth to determine valuation.Assuming revenue growth returns to 25%+ the following two years after FY21's mix-shift transition period, I believe investors will become more inclined to pay a higher valuation for the name, especially as operating margins expand closer to 20%.While the stock has traded down over 25% since reporting earnings, I believe part of this pullback was due to the broader market sell off that hit a majority of software names. The current cloud transition period likely put some fear into investors as they had to reset their expectations over the next few years. Nevertheless, I remain a long-term bull and would look to add more shares at the current level and valuation.Risks to SPLK include revenue growth not returning to 25%+ growth over the following years as well as operating margins remaining under pressure. Typically when a software company begins to see revenue growth decelerate, operating margins and profitability expand. If this does not turn out to be the case for SPLK, investors could punish the name over the next few quarters."
4330894,69905,2020-03-10T11:21:52-04:00,Investors underreact to Splunk's Q4 2020 results and guidance.Splunk's 3-year 40% ARR CAGR may not be enough for shareholders to hang onto.Investors should avoid this overvalued stock.,"Splunk (SPLK) delivered Q4 2020 results which surprised the market and led to an abrupt sell-off, -14%. The sell-off then worsened as it combined with pervasive coronavirus fears.However, I contend underlying this volatility, Splunk delivered a thesis-breaking report.I contend that shareholders are overpaying for a company that is overvalued in the face of decelerating revenue growth rates. Here's why:The whole point of investing in a high growth, recurring revenue business model company is that it should have two noteworthy aspects:With that in mind, please note the graph below:Source: author's calculations; *** company guidance for 2021 (calendar 2020)How is this growth rate in any way stable or predictable? We can see that just two years back Splunk was growing its total revenues at close to 40%, and now looking forward to fiscal 2021, it's guiding for just $2.6 billion of total revenue.Bullish shareholders would retort that Splunk is guiding low to allow for sandbagging. Possibly. Nonetheless, the drop from growing at 40s% two years ago to just 10% is odd.Management declares that it's nothing to worry about, that this decline in revenue growth rate has more to do with the mix of contracts and its booking of ratable revenue.In fact, management asserts that once Splunk gets into fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, its growth rate should rapidly 'bounce back' into the high 20s% growth rates.To give shareholders something to look forward to, management notes that over the next three fiscal years, it is targeting 40% ARR CAGR.Now, let's break this target down:Source: Slide 15The first aspect that is important to note is that its ARR for fiscal 2021 is pointing towards 45% growth. Given that Q4 2020 finished with an ARR of 54%, this marks a significant slowdown.Source: Slide 9The next critical aspect to mention is the small print below. According to industry-wide practice, the ARR is a run-rate from Q4 2020 going forward.So my question is, why is this Q4 2020 exiting run-rate at 54%, but for fiscal 2021 it's down to just 45%? The next obvious question being, what will Splunk's total ARR be in 2022? Common sense leads one to believe it will be sub 45%.Now, to go full circle, how much conviction will investors have on Splunk's ability to bounce back its total revenues to the high 20% in fiscal 2022?Below is another signpost for investors to hang onto:Splunk is targeting $1 billion of cash flows by fiscal 2023 (calendar 2022).However, consider this, Splunk acquired SignalFx for just shy of $1 billion in October 2019. We should have minimally expected this acquisition to boost its revenues into fiscal 2021, but that's clearly not playing out.Thus, my next question, just how much of that fiscal 2023 $1 billion of operating cash flow actually be organic? And is it sustainable?My final argument boils down to a discussion over its current market cap.A lot needs to go very right for Splunk to reach that $1 billion cash flow target. As the graph higher up notes, thus far, Splunk is significantly cash flow negative and has shown a consistent inability to become profitable.Hence, my question to readers is whether paying up a $20 billion market cap, for a company that may or may not reach $1 billion in cash flows from operations more than three years out, makes for a worthwhile investment?Splunk's revenue growth rates are steadily declining and not aligned with the narrative of a high growth, steady and predictable business model.Given its consistent inability to make any profits, I believe investors are pricing in too much hope on its future potential and are highly likely to be disappointed."
4331436,103480,2020-03-12T11:07:50-04:00,"Shares of Splunk have lost ~35% from their peak, accelerated by both a poor Q4 earnings release and general coronavirus concerns.In particular, investors worried about the company's shortfall in Q1 and 2020 revenue guidance, though a large portion of this ""miss"" is due to Splunk's cloud transition.Shifts to cloud-based subscription models will sap near-term revenues in exchange for steadier, more profitable long-term revenue streams.The company has reaffirmed its extraordinary target of hitting 40% y/y CAGR in annualized recurring revenue over the next three years.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.When the markets come crashing down, prudent investors know it's time to go shopping. High-quality businesses that were once too pricey to invest in are now suddenly for sale, and Splunk (SPLK) sits firmly in this category. The mid-cap software company, best known for its machine data tools that help clients leverage their internal system data to generate business insights (particularly around security), has hit a rough patch of late, down 35% from all-time highs and outpacing declines in the broader S&P 500.Data by YChartsSplunk just reported fourth-quarter results, and with it also announced guidance for 2020. Investors' first reaction: not impressed. This guidance shortfall is the primary catalyst pulling shares of Splunk downward. Take a look at the guidance below:Figure 1. Splunk FY21 guidanceSource: Splunk 4Q20 earnings releaseFor the full year, Splunk guided to only $2.6 billion in revenues, representing growth of +10% y/y versus FY20 revenues of $2.36 billion - and falling far short of Wall Street's expectations of $2.82 billion (+20% y/y).Without any further context, this shortfall would be worrying indeed. But we have to recognize that Splunk has been undergoing a multi-quarter transition to cloud. For investors who are familiar with the cloud journeys of other companies like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), you'll recall that companies undergoing cloud transitions end up deferring what used to be large, upfront deals into longer-term subscriptions. Over the long haul, however, subscription customers deliver far more value.Splunk has been pushing its subscription offerings lately. Though Splunk has historically been an on-prem license company, its big announcement last year was the Splunk Data-to-Everything Platform, which Splunk has marketed as ""a constant pulse on your business"" that brings data insights to questions and decisions across organizations. Offerings like these are converting Splunk's customer base from on-prem users to subscription consumers.This article will give an update on the progress of Splunk's cloud transition, which is overlooked by the market amid Splunk's FY21 revenue miss. I'm sticking to my bullish call on Splunk and holding a price target representing 9x EV/FY21 revenues, indicating a price of $150 and 36% upside from current levels.The first and most important point that investors should be aware of is the fact that Splunk has renewed its commitment to grow ARR at a 40% CAGR through FY23.Figure 2. Splunk long-term targetsSource: Splunk Q4 earnings deckTo put this number into perspective, we have to recognize the fact that Splunk already has an ARR of $1.68 billion as of the end of FY20. Very few software companies ever reach that scale, let alone on a recurring revenue basis alone. To grow such a large revenue base at 40% y/y over the next three years is another thing entirely. As a useful reference marker, Workday (WDAY) currently has a subscription revenue base of roughly ~$3 billion (only slightly above the $2.44 billion at which Splunk expects to end FY21), but its growth has fallen below 30% y/y.Ballooning ARR has many side benefits. For one, revenue visibility improves. Out of Splunk's $2.6 billion revenue forecast for FY20, $1.68 billion (65%) is already contractually committed - not to mention the fact that Splunk still has plenty of on-prem legacy license revenues to make up the shortfall, in addition to any new business and expansions signed in the year. This gives us plenty of confidence in Splunk's FY21 revenue guidance, even if the number is a little light (the high percentage of committed ARR makes us even believe there's several points of opportunity on top).As we can also see from the chart above, Splunk's growing subscription business will also yield tremendous profitability benefits. Though FY20 and FY21 are expected to be investment years in which Splunk will generate minimal cash flow, the company eventually hopes to generate >$1 billion in operating cash flows per year. The fact that Splunk has shown a clear path to breakeven is an important indicator in a turbulent market that has zeroed in on tech companies' profitability.We also think it's likely that Splunk can outperform this 40% CAGR target. Note that Spunk exited Q4 at a subscription ARR growth rate of 80% y/y, while total ARR grew 54% y/y. At the very least, Splunk's ARR forecast of $2.44 billion for FY21 (+45% y/y) looks like there could be several points of upside.Figure 2. Current Splunk ARR trendsSource: Splunk Q4 earnings deckCloud has been a difficult battle to win with some of the large blue-chip companies that have preferred to cling to their old systems. Yet Splunk's growing recognition and clout has boosted its sales among large corporates.In the chart below, we highlight that Splunk took in 494 orders above $1 million in FY20, up 25% y/y. Even more impressively still, the number of orders above $10 million jumped 46% y/y to 46.Figure 3. Splunk large order trendsSource: Splunk Q4 earnings deckRecall as well that Splunk also recently received FedRAMP certification, which means it's qualified to become a vendor to federal agencies of the United States. We've already seen from the landmark contested Pentagon cloud deal (which Microsoft (MSFT) won, and Amazon (AMZN) is contesting - expected to be worth $10 billion over several years) that federal agency deals can be among the biggest wins for software companies, and Splunk is now in the running.Another recent development that came alongside the release of Splunk's Data-to-Everything offering is a new pricing system designed to give customers more flexibility in their consumption of Splunk. Though pricing changes have often proven rocky for other software companies, Splunk's pricing change seems to have executed well. Per CEO Doug Merritt's qualitative commentary on the Q4 earnings call:This friendlier, adaptable pricing approach should be a tailwind in FY21 for landing new business and earnings conversions from on-prem to cloud.Of course, the reason why Splunk is such a strong buy right now is that in spite of these subscription-transition strengths, the stock's valuation has fallen off a cliff and has plenty of room for upside when the market rebounds. At present share prices hovering around $110, Splunk has a market cap of $17.13 billion. After netting off the $1.79 billion of cash and $1.71 billion of debt on Splunk's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $17.05 billion. This puts Splunk's current valuation at a cheap 6.6x EV/FY21 revenues. Here's how that stacks up to other mid/large-cap SaaS companies at a similar 30-40% y/y growth range in subscription revenues:Data by YChartsAs previously noted, I continue to believe Splunk can rebound to 9x forward revenues, implying a price target of $150 (where Splunk has traded as recently as February). Stay long here until that reversal happens."
4323244,69905,2020-02-11T16:21:14-05:00,"Revenue growth rates decline, but details here are critical.I question Splunk's actual future profit margins.Savvy investors would do well to avoid this stock.","Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is being valued at more than $25 billion market cap, yet is incurring heavy losses and appears to be losing steam as its revenue growth rate is decelerating.Here, I argue that most of the upside is already being priced into the stock and that shareholders are likely to leave this investment with a loss of capital.Back in November 2019, I presented the following table, noting Splunk's revenue growth trajectory:Source: author's workIt is on this note that I'm compelled to broaden our discussion and emphasize to investors why they should pay heed to the clear pattern of revenue growth contraction noted above.Splunk brands itself as a cloud platform that allows customers to harness the value of their data. With so many buzz words, you are perhaps forgiven for questioning why this company is not valued even higher?Indeed, Splunk has alluring numbers and isn't shy to points investors' attention towards them - as vindication that its business model continues to gain traction with customers:source: Slide 7Thus, although Q3 2020 saw a 40% increase in software revenues (including renewable license revenues) compared with the same period a year ago, it shows that its revenue from software sources fell slightly in Q3 2020 compared with Q2 2020. Please see below:Slide 5: contribution from renewable software sourcesSplunk's CEO Douglas Merritt argues that this sequential drop was nothing material and that it was mostly a function of customers adopting final perpetual purchase. Of course, if you follow this space closely, you will be incredibly attentive to any negative vicissitude in the graph above. If this number doesn't increase in Q4 2020, I would be cautious.The graph below is what I call profits before costs:Source: Slide 13This is a tongue-in-cheek comment, but it alludes to the fact that the bulk of Splunk's costs are carefully added back and thus afford the investors no tangible guidance as to how profitable Splunk may end up being in the future.Specifically, please note that figures below detail Q3 2020 figures, rather than fiscal 2020 (calendar 2019) highlighted above.The bulk of Splunk's costs are added back in the red table, as stock-based compensation. And with these add-backs, Splunk's margins are still guided to finish fiscal 2020 at sub 13% non-GAAP operating profit margin.Moving on, in the graph that follows, I picked out some rough peers to Splunk.Data by YChartsShareholders would rightly contend that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is not a direct peer to Splunk. And I agree: IBM (NYSE:IBM) would be a much better comparison as a competitor to Splunk.The problem though is that, for now, investors are grouping all SaaS players as one and the same. Investors are hoping that their chosen SaaS company will able to gather more than its fair share of the rapidly-growing data market, that CEO Merritt reminded investors during the last earnings call, that digital transformation investments are projected to reach $6 trillion in the coming 4 years. It is the hope that Splunk might gain significant share that makes its market cap so richly valued.However, with nothing but heavy GAAP profit losses, and no objective data as to how its profit margins will ultimately unfold, investors have little to go on.On the other hand, for now, investors are more than happy to ignore any naysayers and remain steadfast on Splunk's FY 2023 guidance shown below.Source: Slide 14(Source)Paying more than 11 times trailing revenues for an unprofitable company, with no real competitive advantage, makes for a very unattractive investment. With so many cheaper and more profitable cloud players, it is hardly worth this speculation."
4315689,35181,2020-01-07T23:11:14-05:00,Splunk has broken out of a trading range that has persisted throughout 2019.The transition from perpetual license to rateable billing has clouded the company's financials.The stock price is fairly valued on a relative basis.I am raising my rating from Bullish to Very Bullish.,"In my last article on Splunk Inc. (SPLK), titled ""Splunk Is Still A Great Buying Opportunity,"" I issued a bullish rating on this Big Data / SIEM company. The stock is up 18% since the article was published, one of my better calls in the last 6 months.Now Splunk's stock price is in breakout mode. This price action is something that investors should not be ignoring. This company stock is progressing to the next step higher after being range-bound for most of 2019.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Unlike many other software high-growth darlings, Splunk is not overvalued, at least not according to my relative valuation scheme. And after ""accounting for accounting,"" I'm having difficulties finding a reason not to buy this stock.It appears to me that the company is staying ahead of the competition with real-time unbounded machine learning and other initiatives. Therefore, competition is not a factor and sales growth is full steam ahead. Given the chart pattern, market leadership and sales growth, I am shifting gears by changing my rating from Bullish to Very Bullish.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Private software based on tools/data from Portfolio123)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Splunk is sitting directly on the best-fit trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is typical to its peers given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Splunk is fairly valued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as the P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I generally look at other factors such as the SG&A expense margin to determine cash burn.In the case of Splunk, however, an examination of margins is not particularly useful because the company is in the process of switching from a perpetual license to a ratable invoicing business model. It was stated on the 2020 Q3 earnings call that cash flow is depressed and will not swing positive until FY'22.(Source: Splunk 2020 Q3 earnings presentation slides)Sales growth appears to be slowing down, but this is due to the conversion from a perpetual license to subscriptions.(Source: Splunk 2020 Q3 earnings presentation slides)Total Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is growing at a rate in excess of 50% annualized. This is probably the best metric for growth given the transitional state of the company's business model.I recently wrote an article featuring Elastic N.V. (ESTC), titled ""Elastic: An Exciting Investment Opportunity."" In this article, I indicated that Elastic would be competition for Splunk in the SIEM market. Commenters also suggested that Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have competing products.The truth is that there is a lot of competition, but I believe that Splunk is one step ahead based on recent developments such as the Splunk Data Stream Processor.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. I would not dismiss the possibility of a dot-com-like crash in the future.There are other uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes, and President Trump's impeachment, that could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.There is also some question about the limited growth rate of new large customers. The response from company management on the 2020 Q3 earnings call was:There is also the possibility that cash flow does not bounce back in FY22 as promised. Competition may also prove to be more fierce than anticipated.Splunk is one of the leading-edge companies involved in Big Data and SIEM. The company is in the midst of transitioning its business model, and this has clouded its financials, including margins and revenue growth.Given the fact that Splunk is a high-growth company, an investment in it should not be judged based on value metrics. Growth in ARR is in excess of 50%. Cash flow is negative but should bounce back strong in FY22.According to my relative valuation scheme, Splunk is fairly valued. The stock is currently exhibiting a substantial breakout, and I believe that investors should take notice. I am revising my rating from Bullish to Very Bullish."
4309664,69905,2019-11-28T11:43:37-05:00,The message from Splunk is that customers are happy to adopt its renewable contracts.The message for shareholders is that its revenue growth rate is decelerating.I declare readers should temper their enthusiasm and sidestep this stock.,"Splunk (SPLK) has incredible momentum, and its stock up more than 50% over the past twelve months and far outpacing the S&P 500 (SPY). Splunk has continued to push the bar of success and has been rewarded for doing so.However, the problem now is that Splunk's success has been factored in so many times already, not only fully eroding its stock's margin of safety, but the pendulum has also now overswung and is priming shareholders for pain.This stock is best avoided for now.The massive takeaway this past quarter was that Splunk was converting its customers away from single sales toward renewable (or recurring contracts), and investors loved it. The stock popped and hasn't looked back.But I start to question just how stable and predictable these rates actually are?Source: author's calculationsIn the past, Splunk was consistently growing in the high 30s% year-over-year. Presently, looking out to Q4 2020, it appears that Splunk's revenue growth rates are now approaching just 25%. Isn't this pointing toward an 11% deceleration in just 12 months?On this front, bullish shareholders would accuse me of misunderstanding the big picture: that most of Splunk's customers are now on renewable contracts:Source: Q3 2020 slide 4Admittedly, renewable software revenue is up, but this time last year, it was already above 80% too. The recent bump, if anything, is a slight drop sequentially.During Q3 2020 results call, Splunk's President & CEO Douglas Merritt charged that data is a 'strategic asset' - which I concur. Merritt went so far as calling data the new paradigm for solving the world's most pressing problems.On the other hand, in the Q&A section of the call, Merritt acquiesced that for some of its customers, Splunk's value proposition was ''new news or not entirely understood by them'' and how Splunk will have to ramp up and ''lean on'' marketing to explain to these customers how they will benefit from harnessing their own data.The whole point of moving away from its legacy offering of one-off sales toward a renewable contract is to improve its cash flow visibility. And here is the carrot for investors to latch onto:Investors willing to hold out until calendar 2022 (3 years out) are likely to be rewarded with very strong cash flows.Splunk's CFO Jason Child proclaims that investors will have to embrace a little more pain before pleasure. How Splunk's vision is to patiently defer maximizing cash flows and how Splunk continues to ramp up expenses to continue its land and expand strategy.Next, it is worthwhile understanding that Splunk has plenty of competition, although this is predominantly privately held. Thus, what follows are the more established big players:And the table above notes there is a wide range of investor sentiment.From the Big Blue, IBM (IBM), trading in the bargain basement, but being incredibly poorly managed; to Microsoft (MSFT) which is well-funded, laser-focused, and insanely driven.On balance, from a valuation standpoint, investors are having to pay a heavy price to become shareholders in company with decelerating growth rates.The message out of Splunk is that its customers couldn't be happier to be on renewable contracts. And everything is ticking along smoothly.For shareholders, I fail to see anything smooth. If I see anything, it is an overvalued stock, with declining growth rates, and an enterprise that may (or may not) reach $1 billion in cash flows from operations (before capex) in calendar 2022.Even if Splunk succeeds in reaching this far out target, investors are already paying close to 25x forward (hypothetical) cash flows from operations.In summary, I believe this is too much risk and too little reward."
4308991,103480,2019-11-25T11:34:09-05:00,"Shares of Splunk skyrocketed more than 10% after the company reported stellar third-quarter results.Revenues grew 30% y/y (software revenues up 40% y/y), powered by pricing changes that are driving increased usage.Splunk Cloud also recently achieved FedRAMP certification, enabling it to sell to the federal government.Margins and profitability are also on the rise and expected to continue growing via the cloud transition.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), the machine data company known best for its use of predictive algorithms to harvest insights from internal system data, is in the early stages of a long rally. The company just reported third-quarter results that massively outperformed Wall Street's expectations, giving the stock a ~10% lift:Data by YChartsLast quarter, I highlighted Splunk as a strong buy due to the following drivers:In addition to strong third-quarter financial results that validated this thesis, Splunk also introduced some new bullish drivers for investors to dig into.The first is a pricing change, one that has powered revenue growth in Q3 and will continue to be an important driver of customer expansion in future quarters. CEO Doug Merritt, on the Q3 earnings call, describes it as follows:The second is FedRAMP approval. As veteran software investors are aware, some of the largest deals to be had in the business are with the federal government - in the past, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has signed nine-figure deals with federal agencies. In Q3, Splunk Cloud received FedRAMP approval, which is the first step to entering into government bake-offs, and giving it the chance to win huge cloud deals. See the press release announcing FedRAMP certification here.With so many tailwinds behind Splunk, the stock remains a strong buy - even though it's gained double-digits since last quarter. At present share prices near $140, Splunk trades at a market cap of $21.68 billion. After netting off the $1.89 billion of cash and $1.69 billion of convertible debt on the company's balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $21.48 billion. For the next fiscal year (FY21), Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus revenues of $2.82 billion, representing fairly conservative 22% y/y growth (per Yahoo Finance). Against this revenue estimate, Splunk trades at a still-reasonable valuation of 7.6x EV/FY21 estimated revenues. In my view, the company can stretch up to a 9x forward revenue valuation, implying a price target of $164 and a 17% upside to current levels.Stay long here and ride the upward momentum.Splunk performed well overall in Q3 - total revenues of $626.3 million grew 30% y/y and blasted past Wall Street's expectations of $605.2 million (+26% y/y) by a solid four-point margin. But underneath the hood, what's critical to highlight is the fact that Splunk is achieving better-than-expected revenue growth despite faster-than-expected cloud progress, which typically run counter to each other (a deal signed in the cloud generally means revenues that would typically have been recognized upfront as a license deal will now get spread out over several future quarters).Splunk's transformation from legacy, expensive license product into a cloud-native, modern SaaS application is one of the underpinning bullish drivers in its arsenal.Figure 1. Splunk renewable revenue mixSource: Splunk Q3 earnings deckAs seen in the chart above, the company's year-to-date revenues are now 91% renewable, up fourteen points from 77% in the year-ago quarter. This gives Splunk not only excellent revenue visibility but also means that it's not starting each year from scratch. New business only tacks onto the existing revenue base that the company already has.Another metric that helps to showcase Splunk's cloud prowess: its subscription ARR has seen accelerating revenue growth. In Q3, Splunk's subscription ARR grew 86% y/y to $368 million, accelerating five points from last quarter's 81% y/y ARR growth. As previously mentioned, one of the driving catalysts behind this was a change in Splunk's pricing schema, which has encouraged deeper usage by its customer base.Figure 2. Splunk ARRSource: Splunk Q3 earnings deckSplunk customers are also signing on for longer deployments. As shown in the chart below, average contract durations keep unchains upward, hitting an all-time high of 33.2 months for cloud deals in Q3 (and even license deals saw a record-high near 38 months this quarter).Figure 3. Splunk contract durationsSource: Splunk Q3 earnings deckSplunk's ""land and expand"" business model has also greatly boosted the company's margins, as customers that retain for longer are far more profitable customers as they cost comparatively little in incremental expenses relative to new business. Gross margins hit a sky-high 85.8% this quarter on a pro forma basis, growing 130bps y/y, while operating margins also jumped 320bps y/y to 16.8%.Equally important to note: while Splunk's cloud investments have diminished cash flows in the short term, the company also issued an incredibly bullish cash flow prediction for FY23 (three fiscal years out). By then, the company expects to generate ~$1 billion in operating cash flows per year, more than 3x what the company was able to generate previously:Figure 4. Splunk OCF forecastSource: Splunk Q3 earnings deckThere's a lot to like about Splunk exiting the third quarter. The company has continued to retain impressive growth rates despite an ever-increasing mix of cloud bookings, while pricing changes have prompted a re-acceleration in subscription ARR growth. Moreover, we have the prospects from FedRAMP certification to look forward to in the cloud space, which could trigger large deals in the near future. Stay long here."
4294382,103711,2019-10-01T11:23:09-04:00,The growth of data is inevitable: This means great opportunity.SPLK enables customers to collect and analyze data.Shares have struggled due to their transition to a renewable revenue model.SPLK is a strong buy.,"Data is only going to keep growing. This is guaranteed by, among other things, the increased use of smartphones and the digitization of everything. Along with all that data lies opportunity for analysis - this is where Splunk (SPLK) comes in. SPLK is a software company that enables customers to collect and analyze data. Shares have sold off from all time highs after they guided for lower operating cash flows due to their increased recurring revenue mix. Shares are very attractively priced and I rate shares a strong buy.We are living in a world of incessant data explosion. SPLK estimates that data production in 2020 will be 44 times greater than it was in 2009, and that the number of connected devices will be more than three times the global population by 2021:(2018 Analyst Day)That’s a lot of data, and companies are realizing that properly analyzing the data is necessary to gain insight on how to better improve their businesses. SPLK helps customers collect, analyze, and extract the maximum value from that data.(Splunk.com)Because SPLK is able to process all data regardless of the format, customers are able to very quickly get a return on investment as they can avoid the typical long deployment cycles and extensive professional services that might be seen at traditional enterprise competitors. We can see below their customer mix in FY2012:(Splunk Overview Slideshare)As we can see above, SPLK is useful for basically every industry - the digitization of everything only helps SPLK by increasing the total addressable market. SPLK has since grown to be used by 92 of the Fortune 100: This is best of breed.A critical measure of customer satisfaction, SPLK has seen very high maintenance renewal rates:(2018 Analyst Day)As stated earlier, data keeps growing. This plus their ability to cross sell other products has led to SPLK being able to continually drive growing revenues from existing customers:(2018 Analyst Day)As expected, SPLK has capitalized on this growing market opportunity as seen from their rapidly growing revenues:(2018 Analyst Day)With the growth of data not appearing to slow down, SPLK looks perfectly positioned to capitalize on these secular tailwinds and I expect to see very high revenue growth for years to come.SPLK has for the most part traded sideways in the past year:(Yahoo Finance)This appears to be due to their transition toward a recurring revenue model. A quick primer: Software companies like SPLK can sell their services either through perpetual licenses, term licenses, or cloud. In a perpetual license, the customer pays for all services upfront and gets to use the software indefinitely. In a term license, the customer gets to use the software for a specified time period and pays for services annually. These two services tend to be “on premise” which means that customers download the software and use it directly. Cloud revenues are similar to term licenses in terms of the recurring revenue model but customers would instead use SPLK software over the cloud. Nowadays technology companies are preferring the recurring revenue model because it leads to less lumpiness in revenues year to year. This stronger business model then warrants a higher valuation multiple.We can see below that perpetual licenses used to make up the bulk of software bookings and that SPLK had guided for approximately a 75% recurring revenue mix for FY20:(2018 Analyst Day)It turns out that they low balled those estimates as renewable software revenues have instead been 91% year to date:(FY20 Q2 Presentation)This is in large part due to the accelerated growth seen at cloud, which saw a ridiculous 80% growth rate:(FY20 Q2 Presentation)Their term and cloud revenues, which form their “renewable software revenues” mix, on average have contract durations of almost three years:(FY20 Q2 Presentation)SPLK has guided for all new software sales to be from term or cloud licenses by the end of the year. While long-term investors should be cheering this aggressive transition due to the more stable revenues moving forward, this has had a negative impact on operating cash flows because whereas perpetual licenses are cash paid upfront, term licenses and cloud are instead paid ratably. We can see below that this should lead to their effective invoice yield (basically how much of the contract value they get in cash now) to drop from 58% in the first half of this year to 33% in the second half of the year:(FY20 Q2 Presentation)Previously, the company had guided for positive $250 million in net operating cash flow for the full year, but due to the accelerated shift toward renewable revenues this guidance has been modified down to negative $300 million. It appears that Wall Street is taking time to digest this news as they weigh the positives of the recurring revenue mix against the drawbacks of lower operating cash flows in the near term. My view is that the current negative cash flows are arguably irrelevant in the grand picture as SPLK should inevitably see significant operating leverage and associated profits very soon.Due to the near-term pressures to operating cash flows, it's important to ensure that SPLK has a solid balance sheet. SPLK has $2.6 billion in cash, equivalents, and investments.SPLK also has $1.27 billion of 0.50% convertible notes due 2023 and $862.5 million of 1.125% convertibles notes due 2025. These convertible notes are both convertible at a share price of $148.30 (every $1000 note is convertible to 6.7433 shares). There’s some rules that allow the notes to be converted earlier than their maturity dates but because I view SPLK as being worth more than $148.30 possibly now and most certainly later, I include the future share dilution in my calculation of diluted shares outstanding. That’s approximately 14.2 million shares that appear inevitable to be issued for the notes.So with basically a net cash balance sheet, SPLK looks well capitalized to make it through any near-term operating cash flow challenges. I expect SPLK to be free cash flow positive by the end of next year and most definitely 2021 (though I note that this would be adding back share based compensation).SPLK recently acquired SignalFX, a company which provides real-time cloud monitoring solutions. This looks like an opportunistic acquisition which strengthens SPLK’s offerings in cloud. I note that SPLK does have enough liquidity to fund the recent acquisition of SignalFX, which SPLK has intended to fund with approximately $600 million in cash and $400 million in stock. In total, SPLK has made 10 acquisitions in a relatively short period of time. I anticipate that SPLK can create significant value through tuck-in acquisitions due to their large customer base in a similar manner as seen at Salesforce (CRM).SPLK has guided for $2.3 billion in revenues for the full year. This implies that SPLK trades at around 8 times revenues based on 155.4 million in diluted shares outstanding. That’s dirt cheap, but the revenue number is misguided. At first glance, it seems reasonable to use the full revenue number as even the maintenance and services segment appears to have positive gross profits:(2019 Q2 10-Q)However, as we can see below “cloud services” is hidden in their maintenance and services segment. When taken out, the remaining maintenance and services revenues presumably have much lower gross margins:(2019 Q2 10-Q)While maintenance and services does still have positive gross margins, I view the profit margins and growth to be much lower than the software counterparts. As a result I instead only count software revenues, which totaled $1.4 billion for the trailing twelve months. Furthermore, I include an additional 14.2 million shares from the convertible notes in my calculation of shares outstanding. This leads to a price to trailing sales multiple of around 14.7 times. It may seem absurd to be paying such a multiple for a company without GAAP profits. Naturally, such an investment requires certain assumptions about forward profitability. I'm projecting at least 22% operating margins for SPLK long term. Based on the current growth rate, my fair value range for SPLK is anywhere between 15 and 35 times sales. A conservative midpoint is 20 times sales, which would correlate to a 90.9 times “earnings multiple” assuming that just referenced 22% operating margin (20/0.22= 90.9). This represents a share price of $165.60, or about 37% upside in the next 12 months. I note that this upside target does not include the value creation from ongoing revenue growth - throw in 40% revenue growth and I could see SPLK easily trading above $200 in 12 months.Data won’t stop growing. That’s an undeniable reality in this digital age. SPLK helps companies harness the full potential of that data. Given their strong revenue growth and low valuation, SPLK is a strong buy.(Tipranks: Buy SPLK)"
4307785,20715,2019-11-19T13:11:58-05:00,Splunk is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Thursday.The company has seen tremendous earnings growth in the last few years and sales have been increasing as well.The stock has been grinding sideways in 2019.Sentiment toward the stock is mixed.,"Application software firm Splunk (SPLK) is set to report third-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Thursday. The company is expected to report earnings of $0.54 per share on revenue of $604.24 million. It reported EPS of $0.38 in the third quarter of 2018, meaning analysts expect earnings growth of 42.1%.Splunk has experienced tremendous earnings growth over the last three years, averaging growth of 108% per year. Earnings jumped an incredible 275% in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2018. Analysts expect earnings to grow by 44% for 2019 as a whole.Revenue has seen impressive growth as well, just not as much as earnings. Over the last three years, revenue has increased by an average of 38% per year and it jumped by 33% in the second quarter. Analysts expect revenue to increase by 28.4% for 2019.While the earnings and revenue growth are very impressive, the management efficiency measurements are average. The return on equity is at 15.2% and the profit margin if as 12%.One thing that seems to be driving the growth for Splunk is the overall trend in almost every aspect of life - using analytics to a greater degree. The technological advancements have allowed businesses, schools, hospitals, and individuals to gather and store incredible amounts of information and now the emphasis is on how to interpret and use the data that is available.It seems kind of fitting that Splunk calls its product ""the Data-to-Everything platform"". As the trend continues toward more analytics based decision making, products like the ones Splunk offers will continue to see greater demand in my view.As impressive as the earnings and sales growth have been for Splunk, the price action on the stock has been very choppy in 2019. It's been up above the $140 mark on several occasions and it has been down below the $110 level several times as well. There is a slight upward slant to the lows over the past year, but it isn't an overly convincing trend.We see on the weekly chart how the stock has remained above its 104-week moving average for the last couple of years and seems to have used the trendline as support on a couple of occasions in the last few months. I know the 104-week isn't a commonly used moving average, but I find it useful as it represents two years worth of data.As far as the overbought/oversold indicators, the 10-week RSI is almost right in the middle of its range at 51.65. The weekly stochastic readings are above the midway point, but are far from being overbought at this time. The stock reached oversold territory back in September and has rallied a little since then.Looking at the sentiment indicators for Splunk, we see a mix of optimism and pessimism. There are 40 analysts covering the stock at this time with 33 ""buy"" ratings, six ""hold"" ratings, and one ""sell"" rating. This puts the buy percentage at 82.5% and that indicates a little more optimism being displayed toward the stock than the average company.The short interest ratio shows the opposite with a reading of 4.5. This reading is higher than the average stock and indicates a certain degree of skepticism toward the stock. The ratio has vacillated quite a bit over the last few months, but that has been more about the drastic changes in the average daily trading volume. The number of shares sold short had been somewhat consistent, but the short interest did drop by 1.1 million shares in the second half of October.The put/call ratio is at 0.885 with 36,386 puts open at this time and 41,134 calls open. This reading is a little lower than average, but not by a great deal. Because the ratio is calculated with the puts as the numerator, a low reading is indicative of more optimism. In the case of Splunk, the reading is a little below the 1.0 average, but the ratio is higher than it was back on August 21 when the company last reported earnings. The ratio was at 0.77 back in August.Looking at Splunk with a long-term view, I think the stock will continue to trend higher as the demand for the company's products will continue to grow. The intermediate outlook is a little less bullish in my view and that is mainly because of the choppiness on the chart and the mixed sentiment picture.If the stock was in a clearer upward trend, I would be more bullish for the next few quarters. If the sentiment were skewed toward the pessimistic side, I would be more bullish for the next few quarters. As it is, the chart isn't all that convincing as far as saying, ""Hey, I have to buy this stock now."" Because the sentiment is mixed, I don't think there is enough pessimism that can switch to the bullish camp to cause the stock to take off on a strong rally like we saw from mid-2017 through mid-2018.I am bullish on Splunk for the long term, but I think investors will have to be patient. The company does have a history of beating its EPS estimates and has beaten by a wide margin in the last few quarters. I fully expect Splunk to beat its EPS estimate again, but I don't know if that will lead to a big jump after the report. In August, we saw the stock fall after the earnings report and it did find support at the 104-week moving average at that time.In August of 2018 and November of 2018, the stock gapped higher after earnings, but then it drifted lower for a number of weeks and ended up losing every bit of the post-earnings gain and then some.If you own the stock, I would suggest holding on as long as the stock remains above the 104-week. If you don't own the stock but are considering buying it, I don't think you have to jump in ahead of the earnings report."

The most recent earnings report from Splunk could be a game-changer in terms of dissipating investor concerns about the company, potentially providing a key catalyst for the stock price to keep moving higher.Splunk is a top player in software for data analytics, an industry offering tremendous opportunities for growth over the long term. But the company is changing its business model, moving away from perpetual licenses and focusing on recurrent cloud-based revenue.This new business model will provide more visibility to investors going forward, but it can also have a negative impact on cash flows in a particular quarter. Even if the fundamentals have remained solid, cash flows have been under pressure over recent months, and this has been weighting on the stock price.On June 14, I published an article entitled Buying Opportunity In Splunk Stock. The main thesis in such an article was that the uncertainty due to the business model transition was creating an attractive entry price in Splunk, as the market was being too shortsighted.From such an article:Importantly, the data from the most recent quarter confirms that the business keeps firing on all cylinders, with both earnings and sales numbers exceeding Wall Street expectations and management raising guidance for the full year.If the most recent earnings report from Splunk can finally dissipate the concerns surrounding the company, it could provide a major catalyst for the stock price to move higher over the coming months.The transition towards a renewable revenue model is practically complete, and annual recurring revenue - ARR - increased by a vigorous 53% last quarter. By all accounts, it looks like the company is moving in the right direction.Source: SplunkSome notable highlights from the report:Source: SplunkCEO Douglas Merit explained in the conference call how data is becoming an enormously valuable resource across all kinds of industries and organizations:According to estimates from IDC, digital transformation investments are projected to reach over $1 trillion in 2019, and they're expected to reach $6 trillion in 4 years. Splunk is already a provider to over 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, and it has over 19,000 customers across all kinds of sectors.In other words, the company is in the right position to benefit from massive growth opportunities in the years ahead.High growth stocks in the software as a service sector generally trade at elevated valuation levels. In the case of Splunk, the price to sales ratio has been much higher in the past, and the stock is still trading at valuation levels that are not too far away from the low end of the valuation range.Data by YChartsThe table below shows the average revenue estimates and the forward price to sales ratios for Splunk in the coming five years based on these estimates. Even when expecting a material deceleration in revenue growth rates, the stock is not too expensive at all if the company manages to meet those estimates.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialSpeaking of which, Splunk has an outstanding track record of not only beating but also surpassing Wall Street expectations. The chart shows the expected revenue figures and the actual reported numbers in the past 16 quarters, and Splunk has delivered above expectations in each of those quarters.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialWith the company typically outperforming expectations, Wall Street analysts keep running from behind and increasing their earnings forecasts for Splunk. If the price to sales ratio is going to remain constant, rising earnings expectations should push the stock price higher too.Data by YChartsPast performance does not guarantee future returns, but winning companies tend to keep on winning over time, and Splunk management seems to have the healthy habit of providing conservative guidance numbers and then outperforming expectations. As long as this trend remains in place, it could be a strong tailwind for Splunk stock.Splunk operates in a very dynamic industry prone to technological disruption. Success attracts the competition, and it makes sense to expect the company to face growing competitive pressure from multiple fronts in the years ahead. With this in mind, investors in Splunk stock should keep an eye on the competitive landscape in order to make sure that the company is still at the forefront of the data revolution.Since the company is aggressively investing for growth, profit margins, and cash flows tend to be hard to predict in the short term. This can be a source of volatility on the stock price on a quarterly basis.Those risk factors being acknowledged, Splunk is a top-quality growth stock with plenty of potential for expansion in the years ahead. Companies in the sector generally trade at expensive valuation levels, but Splunk is not overvalued at all for such an outstanding business.Splunk is a position in both my own portfolio and The Data Driven Portfolio since I replicate such a portfolio with my personal money. With the stock rising strongly after earnings, it makes sense to be patient when building a position. However, the long-term investment thesis in Splunk is stronger than ever, and any pullback or price consolidation down the road should be considered a buying opportunity."
4313829,104608,2019-12-23T10:06:58-05:00,"Splunk reported a good Q3 with revenue growing 30% and EPS coming in ahead of expectations.
        Management raised their full year revenue guidance by more than the Q3 beat, signaling underlying strength in the business.
        After the 15% run-up over the past few weeks, valuation has started to look more expensive at ~8x FY21 revenue, though the stock should outperform over the long-term.","Splunk (SPLK) reported a strong Q3 with revenue growing 30% and annual recurring revenue growing 53% during the quarter. The stock reacted positively to the quarter and is up 15% over the past few weeks. Management also raised full year revenue guidance by more than the Q3 beat, signaling underlying strength in the business.The company also talked about reaching $1 billion in operating cash flow by FY23, which compares to their expected loss of $300 million during the current FY20. Investors seem to have more confidence in the longer-term profitability of the company and with operating margins showing some signs of expansion, the stock appears to be pretty attractive even after the recent run up.The stock has been up ~15% since the company reported earnings a few weeks ago as investors applauded the company’s strong quarter, guidance raise, and commitment to $1 billion in operating cash flow.Business fundamentals have remained healthy and although valuation has gotten close to 8x forward revenue, the company’s 30%+ revenue growth and 50%+ annual recurring revenue growth bode well for long-term investors. Valuation is nothing too expensive compared to the company’s historical valuation ranges, though with revenue growth eventually decelerating given the law of large numbers, investors will continue to look for consistent growth and improved profitability.With the recent acquisition of SignalFX, Splunk is in a better position to become even more competitive with both New Relic (NEWR) and Datadog (DDOG). Management has continued to push more of their revenue to come in the form of cloud-based bookings, which are naturally more recurring in nature and gives the company better insight into their longer-term revenue growth.Revenue during the quarter grew 30% to $626 million, which was above expectations for ~$605 million and ahead of management’s quarterly guidance of ~$600 million. The beat during the quarterly was primarily due to license revenue growing 34%, though this revenue stream tends to be less visible and predictable than the software revenue.Source: Company PresentationCloud revenue was also a strength during the quarter, growing ~78% to $80 million and now represents over 20% of total software revenue. Large enterprises continue to shift more of their resources towards to cloud in order to improve internal efficiencies in addition to lowering their operational expenses. Even though cloud revenue is still a relatively small portion of overall revenue (~12% of total), the fast growth demonstrates the strong demand in the market, which I think will continue for a while as enterprises adopt cloud technologies.In addition, management continues to reap the benefits of the company moving towards a more recurring, cloud-based subscription model. Even though cloud revenue only represents ~20% of total revenue, the focus on this area of the business will continue to deliver solid growth prospects and additional returns. Also, this cloud-revenue comes in the form of higher margins, thus helping enhance the overall profitability of the company.After receiving their FedRAMP authorization, the company has already achieved some success with signing several $1+ million public sector wins during the quarter. I believe this is another avenue of potential revenue the company can deliver given their recent authorization status. Now that the company has received their FedRAMP authorization, they are able to go after a new subsegment of their market, that being the federal and state governments. Even though this area of the market is not necessarily the fastest growth, it is a relatively untapped market with a lot of growth potential.Billings grew 28% during the quarter to $667 million and the growth rate was pretty close to the 29% growth seen last quarter. In addition, the billings came in well above expectations for ~$590 million.The newest metric provided this quarter was total annual recurring revenue, which came in at $1,439 million and grew 53% compared to the year ago period. This metric accounts for subscription, term, and maintenance contract annual recurring revenue and investors will likely start to follow this growth rate pretty close.Source: Company PresentationGross margin of 85.8% expanded from 84.5% in the year ago period primarily as a result from strong software and cloud revenue growth. These revenue streams typically come with higher levels of gross margins as costs are more concentrated within operating expenses. This helped lead operating margins to come in at 16.8%, which was above expectations for ~16%. As the company continues to scale and gain leverage within their software revenue, SPLK will have the opportunity to further expand margins.The better than expected revenue and margins led to EPS of $0.58 during the quarter, above expectations for $0.54.Source: Company PresentationFor Q4, management is expecting revenue of ~$780 million with operating margins of ~23%. Revenue guidance was a little bit higher than expectations for ~$765 million.For the full year, management raised their revenue guidance to ~$2.35 billion (up from ~$2.3 billion) with operating margins remaining at ~14%. Management reiterated their expectation for operating cash flow loss of ~$300 million, however, management also talked about $1 billion in operating cash flow in FY23. While FY20 operating cash flow loss of ~$300 million is not healthy, the longer-term guidance installs a new base level of confidence for cash flows.Management also talked about their new annual recurring revenue metric, which grew 53% during the quarter to grow in the mid-40% range during FY21.SPLK recently acquired SignalFX a few quarters ago and the negative operating cash flow makes sense given the investment needed to get the acquisition up to company standards. It will likely take a few quarters to truly see the benefits, this expansion could ultimately help top line growth and margin expansion over time. In addition, management's continued push towards cloud-based recurring bookings on top of receiving their FedRAMP authorization gives the company other avenues of growth potential over the long term.Valuation has been pretty volatile this year as the stock’s price has moved around quite a bit. However, since reporting earnings a few weeks ago, the stock has gone up ~15% given management’s raised guidance metrics and longer-term confidence in operating cash flows. With revenue growth of 30% during the quarter on top operating margins coming in better than expected, I believe there is still a lot to like with this name.The company has a history of beating and raising their guidance and there is a good possibility this trends continues into FY21. Even though management recently raised their full year revenue guidance heading into the last quarter of the year, the revenue raise was larger than the Q3 beat, which I think demonstrates the underlying strength in the business.With a current market cap of ~$22.6 billion, $1.9 billion of cash/investments and $1.7 billion of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$22.4 billion. Using management's revenue guidance of $2.35 billion, we can start to build out a potential FY21 revenue multiple.Revenue growth for this year has been consistently above 30% and it’s possible revenue growth remains near that level in FY21. However, to be a little conservative, we can assume revenue growth decelerates to 25%. Assuming revenue comes in at management’s guidance level (which is conservative given their pattern of beating expectations), this could result in FY21 revenue of ~$2.95 billion, giving us a FY21 revenue multiple of ~7.6x.While this revenue multiple is still expensive compared to the overall market, there are very few software names in the market who have consistently grown revenue 30%+ at a $3+ billion run-rate level. In addition, management’s recent commentary around $1 billion in operating cash flow by FY23 gives investors increased confidence in the company improving their profitability over time.Even after the recent 15% run-up in the stock price since the company reported earnings, I believe this is a solid long-term name to own. While valuation is somewhat expensive, the company continues to execute well and has demonstrated their ability to beat their own expectations.Risks to SPLK include revenue growth decelerating below 30% with operating margins not expanding during the year. Typically when a software company begins to see revenue growth decelerate, operating margins and profitability expand. If this does not turn out to be the case for SPLK, investors could punish the name over the next few quarters."

The highlights of the quarter were the strong momentum in cloud revenue and its $1.05 billion acquisition of cloud monitoring company SignalFx.Q2 revenues grew 33% over the year to $517 million, significantly ahead of the market's expectations of $488.4 million. Net loss was $100.8 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.30, beating analyst estimates of $0.12 per share.By segment, its License revenue increased 39% to $279.3 million while Maintenance and Services revenue grew 26% to $237.3 million. Within the segment, Software revenues, which includes cloud and license revenues, grew 46% to $350 million. Cloud revenues grew 80% to $70.5 million.During the quarter, Splunk added nearly 500 new enterprise customers including ABB (Switzerland), Conde Nast, Cox Automotive, Denny's, DoorDash, Duke University, Gatwick Airport (England), Harvard Business School, Jump Operations, NATO (Belgium), Nubank (Brazil), Pennsylvania State University, US Postal Service, Verizon Media Group, and Zoom.For the third quarter, Splunk expects revenues of $600 million compared with the market's estimate of $477 million. It expects to end FY 2020 with revenues of $2.3 billion, up from the previous guidance of $2,25 billion. Analysts expect revenue of $2.26 billion for the year.Splunk has been transitioning its business to a subscription-based renewable software model. By the end of FY20, Splunk expects about 99% of product sales will be recurring renewable subscriptions. This has pushed the FY20 free cash flow target from a positive $250 million to negative $300 million. I think it's a short-term challenge for the company, but in the longer term, the transition will stand Splunk in good stead.During the earnings call, Splunk announced that it was acquiring cloud monitoring company SignalFx for $1.05 billion. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of the fiscal year.Founded in 2013, SignalFx raised $178.5 million from investors including Tiger Global Management, Andreessen Horowitz, CRV, and General Catalyst. It last raised $75 million in June 2019 at a valuation of $500 million. Its estimated annual revenue is $25 million.San Mateo, California-based SignalFx is a SaaS-based monitoring and analytics platform for infrastructure, microservices, and applications and is able to alert users of anomalies in data in two to five seconds. The combination of the Splunk and SignalFx platforms will challenge leaders in the application performance monitoring market such as Cisco AppDynamics (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Dynatrace (NYSE:DT). It's expected to allow developers and IT departments to monitor and absorb data in real-time for both on-premise or cloud infrastructure.Its stock is trading at $111.82 with a market capitalization of $16.8 billion. It had climbed to a 52-week high of $143.70 in February and has recovered from the 52-week low of $83.69 in October last year."
4289720,105400,2019-09-04T21:24:20-04:00,"Splunk has fallen by 20% in the past month.The negative news surrounding its cash flow guidance is focused on the short term.However, the company is undervalued and remains a leader in the Big Data space.","The share price of Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) saw a recent pullback of roughly 20% from a recent high of $138 to $111 due to a change from perpetual licenses to a renewable model. Splunk is a long-term investment in the growth of Big Data. Despite some risks, it is expected to deliver decent long-term returns.Splunk's fall in stock price can be largely attributed to its negative guidance in cash flow for fiscal 2020. The company initially guided positive $250 million, but in its most recent quarter told investors to expect negative $300 million. Management blamed the shift from perpetual licenses towards a cloud-based renewable model as the main reason for the negative guidance.(Source: Google)However, in the long term, the benefits from a cloud-based model outweigh the short-term negative cash flow impacts. From the most recent earnings call transcript:Besides improved customer acquisition impacts, a cloud-based model allows Splunk to capture more value from customers. For example, a perpetual license limits the company to one upfront charge, whereas a cloud-based model gives it more flexibility in pricing. It's easier for Splunk to adjust the pricing upwards for big companies with high usage volumes, while making it affordable for smaller companies. This could explain the better-than-expected revenue growth of 33% to $516 million, $31 million higher than its own guidance of $485 million.(Source: Splunk Q2 2020 Earnings Slides)This updated model puts Splunk in a better position to capture the growing Big Data processing space, which is estimated at roughly $62 billion today. The main source of revenue for Splunk will be helping companies navigate the enormous digital universe to produce insights.(Source: Splunk Analyst Day)Companies have already begun their Big Data initiatives with successful results. Once we reach the tipping point of companies that manage to reduce expenses and succeed through the use of Big Data, there should be an acceleration in the number of companies adopting Big Data services. When that happens, the breadth of data solutions Splunk provides will allow it to capture a large portion of the total addressable market.(Source: NewVantage Partners, Big Data Executive Survey)As companies begin embracing Big Data within their operations, Splunk's services will become increasingly embedded. Already we see that it has 92 of the Fortune 100 companies using its services. As SMEs follow the footsteps of larger companies, we can expect Splunk to be one of their top choices. Splunk has also managed to grow its large orders above $100k by 20% from 2017 to 2018, while maintaining high maintenance renewal rates at 95% in recent quarters.(Source: Splunk Analyst Day)Due to the sensitive nature of data, it becomes difficult to implement another data platform once Splunk is embedded into a company's operations. IT executives are unlikely to risk the loss of data and potential business disruption even if they could glean cost savings from switching to another platform.Currently, Splunk is the leader in Security Information and Event Management, according to Gartner. Based on Gartner reviews, Splunk has a 4.4 rating with the highest volume of reviews, and 82% are willing to recommend its services. These ratings are better than those of its closest competitors - IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) and LogRhythm - on the Magic quadrant. By being the leader with a favorable brand name, Splunk is poised to capture market share in this space from its competitors. This will set the company up for maintaining high returns of capital in the future from this switching costs advantage.(Source: Gartner)(Source: Gartner)Change is tricky. Splunk might face some execution problems with moving customers from perpetual licenses to cloud-based models. To maintain high customer satisfaction, the company has to minimize disruption to business operations and ensure a smooth transition.It remains to be seen if companies find that machine data will have a key impact on their bottom line. The NewVenture survey above shows that some companies find their Big Data initiatives unsuccessful, perhaps due to a lack of actionable insights. If Splunk is unable to generate meaningful insights that impact businesses positively, customers might end their subscriptions with Splunk, and that would lead to reduced future revenues.The negativity surrounding Splunk recently has been its negative cash flow guidance. This gives investors with a long-term focus an opportunity to buy Splunk at a bargain price.To value the company, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 30% for 2020 (in line with guidance), then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Splunk's leadership in the Big Data space and the ability to capture a large portion of the industry's growth. Although the Big Data market is expected to grow at only 10% for the next few years, Splunk has just penetrated roughly 3% of its total addressable market, based on its revenues. Increased penetration from higher customer acquisitions due to its new cloud-based model should allow the company to grow at a higher rate than the market. However, if Splunk is unable to achieve satisfactory insights from its customers' data, revenue growth might be lower than expected as companies reduce their spending on Big Data initiatives.2) Operating margin of 25% from 2024 onwards. Software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Operating margins of 25% would be considered average and achievable for Splunk. Moreover, the company's gross margin has remained above 75% in recent years. However, if competitors are able to develop better services with higher value propositions than Splunk, margins for the company might be depressed in order to compete with better data solutions.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Splunk will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) It has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9.43%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Splunk having negative cash flows and losing money. However, once the company achieves the scale needed for operating leverage to kick in, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using Splunk financials)Despite short-term noise surrounding its negative cash flow guidance, Splunk remains a good buy with a 23% upside, based on my intrinsic value estimates. If investors believe that Splunk can generate value for customers in the long term within the Big Data space, this stock should be able to provide decent returns for many years ahead."
4291424,104608,2019-09-13T11:59:24-04:00,"Splunk reported a strong Q2 earnings with revenue and EPS above expectations, led by strong cloud growth and operating margin expansion.Management reduced their cash flow guidance for the year due to a few moving parts including the recent acquisition of SignalFX.Valuation appears pretty attractive at under 6x FY21 revenue, despite the company continuing to grow revenue over 30% with strong margin expansion.","Even though Splunk (SPLK) remains in growth mode, the recent 15% correction in the stock post-earnings seems justified given the lowered cash flow guidance and heightened risk with their new SignalFX acquisition. The company reported strong earnings leading to another beat and raise quarter and talked a little about their newest acquisition.Splunk is a great long-term play on big data and the transition to the cloud with the company continuing to demonstrate strong trends this past quarter. The SignalFX acquisition will add additional application performance monitoring capabilities to Splunk's already rather impressive portfolio of services. However, the pullback in the stock was largely due to management reducing operating cash flow guidance from +$250 million to a -$300 million loss.Data by YChartsTypically when a company takes this big of a hit, there is a large, underlying change in the business fundamentals. However, for Splunk, the drop seems a little aggressive considering the circumstance. Yes, the lowered cash flow guidance is a negative for the company and the stock should trade down on that news.However, the business fundamentals remain healthy and the updated guidance takes into account the recent acquisition, which will come with heightened expenses over the near term. The stock remains at a premium valuation and rightfully so. If investors were willing to pay nearly 8x forward revenue a few weeks ago, the current valuation of under 7x forward revenue seems more than reasonable.Q2 revenue grew 33% to $517 million, which was well ahead of consensus expectations for ~$490 million. The beat for the quarter primarily came from larger than expected license revenue, which tends to be lumpier and less visible for management to guide to. Even though license revenue is still revenue, investors typically place a lower multiple on license because of its lack of predictability and unstable stream.Source: Company PresentationCloud revenue, which is part of software, grew ~80% during the quarter and now represents over 20% of total software revenue, up from over 15% of software revenue in the year ago period. Enterprises continue to shift more of their resources to the cloud in order to improve both efficiencies and costs. While this revenue stream is still in Splunk's minority, the 80% growth rate demonstrates how impactful cloud could become over the next several quarters.Billings growth of 29% to $517 million was well ahead of consensus expectations for $488 million. However, adjusted bookings growth of 23% decelerated quite a bit compared to the 32% growth seen last quarter. This was another area of weakness during the quarter that investors used to punish the stock.Source: Company PresentationGross margin of 84.2% expanding 200bps compared to the year ago period as a result of two main factors. First, the strong growth in cloud revenue helps margins due to the higher margin nature of the software business. Second, as the company continues to scale, they have been able to generate a higher amount of recurring revenue. The gross margin improvement helped lead to operating margins of 9.0% during the quarter, compared to 2.9% in the year ago period.Q2 EPS of $0.30 came in well ahead of consensus estimates of $0.12 largely due to the significant revenue beat and margin improvement.Source: Company PresentationFor Q3, management expects revenue to be $600 million, putting the company at nearly $2.5 billion run-rate. Management also sees operating margin of ~16% during the quarter, which would be an improvement from the ~13.6% seen in the year ago period.For the full year, management slightly raised their revenue guidance to $2.3 billion (up from $2.25 billion last quarter) with operating margins left unchanged at 14%. While these metrics were not of concern, management lowered operating cash flow guidance from $250 million to a loss of $300 million, attributing the lowered guidance to license revenue mix, a shift to annual invoicing, and acquisition costs related to SignalFX.The acquisition of SignalFX helps expand Splunk deeper into the cloud monitoring of infrastructure and applications and will be funded by 60% cash and 40% stock. The timing of the acquisition was probably a big reason why cash flow guidance was reduced so much for the remainder of the year. While this acquisition could take another few quarters to truly see the benefits, this expansion could ultimately help top line growth and margin expansion over time.Splunk's valuation has moved around quite a bit over the past year given the late 2018 market correction and the ebbs and flows of their earnings reports. The recent 15% correction in the stock price was likely due given the recent run-up in valuation mixed with somewhat disappointing outlook. However, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain intact and with revenue growing another 30%+ during the quarter, there is a lot to look forward to.Data by YChartsWhile management's guidance of $2.3 billion in revenue is impressive, I believe there continues to be a little conservatism baked in. We could ultimately see upside revenue given strong performance from Splunk and the potential for additional revenue from their recent acquisition.With a current market cap of $16.6 billion, $2.7 billion of cash and $1.7 billion of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of $15.6 billion. Using management's revenue guidance of $2.3 billion, this results in a FY20 revenue multiple of only 6.8x, which appears to be slightly below their peer group.Assuming revenue for the year comes in ahead of current guidance and ends up at $2.35 billion in addition to another strong growth year of 30%, we could see FY21 revenue of $3.05 billion. This would imply a FY21 forward revenue multiple of only 5.1x, significantly lower than some of their peers.However, Splunk is currently guiding to negative cash flow for the year and it could take the company another year or two to achieve positive cash flow. It remains challenging to give a double digit revenue multiple on a company where management is not overly optimistic on the cash flows of the business. However, if we start to see cash flows and margins improve in the next few quarters, investors could start to place a higher multiple on the company.For now, the stock appears to be a good buy for long-term investors. It is challenging to know how the stock will work through the next quarter earnings, though at ~$110, it is not a bad price to get in.Risks to SPLK include revenue growth decelerating below 30% with operating margins not expanding during the year. Typically when a software company begins to see revenue growth decelerate, operating margins and profitability expand. If this does not turn out to be the case for SPLK, investors could punish the name over the next few quarters."

After a nearly 500% gain, Splunk may be due for another deep correction as it sits below its 200-day moving average and hovers just above the 38.2% retrace from its all time highs. As a leader in its industry, Splunk is positioned to benefit for years to come, so I will be looking to initiate a long term position at lower levels.Being one of the darlings of the recent cloud bull run, Splunk is currently more of a hybrid cloud company, and it is very likely to continue its bull run in the foreseeable future. The company derives the majority of its revenue from licensing its platform, which gives users the ability to investigate, monitor and act on machine data regardless of format or source. The company is one of the leaders in the big-data analysis and security space, which according to Statista is expected to grow from roughly $42 billion in 2018 to $103 billion by 2027 representing a CAGR of 9.4%. This growth, like the growth forecasted in the OTT market, has investors accepting higher-than-normal valuations – which, after a near 20% drawdown from its recent high, is still baked in with a P/S ratio of 8.Recently Splunk released a stellar quarter, reporting some of its best results in recent years. Supporting an $16 billion market cap, and an EV of $15 billion, Splunk reported quarterly growth of 33% YOY, which translated to annually adjusted earnings that more than doubled analysts’ expectations. Splunk then increased its revenue guidance for 2020.Not only were the numbers what historically drives prices to their next leg higher, but Splunk addressed significant progress from shifting its business to licensing out its platform to becoming an all-cloud-based platform, which would drastically improve its margins and directly lead to positive cash flow over time. Looking back through their filings, in 2015 Splunk’s cloud business accounted for roughly 5% of its sales. Today, they expect virtually all new software sales to be cloud-based by the end of year.Apart from transitioning away from perpetual licenses, Splunk has made some strategic purchases in the recent past to boost its artificial intelligence position, including SignalSense in 2017 and VictorOps last year. On the call, Splunk revealed that it would be making another acquisition – cloud-monitoring service SignalFX for $1.05 billion in a cash-and-stock deal which is expected to strengthen the company’s application monitoring service. The combination of Splunk and SignalFx will give application developers and IT departments a unified data platform that allows them to monitor and absorb data in real time, no matter the infrastructure or scale, in order to cut costs, boost revenue and improve the customer experience. This acquisition, though a drain on cash flow guidance, once integrated, will lead to a powerhouse in the security industry.However, with market sentiment leaning towards being more afraid, and with recession talk flooding the news every day, it appears that investors’ patience for profitless tech companies is wearing thinner. This was evident in Splunk’s operating cash flow guidance, which as stated is the result of a strategic path to profitability. Instead of affirming its positive cash flow expectations from Q1 of this year, it stated that they will remain in negative territory through 2020. Even with stellar growth and a significant shift in its business model, the stock immediately sold off 10% and is continuing its retrace today as a result.A growth stock with valuations like Splunk leaves no room for error on earnings. This has been evident this year with three major volume spikes coinciding with investors initiating a sharp selloff regarding quarterly results. Back in May of 2019, Splunk’s report caused a 17% selloff due to a concern over the timeline of Splunk’s path to positive cash flow. In short, the company’s weakening cash flow today overshadowed its incredible revenue growth and business pivots, which will lead to positive cash in the future. Even though Splunk’s negative cash flow has been present throughout the course of the recent uptrend, it is now becoming an obvious issue for investors. I believe this is a sentiment-driven move that will need to play out along with the broad market before investors’ appetite for high-revenue/low-profit growth companies.Splunk has been in a multiyear uptrend since bottoming in 2016. This multi-year run is outlined in aqua, with a clear 5 waves up. Also, the aqua trend line is the Anchored Volume Weighted Moving Average (AVWAP), which has been anchored to the beginning of the uptrend in February of 2016. The AVWAP is one of my favorite ways to gauge the health of a trend. It factors in volume along with price, and instead of being defined through an arbitrary yet popular length of time, we can attach it to an emotional shift in sentiment to gauge sentiment. I find it to be a powerful tool when used in unison with Elliot Wave analysis.The AVWAP shows that the trend has a ways to drop before confirming this four-year uptrend to be over, which puts into visual context Splunk’s five-year beta of 2, with a max drawdown of roughly 67%. This tells me that even with the volatility we’ve seen in Splunk, the long-term trend is still in the hands of the bulls. What I find interesting is how the AVWAP seems to be coinciding with the cluster targets highlighted in the yellow box. This area will act as a major support region if price continues to decline.In terms of volume, we are shifting to a more cautious tone with investors. The last three volume spikes were sells initiated from the last three earnings reports, followed by a low-volume uptrend that decreased as the price marched higher. This slowing buying pressure is also evident in the MACD, with obvious divergence between price and momentum. The current internal strength of Splunk has faded to a more bearish stance, with the MACD still pointing down.A simple trend line can be drawn from the start of this uptrend from the bottom in 2016 through today, which I highlighted in a dotted black line. This trendline was broken in November of 2018, intraday, but closed above it. Today, as you can clearly see, this trendline has broken, and Splunk continues to trade below it. Furthermore, I anchored another AVWAP at the start of the most recent short-term uptrend from the bottom of November 2018, which is highlighted in purple. As you can see, the price has not only broken the 200-day moving average in orange, but this trendline as well. This is signifying that the bears are in control in the short term. I would need to see both the 200-day as well as the short-term AVWAP to be taken back before wanting to participate in a continued uptrend.After a clear 3-wave correction, highlighted with a green A, B, C, the price is bouncing between the 31.8% extension and 100% extension. It's worth noting that the length of the A wave decline is in equal length as the C wave decline, which coincides with the 38.2% extension. This support area is huge for Splunk’s continued uptrend. Based on the weakness in the MACD, as well as weakening sentiment in the markets, specifically with cloud darlings, I believe the probabilities currently favor seeing Splunk trading below these levels. We may get a corrective bounce from here, but I believe it will be corrective, and that it will soon give way to a more sharp decline. If so, my target will be between its 76.4% extension (around $92.50) and 61.8% extension (around $82.50), which also encompasses the 61.8% retrace (around $87.50). At these levels, I will be a heavy buyer.Splunk is a cloud-based security leader and soon-to-be powerhouse, making very intelligent moves in a hyper growth space. This is a company that I want to own for years to come, assuming this bull market can extend this long. I think we will see a lower low in the $92-to-$82 region, at which point I will look to build a position. When trading in growth towards the end of a cycle, I will not initiate a position without an exit strategy. So, a trailing stop between 25% and 35% will give this position enough room to breathe, while getting you out just in case the big one hits."

Its technology - which analyzes the data generated by a company's internal systems, then translates it into actionable insights (many pertaining to security) - has virtually no equal in the market. Recently, the company also announced a $1.05 billion acquisition of SignalFX - which will add application performance monitoring (NASDAQ:APM) capabilities to Splunk's portfolio and allow it to compete against fast-growing companies like New Relic (NEWR) and Datadog.Naturally, when such a strong company drops by ~15% after an earnings report - despite a ""beat and raise"" to Wall Street's expectations in both the current quarter and the upcoming quarter - investor interest should be piqued. In my view, Splunk's recent slump puts it at attractive buying levels:Data by YChartsWith shares being unfairly pummeled over the last few weeks, it's a good time for investors to review the bullish case for this stock.One of the first bullish headwinds we should consider in Splunk is its transition to cloud. As most software investors are aware, the initial stages of a ""legacy"" company's shift to cloud-base billings is painful. Large chunks of revenue that used to be recognized upfront are now spread over longer periods of time. Splunk, however, isn't seeing much of a headwind from this cloud shift.Splunk has made significant progress in beefing up its cloud business. As of the end of the second quarter, Splunk reported total ARR of $300 million, and its cloud revenue growth rate is clocking in at a mind-blowing 80% y/y.Helped by the contribution from greater cloud revenues, Splunk's percentage of renewable software (which includes both cloud and recurring term licenses) jumped to 95% in Q2, up seventeen points from the year-ago quarter:Figure 1. Spunk renewable revenuesSource: Splunk 2Q20 earnings deckIn effect, Splunk has greatly expanded its revenue visibility, with so much of any given quarter's revenues already locked into multi-quarter contracts. In spite of this increased revenue stability, however, Splunk's growth rates haven't materially contracted from last year. As a reference point, Splunk grew FY19 total revenues at 38% y/y; this quarter, Splunk's total revenues grew at 33% y/y. Despite the headwind from the cloud shift, Splunk seems to be experiencing a normal deceleration pattern - whereas other companies that have embarked on the same shift, such as Autodesk (ADSK), have seen revenue growth decline into negative territory.It's worth noting as well that Splunk's greater cloud mix has come accompanied by a lengthening of average contract durations, further improving revenue stability. Average contract durations hit a two-year high of 33.5 months in Q2, driven by lengthening of both term and cloud license durations.Figure 2. Splunk average contract durationsSource: Splunk 2Q20 earnings deckSplunk's careening share price in August would suggest that the company revealed a bad hand in its Q2 earnings report, when in fact Splunk delivered a solid beat-and-raise. Here's a look at the company's results below:Figure 3. Splunk 2Q20 earnings resultsSource: Splunk 2Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 33% y/y to $622.1 million, far surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $489.0 million (+26% y/y) by a wide seven-point margin. This represents just there points of deceleration versus last quarter's 36% y/y growth rate, despite Splunk reporting that its cloud transition is ramping up faster than expected.Splunk also landed a huge number of big deals in the quarter, which management defines as orders with a total contract value in excess of $1 million. The company closed 93 such deals in Q2, up 52% y/y:Figure 4. Splunk big deal trendsSource: Splunk 2Q20 earnings deckSplunk's >30% y/y growth rate in relation to its ~$2.5 billion annual revenue run rate is another element that makes the company an outlier in the software sector. CEO Doug Merritt breaks this down in his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Merritt also noted that the company's recent push toward cloud-based subscriptions is well-received by customers, especially in an IT market that has gotten used to flexible consumption models. Splunk has also updated its pricing tiers to make subscription costs more predictable on the customer front, and the initial customer feedback is highly positive.Splunk's top-line strength cascaded into profitability improvements as well. Driven both by greater scale and a healthier mix of recurring software, Splunk pushed up its already-high pro forma gross margins to 84.2%, a 200bps improvement from the year-ago quarter. Efficiencies in operating spend (especially on sales and marketing expenses) have driven a further improvement in pro forma operating margins to 9.0%, representing a 610bps gain versus 2Q19:Figure 5. Splunk operating margin trendsSource: Splunk 2Q20 earnings deckAll in all, Splunk's pro forma EPS of $0.30 in the quarter more than doubled Wall Street's expectations of $0.12.But the Q2 beats don't just end there: the company also released upbeat guidance for Q3. Splunk issued a Q3 revenue outlook of $600 million, representing 25% y/y growth (though history suggests that Splunk will still massively outperform this outlook) versus Wall Street's expectations of $591.2 million, or +23% y/y:Figure 6. Splunk guidance updateSource: Splunk 2Q20 earnings releaseFor the full fiscal year, Splunk also edged up its revenue forecast to $2.30 billion, a $50 million bump from the year-ago quarter. It's worth noting that when Splunk first issued FY20 guidance, it expected only $2.0 billion in revenues. Now halfway through FY20, the company's full-year target has stretched by 15% in spite of a faster-than-expected cloud shift.Despite the obvious momentum we've seen in Splunk's fundamentals, the company still remains modestly valued. At present share prices near $108, Splunk trades at a market cap of $16.25 billion. After netting out the company's $2.67 billion of cash and $1.67 billion of convertible debt on its balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $15.25 billion.Over the trailing twelve months, Splunk has generated $2.04 billion in revenues. If we assume the company can keep up a 30% y/y growth rate over the next four quarters, we arrive at a forward revenue estimate of $2.65 billion. This puts Splunk's valuation at a fairly modest 5.75x EV/forward revenue multiple. Compare that against other mid/large-cap software companies in the ~30% y/y growth range, most of which trade at double-digit forward revenue multiples:Data by YChartsThe bottom line for Splunk: investors have a well-timed opportunity to buy a fast-growing, cloud-oriented business with minimal competitive pressures that is also about to enter the cloud application monitoring business. Splunk is trading at bargain-basement values, and investors should jump on the opportunity before Splunk climbs back to the $130s, where Splunk traded prior to the August correction."

The company is growing at full speed but cash flows are disappointing because Splunk is transitioning towards a business model more focused on recurring revenue, which has negative implications on cash flow generation in the short term.Over the long term, however, management is leading the company in the right direction, and temporary weakness seems to be presenting a buying opportunity for investors in Splunk.Splunk is a leading growth player in data analysis and security, an industry offering exceptional opportunities for growth over the long term. Management is doing a great job in terms of capitalizing on such growth opportunities and generating exponential revenue growth for investors.Data by YChartsSplunk reported better than expected numbers last quarter, and the company also raised guidance for the rest of the year. The main business metrics are clearly pointing in the right direction:However, Splunk is changing its business model, moving away from perpetual licenses and focusing on recurrent cloud-based revenue. Management reached a renewable mix of 77% last year, which was 12% higher than planned, and renewables are expected to be over 85% this year.This business model has many advantages both for the company and its clients, but the transition is also having a negative impact on cash flow generation.From the conference call:Splunk is firing on all cylinders. The company is still losing money because of big investments in R&D and in sales and marketing, which are basically investments for growth. However, gross profitability is improving, and management is doing the right thing by prioritizing the strategic direction of the business above short-term cash flows.Companies operating in the software and big data segments trade at a considerable premium versus the broad market due to the industry's much promising potential for growth. In Splunk's particular case, the business is not yet profitable at this stage, so we need to rely on revenue for valuation.To begin with, it's worth noting that the price to sales ratio has significantly declined in recent years, and the stock is trading at a valuation level near the low end of the valuation spectrum.Data by YChartsIn terms of relative valuation, Splunk is not too expensive by industry standards. The chart below shows the price to sales ratios for Splunk versus Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM), Workday (WDAY), Shopify (SHOP), Red Hat (RHT), Twilio (TWLO), and Tableau Software (DATA).These companies are very dissimilar in terms of profitability and size, so the comparison is not very straightforward. However, it's worth noting that Splunk is trading at a discount versus other players in the industry. As a reference, the average price to sales ratio for the companies in the group excluding Splunk is almost 16.On a forward-looking basis, Wall Street analysts are expecting Splunk to make $2.26 billion in revenue during 2020 and $2.75 billion in 2021. Under these assumptions, the stock is trading at forward price to sales ratios of 7.8 and 6.5 respectively. This is making Splunk look attractively cheap in comparison to other companies in the sector.Importantly, Splunk has an impressive track record in terms of outperforming expectations. The company has delivered revenue figures above analysts' forecasts in the past 12 consecutive quarters. The chart below shows consensus revenue estimates and the actual reported revenue numbers for Splunk over time.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialIn green, we can see the percentage difference between expected and reported revenue for Splunk.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialFundamental momentum can be a powerful driver for stock prices. When the company is delivering numbers above estimates and expectations about future performance are increasing, this generally means that the stock price has to increase too in order for the valuation to remain constant.The chart compares the stock price for Splunk versus revenue estimates in both the current year and next fiscal year. Both the stock and sales estimates have significantly increased in recent years.However, over the past several months, the stock is lagging behind sales expectations. This is arguably creating an opportunity for investors in Splunk in terms of valuation.Data by YChartsThe Stocks on Fire system is a quantitative algorithm available in real time to members in The Data-Driven Investor.

The company is still losing money, and it operates in a very competitive industry with an always changing competitive landscape. On the other hand, the recent weakness in the stock price does not make much sense from a long-term perspective.Revenue is still growing at an impressive rate, and transitioning towards a business model based on recurrent revenue will ultimately make financial performance more stable and predictable. Valuation is relatively attractive, and the momentum indicators for Splunk stock look bullish over the middle term.For investors who believe that Splunk is strong enough to deliver vigorous growth rates and expanding profitability in the coming years, the timing looks good to start building a position in Splunk stock."

I have said this earlier that I think SAP would benefit by acquiring Splunk to offer analytics for its IoT offerings.","Recently, Big Data player Splunk (SPLK) announced its first-quarter results that surpassed market expectations. Splunk is focusing on transitioning its business model to a subscription-based model, a move that's impacting quarterly cash flows. The drop in the cash flow outlook resulted in a decline in the stock's price post result announcement.Revenues for the first quarter grew 36% over the year to $424.9 million, significantly ahead of the market's expectations of $395.7 million. Net loss was $155.4 million and adjusted EPS was $0.02 per share, again better than the market's forecast loss of $0.15 per share.By segment, its License revenue increased 46% to $202.9 million, while Maintenance and Services revenue climbed 29% to $222 million. Within the segment, Software revenues grew 54% to $265 million.During the quarter, Splunk added more than 400 new enterprise customers, including big names like Brink's (BCO), Cerner (CERN), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), and Slack (WORK).For the current quarter, Splunk expects revenues of $485 million, compared with the market's estimate of $477 million. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $2.25 billion, compared with the Street's estimated $2.2 billion.Splunk has recently released product upgrades like Data Stream Processor and Data Fabric Search. The Data Stream Processor accesses, analyzes, and transforms vast amounts of data in motion, in real time, and routes it to multiple destinations. It can be used to analyze transactional events such as call detail records in real time, monitor anomalies on the stream, and route service quality issues.The Data Fabric Search enables customers to perform complex analytics against enormous data sets stored in Splunk Enterprise and elsewhere. It will allow customers to identify the patterns of service quality incidents in those call detail records, search through billions of events across a wide-ranging timeline, and analyze them at the level of individual user accounts or device IDs.Some of the other services released recently include the Connected Experiences and Splunk Business Flow. Connected Experiences delivers insights on the go through augmented reality on mobile devices through mobile applications to provide users with the ability to investigate, monitor, analyze, and act on their data anywhere, anytime. Business Flow automatically analyzes the machine data gathered by Splunk and connects steps and events from various systems to create an immediate view of operational processes to identify opportunities for improving business operations.Splunk is transitioning its business to a subscription-based software model. While the subscription-based model translates to a more stable revenue base, it also causes a significant change in the deferred revenue accounting. In case of perpetual licenses, customers are billed upfront, whereas in subscription-based revenues, they are invoiced annually under renewable contracts. The shift in the billing model results in a ""greater trough in operating cash flow"" and an impact to deferred sales. The impact of the transition on free cash flow was confirmed by Splunk's revised operating forecast. Splunk dropped its operating cash flow forecast from $350 million to $250 million. I think it's a short-term challenge for the company, but in the longer term, the transition will stand Splunk in good stead.The recent Tableau (DATA) acquisition by Salesforce.com (CRM) also should benefit Splunk. Splunk had entered into a partnership with Tableau in 2014 that allowed users to leverage Tableau to visualize machine data from Splunk Enterprise. Tableau's acquisition by Salesforce would help Splunk enhance its market reach as well.I think Splunk is a very lucrative acquisition target for several major players including, Salesforce, SAP (SAP), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Workday (WDAY), ServiceNow (NOW), and Cisco (CSCO). Salesforce, for instance, would benefit from Splunk's deep partnership with Tableau.Then there is SAP. I have said this earlier that I think SAP would benefit by acquiring Splunk to offer analytics for its IoT offerings. Similarly, both Microsoft and Oracle can benefit by adding the data analytics solution from Splunk to their Power BI and OBIEE capabilities. Similarly, Workday is driving focus on Prism analytics and AI solutions to improve analytics, and an acquisition of a company like Splunk would help significantly advance those capabilities. Meanwhile, companies like ServiceNow always are on the lookout for technology and talent acquisitions that can improve their customer experience. Adding Splunk's analytic capabilities will surely benefit its customers.The stock is trading at $119.32 with a market capitalization of $17.9 billion. It had climbed to a high of $143.70 earlier this year. The stock has recovered from the 52-week low of $83.69 that it had fallen to in October last year."

It is in the middle of transforming from selling perpetual licenses to becoming a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company.

For potential investors, this transformation is a blessing in disguise, because the change in financials is not well understood by analysts. That was pretty much made clear in the Q1 2020 earnings call transcript, as analysts were having a hard time with slowed billings, revenues, and so forth. This is a blessing because Splunk stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 10, low for a SaaS business with a 37% growth rate.As I explained in a recent article on New Relic (NEWR), high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, the software company ""Rule of 40,"" and my favorite - company performance relative to analyst estimates.Splunk had a great year with trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 37.5%. The company's 5-year annual growth rate of 42.9% is also extremely good.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Splunk's free cash flow margin TTM has been positive since going public in 2012, and is currently sitting at 11.4% of revenues on a trailing twelve-month basis.(Source: Portfolio123.com)The decline in free cash flow margin over the last year is due to the transformation to SaaS. In any case, having high growth and positive free cash flow makes this an interesting investment opportunity.Splunk’s gross profit margin was declining from 2013 to 2018, starting from an incredible 92% and bottoming out at approximately 82% likely a result of competition. Since then, the gross margin has risen to 83.7% - nothing to be ashamed about. The very best SaaS companies have a gross margin of around 90%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Examining how a company performs versus analysts' estimates gives me a feel for how conservative the management is and how well they communicate with the investment community. This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, Splunk has a great record of beating analysts' estimates. The company has exceeded estimates for the last five quarters for both sales and EPS estimates. In many quarters, it has trounced analysts’ estimates.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Early-stage SaaS businesses tend to burn cash, and Splunk is no exception. SG&A expenses are 955% of revenues, higher than what would be expected from a more mature software company that would typically have a figure around 50-60%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Note that SG&A includes sales and marketing, general & administrative and R&D.Splunk's SG&A expense has been steadily declining and is at least less than revenues, unlike some other stocks that I have analyzed recently, such as Okta (OKTA), which has more than 100% SG&A as a percentage of revenues.Analysts are challenged when it comes to valuing software companies. While these companies tend to generate high revenue growth rates, they also tend to be unprofitable due to large investments in research & development and sales and marketing. Discounting future cash flows requires many assumptions that are typically unreliable and difficult to support.One industry metric that is often used for early- to mid-stage software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe it is the best measure of profitability for companies prioritizing growth over value.Some analysts interpret the Rule of 40 as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then a high-growth SaaS company can burn cash in order to drive growth.According to the Rule of 40, the cash burn is OK so long as revenue growth plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more.Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 37.5% + 11.4% = 48.9%In the case of Splunk, the cash burn appears to be ""acceptable.""Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is the valuation divided by revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my Digital Transformation stock list. A linear trend line is plotted through the scatter plot that represents the best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123 /MS Excel)As can be seen from the above graph, the Splunk valuation (EV/Sales) is below the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me, at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher-growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, I conclude that Splunk stock price is undervalued relative to the average digital transformation stock in my custom universe. Therefore, I assign a Buy rating to this stock.An investment in Splunk comes with several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, and many of them are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation levels and little in the way of profits.Also, there is the possibility that the new initiatives by Splunk may not be endorsed by customers.Finally, the market is very competitive, and although Splunk is considered a leader in SIEM, the company does not have an economic moat, according to Morningstar. There are other players such as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and LogRythm that could take market share away from Splunk in the future.Splunk offers a platform that helps users derive new insights from machine data that can be used to improve service levels, reduce operational costs, mitigate security risks, demonstrate and maintain compliance.The company has YoY revenue growth of 37.5%, has a gross margin in excess of 83%, has steadily declining SG&A and scores quite well on the Rule of 40. I believe it is fairly valued relative to other software stocks.This investment comes with significant risks, however. All digital transformation-enabling stocks have lofty values. At some point in time, these companies may come down to earth. There is also intense competition. But I believe that Splunk, with its more reasonable valuation, is a buying opportunity and investors should not miss out. Therefore, I assign a Buy rating to Splunk.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4249165,105069,2019-03-15T15:43:45-04:00,"A robust system for collecting and analyzing data from diversified sources, it can handle virtually any machine data and gather the analytics you need.
        Globally renowned enterprises rely on Splunk to manage their data efficiently in one place.
        The largest competitors include IBM and Rapid 7, but Splunk’s revenue curve reveals an explosive growth trend since the inception.
        Timeline of price to sales ratio shows that very recently investors may have started to factor in the growth potential in price.","Splunk (SPLK) Inc is a cutting edge firm in the field of machine data. Splunk’s integrated artificial intelligence enables the users to automatically detect anomalies, predict future outcomes and sift through the noise, saving companies the time and cost to install and maintain expensive data infrastructures and enabling them to focus on more important things- like making critical business decisions. Consider the example of TrueCar- a platform for retrieving automotive pricing and related information, the firm needed a solution to scale and support its cross-functional searching and reporting to manage its complex IT environment, so it brought in Splunk. As a result, TrueCar instantly had all their real-time insights in one place which accelerated its software and product development and helped improve its security insights and threat detection. Splunk went public in 2013 and consistently produced superb results since. The stock has very recently taken a pullback and offers a beautiful entry opportunity at $122.Figure: Seeking AlphaSplunk offers four levels of service, starting from a free to a light version, an enterprise version, and a cloud version. Splunk can literally collect and index any machine data, search and analyze in real time and offers Mission-critical performance, scale and reliability. The main difference between the enterprise and the cloud version is that the latter offers dynamic data management. Users are particularly very much impressed is its improved mobile and natural language processing capabilities where the company is opening the aperture to a larger number of business users. Splunk’s platform manages complexity and chaos efficiently in an ever-changing data landscape that enables the users to find insights from their data without first having to structure that data. Processing unstructured is very important but difficult if you are an engineer you know the hassles. In my line of work, unstructured data is frequent, and the processing used to take huge manpower and technical capabilities, with Splunk, now they can focus more on the qualitative side of data rather than spending a substantial amount of money in scaling data processing platforms.Splunk App AnalyticsPreviously I gave you the example of TrueCars, another example is Splunk’s long term customer Cox Automotive. The company expanded its use of Splunk cloud and ITSI (IT service intelligence) which allowed them to monitor activity across their business units. One of the largest higher education system in the United States, The California Community Colleges also expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise to better act on their data across 115 colleges, this has drastically reduced their manual time spent on IT and security issues while saving both money and time on troubleshooting. On the security step, Splunk is receiving new customers. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is a new Splunk Cloud and Enterprise customer who uses the platform to protect itself from risk. They leverage Splunk in the U.S. and 12 different countries to manage their risk efficiently. Recently, Santos Limited, an Australian oil, and gas producer have also purchased Splunk Cloud to expand its real-time visibility across their security operations.Splunk is not profitable yet, the reason is its sales and marketing costs. But bear with me because Splunk’s revenue outlook of $2.2 billion for fiscal 2020 reflects its increasing confidence in the opportunity and could become profitable in the next two years if it achieves guidance. Nonetheless, Splunk has posted three consecutive earnings surprises on a quarterly basis, and four consecutive earnings surprises on a yearly basis and the surprises are not merely marginal. These are noticeable differences against consensus estimates and the results stem from the fact that Splunk has a highly efficient platform that is enterprise-level functional and at a fraction of cost.Image: Seeking AlphaI am not surprised at all to see a majority of the strong buy recommendations in the market. Technical people knew way earlier that Splunk had to tend high because they know the engine, they know the product. Analysts are just catching it recently as earnings beats have become regular for Splunk.From Seeking AlphaEnterprises are still in the early steps in using centralized data infrastructures. Many of the enterprises are still focused on traditional ways of managing data, most of which focuses on structured, quantitative data. But, with the rise of sophisticated data infrastructure developers many enterprises are now more serious about managing and analyzing customer and competitive data. IBM is the largest player in this field beside Splunk. Because the market in which Splunk operates is still very much fragmented and many competitors are small and privately owned, a straight forward competitive position cannot be estimated.Below is a table that shows market share about Splunk’s enterprise security based on a number of websites that use it. But this is a very conservative estimate because this only focuses on the security suite not the total suite and secondly, not all enterprises disclose what platform they use.Data from DatanyzeAmong these competitors, only IBM and Rapid 7 are publicly listed. Although data shows that Rapid 7 has a larger market share (based on number of websites) it has a very small revenue ($244.09 million last year) compared to Splunk. If you take a look at Splunk’s revenue chart, it is clear that Splunk is the dominant player here, sales have been grown at an explosive rate. Profitability is negative for both the companies because of mostly substantial marketing and selling costs. With the rollout of 5G and IoT adaption going up enterprises will be keen to have complete analytical control of their unstructured data. Unstructured data analysis remains one of the key challenges in modern data analysis world because it is complex but extremely insightful, Splunk is filling a largely unfilled high potential space and have been very successful as showed by its performance over the years.Although Splunk had traded at large premiums it has gotten cheaper over the years. The core reasons behind these includes its negative profitability which brought down the amount of price investors are willing to pay for each unit of sales. But investors were not pricing in the growth potential in sales Splunk’s continues to enjoy a high penetration rate in the enterprise market. But very recently investors may have started to realize its growth trajectory because p/s ratio has tended to go slightly upwards, this may be the time for you to lock a position in this high growth stock.Splunk’s revenue outlook for 2020 is $2.2 billion, which was updated from the previously guided level of $2.15 billion. This shows that the management is confident and Splunk continues to enjoy its market expansion. Very recently there was a sell-off that followed RSA cybersecurity conference announcements from Alphabet with its new Backstory product and Microsoft with its new Azure-based security tool. But none of these products have any direct threat because Splunk addresses the data management infrastructure as a whole and not just the security side. If Splunk had a core focus on cybersecurity then the sell-off would have been justified, so now there is a nice entry opportunity.“Wedbush says this week's Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) 9% selloff was ""overdone"" and pushed the company to attractive levels. The selloff followed RSA cybersecurity conference announcements from Alphabet with its new Backstory product and Microsoft with its new Azure-based security tool. Wedbush analyst Steve Koenig says neither product is expected to pose a significant threat to Splunk.”Splunk’s revised guidance implies a 22% increase on a yearly basis which could significantly boost the stock price throughout this year. Because Splunk has consecutively beaten four quarterly consensus estimates, investors have faith on Splunk’s guidance and wouldn’t delay to increase their position size. As a result, the supply-demand economics will naturally drive the price up. From a technical analysis perspective, the stock looks oversold too, as shown by RSI. All these factors mean that that the short term dip has come off as a blessing and offers an attractive opportunity to move forward with the trend. Investors tend to overreact even in cases of marginal increase in sales, and as Splunk reaches towards achieving its guidance through the next four quarters you will likely see its price to sales ratio trending at levels near 14-15x. Let’s not forget that Splunk’s guidance reflects its continued market capture in its industry and high confidence in the management, so the trend is likely to continue through this year.There are a number of risks involved with Splunk Historically the firm has generated a majority of its revenues from perpetual license agreements, whereby it generally recognizes the license fee portion of the arrangement upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Right now the firm is transitioning its present business model to shift from perpetual license sales in favor of term license sales and agreements for its cloud services. Splunk cannot predict the ratio of orders with revenues that will be recognized upfront and those with revenues that will be recognized ratably it will enter into during the quarter. Generally, term licenses and cloud services agreements have shorter contract duration than perpetual licenses, and the shift away from perpetual license sales could cause fluctuations in Splunk’s results. Another significant risk is Splunk’s long sales cycle. The length of its sales cycle, from initial evaluation to delivery and payment for the software license varies substantially from customer to customer. Moreover, if customers wish to avail a combination of its multiple offerings, it will further slow down its sales cycle. One of the most important things to Splunk is its intellectual property rights. In today’s world, it is really difficult to protect IPs. Firms are now aggressively prototyping competitors’ products and slightly changing the interfaces and engines and branding them under their names. The loss in IP rights could substantially harm Splunk.Splunk has an admirable product in the enterprise market. Firms love to use Splunk to leverage its highly analytical but easy-to-use solutions. The system is robust, highly scalable and very fast. It can process virtually all machine data and gather valuable insights. Whether you want to gather predictive or risk analytics, Splunk can get it done for you. If you were to build a similar system from it would strain your core operations (assuming that is not your main business), now you can focus more on the qualitative sides of your business while letting Splunk handle the technicalities. However, there are multiple risks involved and you should only invest if you have a growth orientation and a higher risk tolerance."
4270095,22148,2019-06-13T12:06:00-04:00,Splunk remains a bargain in comparison to the price paid to buyout Tableau Software.The company continues to grow revenues at a 30% rate despite a move to renewable contracts.The stock is still down $25+ from the highs and trades at the lower end of the historical range at ~6.4x forward sales estimates.,"The Salesforce (CRM) acquisition of Tableau Software (DATA) brought our focus to one stock: Splunk (SPLK). Both Tableau Software and Splunk have generally been linked together having gone public in the same time frame of 2012/2013 and focusing on the big data concept. The deal reinforces the business intelligence category and reinforces my bullish investment thesis on Splunk when the stock dips.Image Source: Splunk websiteOver the years, Splunk has had the better operations by constantly generating faster growth. The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) acquisition of Looker made analysts like KeyBank seem smart by previously finding extreme value in Tableau Software.The firm slapped a $165 target on the stock and, apparently, Salesforce agreed. The company agreed to pay 1.103 shares of Salesforce valuing Tableau Software at a market valuation of $15.7 billion or the equivalent of $178 per share. The stock is now worth $166.50 after Salesforce has slipped to about $151 on the merger news. Tableau Software is down to where KeyBank pegged the stock value.The interesting part is that Splunk has a market value of about $17.5 billion now. The company has distanced itself from Tableau Software over the years, and Splunk is now approaching revenue targets heading towards double the goals of Tableau Software.Salesforce was even willing to pay a large premium for a deal that will cost a 75 bps hit to non-GAAP operating margins and cause an adjusted EPS impact of $0.38. The stock is trading weak for this reason, but Tableau Software executives did decide to take stock of Salesforce to continue playing the bullish long-term trends in data. Splunk places the 2020 total addressable market at $62 billion.Source: Splunk 2018 Analyst MeetingOver the years, Splunk has grown much faster than Tableau Software. Splunk has consistently maintained growth rates in the 30%+ range while Tableau has constantly faltered. The companies were similar in sizes in 2016, but Splunk has a vastly larger revenue base now and the gap is only growing.Data by YChartsSplunk recently raised FY20 revenues to $2.25 billion, up from $2.20 billion, but the forecasted growth rate is down to 31%. Analysts are at only 21% growth in FY21 with revenue pegged at $2.7 billion. At the rate that Splunk typically beats estimates, the analyst community is likely to slowly raise these numbers over the next year.Regardless, the current fear is that growth has slowed and the shift from perpetual licenses isn't helping in the short term. Splunk saw the renewable business mix shift to 77% last year and forecasts a growth rate to 85% this year. This shift lowers initial revenues and cash flows in favor of more consistent and strong long-term metrics.The question here is why isn't Splunk an even better deal for an acquisition. Prior to the deal announcement with Salesforce, both stocks traded at a forward P/S multiple of ~6.4x. The ironic part is that the stocks traditionally bounce back and forth within a similar range despite Splunk traditionally offering the better results and growth rates.Data by YChartsThe company that uses machine learning for data monitoring and analysis for predictive monitoring of corporate data has the better growth. Tableau Software was valued at nearly 9x FY21 revenues of $1.65 billion by Salesforce.Splunk is quickly moving into the cloud and software revenues where FQ1 growth rates were 85% and 54%, respectively. Any slowdown in revenue growth rates could quickly reverse as Splunk Cloud expands. The company is set up for a better future as more customers move away from contracts that require maintenance in order to set the customer up on the Splunk platform.The key investor takeaway is that Splunk is an appealing stock considering Salesforce was willing to pay such a premium price for Tableau Software. Investors shouldn't buy Splunk for a trade expecting a buyout, but the stock makes a good long-term investment on the increasing importance of customers like Slack (NYSE:WORK) using Splunk software to analyze the big amounts of data on their platform to monitor messaging platform.At a similar multiple as the Tableau Software buyout, Splunk would trade up about 37% to $160. The risk in the business intelligence sector and general software market is that some of the revenue slowdown is more related to competition and not the shift to renewable contracts. The risk appears low, but Splunk did trade below $100 on multiple occasions towards the end of 2018."

Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) operates in this emerging tech category, sitting at the intersection of business applications and IT operations, offering a ubiquitous data platform that solves ""data challenges around IT operations and application delivery, security compliance and fraud; as well as business analytics and IoT,"" according to the company's Q4 2019 Earnings Call.Splunk has had significant growth over the past several years and strong financial metrics, but the security space is growing increasingly competitive, as the biggest players in the tech industry build out their own security products. However, Splunk has key competitive advantages that will allow them to retain market share in the face of the top dogs, and continue to grow over time. Source: CompTIASplunk operates through four key business segments, all of which serve as an enhancement to traditional hardware and software offerings. They recently partnered with the US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration with the High-Fidelity Adaptive Deception & Emulation System, a threat monitoring network. They also built out a substance monitoring platform for New York Presbyterian Hospital. They also manage student data with the Universities College and Admission Service, which processes 3 million student applicants every year.Source: GartnerSplunk has exposure to almost every single industry, primarily because they dominate their own industry, Security Information and Event Management. Gartner ranked Splunk Number One in their Magic Quadrant for SIEM, ranking them above IBM and McAfee. Gartner cited that Splunk had the highest overall ""Ability to Execute"" and this represents the 6th straight year that Splunk was named a Leader in the industry.Splunk has a significant foothold in the SIEM industry with ~13.4% market share, and experiencing 51.1% growth Y/Y. The Cybersecurity market as a whole is expected to grow to almost $250B by 2023, which is 67% growth from 2017. That represents a large growth opportunity for Splunk, but only if they can retain market share in the face of increasing competition.Splunk made two key acquisitions recently to combat the ever-increasing competition in the space. They acquired VictorOps for $112.3M in June 2018. VictorOps helps security teams get the data that they need faster, and helps deliver security alerts to the right person.Splunk's other acquisition, Phantom, wants to erase the need for a person at all. Splunk acquired Phantom in April 2018 for $303.8M. Phantom ""automates the work of IT security staff"" and has an interface that can already support over 225 apps and 200 APIs. It contributes to the decision-making process for IT personnel, providing context to threat findings, as well as the potential to make automated response actions.Phantom enhances the 40-50% share of Splunk's total revenue that comes from its security offerings. It also shifts priority from humans to machine response and data analytics in the face of data breaches and security threats. Phantom works every second 24/7, reviewing and acting on the numerous security events that occur everyday.To quantify that, the graphic below details the number of events that occurred on one Splunk engineer's laptop over a 2-week time span. Phantom took 4.2 hours to resolve each respective event, saving 9.7 months of human work, as well as almost $306,000 in cost savings. It also represented a gain of 27.7 full-time employees.Source: SplunkThat's just one engineer's laptop. Imagine those same metrics for a company of 100+ people. $30 million in cost savings per 2 weeks saves ~$1.56 billion a year. Also, that's almost 4,000 years in time saved. Human capital can be better allocated to somewhere else in the company, which allows the entire operation to become more efficient.Partnerships: Splunk App for Amazon Web ServicesSplunk has made some key acquisitions over the past few years. But they've also built out a very strong partnership network with tech leaders. Splunk serves as an add-on for Google Cloud Platform (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT), and an app for AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN).The Add-On for Google Cloud allows a software administrator to collect events, performance metrics, and billing data using the Google Cloud Platform API. The Add-On for Azure is similar, and operates through Office 365 APIs, Azure Service Management and Store APIs. Both of these add-ons allow Google Cloud or Azure users to connect their data to Splunk for future data processing purposes.Source: SplunkThe Splunk App for AWS is a bit different. Back in November 2018, Splunk announced their integration into AWS Security Hub, through Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Phantom. According to the company website, it ""offers a rich set of pre-built dashboards and reports to analyze and visualize data from numerous AWS services,"" with the main goals of security enhancement, adherence to compliance standards, machine learning leverage, and AWS cost management.Splunk takes the data generated by AWS, and monitors and identifies potential threats. It also adds ""context enrichment"" through Phantom, which can save time on decision-making for the security teams. With almost 29k downloads, the AWS App is much more popular than the GCP add-on and the Azure add-on with only 1,959 downloads and 13,801 downloads, respectively.Source: SplunkThe partnership with AWS is promising because that means that Splunk has a spot with one of the Cloud leaders. Google and Microsoft are each building out their own respective security platforms, so being connected to Amazon should insulate Splunk from going insolvent in the face of increasing competition.Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, said that ""customers love having the agility of AWS with the end-to-end visibility of Splunk.” Splunk can currently ingest 50+ AWS data sources and can be implemented on AWS GovCloud, which is AWS for the government. It also can reach 10+ regions worldwide.Despite their AWS partnership, Splunk does have to watch its back for Backstory. Backstory was released by Google's Chronicle in early March, and Splunk shares dropped 5% in response. Alphabet insisted that there was no competition for Backstory, saying that they have no competitors but ""really compete with doing security intelligence on your own to try to stop cyberattacks.""Splunk has the same goal. Both companies want to make it easier to analyze data, figure out how and when attacks happen, and the best way to fix them. Splunk's four pillars are ""investigate, monitor, analyze, and act"" which is precisely what Backstory intends to do.In a Medium post by Chronicle, it is stated that Backstory ""would give analysts the context they need to protect their organizations…i.e. the backstory"" which is similar wording to Splunk's Enterprise security documentation, where it is stated that ""Splunk Enterprise Security compares asset and identity data with events in Splunk platform to provide data enrichment and additional context for analysis."" I would argue that Backstory does indeed have competition, given the similarity of those two statements.Chronicle pricing will be based off of company size, compared to Splunk's volume of data pricing method. That could provide a competitive edge to Backstory, especially in comparison to Splunk's regressive pricing policy, as outlined in the chart below. However, Splunk's shift towards a renewable model for contracts, coupled with the already 80% reduction in infrastructure costs that customers already experience, might be enough of a pricing and cost savings incentive for customers already. Source: Learn SplunkOf course, Microsoft had to get in on the action with Microsoft Azure Sentinel, which operates as a cloud-based Security Information and Event Management Tool, like Splunk and Backstory. The product was announced in late February.Ann Johnson, the VP of Cybersecurity Solutions at Microsoft, claimed that Azure Sentinel is the ""first native SIEM within a major cloud platform."" Splunk has released cloud-based SIEM tools through AWS, as described above, but Sentinel claims that they are the first major cloud provider to offer the service as an integrated part of the entire cloud portfolio.Tom Kranz, head of cyber labs at 6point6 was less than enthused about the Azure Sentinel announcement, stating:Kranz makes an excellent point. Both Azure and Google Cloud Platform used some sort of security company before they built out Sentinel and Backstory, respectively. Building out their own tech without much acknowledgement to the current competition in the space is understandable, given each company's relative market dominance. But the products might not make as big of an impact that Google and Microsoft are expecting it to.Splunk does things well. Their revenue rose 35% Y/Y, beating estimates by almost $60M. They closed 394 deals worth $1 million or more in 2018, and 24 contracts worth over $10 million. They have a first-mover advantage, and have been able to build the cloud-SIEM space around their product line. They've been a growth leader for six years.Splunk might face an increase in competition from Google and Microsoft, but switching costs, customer loyalty, and strategic alliances will aid them in maintaining market share. They have over 17,500 global customers, adding 600 new customers in Q4 2019 alone.Only 33% of their revenue currently comes from overseas, but they built out their first external Research and Development center in Shanghai, showing their commitment to international growth, especially in China. They have a partnership with Alibaba Cloud (NYSE:BABA) in the APAC region, further cementing the company's openness to strategic partnerships.One of the downsides of Splunk is that they currently do not make money. Net income has been negative since their 2012 IPO. But FY2020 is expected to be the year that the company does go into the black, with ~20% Y/Y growth expected over the next three years. Source: Capital IQThey did experience a large increase in General and Administrative costs, which should be monitored. The company pointed to personnel costs as the main reason for the increase in operating expenses, which makes sense given their specialized industry, a median employee salary of $256k and San Francisco headquarters.They have strong cash flows, with operating cash flows increasing 13% into 2019. They did experience a decrease in investment cash flows due to their acquisitions of VictorOps and Phantom, but the end-of-year debt issuance helped to bolster their total net change in cash to $1.3B. Splunk has an unlevered free cash flow amount of $594.9M for 2019, which was a 4.5x increase from 2018 and a free cash flow yield of 3.25%.The company is not burning through cash right now, experiencing substantial positive cash flows from 2018 and into 2019. Their end period cash and cash equivalents totals $1.87b, a large increase from beginning period amounts of $545M.

Splunk has a Price/Book ratio of 12.32, which is lower than industry average of 14.04. Splunk does appear to be more expensively valued compared to their competition, especially in terms of forward metrics.Source: Capital IQHowever, the stock still has room to grow. Based on my DCF calculations, the stock has a potential upside of 42% at the current stock price of $125. It has an expected growth rate of 11%, based on my calculation of an expected return on invested capital and retention ratio, and carries a weighted average cost of capital of 12.3%. On the low end, the stock has a potential of a 6% return and a high-end potential of 128% return.Source: Author This is relatively in line with Capital IQ estimates as well, with those estimates based off a combination of LTM TEV/Total Revenue, NTM Forward P/E and LTM P/BV.Source: Capital IQMicrosoft and Google do make the security space more competitive than it was, but Splunk is poised for success through their partnership with AWS, as well as their strategic acquisitions of Phantom and VictorOps. The company has a solid overseas growth plan, and their Shanghai R&D center provides for a strong foothold in China.If you own tech stocks in your portfolio, you should consider purchasing a security tech stock to complement them. Splunk has a lot of room for growth, and with a strong balance sheet and great margins, the company is a good addition to a tech-focused portfolio."
4267081,98236,2019-05-29T14:27:48-04:00,"Late last week Splunk announced its fiscal Q1 results.The results, for the most part, were very strong and showed accelerating growth in software revenues as well as a strong margin performance.The company continues to dominate its Log Analysis space with multiple offerings in multiple use cases and strong acceptance as a security paradigm.The company now reports new metrics that seem to have confused some stake holders but show lots of growth that is exceeding prior expectations.The company's cash flow shortfall has more to do with its transition to cloud and subscription consumption models. The shortfall this year is completely transitory.","Sometimes you just do not know what it is that might spook investors. Last week, Splunk (SPLK) reported what seemed like a strong quarter, and it raised guidance. But apparently the results and the guidance weren’t pleasing to investors-or at least not pleasing enough-as the shares fell noticeably on Friday. At this point, the shares are lower than they were at the end of last September and the one year gain of about 11% compares to a gain of the IGV of 16.5%. And Splunk, once the epitome of a highly valued enterprise IT company, has seen its valuation compress to a point where it is below average for its growth cohort.’Is this current share price a decent entry into Splunk shares? Is something negative happening to Splunk’s positioning? Is the company’s long term growth rate materially contracting? I haven’t commented much on this name in quite some time. I did suggest that its valuation had started to look much more investor friendly last summer, and that its capital raise was a thing of beauty for shareholders. But I haven’t written extensively on the name since last July when the shares were around $100. I don’t have Splunk shares in the Ticker Target high-growth portfolio-but at this price, and this valuation, I think it makes sense for readers and subscribers to consider starting a position. I do not believe the company’s sales motion is at risk, or that its competitors-either its direct competitors or its functional alternatives are gaining ground on the company.I think the company will continue to grow both its TAM and revenue and see rising profitability in years to come. The issue with cash flow guidance is essentially meaningless and transitory. I would be a buyer of this name at this price. And I expect for the shares to achieve positive Alpha and to return to relative strength over the coming year.Splunk actually reported that its total revenues rose by 36%. And it reported that it non-GAAP operating margin was negative 2%. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter rose to almost 82% up from 79.3% in the prior year. These numbers were substantial beats-the prior consensus for revenue had been growth of 27% and the prior estimate for non-GAAP operating margins had been negative 8%. The non-GAAP operating expense ratio for the quarter was about 78%, compared to 84% in the prior year. Even the reported stock based comp expense fell a little bit from 32% to 30%-although of course 30% is an outlier and far above average for even high-growth software companies.The company did raise guidance-although by no great amount. Q2 revenue expectations were increased by 1%, and margin guidance was raised nominally. For the full year, the company increased it revenue guidance by a bit more than the beat of Q1 and the raise of Q2. It is now forecasting that it will report growth of 25% in reported revenues for the full year, compared to a prior estimate of 23%. The company has actually beat its forecasts every quarter now since 2016, when its earnings just met estimates in a single quarter. Revenues have been greater than forecast for every quarter for no less than 5 years. I think it would be reasonable to imagine that full year percentage revenue growth will reach close to 30% or perhaps higher, a strong level of performance given both the size of the company, and the move to ratable consumption agreements.The culprit, at least according to headlines relating to last week’s pullback, relates to weak cash flow, which fell by more than half in Q1, and did so, mainly because the decline in deferred revenues, a normal seasonal event, more than trebled. The company is now forecasting operating cash flow of $250 million this year, and that compares to a prior forecast of $350 million. Cash flow the prior year had been $295 million. Cash flow is a product of many items, and in particular, a company in the midst of a transition from perpetual to ratable revenue streams, will see cash flow change in a given time period based on the level of ratable business that it closes. In this quarter, the ratable component of its business increased from about 77% last year, or perhaps a bit less, in Q1, to 85% in this latest reported quarter. And in a nutshell, that is the sole reason for the decline in cash flow compared to its projection for the year in the prior quarter.Splunk shares have drawn the ire of the analyst team at Citi for almost the past year now, initially based on concerns about what they described as “plateauing growth.” After the results of this quarter were released, the analyst propounding the negative thesis cut his price target further, from $112 to $106. The Citi analyst in question, Walter Pritchard, has been in this field for quite some time and is well regarded by many. His current justification for his thesis about slowing growth at Splunk relates to maintenance revenue. It is a very weak support for the thesis; Splunk’s maintenance revenue growth has declined, as its cloud revenues have increased. Simply put, consuming Splunk in the cloud affords users a service that includes maintenance so the decline in maintenance growth is not terribly surprising. It is hard to talk about plateauing growth for Splunk with a straight face and a reasonably sized nose in the wake of a headline 36% revenue growth, a 54% growth in software, and an adjusted growth of more than 30% in considering the impact on Remaining Performance Obligations.I have commented in the past when writing about other companies, that bookings as a metric used to value high-growth names has become a bit obsolete. That said, it is likely that one factor that has weighed on the shares is the miss in the estimated bookings metric that came to $353 million as opposed to the published expectation for bookings of $373 million. Is that a problem? The major shortfall apparently came in the area of long-term deferred revenue change which is more or less an unforecastable metric. No one can know if users will choose to pay in advance for large enterprise contracts that have a multi-year duration. There is no real incentive that makes sense for a large enterprise to attempt to gauge their consumption of different Splunk solutions into the distant future. It is a completely random event, which of course is why this management and many others no longer try to forecast it. It is much more accurate in the new world of ASC 606 disclosure to calculate some bookings proxy by the use of the change in what is called Remaining Performance Obligation added to the actual revenue results in a quarter. Using that methodology, the so-called bookings growth proxy comes to a bit more than 30% and was quite a bit greater than prior estimates for bookings growth. Even that number, understates the strength of the company’s business as it is influenced by non-software elements such as services. Overall, the level of software sales this past quarter was one of the strongest this company has achieved in some time, and its growth seems not to be reflected by its share price, and the share price reaction to the earnings release.Some analysts have attempted to provide a new subscription ACV calculation. It is a valiant effort, but unfortunately I don’t think it is entirely accurate. Some of the numbers presented are simply not credible and the numbers that are less tendentious, show evidence of a very volatile and very seasonal set of quarterly contract signings.I would be very much surprised if that level of variability as portrayed in some of these reports actually exists for Splunk in the real world. In the real world, the metric that is now used by Splunk and which should be incorporated into the analysis, is Remaining Performance Obligation. This should replace billings as the metric of choice in evaluating the performance of this company. The RPO metric jumped sharply compared to normal seasonality, mainly because of an $80 million increase in unbilled contractual commitments in this past quarter. In aggregate, the RPO metric was $1.2 billion, an increase of 57% year on year. While that is not a metric that is likely to continue to grow at that rate, it does suggest that the company is achieving very strong performance when looking at the sales metrics holistically.At this point, Splunk does not include RPO and unbilled in its earnings presentation although it is discussed on the conference call; that can be a reason as to why investors didn’t react rationally to the earnings release. I do think investors would be far better served in evaluating Splunk and its sales productivity to look at that metric rather than billings which can be strongly influenced by the timing of printing invoices.Notionally, Splunk’s valuation is not longer prohibitive. It is below average for its estimated growth cohort in the mid 20% range. In fact, the shares on an EV/S/growth basis are now in the range of the valuation of Wix (WIX) and PayPal (PYPL), and actually below the valuation of Autodesk (ADSK) and Adobe (ADBE), just to name a couple of other well-known software vendors.My calculation of EV/S on a 12 month forward basis has dropped to about 7X, and the company, despite the expense involved in moving to a subscription basis, has still been able to retain a 10% operating cash flow margin, albeit with the help of a substantial level of stock based compensation.And despite the revised forecast for cash flow this year, Splunk still is more profitable when looked at on the basis of its cash flow margin/compared to its growth rate than average. And there seems little doubt, that the cash flow results projected this year are more transitory in nature having to do to the noticeable transition from perpetual to renewable bookings which drives strong increases in uninvoiced contract value in the short term but which will drive much higher cash flow in the next few fiscal years.I really do not imagine that too many people think that it is, although from time to time, articles appear on SA to that effect. But beyond SA, there were comments from well-known brokerage analysts with regards to moderating business momentum -although the author has the share rated as a buy and maintains a $157 price target. In his case, he says one ought to own Splunk shares because “the company is a unique asset that extracts value from unstructured data.” I think readers should own the shares because this past quarter was exceptionally strong, on both an absolute basis, and relative to expectations and that strength seems likely to continue into the foreseeable future. I simply do not see the kind of moderating business momentum that some might have seen and which might have hobbled share price performance in the wake of the quarterly earnings release.The issue, which is not really an issue, is that the company has chosen to focus on providing more and more data with regards to its performance and some of the data its provides is not always familiar to everyone or is subject to multiple interpretations due to lack of historical context. But if there is a single thing that is important to understand about this company, it is the sales culture. Splunk has been a sales machine essentially since it started, and while the original founder has retired, by all accounts that hasn’t diminished the sales focus. The company spends an enormous sum on sales and marketing-last quarter that ratio came to 66% of revenues on a GAAP basis, and that is actually less than the level of the prior year when the sales and market expense level was 70%. It might be argued that the company doesn’t have the most efficient of selling mechanisms-but at the end of the day, the success this company has enjoyed in creating a substantial business speaks for the validity of its strategy and sales effort.Splunk is the leader in what is called SIEM (security information and event logging). Splunk was one of the earliest competitors in the space and its marketing efforts were essential in seeing the space take-off. It is still the leader in selling SIEM. I have linked here to a guide to Splunk alternatives. There are plenty of these, but the disparity in sales and marketing spend between Splunk and these alternatives is such as to have left Splunk with a commanding market share in the space. For the convenience of readers with an interest in such things, I have provided a link to the Gartner evaluation of the SIEM space. Splunk has been one of the leaders since the space was first looked at by Gartner, it remains a leader and it is has positive evaluations both from Gartner itself and users. The principle issue users have with Splunk is that it can cost quite a bit-typically what market leaders are able to do.As can be seen from this Gartner market share evaluation, Splunk has continued to gain share in the faster growth areas of its solution set including Performance analysis, and other monitoring tools such as what is called ITSI (IT service intelligence tools). It is not feasible in a single article that is focused on quarterly performance to evaluate all of the different components that make up Splunk’s product portfolio. This quarter, the conference call focused on the success that Splunk is having with the platform it calls Phantom. Phantom is a platform that was introduced about a year ago, as part of the acquisition of a company of that name. The company provides security orchestration, automation and response which is known as SOAR. SOAR is a set of offerings that might reasonably be expected to grow the TAM for Splunk and to meaningful accelerate its growth rate. Last quarter, the company booked its first 7 figure Phantom deal which I imagine is a harbinger of things to come.In Q1, Splunk closed 400 new name accounts. That is a strong metric relative to the performance in the recent past and yet perhaps not strong enough for some observers. Historically, new customers have been Splunk enterprise customers. But these days, Splunk offers a service from an acquisition called VictorOps, and because of the way it is priced and consumed, its customers are not part of the total. Splunk has a variety of consumption options on the cloud and these options do not always create a new customer count, as the company defines that metric. It is the kind of subject about which it might be said it has the relevance of the number of angels living on a pin-but there are analysts who are concerned about and write about such things for no purpose other than to support their thesis about why investors should avoid the shares.Splunk has set a goal of achieving 20k customers by the end of the year, and it needs to close more than 400 customers each quarter. Q1’s are seasonally slow for new customers-and the fact is that the 400 number is rounded down. There are analysts who felt this was an area of less than great performance-again, I look at Splunk holistically and not in particular silos. Splunk at this stage, will achieve much of the company’s growth through the sales of the full product line to the installed base. That was one of the reasons for the strong software license performance in Q1. 400 new nameplates was good enough for me and is good enough to keep Splunk’s growth rate in the hyper territory.I believe that Splunk, in the future, will bring down the sales and marketing expense ratio and will pivot its spending a little more to research and development. Last quarter, research and development was up 50% year on year, while sales and marketing increased by just 32%. I have commented when writing about other companies, that I like to see higher levels of research investment to an extent that it can offset investment in sales and marketing. That strategy, for example has served Atlassian (TEAM) favorably. For a company like this, with dramatic recognition in the IT space, it doesn’t need quite the level of sales and marketing investment that was rationale in times past. I think the pivot to supplying the market with a greater array of products will both build the company’s moat and lead to a continuation of hyper growth at rates above 30%.There are a host of newer companies that Splunk might face in the area of IT ops and of course companies that have capabilities in search that could be part of an IT Ops solution. Are any of these companies a threat to Splunk’s growth and dominance in the space? It is somewhat difficult to handicap some of these newer companies that use machine data to provide alerts to provide threat analysis and warning. Some of these companies are well known names such as Atlassian, PagerDuty (PD) and Everbridge (EVBG)I am not going to try to evaluate all of the different use cases that can be developed using the data from log analysis. This was a concern of one questioner on the call and the CEO tried to articulate both the benefits and the limitations of companies that are focused on a single lens, as he described it.Many people like to believe that investing in the IT space is a zero sum game. I think that it is not and that there will be room for multiple companies doing slightly different things. Splunk has built a franchise, not just in the SIEM space, but in the other spaces that can use an analysis of machine data to improve productivity and efficiency.As I write this, Splunk shares are making a modest recovery, although given the performance of the shares thus far this month, it is more in the nature of a dead cat bounce. The shares have under-performed now, for some time, and that has come despite strong operational performance.I think that the results that were reported for Q1 should have been received positively. Splunk’s valuation compression has reached a point where it valued as though the outlook for the company has deteriorated meaningfully. If there is any change, whatsoever, the outlook for Splunk has gotten better.The outlook for cash flow has more to do with a transitory, transition issue rather than some negative implication for profitability or the ability of the company to generate cash. It has more to do with the company’s transition to the cloud and to subscription revenues at a more accelerated pace and that is a good thing which will ultimately generate higher cash flow margins.The company has some new metrics that should best be used to evaluate its progress than the bookings proxy which no longer reflects the level of growth the company is achieving. With a 30%+ growth in the new metric that tracks business activity, I think investors need to carefully evaluate the opportunity in these shares at this point. I think the opportunity for positive alpha over the coming year has increased and will continue to do so."
4247559,104608,2019-03-09T16:01:36-05:00,"Splunk is a great long-term play on big data and the transition to the cloud and has performed exceptionally well so far this year.Q4 earnings and billings metrics were well above consensus estimates; however, shares traded down on soft 2020 guidance.2020 revenue guidance was slightly raised to $2.2 billion, though operating margin was left unchanged.Valuation appears to price in most of the upside for the year; however, the stock would become very attractive if closer to $110.","Splunk (SPLK) reported another good Q4 earnings report with revenue and billings; however, shares have traded down ~10% since. Management raised 2020 guidance and remains very confident in the long-term outlook of the company.SPLK was not immune to the massive tech sell-off in October-December, with the shares down over 30% from peak to trough. However, SPLK was very resilient since the beginning of the year, with the shares up nearly 50% before earnings. At this point, the brief 10% decline in share price could be for two reasons. First, investors may believe F2020 guidance seems about right and the stock currently prices in that upside. And second, investors could be taking some money off the table after the strong run in the past few months.Splunk is a great long-term play on big data and the transition to the cloud with the company showing continued strong demand trends this past quarter. Although the stock has rebounded quite nicely the past few months, it remains down ~10% after earnings, despite reporting a strong Q4 and raising FY20 guidance.Data by YChartsFor most of 2018, Splunk was in extreme rally mode, rising nearly 50% at one point, reaching its all-time highs. The months of October/November/December were challenging for most of the market, and the tech sector was no exception. The stock was down over 30% from the all-time highs before beginning another rally phase in late November. The phantom recovery was met with a challenging December. However, since the start of the year, the stock was up nearly 50% but has since declined ~10% after a strong earnings.Q4 revenue grew 35% y/y to $622.1 million, decelerating from the 40% y/y growth in Q3. Revenue was significantly ahead of consensus estimates for $563 million. Software revenue also performed pretty well, growing 42% y/y for the quarter, a deceleration from 49% growth last quarter, however, on a much tougher comparable.Source: Company PresentationSoftware revenue growth, which includes cloud and license grew over 40% for the quarter, including a strong performance of license which was well above consensus expectations. As this revenue continues to grow well above the overall company growth, cloud will begin to represent a larger share of revenue - this could become a large driver of future growth as more enterprises continually look to transition to the cloud.Billings also performed nicely in the quarter, with total billings of $798 million, over 10% ahead of consensus estimates for $725 million. Billings growth of 29% for the quarter was largely due to new and existing customers expanding their use cases and utilization of cloud and on-premise solutions.Source: Company PresentationOperating margin of 26.8% was slightly ahead of consensus estimates. The slight expansion in operating margin makes sense as SPLK saw their revenue decelerate slightly. As Splunk's revenue naturally decelerates, we should begin to see operating margin improve and the company become more profitable. At these margins, Splunk remains ahead of other faster growing software names, which typically have breakeven to negative operating margins as the companies chase after top-line growth.Q4 EPS of $0.93 came in well ahead of consensus estimates of $0.76 largely due to the significant revenue beat and slight margin beat.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided guidance for Q1 and FY20.For Q1, management sees revenue growing to $395 million, which would put the company over a $2.25 billion run-rate. In addition, management sees operating margin to be -8%. Typically, FQ1 revenue and operating margins are seasonally lower, with both of these guidance metrics similar to consensus estimates.For FY20, management is now expecting revenue of $2.20 billion, up from their previous guidance of $2.15 billion. The slight raise here implies ~22% revenue growth for the year, a massive deceleration from the 38% revenue growth in FY19. I believe management continues to be conservative in their guidance as this sets them up for a beat and raise potential year.Operating margin guidance remained the same at 14%, which was similar to consensus estimates. Shares were weak following the earnings report and guidance largely due to investors expecting a bit more revenue growth considering margins were left unchanged. With revenues expecting to decelerate ~16% from last year, investors would typically expect operating margins to expand, thus, rendering a more profitable company. However, this was not the case for SPLK which has caused some investors to fear the lack of operating margin leverage.Splunk's valuation has bounced around quite frequently over the past few months, similar to many other tech names. However, Splunk is a very solid, long-term investment given management's confidence in the underlying business trends and very strong revenue growth rate. It put out an updated preliminary revenue guidance for FY20, which implies revenue growth of ~22%, decelerating from the 38% growth in FY19. Operating margins are guided to ~14%, which was left unchanged from previous guidance.I believe management continues to remain conservative with its guidance, as it should be. Coming off a 38% revenue growth year, it is challenging to imagine this type of success is likely to continue over time, especially as the company eclipses a $2 billion revenue run-rate. The law of large numbers eventually settles in and revenue naturally will decelerate.However, I do believe management's guidance is quite conservative. At ~22% growth rate through FY20, this would imply a 16% deceleration. I believe revenue will end up growing ~30-35% in FY20 as Splunk is likely to beat and raise each quarter.The main question for FY20 is whether the 14% operating margin remains intact. Investors are likely to focus on this metric, as well as free cash flow, a bit more in the upcoming year than the past year. If revenue growth does decelerate to 22%, I would anticipate operating margins to expand well above 14% in order for the stock to have a strong year. If operating margins remain flattish and revenue growth does decelerate this much, I believe the stock could be in a hold pattern for a little bit.With the stock currently trading at ~$120, the company has a market cap of $18.2 billion. Netting out the $1.9 billion of cash and $1.6 billion of debt, the company has an enterprise value of ~$18 billion. Using management's $2.2 billion FY20 revenue number, we get a FY20 revenue multiple of 8.2x, which seems to price in a decent amount of beat and raise potential.For my personal analysis, I assume revenue ends up growing closer to 30% during the year, bringing FY20 revenue to ~$2.35 billion and lowering the revenue multiple to 7.7x, a bit more reasonable for this price. As long as the company continues to grew revenue at a decent clip and is able to provide upside to profitability, I believe the stock should perform pretty well throughout the year.Risks to SPLK include revenue growth decelerating to the lower 20s with operating margins not expanding during the year. Typically when a software company begins to see revenue growth decelerate, operating margins and profitability expand. If this does not turn out to be the case for SPLK, investors could punish the name over the next few quarters.For now, I would be cautious around building up a position with the stock trading around $120. If we start to see the stock fall closer to $110, this would provide a great buying opportunity."

Although the stock has rebounded quite nicely the past few weeks, it remains down ~10% from its all-time highs, despite reporting a very encouraging Q3 report. Splunk reported revenue growth of 40%, which accelerated from Q2 and significantly beat consensus estimates.Data by YChartsFor most of 2018, Splunk was in extreme rally mode, rising nearly 50% at one point, reaching its all-time highs. The months of October/November/December were challenging for most of the market, and the tech sector was no exception.

Revenue was significantly ahead of consensus estimates for $433 million, or 26% y/y growth. The significant revenue bet immediately sent the shares up, and rightfully so. Splunk is now one quarter away from being a ~$2 billion run-rate revenue company growing revenue 35-40%, a feat not many companies have ever achieved.Source: Company PresentationCloud revenue, in my opinion, remains a hidden gem for the company. Though only ~10% of total revenue, cloud revenue grew 87% y/y this past quarter, a testament to the cloud's potential. As this revenue continues to grow well above the overall company growth, cloud will begin to represent a larger share of revenue - this could become a large driver of future growth as more enterprises continually look to transition to the cloud.Splunk continues to transform its revenue base and transition toward a more recurring revenue stream. This is different than its historical perpetual license, where an enterprise would pay a larger upfront cost and receive Splunk's services in perpetuity. Management continues to push for 75% of software sales to be on a recurring basis by next year, which could ultimately help its valuation. Investors tend to place a higher multiple on software companies that generate recurring revenue streams, as this type of revenue is highly predictable and visible.One interesting piece of commentary from management has been its discussion around the headwind created when transitioning to cloud/recurring revenue. As this revenue is recurring, it does not have a large upfront flow of revenue. This presents a minor revenue headwind compared to prior periods where Splunk would recognize large upfront revenue from its perpetual license deals.Source: Company PresentationOperating margins were a bit lower than usual, clocking in at 13.6% compared to 15.5% in the year-ago period. This is not out of the ordinary considering Splunk has found a way to accelerate its revenue growth to 40%, which typically comes with higher operating expenses such as S&M. As Splunk's revenue naturally decelerates, we should begin to see operating margin improve and the company become more profitable. At these margins, Splunk remains ahead of other faster growing software names, which typically have breakeven to negative operating margins as the companies chase after top-line growth.Q3 EPS of $0.38 came in ahead of consensus estimates of $0.31 despite the lower operating margin. The EPS beat was overwhelmingly due to the large revenue beat. Going forward, we should see revenue decelerate but margins expand, thus leading to continued increases in profitability.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided guidance for Q4 and FY20.For Q4, management sees revenue growing to $560 million, which would put the company at a near $2.25 billion run-rate. In addition, management sees operating margin expanding to 25-26%.For the full year, management sees revenue to be ~$1.740 billion, a rather large increase compared to its previous guidance of ~$1.685 billion. The new guidance also calls for operating margin of 11.5-12.0% compared to the previous guidance of ~11.5%. Although this is a small increase, along with the raise in revenue guidance, Splunk remains very confident in its ability to generate profitability.In addition, management raised its FY20 revenue guidance to ~$2.15 billion, a 7% increase from the previous $2.0 billion guidance. The FY20 revenue guidance also implies ~24% revenue growth during the year, which seems very conservative given the current 35-40% revenue growth rates. A company which raises the year-out guidance this far in advance must be very confident in its ability to deliver, and I believe Splunk will deliver an even greater revenue base by the end of FY20.Splunk's valuation has bounced around quite frequently over the past few months, similar to many other tech names. However, Splunk is a very solid, long-term investment given management's confidence in the underlying business trends and very strong revenue growth rate. It put out an updated preliminary revenue guidance for FY20, which implies revenue growth of ~24%. Operating margins, although not guided to, are likely to expand from the current FY19 guidance range of 11.5-12.0%.I believe management continues to remain conservative with its guidance, as it should be. Coming off a 40% revenue growth quarter, it is challenging to imagine this type of success is likely to continue over time, especially as the company eclipses a $2 billion revenue run-rate. The law of large numbers eventually settles in and revenue naturally will decelerate.However, I do believe management's guidance is quite conservative. At ~24% growth rate through FY20, this would imply a rather large 10-percentage point deceleration from current growth levels. I believe revenue will end up growing ~30-35% in FY20 as Splunk is likely to beat and raise each quarter. In addition, profitability will likely expand further in FY19 and could end up being closer to 13-15% in FY20.With the stock currently trading ~$120, the company has a market cap of $17.7 billion. Netting out the $2.79 billion of cash and $1.61 billion of debt, the company has an enterprise value of $16.5 billion. Using management's $2.15 billion FY20 revenue number, we get a FY20 revenue multiple of 7.7x, which does not seem overly expensive for a company which will end up growing ~30-35% in FY20.For investors who are looking for a long-term winner, Splunk could be that name. With FY20 guidance already being raised ~7% to $2.15 billion and Splunk's history of beat-and-raise earnings, it could be setting itself up for another successful year. Valuation remains a bit expensive, but compared to other software companies growing 35%+ with mid-teens positive operating margins, this name appears to be a good deal."

It was also recognized by IDC as the fastest-growing vendor in the IT Operations market and by Gartner as the second biggest player in the AIOps/ITIM/Other Monitoring Tools category. In some sectors, Splunk is outpacing market growth and eating into its competitors' share. For instance, in the security market, IDC estimates that Splunk grew five times faster than IBM and Micro Focus in 2017.Splunk has been successful at integrating the complexity and chaos of today's data with its platform to help users find insights without the need for parsing and structuring data. It is aligning itself with the market's requirements of advanced analytics and machine-learning based approach. It has expanded across the IT universe so that customers like SoftBank who may have initially signed for mobile devices and application management are now also using it for infrastructure and operations management.Some of the new features that Splunk has released through its general offering and through the Next platform are seeing interesting uses. For instance, the University of Connecticut is using Splunk's new features in their aquaponics lab so that the researchers can use their mobile devices and walk through the lab to check things like UV light and pH balance to monitor the growth of their fish.

SPLK’s technological advantage, sales alignment and disarray in competitors are likely to help the company grow significantly. As a long-term bet, SPLK can be a neat portfolio addition.SPLK is known for solutions to collect, monitor, and analyze machine-level data to interpret security threats. Additionally, the company’s solutions also help respond to possible threats using AI, ML etc. While SPLK operates primarily in the business intelligence space, the company’s big data and machine data focus make it significantly different from a Tableau (DATA). DATA sits on top of organizational databases, indexes and builds out a view of user-generated data, which helps to discover insights from past work etc.The data targeted by SPLK is mostly generated by the activity of machines, codes, appliances etc. This data is also known as log files. The granularity and timestamped nature of data help in monitoring and analysis. The key use cases revolve around user and entity behavior analytics, enterprise security and monitoring KPIs for critical business processes.SPLK’s products also do not have the constraints of a typical database:Source: SPLK 10K – 2018By making decisions in-situ, not only has SPLK’s has made a marked shift from trend forecasting to real-time actioning but also has obliterated the requirement of data to be in a particular format. For critical process monitoring, this aspect is invaluable – a business manager can continuously monitor data without having to worry about exceptions arising from newer threats or data types. This ‘schema-on-the-fly’ paradigm also allows for almost unlimited coverage of data types, increasing the ROI of the solution. SPLK complements this analysis power with a search processing language or SPL, aimed at helping users build queries on top of the evolving data sets.While the complexity and cost of the SPLK’s products have been cited as a challenge, the depth and breadth of the solution have made over 85 of the Fortune 100 companies as its customers. Unsurprisingly, SPLK has been featured in Gartner’s magic quadrant for SIEM or security information and event management for the fifth consecutive year.Source: GartnerWith the convergence of the user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) and SIEM markets, SPLK’s acquisition of Caspida and Phantom is likely to make it a recommended choice for customers.Although SIEM is only a part of SPLK's overall TAM, evolution in the SIEM market also gives a broader sense of the machine data processing space. Source: SPLK Analyst DayWhile LogRhythm is a pureplay SIEM (and UEBA) player, SPLK is more of a pureplay big data software company. IBM’s (IBM) presence is also not a complete surprise given the company’s enterprise software presence. For McAfee also, machine data-based security offerings are purely an extension of its core security business.Source: GartnerWhat is interesting is how things stack up beyond market presence.Users’ preference of SPLK to LogRhythm, LogRhythm and McAfee's likely marriage preparations and over 40% customers’ unwillingness to recommend IBM are likely to accelerate momentum seen by SPLK in 2Q18.Customer growthFor several years, SPLK’s customer growth had been slowing down.Source: SPLK Financial Model. Note: The SPLK Financial Model has been built by the author using SEC filings, investor presentations, and competitor analysis. 2Q19 seems to have marked a change to this trend.Source: SPLK Financial ModelEven the deal metrics seem to be on an upswing. For 1H19, SPLK reported 104 $1 million+ deals vs 85 in 1H18. Additionally, SPLK also appears to have achieved a balance between retaining existing customers and getting new ones right. Previously, the company was spending a disproportionate amount of time on ensuring renewal rates remain high.Source: 2Q19 Earnings Call Source: SPLK Analyst DayNo wonder, 2Q19 was a much-awaited quarter for SPLK:Source: 2Q19 Earnings Call Contract mixAnother lever to this growth is the average contract duration. SPLK sells software on a perpetual and term (subscription) basis, with a focus on shifting to the renewable term contracts.In case of a perpetual license, SPLK recognizes the license fee portion upfront. In the case of a term contract, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract duration. While in the long term, the shift to a subscription model will be beneficial, in the near term it causes loss of advanced revenue (due to the move away from perpetual licenses).During its 2Q19 earnings call, the SPLK management disclosed that the average term contract duration had moved up to 33 months for 1H19 from 25 months a year earlier. This compares with an average duration of 36 months for a term contract to become equivalent to a perpetual one.While this delta in duration may be a headwind in absolute basis (until duration hits 36 months), the ramp-up in duration will also lead to better q/q and y/y comps in the interim. At the current rate, SPLK’s average term contract duration should reach 36 months by end of F2019.Source: SPLK Financial ModelBear caseIn the worst case, the current momentum is likely to be a flash in the pan. SPLK would continue to invest in the search for a balance between servicing existing customer and get new ones on board. This will lead to a lower revenue growth coupled with a higher opex.Base caseThe most likely case is that of the light at the end of the tunnel turns out to be a bright morning. SPLK’s customer additions should continue to accelerate with a steady growth of $1 million+ deals. The efforts of the past three years should continue to show leverage, helping in controlling opex.Bull caseIn the blue-sky scenario, lack of competitive intensity should fuel growth beyond the results of SPLK’s own efforts. An accelerating revenue growth and muted opex growth should pave the way for superior cash flows.On a P/S basis, SPLK trades at an expensive 12-13x multiple.SPLK data by YChartsHowever, the company is not really a simple cloud play that can be seen in context of a P/S multiple.SPLK is a leader in the growing machine data processing market. The technological know-how required to enter this market and SPLK’s enviable real-time decision technology are significant competitive differentiators for the company. This makes SPLK a long term-play, best valued using a DCF approach.Source: SPLK Financial ModelWhile improving competition can definitely hamper SPLK’s revenue growth, the current market scenario may actually be a tailwind for SPLK. Unless IBM or another big player were to go on a shopping spree aimed at disrupting the market, the pecking order should mostly stay intact. This makes SPLK as the only pure-play, investible choice in a fast-growing market.Notes:"
4207169,104099,2018-09-19T11:47:42-04:00,"Although there's something obviously compelling about this company and the market it serves, the stock is overpriced in my view.Given the nature of the market it serves, growing sales come with growing expenses, calling into question the scalability of this enterprise.With an assumed growth rate of 11%, and a price to free cash flow north of 60 times, investors are being asked to pay too much for an uncertain future.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of Splunk Inc. (SPLK) are up about 85%, and I think there’ll be more downside than upside from these levels. Thus, I think shareholders would be wise to sell now. I’ll go through my reasoning by looking at the financial history here, and by looking at the stock as a thing separate from the business itself. In sum, although there’s something very compelling about a business that services such a fast growing area, at the moment investors are being asked to pay too much for too little in my view. Before getting into my analysis proper, though, I’ll go through the bullish arguments in an effort to understand them. I’ll (hopefully) steelman them and refute them where I can and acknowledge their merit where I can’t.Splunk is a company that allows its customers to gain instant access to intelligence by harnessing their data. Splunk’s software allows customers to collect, index, search, and correlate data regardless of format or source. Splunk allows a customer to access large and diverse data sets (“big data”), and specifically tailored for “machine data.”The “Splunk Enterprise” software is relatively compelling for a host of reasons. It is easy to use, so a company doesn’t need extensive professional support after installation. In addition, customers have the ability to “try before they buy” with a 60 day trial. “Splunk Cloud” is a subscription based service where a customer will pay an annual subscription fee based on a combination of data retention period and the volume of data indexed per day.There is obviously a growing need for products like these given that is reasonably expected to grow more diverse and voluminous. That growing demand shows in the company’s financial statements.I think it’s best to be as intellectually honest as possible in all domains for a host of reasons. In general it leads to a more honest, productive discussion, and in the domain of investing, it helps us all avoid losses. We all have biases, hidden or overt (e.g. “the firm will at some point be able to scale its G&A costs”), and those can get us into trouble. Fully engaging in the other side of a debate may help us uncover some of those potentially destructive biases and make more money or avoid significant losses. With that said, I’ll go through the best arguments the bulls have to offer and either do my best refutation or acknowledge it.It’s very reasonable to suggest that many of a company’s expenses will be front loaded. Startups are expensive. Building out capacity, finding new customers (who will remain loyal customers in future), building new products etc. are expensive and investors could be forgiven for assuming that profitability will happen when expense growth slows while revenue growth continues. After all, it’s far less expensive to service an existing customer than to acquire a new one. It’s also the case that some of these backward facing financial metrics are less than useless here, because an argument could be made that some things which should be capitalized are in fact expensed (why, for instance, should we expense R&D when it increases the likelihood of future sales? Isn’t that the definition of an asset?). These arguments sound reasonable enough. At the moment, the market is betting that at some future unknown date, the company will turn profitable as expense growth slows materially and revenue continues to grow.This prompts the question “why?” I have many friends who are religious believers and I’ll confess that we sometimes share a sardonic laugh at the expense of investors who, on the one hand, insist on living in an “evidence based way"", while maintaining faith in the capital markets or a company's business plan. This sort of thinking puts me in mind of some of the best animation in recent memory. The thing that makes this company compelling to investors and customers is revenue growth on the one hand and continuous technological innovation on the other. This dual need puts the firm on a treadmill of sorts, where the costs of attracting customers at a rapid rate is continuous innovation in product offerings (R&D expense) and a continuous increase in headcount (increasing sales force and G&A). In my view, if the company rests on its laurels, revenue will soon slow, and the game will end. Thus, in my view, there is a high degree of probability that the firm won’t achieve a “tipping point” of profitability.A quick review of the financial history here reveals that this is a growth company. In my view, everything at Splunk Inc. grows. For instance, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 33%, and gross profit is up at 30%. The problem is that that’s where the “good” growth ends. Expenses are also up a great deal. For example, R&D, Sales and marketing, and G&A are up at a CAGR of 32%, 30%, and 24% respectively. The result of all of this is that net loss has grown at a CAGR of about 27% over the past five years. In fact it could be said that the more this company sells, the worse it does. I say that because I ran a regression on revenue and “income” at Splunk and found a strong (r=-.68) negative correlation between the two.Given the long history of economic loss here, it doesn’t come as a surprise that the number of shares outstanding has grown at a CAGR of about 6% over the past five years. In my experience, investors aren’t aware of the truly pernicious effects of dilution, and this is one of the principle risks associated with investing in this company.Comparing the first six months of this year to the same period a year ago, it seems that growth is intact. Specifically, revenue is 38% higher than it was in the same period a year ago. Net loss is up “only” 15% over the same period, which I imagine is some consolation. On the bright side, net cash from operations is up 70% from the same period a year ago, driven largely by a massive decrease in accounts receivable. Interestingly, stock based compensation is up only ~9% from the same time last year. This suggests that increases in stock price which caused greater expenses, thus increasing the loss isn’t a reasonable argument. The loss widened from last year to this because the pattern was maintained: R&D was up 35%, sales and marketing was up 29%, and G&A was up 44%.One group that has benefited a great deal over the past five years is the employees at the firm. Since 2014, the per employee stock based compensation has grown at a CAGR of about 10%, although it hasn’t risen at an as steady rate as some of the other companies that I’ve written about recently.Source: Company filings, “per employee compensation” calculated by author.It should be obvious by now that I think there’s value here. In my view, one of two things are possible. First, the company will continue to grow expenses as it grows revenue to serve its admittedly growing market. Second, at some future date the company will start to generate economic profits as revenue growth outpaces expense growth. I consider the first scenario to be more likely for the foreseeable future, but I can’t completely discount the fact that this may eventually be a profitable enterprise.Based on that, I need to spend some time looking at the stock itself. It is the case that a troubled company may be an excellent investment if the price is right. In order to determine whether a troubled company can be a great investment, I look at a few variables, one of which I will go over in this article, namely price to free cash flow. To paraphrase someone whom I consider to be one of the most overrated politicians of the last 50 years “let me be clear”, I’m not stating that Splunk is troubled. I’m simply saying that a troubled company can still be an excellent investment at the right price.Although the company has been more expensive than it currently is on a price to free cash flow per share basis, it is still quite expensive. In my view, the more an investor pays for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be their subsequent returns. That, plus the fact that there are a host of other, less expensive future cash streams available, I’m prompted to wonder why an investor would choose to put capital to work in this company.Source: GurufocusIn my view, investors start to pay attention to more exotic valuation models near the top of a market in order to rationalize valuations. I don’t think this ends well, but I’ll look at one of the more popular valuation metrics at the moment: EV/Revenue. Before engaging in this exercise, I should repeat to my readers the fact that I consider free cash flow to be the basis of all shareholder returns. Free cash flow pays for dividends and/or expanded book values. Revenue that grows for five years, while the company continues to throw up losses, is less relevant in my estimation. That said, it’s never a good idea to argue too vociferously with the crowd, so I’ll look at EV/Revenue. In so doing, though, I’ll also look at the same measure for a few other companies. The reason for this is that investing is an innately relativistic game and one stock is just as accessible as another.Source: GurufocusI hope the point of this table is made. Splunk trades at a very rich valuation relative to some of its peers. Additionally, I would caution investors against the anchoring bias inherent in peer comparison. It may be the case that a particular company may be a less expensive stock than its peers, but the entire peer group may still be morbidly overpriced.I think the sales growth over the past five years here is impressive, and it’s that that investors are rewarding that sales growth with impressive valuations. I have some questions, though: how long is it going to take this company to turn a profit? What will be different about the next five years? Or the next ten? The technology is certainly interesting, and there’ll be a greater demand for it in future, given that data is becoming more complex. The problem is that this growth will attract competition, as abnormal profits always do. Also, interesting technology will not be proof against an iron law of investing in my view. That law is that the more you pay for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be your long term return. Period. Investors who pay up for shares at these levels are betting on a very optimistic future in my view. The problem is that the history of losses here suggests little reason to be optimistic. I think investors should avoid the name until we have some evidence of earnings."

Splunk (SPLK) has seen the stock rally off the recent market induced lows due to impressive growth. Most people didn't like my previous call that stock prices above $125 wouldn't last, but the data analytics stock makes a lot more sense down here closer to $100.Image Source: Splunk websiteWhat got the stock to finally head higher off the flatline action from 2014 through 2017 was revenue returning to accelerated growth. In the last quarter, Splunk generated a reported 40% growth rate with software revenue surging 49%.The actual reported revenues were 46% above the amount originally reported last FQ3. The adjustment for ASC 606 led to the higher growth rates used in the chart above.The real hiccup to the story is that Splunk only guided to FY20 (Jan. 31) revenue growth of ~24%. The company gave the following guidance for revenues of $1.74 billion this FY and $2.15 billion next year.Source: Splunk FQ3'19 earnings releaseSplunk constantly smashes estimates so one might project that FY20 ends up with 30% growth or closer to revenues of $2.26 billion. Heck, don't even cross off the possibility of 35% growth for revenues of $2.35 billion.The issue is that the data analytics company needs substantial quarterly beats to even approach the recent growth rate for the current year. The signs suggest Splunk has again reached peak growth rates. The stock didn't trade very well during the last slowing period. The investment story ultimately comes down to how much one wants to pay for a $2 billion-plus revenue stream next FY. The stock is currently worth about $15.5 billion and a 30% return pushes the valuation up to more than $20.1 billion.Splunk is clearly not a major bargain trading at about 7x forward revenue estimates. For a shareholder to reach sizable stock gains in the next year, the stock has hit some very stretched valuations.The story gets interesting down at $100 due to Splunk generating about $52 million in free cash flow in the last quarter while FQ4 margins are set to soar. Splunk is the prime example of how small-cap techs can quickly turn on the leverage spigot. The company forecast FQ4 operating margins in the 25%-plus range.The full-year operating margins are down at 12%, but substantially above the levels of last year. Splunk headed into FQ4 last year with quarterly margin targets of only 8% to 9% and yearly totals down at 5% to 6%. The amount is due to surge as revenue growth rates hold above 20% and closer to 30%.In essence, the P/S ratio isn't too enticing, but a stock with strong margins and cash flows are better able to handle any market downturn or economic weakness.One of the biggest issues remains the surging share counts. The FQ4 forecast of 155 million shares outstanding places the valuation above $16.1 billion with the stock at $105. Surging share counts will make for a bigger headwind when revenue growth dips back below 30%.The key investor takeaway is that Splunk is correctly positioned to utilize increasingly large amounts of data to monitor networks and apps while protecting the integrity of corporate systems via data analytics and machine learning. The stock is more appealing down closer to $100 though not really offering a massive bargain as revenue growth heads into a period of deceleration.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

It's monetizing this through moving to SaaS, which is nearing completion, and moving to the cloud at least in part. It's still landing new customers, but given the generic nature of their capability, management is constantly widening the use cases and even opening up whole new fields of applicability. This should keep the company growing for a long time to come, even if that growth might slow down quite a bit from today's 40%+ levels.

Here is management's answer to that concern (Q3CC):That machine learning is driving improvements in the analytical capabilities of its capabilities should come as little surprise.The room for land and expand seems particularly large for Splunk simply because there is so much one can do with the data that business generate, one can consider Splunk's machine data capability to be a generic capability, having a bewildering amount of applicable fields and use cases.Most of their use cases still revolve around security and IT uses cases, but even here the room for expansion is still enormous, according to management (Q3CC):The bells and whistles that the platform is adding is such that we can't describe, not even mention each and every one of these. But there are several important broad new categories that are worth mentioning:Lowering the bar, which involves improvements like making data onboarding even easier, natural language processing (even including queries through Alexa) makes it easier still for clients to get the most insights out of their data. DevOps solutions has been given a boost by the acquisition of VictorOps in the summer, among other things (Q3CC):The company released Splunk for Industrial IoT, and they seem to have landed significant customers already with BMW. With Business Flow the company seems to be entering a new field in providing business insights for marketing, operations and manufacturing from data from business processes to produce insights.Splunk Next is still in beta, but it's a suite that contains (Q3CC):It will probably take years for these new fields to develop into serious revenue generators, but we give this considerable credibility as their main competitive advantage seems to be generic, the simple way they allow customers to turn unstructured data into business insights. That seems to be a capability with a wide range of applicability so we are quite optimistic here.The company also has an ecosystem for third party solutions and different use cases; the bigger this gets, the more sticky their platform will become.We didn't find any dollar net retention rate but this is complicated by the shift from perpetual licenses to SaaS, but here is nevertheless an indication of the effectiveness of the company's land and expand strategy, from the Investor Day Presentation:From the 10-Q:Some notable data points:The company started off generating sales as perpetual licenses, mostly on-premise. But like many other companies, it has embarked on two shifts:The ambition was to generate 75% of their revenues from SaaS contracts by next year and they have already exceeded this, but the picture is somewhat muddied by:Together these shifts produced a tailwind of about $40M for the first nine months of the year. But the shift to the cloud provides a headwind of about $43M, so basically the mix shift is cancelling each other out (Q3CC):Q4:FY2019:FY2020:SPLK Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsYou see the substantial operational leverage even if GAAP operating margin is still negative. It's non-GAAP counterpart is already significantly positive at 13.6% in Q3, with most of the difference coming from (very substantial) share based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85%. This is what the company aims at, from the Investor Day presentation:But given that share based compensation is 25% of revenues, GAAP operational margin will still be quite negative even in 2020.SPLK Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts2019 is supposed to be a through year for cash flow because the shift to ratable, which is on a yearly basis, bringing in less up-front cash compared to perpetual licenses. Despite that, the development of cash flow seems great to us, and Q4, the biggest quarter for cash flow is yet to come. This is likely to improve further going forward although free cash flow might take a bit of a hit from the CapEx in their new headquarters. Indeed, here is their target from the Investor Day earlier this year:They are doing considerably better already, although greatly helped by stock based compensation:SPLK Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YCharts$400M in share based compensation on $1.6B of revenue that's 25% of revenue which is really rather excessive. No wonder the company's share count keeps on increasing at a considerable rate.The company has also issued $1.8B of convertible debt in the quarter, bringing its cash and short-term investments to $2.8B at the end of the quarter.SPLK EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsValuation is not terribly excessive in the sense that we've seen worse, but the uncomfortable truth in this market is that investors are much less assured of what kind of valuation the market tolerates these days, which makes investing quite complicated.The shares are off from the highs, but we've seen much worse.We think that Splunk, in a way, is similar to Alteryx (AYX) as it has a similarly dizzying number of growth opportunities ahead of it. With Splunk, this derives from their generic capability of the simplicity of handling machine data. We further like the fact that there is strong operational leverage and cash flow generation, and valuation is not overly excessive.There are a number of caveats though:When a modicum of market stability returns we still consider this a pretty good bet."
4202006,22148,2018-08-24T19:48:24-04:00,"Splunk reported fantastic revenue growth in FQ2, but the real story is the soaring operation expenses.Out of control stock-based compensation has sent diluted share counts soaring since the company went public.The forecasted EPS estimates don't match a stock price trading at $125.","Splunk (SPLK) reported another fantastic quarter with accelerated revenue growth as software revenues surged 43%. The stock, though, is disconnected with the actual results as Splunk is trading at $125 in initial trading, and the tech company made a meager $0.08 in the quarter. The hidden costs of massive stock-based compensation (SBC) are really hurting the reason for being excited about the stock here, making me stick with my previous bearish call on the stock at these levels.Image Source: Phantom websiteSplunk has the business description that attracts investor attention whether or not the company even produces solid results. The company lists itself as the machine data analytics and artificial intelligence firm that is now combined with the recently acquired incident management business from VictorOps. The company can in theory quickly resolve and help prevent issues that cause problems with customer engagement. For this reason, the market can get carried away with valuations.The story is backed up with actual results. Gartner places Splunk in the magic quadrant for the security information category, and the company is generating stable to accelerating revenue growth.In the recent quarter, Splunk generated sales growth that re-accelerated to 39%. The company had several quarters where growth dipped to around 30%.SPLK Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsSplunk didn't detail the revenue impact from recent acquisitions like Phantom and VictorOps that might have boosted revenues. These acquisitions likely impacted some of the expense issues to a greater degree.Splunk might generate some large top line growth, but these gains constantly come at a large cost to shareholders. In the last quarter, the operating loss surged from $77.2 million to $103.9 million.When each additional dollar of revenues costs in excess of dollar to generate, the additional revenue is coming at a cost to shareholders. The issue with Splunk is a very large stock compensation spigot.In FQ2, the company took an incredible $108.4 million charge for SBC. Revenues were only $388.3 million in the quarter, making the charge equivalent to nearly 28% of revenues.Since going public, the share count has now surged from below 100 million to now over 151 million shares outstanding. The below chart shows the GAAP count for FQ1 that excludes the 6.4 million shares outstanding for employee stock options that don't count in the listed GAAP numbers due to the reported losses.SPLK data by YChartsIn FQ2, Splunk reported net income of $11.4 million when stripping out the $108 million SBC charge. The end result was an $0.08 EPS. Imagine, though, if the share count was only 110 million from more normalized stock issuance since going public back in 2012. The EPS would be up at $0.10 per share.Taking the FY20 EPS estimates of $1.53 and only 110 million shares, the estimate would be up at $2.10. The amazing part is that Splunk is still incredibly expensive even if the company didn't need out of control stock issuance to build the business.SPLK EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Splunk is generating fantastic growth in the business. The problem for shareholders is that value is based on building the business without having to invest so heavily in operations.So far, Splunk hasn't found the magic equation to profits and massive cash flows despite a market valuation of nearly $19 billion now. One shouldn't expect his rally to last much longer.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4201779,103480,2018-08-24T06:11:48-04:00,"Splunk, the machine data company, reported excellent Q2 results that smashed Wall Street expectations.Revenues accelerated two points from the year-ago quarter, and Splunk also raised its guidance for the full year.Free cash flows and operating margins also saw decent improvement in the quarter, but are still mildly disappointing for a company that has reached Splunk's ~$1.5 billion revenue scale.At nearly 10x forward revenues, Splunk remains an expensive stock, and further upside is likely capped by its valuation.","In an incredibly sharp reversal from last quarter's turn of events, machine data company Splunk (SPLK) jumped nearly 10% after posting Q2 results. Splunk has been trading sideways since last quarter. It's difficult to understand why: Splunk had beaten top- and bottom-line estimates in Q1 as well, and even bumped up its guidance for FY19. The only plausible reason is that investors couldn't stomach Splunk's high valuation.This quarter, in my view, the story remains very much the same. Splunk's Q2 results were just as good as the Q1 results, although the bump to guidance (a $40 million increase in the range to $1.685 billion or +33% y/y, double the $20 million boost Splunk indicated in last quarter's guidance update) was notably steeper. The strong earnings reaction might be standing on shaky ground, because Splunk's valuation is still fairly high.SPLK data by YChartsThere's no doubt that Splunk is a fantastic company. One of the elements of Splunk that I like best is the fact that the company owns one of the most unique products in the software space. This isn't just another SaaS company that's peddling another CRM or HCM app, which are products that just about every large-cap software company owns. Splunk's machine data intelligence platform has a wide variety of use cases - from security to business analytics - and Splunk is essentially the only company providing this service at scale.But in my view, Splunk's valuation and recent stock price performance have already priced in years of outperformance. The stock has risen 43% year-to-date, beating many of its peers (especially in a year where many high-flying stocks have been beaten down and brought back to earth), and over the past 12 months, shares have nearly doubled. At some point, investors are going to wonder when enough is enough.A quick valuation check - at Splunk's current post-Q2 share price just above $118, the company carries a market cap of $17.1 billion. If we net out the company's balance sheet cash of $901 million, that leaves us with an enterprise value of $16.2 billion. This represents a valuation of 9.6x EV/FY19 revenues - a very steep multiple for a company with a more or less ""average"" (at least relative to other high-growth SaaS companies) revenue growth rate.Bear in mind that this multiple is about half a turn more expensive than where Splunk was trading last quarter. And, before the company raced on its massive rally over the past year, shares had largely traded in a range-bound fashion between 6x and 7x forward revenues. At the time, investors had valued Splunk's revenue stream as less valuable than other SaaS companies because a good majority of its revenues came from perpetual license deals. Splunk has done a good job at converting more of its business into recurring subscription streams, but is it worth the ~40-50% explosion in its revenue valuation?My ultimate verdict on Splunk: great company and a unique product, but the valuation and investment timing just aren't quite right. I retain my view from the prior quarter: Splunk is at best a hold, and shares are likely to hover around $100 (representing a fair valuation of 8x forward revenues) for some time.That being said, we have to acknowledge the fact that Splunk's Q2 results are a cause for cheer. Here's a look at the quarter:Figure 1. Splunk Q2 earningsSource: Splunk investor relationsRevenues grew 39% y/y to $388.3 million, far surpassing analysts' expectations of $358.5 million (+28% y/y) by a staggering eleven points. Perhaps Wall Street's forecast was too conservative - Splunk's previous full-year guidance range, after all, called for revenue growth in the ~30% range. Still, it's also worth noting that Splunk's revenues actually accelerated by two points of growth this quarter (Q1 revenue growth had clocked in at 37% y/y), instead of decelerating as Wall Street had expected.Top-line results aside, Splunk also posted great customer wins in the quarter. Net new client additions tallied up to 550 in the quarter, including some big names like the U.S. Department of Defense. Note that not very many enterprise software companies have the certification or even sales capacity to pursue large public sector contracts, and those that have won large federal deals like Salesforce.com (CRM) have been awarded with multimillion-dollar annual recurring deals. And in addition to winning the U.S. DoD, Splunk also managed to sign the United Kingdom Department of Defense as well, indicating huge success in the company's push into the public sector.A win like the two Departments of Defense - as well as some other notable new additions like Dartmouth College and Worldpay (WP) - is another reason to be bullish in Splunk's long-term future. These organizations will have a difficult time ripping Splunk out of their IT stack, so these deals will be immensely accretive to the top line for a long time.Bottom-line results also showed promise, in parallel with strength on the top line. Splunk's gross margins, however, showed a slight decay to 78.4% of revenues, down 20bps from 78.6% in 2Q18 - partially as a function of a poorer revenue mix, with lower-margin maintenance revenues growing faster than license revenues.On the operating margin side, Splunk showed a bit better of a story. Partially as a result of sales and marketing costs scaling down to ""only"" 62.7% of revenues, 390bps better than 66.6% of revenues in 2Q18, Splunk improved its GAAP operating margins to -26.7% this quarter, up 90bps from -27.6% in 2Q18.We note, however, that for a company of Splunk's scale, its operating losses still leave a lot to be desired. The biggest culprit is stock comp - Splunk has always lavishly awarded stock comp to its employees as a large fixture in its cost base, and though these aren't cash costs, dilution does become a real cost to investors. By the time software companies reach a >$1.5 billion revenue run rate, their operating margins are typically positive - a close example would be Red Hat (RHT), another backend-focused software company. Splunk's operating margins near -30%, however, are more in line with losses at high-growth SaaS startups.And especially for a company with Splunk's near double-digit revenue valuation, we'd expect a boost on the profitability front alongside top-line strength. Pro forma EPS of $0.08 beat Wall Street expectations of $0.05, and free cash flow grew 38% y/y to $28.0 million, but still we should be expecting more from a company of this scale and with this reputation.Figure 2. Splunk FCFSource: Splunk investor relationsWhile Splunk's Q2 results are encouraging, it's not a reason to rush to buy the stock. Shares have already rebounded sharply from last quarter's losses, and are up further still in the past 12 months, extending the company's valuation to a dangerous breaking point. In my view, Splunk will need to show more improvement on the bottom line and on free cash flows before it can achieve its next major leg higher - and this quarter, it seemed like the two points of revenue acceleration came at a heavy sales cost. While Splunk has gradually been achieving greater sales leverage, a company at a >$1.5 billion run rate that is still spending more than 60% of its revenues on sales and marketing might not be operating at full potential.While I remain positive on the company's long-term prospects, I'm more inclined to stay on the sidelines until shares discover a better price."

This is a really good way to make money in the markets and doesn’t require spending many calories on quarterly earnings or point in time valuation metrics. If you invest with tailwinds, your financial analysis can be less precise because you will have more margin for error.For example, let’s think about Amazon (AMZN) in 2012. By all traditional metrics, the company was overvalued. But if you simply asked yourself where e-com penetration was, where it was heading, and if Amazon was suited to capitalize, you could have nailed the investment.I am not necessarily labeling Splunk (SPLK) as the next Amazon, but there are some corollaries. Splunk has attached itself to a key megatrend in a market with a large total addressable market (“TAM”). Splunk is positioned as a key player with competitive advantages in its niche. Splunk has a scalable platform with a financial model that can compound profitability.Big data is a top megatrend. Data is being generated from all sorts of public and private sources like a weed on steroids. Much of the data generated is adequately captured and stored, but much of it is leaking into the abyss. Of the data that is being captured, it is hard to make much sense of it because of the volume that has poured in. I recently learned an interesting term to describe this tidal wave of data: infobesity. We live in an infobese world.To put some numbers around the state of infobesity today, data is growing at a 33% annual rate. Assuming rule of 72, the total amount of data collected will double in 2 years. Data production will be 44 times greater in 2020 than it was in 2009. This is being driven by global population growth, technology adoption, growth in devices per person, and the use of sensors in every day appliances and machines (also known as internet of things, yet another megatrend). (Source: Splunk 2018 analyst day)This data is useless to decision makers if it is not being organized and analyzed. There in lies the opportunity for Splunk. Splunk’s mission statement is to “make machine data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone in an organization.” The company serves its customers by providing software that captures, organizes, and summarizes any kind of data regardless of data type, origin, structured, or unstructured.The key differentiating feature of Splunk is that it is plug and play and comprehensive with any data set and can quickly generate useful summaries in real time. In fact, the company has patented its data processing architecture that parses data to protect its intellectual property.Splunk has extended the use case of its core data processing engine to many applications, depending on a customer’s needs. For example, Splunk has software that can monitor devices in real time and has other software that is focused on analyzing historical data. The driving point here is that Splunk has a powerful platform that is flexible to pretty much anyone that needs to deal with big data (which is every large company). Splunk counts 89 of the Fortune 100 as customers (source: Splunk website).Splunk has partnered with most major enterprise software vendors to provide in-app functions that “talk” to different software applications. These partnerships include Amazon AWS, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and Box (NYSE:BOX), to name a few. Splunk doesn’t compete directly with these vendors but works to enhance their usefulness for the end customer.Splunk is currently transforming its revenue from a volume pricing structure to a subscription pricing structure, which is helping to drive growth. Currently, most customers pay an upfront licensing fee to use Splunk and are then charged a negotiated rate on the volume of data they process. While this is a low-risk way for companies to test Splunk’s platform, it disincentivizes companies from fully embracing Splunk because if they process all their data through the software, the bills would rack up. The disincentive has led to some customers off-loading some of their analysis to Splunk competitors, particularly the data that is already structured.Splunk has started to promote an “all you can eat” subscription version of their software. Many large companies have jumped at this because it is easier for them to budget Splunk’s costs to them. Splunk has priced the subscription product by estimating data volume needs for each company. The subscriptions expire and are re-negotiated after several years. This new pricing structure is also good for Splunk because it helps Splunk lock in a set amount of business and ensures a predictable stream of revenue. The below table illustrates the transition in pricing structures expected over the next few years.(Source: 2018 Splunk Analyst Day Presentation)The other transition at the company is the shift towards cloud-based products. Today, less than 10% of Splunk’s revenues are on the cloud, but that will shift higher over time. Because installation costs and support costs are lower for cloud, gross margins are higher and should help the company expand its operating margins over time. Splunk is currently at negative operating margin, but strong revenue growth will help them become profitable by fiscal 2020 (author's estimate) as they leverage fixed costs. The following two tables walk through the transition to cloud and the path to profitability.(Source: 2018 Splunk Analyst Day Presentation)(Source: 2018 Splunk Analyst Day Presentation)Splunk is very distinctively a growth stock. It is growing at a very healthy double-digit clip and is unprofitable as it prioritizes future growth over current earnings. However, due to some favorable add-backs and positive working capital adjustments, the company is cash flow positive which enables the company to plow forward without reliance on the capital markets. In fact, the company has a very healthy balance sheet with net cash of $878 million.Gross margins have dipped in recent years as the company has been developing its cloud-based products. Both gross margin and operating margin are expected to increase over the next few years. The company is expected to be profitable on an operating earnings basis by 2020, based on its current growth and fixed cost profile.Splunk is notoriously difficult to value because it isn’t profitable. The company currently trades for 8.3x Enterprise Value to 2018E revenue, which places it amongst the most expensive stocks in the world. However, comparing Splunk to rapidly growing enterprise software peers doesn’t make Splunk seem too out of place. On average, Splunk’s peers are unprofitable and trade for 8.9x EV/Forward Revenue. Splunk is growing faster and is slightly cheaper. This analysis provides a good sanity check on Splunk. See the comparison table below.However, using relative peer analysis isn’t the best way to make an investment decision because it is quite possible that the entire sector is overvalued and it probably is if you are thinking about the world in a short-term time horizon. If you are a big picture thinker and are patient, Splunk could be worth many times over its current valuation at some point in the future. All you need to do is think about the megatrends at hand and how well-positioned the company is to capture value. Like Amazon in 2012 (and perhaps even Amazon today), Splunk is capturing a very small fraction of its total addressable market. What’s more is that the TAM is growing at double-digit pace. Even if Splunk captures the same share of its TAM 10 years into the future as it is today, it would have significantly grown its earnings and cash flow.Bottom line: think big and think long term; Splunk is a long-term winner in a massive market."
4226903,103480,2018-12-06T21:32:01-05:00,"Shares of Splunk have rallied after reporting another big beat in Q3, with revenue growth actually accelerating above 40% y/y.Perhaps most importantly, Splunk also lifted its full-year FY20 revenue forecast to ""approximately $2.15 billion"", a 7.5% bump from a prior view of $2.0 billion.Operating margins worsened slightly, however, as Splunk continued to splurge on sales and marketing costs.Despite ratcheting back to a high valuation, Splunk's bullish outlook for the coming year will likely provide an important catalyst for Splunk to continue rallying.","After falling sharply alongside other growth stocks in October and November, and briefly dipping into bear market territory, machine learning company Splunk (SPLK) has buoyed sharply upward on the back of its third-quarter earnings release.Splunk already had a big quarter in Q2, showing accelerating revenue growth and a greater than 10-percentage point beat to Wall Street's top-line estimates. Many investors, myself included, thought Q2's print may have been a fluke - perhaps Splunk pulled in a deal here or there (after all, as a company that relies primarily on big license deals, its revenue pattern is slightly more lumpy than SaaS companies). At the time, I had argued that Splunk's valuation had reached chart-topping levels, and that it was overdue for a correction.That correction happened across the board for software stocks, and now, Splunk is racing back to its all-time highs:SPLK data by YChartsQ2's earnings strength turned out not to be a fluke, however, as Splunk showed accelerating growth yet again and produced a similarly large beat to consensus estimates. As such, my view on Splunk has shifted: the October/November volatility has already tested Splunk's resilience, and it appears that the stock is prepared for a fresh rally. The most important catalyst here is a lift in next year's guidance, which we'll discuss shortly. Buy Splunk on the rebound - this is a stock that has clearly differentiated IP, and one that can be applied across a plethora of use cases. Many of Splunk's current use cases involve security, but the opportunity in business analytics and intelligence is similarly large. Rare is the company at a ~$2 billion revenue that is still able to grow the top line at 40% y/y, and there is still a long runway for growth ahead that investors can benefit tremendously from. As Splunk barrels toward the end of its fiscal 2019, the company has already boosted its guidance for fiscal 2020, one quarter earlier than most companies give guidance for the following year (most companies offer forward-year guidance in Q4).Splunk's latest forecast for FY20 revenue is ""approximately $2.15 billion"":Figure 1. Splunk guidanceSource: Splunk earnings releaseThis represents a 7.5% lift relative to the company's prior guidance view of $2.0 million. Note that Splunk's growth rate is incredible compared to other companies of its scale. Take Workday (WDAY), for example - one of the closest software companies to Splunk in scale. Workday is slightly larger than Splunk - it's at a ~$2.7 billion revenue scale - but its growth has fallen to the ~30% range. Splunk's ability to continue growing at a breakneck pace is yet another indication of the massive market opportunity ahead of it, applying its machine learning technology across a broad scope of possibilities.Splunk's guidance lift also has the effect of making its revenue-based valuation more reasonable. At its current price of ~$108, Splunk carries a market cap of $15.6 billion. If we net out $2.79 billion of cash and $1.61 billion of convertible debt on its balance sheet, the company has an enterprise value of $14.4 billion. Against Splunk's FY20 revenue forecast of ""approximately $2.15 billion,"" this represents a valuation multiple of 6.7x EV/FY20 revenues - which isn't exactly a bargain-basement valuation, but certainly isn't expensive for a 40% grower either. Another quick observation on Splunk's progress: one of the marks of a truly dominant software company is when it begins to strike major wins in the public sector, particularly with the federal government. These types of deals are not only large sources of recurring billings, but also a stamp of legitimacy on the value of the underlying technology. Last quarter, Splunk brought home two so-called ""whales"" in closing two separate deals with the U.S. and UK Departments of Defense.While this quarter's major wins are slightly lower in profile, we note that Splunk closed the Chicago Public Schools System (the fourth-largest public school system in the U.S., with enrollment of just shy of half a million students) this quarter, as well as the city of Austin, Texas and the Australian Department of Home Affairs.The variety of these wins across multiple levels of government shows how versatile Splunk's platform can be. Public sector wins can often produce a domino effect: one department or municipality adopting a certain technology can induce many others to follow suit.Here's a look at Splunk's most recent quarterly results:Figure 2. Splunk 3Q19 resultsSource: Splunk earnings releaseTotal revenues grew 40% y/y to $481.0 million, accelerating one point over last quarter's 39% y/y growth (which, in turn, accelerated two points from 37% y/y growth in Q1) and smashing Wall Street's expectations of $433.4 million (+26% y/y) by a huge fourteen-point margin. Note that this is an even bigger beat than last quarter's ten-point beat. For a company of this scale to produce such a large earnings surprise is truly incredible. Note also that cloud-based revenues (at $45 million, still a small contributor to overall revenues) grew 87% y/y. Splunk's outgoing CFO, David Conte, also noted that Splunk remains committed to transforming its revenue base from perpetual license to recurring and subscription-based revenues. Per his remarks on the Q3 earnings call (key points highlighted):Splunk's ongoing conversion into recurring and subscription revenues are likely to drive richer valuation multiples for its stock. Companies that have undergone similar transitions, like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), have also seen their stocks soar. Splunk's cloud-only ARR hit $200 million as of the end of this quarter, more than double the ARR in 3Q18.The other major observation to note regarding this cloud shift is that it presents a headwind to revenue growth. Conte noted that so far in FY19, the company's shift to cloud has occurred faster than expected, and estimated that shift produced a $43 million headwind to revenue growth. In spite of this huge headwind, Splunk has still been able to generate 40% revenue growth. On the profit side, Splunk saw a small contraction in operating margins to 13.6% on a pro forma basis, down 190bps relative to 15.5% in 3Q18. Sales and marketing expenses continue to remain high, rising 33% y/y to $263.2 million as Splunk continues to chase growth (as a percentage of revenues, however, sales and marketing costs pared down slightly). Despite the small margin shrinkage, pro forma operating income still rose to $65.4 million, up 23% y/y. Splunk's pro forma EPS of $0.38 also beat Wall Street's estimates of $0.31 with 23% upside.In addition, Splunk managed to continue growing its operating cash flows, up 45% y/y in the quarter to $33.5 million. Year-to-date, the company has grown OCF by a startling 67% y/y.Figure 3. Splunk operating cash flowSource: Splunk earnings releaseSplunk has just given investors a fresh bullish catalyst to lift the stock in 2019. Despite its already-bullish outlook for FY20, Splunk has a deep-seated track record for consistently surpassing its own guidance ranges. Continued strength in cloud and an aggressive conversion to subscription revenues also provide clear upside catalysts for Splunk in 2019.The biggest risk to the bullish thesis for Splunk, of course, is if its trend of outperformance suddenly slows down. Investors have more or less gotten accustomed to Splunk's big earnings beats. The slightest whiff of revenue deceleration - especially amid volatile markets, where investors are looking for any and every reason to dump growth names - could spur a sharp selloff. This is not unprecedented this year: growth SaaS names like Cloudera (CLDR), Instructure (INST), and Talend (TLND) have all suffered massive declines on deceleration fears and haven't recovered since. That being said, against Splunk's freshly lifted guidance forecast and tremendous performance over the past two quarters, its valuation at just over 7x 2019 revenues seems reasonable, with the risk/reward profile heavily tilted in favor of bulls. Stay long on this name."
4185566,98236,2018-07-05T13:00:49-04:00,"Splunk shares were recently downgraded by Citi and have seen a noticeable negative share price reaction since that time.I feel the analyst at Citi missed key points in his analysis and has reached very wrong conclusions.Splunk remains the category leader in a variety of IT operation market segments.Its platform approach has proven to be very successful and has had noticeably positive impacts on the company's enterprise adoption and ASPs.Despite the current First Call consensus, I do not see substantial compression of this company's admirable growth rate - and the company is not forecasting that for the balance of the current fiscal year.","Spelunking is the hobby of exploring wild caves in search of adventure. Not something for this writer - unless Aman or Capella choose to develop a cave complex in some exotic destination. Splunk (SPLK), the company, on the other hand, is involved in exploring data sets professionally, trying to find anomalies and connections to improve the security, efficiency and capacity of computing (The name of the business was apparently developed from the name of the hoppy). I have been quite comfortable in checking into its shares on several occasions and may well do so again, depending on market conditions.Splunk, the company, has been enormously successful in the 15 years since its foundation. I think it would be fair to say that Splunk essentially created the category known as SIEM - Security Information and Event Management - and it has gone on to create additional categories building on SIEM that provide analytic capabilities as well as search and visualizations. One of the more significant categories beyond security in which Splunk is a leader is IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) which, with the advent of AI has developed a substantial number of new use cases that are providing the company with renewed growth opportunities. Another category is called ITOM, or IT Operations Management. These categories tend to overlap and can be used as part of a holistic solution to enhance the performance of a typical IT installation. About half of Splunk's business is related to security use cases, and the balance comes from various kinds of uses related to analytics and various forms of solutions to improve the efficiency of IT Ops. As might be reasonably anticipated, AI is becoming a substantial component of what Splunk and its competitors offer as it is being used to develop paradigms that can lead to more efficient configurations and to attack growing complexity. The company is just now entering the IoT space and has begun to offer a solution that it calls Industrial Asset Intelligence.A few weeks ago, the Citi senior software analyst, Walter Pritchard, downgraded his rating on the shares of Splunk from hold to sell. Mr. Pritchard has had 20 years of experience as a sell-side software analyst and he has been at Citi for 9 years. Overall, he has a reasonable track record in terms of his picks, but his specific record with regards to analyzing Splunk hasn't been exemplary. In fact, he has been fairly consistently rated the shares as neutral or negative. He claims that there are ""warning signs in some numbers,"" the company faces increasing competition, and that it faces adoption challenges caused by a ""persistently unconventional"" pricing model.Splunk has had its detractors for years during which it has consistently confounded skeptics. I think that this will be a similar case, although since the downgrade, the shares have been under substantial pressure and have depreciated by about 18% compared to a pullback of less than 5% for the IGV. One thing on which I agree with Mr. Pritchard - Splunk is not a full-fledged SaaS vendor; its customers still operate data centers. Cloud revenues specifically were $34 million last quarter, up by 89% year on year and are now 12.5% of total revenues - achieving that performance quite a bit faster than the company had forecast. Splunk is forecasting that its cloud revenues will grow to $160 million this year, with cloud bookings rising to $270 million. Cloud, for Splunk, is proving to be another growth driver, and it is not impinging on the rest of the company's offering - why that seems to be in dispute is something hard to understand.Over the years, this company has made a transition from traditional on-premise perpetual license revenues to term license revenues. That has depressed growth slightly, but at this point, the goal for term license revenues is 65% in the current fiscal year, up from 50% in the prior year. It is really no secret that most users these days prefer term licenses, and it is no secret either that for most companies, and that includes this one, that term licenses provide vendors with more visibility and higher levels of total revenue than prior consumption models. Term license duration has run between 27 and 28 months for Splunk, more or less since the option became a significant component of consumption, and that remains the case.And I will also agree with the Citi analyst that Splunk has historically and continues to offer a variety of consumption options based on data capacity and ingestion/data usage, which is different than the pricing offered by many other vendors in the software space. That has been true since day 1 for this company and it is one of the reasons for its success. Where I part company with the Citi analyst is his opinion that both of these components of Splunk's business are issues in terms of either valuation or competitiveness. The company now does offer more packaged offerings that eliminate some of the issues that users have confronted from capacity or ""ingestion"" pricing.Splunk adopted ASC 606 last quarter and some of the warning signs Mr. Pritchard maintains he sees come from the comparison he has chosen to make of apples and some other kind of unpalatable fruit. Splunk adjusted its balance sheet and prior year's income statement for ASC 606, and it bought a company called Phantom. Without going through the details, a company of this size will characteristically have metrics that are seasonal in nature because of annual billings, and these seasonally influenced metrics affect balance sheet items including deferred revenue balances. And that was pretty much what was seen in Q1 - rather than some sinister metric that showed an unusual track or was a potential warning sign.The biggest problem seen by Mr. Pritchard relates to bookings growth, which was substantially lower in Q1 than revenue growth. The CFO talked about the need to retire billings as a useable metric for parsing company performance in this current conference call. ASC 606 uses a different disclosure for deferred revenue than was heretofore standard, and this is a problem for the analyst, and not the company's operational performance. Over time, all companies are going to have to replace deferred revenue reporting with what is called ""Remaining Performance Obligations."" It really is a change in optics and has nothing to do with how well Splunk did in selling its solutions last quarter. While it may be tedious to do so, it behooves investors to pay attention to the specifics of what the CFO had to say on that subject, specifically, rather than attempting to make up some scenario that belies the company's operating performance.Splunk is neither a remarkably cheap nor an undiscovered name, although compared to some other hyper-growth names, one could readily make the case that it is actually less expensive, at least on a relative basis, than its peers, and it is certainly less expensive than historical valuations. Of course that assertion is based on my expectations that growth compression will be far less than is currently forecast in the First Call consensus.Based on the company's latest guidance, the EV/S ratio for the next 12 months has dropped to around 7.3X. The company is non-GAAP profitable, and using its current forecast of 11.5% for non GAAP operating margins, EPS for the next 12 months should be around $1.50, depending on the income tax rate accrual the company might make. The company generated lots of cash last quarter, some of it because of stock-based comp, and even more of it because of the rapid collection of Q4 bookings. Management forecast that operating cash flow would be around $300 million, with free cash flow reaching $275 million. The company's Q1 performance is running far ahead of that pace. Based on normal seasonality, overall, operating cash flow should readily exceed $375 million over the coming 12 months, and the free cash flow yield might be expected to reach almost 3%. Management spoke to the potential to review its own forecast with a thought toward revising it upward. Neither the P/E ratio of about 65X nor the free cash flow yield of almost 3% is an untoward bargain. On the other hand, these metrics represent a significantly more attractive set of valuation markers than the shares have had for some time now.Facts can be inconvenient things. For the record, not only has Splunk seen reaccelerating growth, but it also has raised its guidance as well. And this is the second quarter in a row in which accelerating growth has been achieved. Growth in the last two quarters has been well above growth that the company reported earlier in 2017. And this growth acceleration has been achieved despite the company's pivot away from providing implementation and education services for its users. Software revenue growth is now above 40%, which is quite remarkable for a company of this size, especially when it has been achieved in the face of new consumption models that offer more ratable consumption choices for customers. Some of the company's attainment, to be sure, was against a comparison in the year earlier quarter that was, to use the term offered by the CFO, ""inconsistent."" But of course inconsistent means different things to different organizations, and Splunk did manage to grow by 30% in last year's Q1, and it did raise guidance at that point. It is important for investors and analysts to take a look at comparisons that are based on revised reporting standards which show the extent of the growth reacceleration as well as depicting some leverage at scale. As it happens, the new ASC 606 standard deferred about 6.6% of the revenue that had been reported in Q1 last year to subsequent periods.The reasons for this growth acceleration are not terribly surprising or really that much of an arcane mystery and as it happens I wrote about this subject before the last quarterly earnings release. The differences for me are that growth is better than had been projected and the share price is lower. Sad but true. I do not want to recapitulate now, all that I wrote then. But I will hit some salient points.This company has an absolutely unbreakable grip in certain areas of IT Operations that are a function of its many years of developing the space. The CEO calls it deep domain expertise, and after all these years, it is hard to dispute the matter. Gartner's MQ has a section in vendor evaluation it calls ""Cautions."" The cautions it has regarding Splunk are so minimal as to be risible. I suppose the most substantive, and yet the least important, is that Splunk doesn't sell hardware appliances - it remains a software company. It is true, as has been the case for years, that some users do not like paying for the volume of data they analyze - not so much because of the level of payments, but because the payments are not level with irregular billing. But as Gartner mentions, Splunk is now offering other kinds of consumption plans that meet those objections.Splunk's largest competitor in SIEM anyway is IBM (NYSE:IBM), and I doubt that Splunk's management spends many sleepless nights worrying about price competition from that vendor. In the ""Strengths"" section, the most telling ones mentioned by Gartner are that"" Splunk has significant visibility with Gartner clients, consistently appearing on buyers' shortlists"" and that ""Splunk provides a full suite of solutions oriented toward SEM that allow users to grow into the platform over time."" There are lots of vendors in the SIEM space - and that has been the case for many years now - and Splunk has made the investments and managed its processes such that it has remained at the top of the Gartner leader quadrant for many years at this point.Another part of the Splunk growth story relates to the explosion of AI and its use in IT Ops. Gartner calls what Splunk does AIOps and the category is apparently very cool and achieving very rapid growth. I have linked here to an article about the subject actually written by a Splunk competitor. It is worth understanding the opportunities inherent in AIOps if one wants to understand part of the reason as to why Splunk's growth has shown such strength. Many readers who work in the IT space are well aware that their segment is exploding in size and complexity. It has become increasingly difficult for users to optimize and control all of the areas for which they have responsibility. There are other ways to do what Splunk does for sure. But generally, a Splunk solution is mainline and it is one into which users grow. This is not a trend that is going to either stop or abate, and the advent of the cloud - particularly its most popular implementation, the hybrid cloud, is simply adding to complexity. Again, I am really baffled as to why someone might come to the conclusion that there is some organic problem with Splunk's demand paradigm.I mentioned that Splunk is now offering its initial IoT product. It is a product that is not priced based on data volume, so it avoids the label of ""unconventional pricing"" used by the Citi analyst. At this point, no one can accurately forecast the size of the opportunity for this set of solutions. I assume that it will ultimately be in the multi-billion-dollar range. Overall, the company has a runway that it believes is based on a $62 billion TAM which continues to expand along with the different use cases for Splunk's technology. Just looking at the plethora of new products this company has to sell and the size of the market in which it can compete might suggest that there is no real reason to see any growth rate compression.But further to that, it is interesting to see that this company is now able to close more large deals than at any time in its history as it becomes accepted as a de facto standard in the areas in which it competes. Last quarter the company closed 43 deals of greater than $1 million, up about 22% in number, and quite a bit more in value, when compared to the year earlier period. The company is closing larger deals; it is closing more Enterprise Adoption Agreements, and its ASPs are rising and rose at an accelerating rate last year - basically because this company has more and more products that it can sell. The number of new name accounts was somewhat below average levels last quarter, but the CFO suggested that it was a function more of seasonality than any lack of new name opportunities.There certainly have been articles on this site suggesting that regardless of the merits of Splunk as a business, its valuation is too high. I have previously discussed some of the key valuation metrics that are normally used to assess valuation. In the case of this company, I think one has to start with the evaluation of whether growth is going to compress to 25% in the next fiscal year. Part of that forecast is a product of the company's Investor Presentation which uses that kind of number. It produces a nice round $2 billion goal for revenues. I am not sure, however, the extent to which that number was meant to be taken explicitly as a forecast when it was presented, and I see no reason to believe that Splunk will not continue to deliver growth well above 30%.Splunk is actually forecasting that sequential quarter-to-quarter growth will reach 15% this quarter, and obviously that cadence is at a far greater rate than 25% or 30%. Part of that discrepancy is the impact of ASC 606 on the year-earlier base number. Part of it is the pivot, described earlier, away from support and education revenue sources. In the preceding year, Splunk saw a 15% sequential quarter increase in revenues between Q1 and Q2. It would, I think, be analytically unjustified to suggest that the company is actually seeing anything like a slowdown in the rate of demand increase.If one takes the trouble to look at what Splunk's model actually implies in the wake of its Q1 results and its Q2 guidance, it turns out that the company is forecasting at least 35% year-on-year growth in Q4, and most likely more when adjusted for the ASC 606 restatement. I realize that company forecasts are not written in stone and they can frequently misfire, although the record of Splunk suggests a reasonable level of conservatism in its projections. But if this company winds up growing at the cadence it has currently forecast, then the kind of growth slowdown implicit in the current First Call consensus estimates for fiscal 2020 is simply unsupportable. And when one takes the view that this company can achieve 30-35% growth for a number of years, then the shares no longer seem particularly expensive. In fact, if one believes as I do that the company is going to maintain growth at more than 30% for the next several years, the current EV/S ratio of 7.3X is noticeably less than the average EV/S ratio for hyper-growth companies.Does that analysis hold true in terms of operating margins and cash flow? There are certainly signs that the issues that have weighed on investors in terms of profitability are starting to abate. It is clearly a process and not something one-off, but last quarter showed the process to be alive and well.I am not going to engage in a sterile debate about the merits or demerits of stock-based comp. Splunk uses a lot of it, and many people have pointed that out over the course of many years. About the best that can be said regarding stock-based comp is that it grew only 5% year on year last quarter, but yes, it is 30% of revenues, although that ratio will almost surely fall over the course of the next 12 months, and the potential dilution to the shares will fall as well.If a company is engineered to produce 40% growth in software revenue - and that is the case for Splunk - doing so is going to be quite expensive. Some people don't like Splunk because its use of stock-based comp has been judged excessive; there have been times when I would put myself in that category. But how a company can hire at the rate necessary to achieve 40% growth in product revenues at the scale of Splunk without very high stock-based comp expenses is not immediately apparent to me. The products do not develop themselves, nor can they be sold through some new efficient process, and even the contracts and ecosystem relationships that are part of the strategy of this company have to be negotiated by real people. How those people get hired in a competitive labor market - particularly the labor market in Silicon Valley - without significant stock-based comp expense is beyond me.In any event, Splunk's management has apparently heard enough about its use of stock-based comp from analysts and major investors, and it is gradually reducing its over-reliance on that form of compensation; that according to one of the slides in its latest investor presentation. And while Splunk continues to make losses on a GAAP basis, it has established a rather clear profit improvement trajectory. I have mentioned that the company is seeing term licenses increase as a percentage of the total. Over time, term licenses will lead to higher gross margins as renewals become a more significant source of total revenues. And the pivot away from services is going to lead to improved gross margins on that line; maintenance is a highly profitable undertaking for software vendors. Overall, last quarter, GAAP gross margins rose from 73.6% to 75%. I expect that this trend will continue for some time into the future.Of course for many years this company has spent a huge amount of revenues on opex - and that is still the case. But there are signs of improvement here as well. Overall, operating expense was 114% of revenue this last quarter compared to 124% of revenue the prior year (Investors should note that Q1 is the seasonal low point for revenues; the full-year metrics will be far better and most of the profit comes in Q4). The increase (or better said, the reduction in operating loss margins) in Q1 is masked to a degree by the relatively flat performance of the stock-based comp expense. The change in non-GAAP operating margins was 320 basis points. I think it reasonable to assume that GAAP margins will continue to improve far more rapidly than non-GAAP, as the company constrains the growth of stock-based comp. It forecast that it would reach 14% in non-GAAP margins in fiscal 2020; at this point it is on a pace that would exceed that goal, but the CFO did not choose to call out any potential improvement beyond 14% in this latest conference call. I think it would be a given that if the company's growth trajectory remains above that in the March investor penetration, it will achieve higher operating margins than were forecast at that point.I am not going to put together a 2020 model for Splunk's EPS at this point. But needless to say, my expectation is that revenue growth will exceed the current First Call consensus forecast of 25% growth and that as a concomitant, operating margin improvement will be more rapid as well. Those kinds of expectations would result in reported EPS for fiscal 2020 of something between $1.75 and $1.80, and whether or not I like it, or anyone else likes it, the shares will ultimately trade, in part on that kind of metric. A P/E of 55X for a company achieving 30%+ growth is exceptionally attractive for many investors.I mentioned earlier that the company had particularly strong operating cash flow in Q1. The level of operating cash was so strong that it would normally call for a revision in that forecast given normal seasonality. But the CFO has left his forecast for $300 million of operating cash flow alone at this point with some indication that there is an upside bias that will be considered specifically during the Q2 earnings release. Clearly, the large jump in collections last quarter can't be readily repeated. On the other hand, the large fall in accrued comp is also a product of seasonality. The company's cash flow continues to carry changes in deferred revenue. But with the advent of ASC 606, that number has a different meaning than heretofore. The fall in deferred revenue balances this quarter is a function of annual billings and a higher proportion of subscription billings that are billed annually. Looking at that number in isolation produces a disquieting result in terms of calculated bookings (the issue pounded on by the Citi analyst). An investor can either accept that cavil and sell the shares or can accept the analysis of the CFO and how the change to ASC 606 revenue recognition is changing the calculus. In that case one reaches a different conclusion. I have chosen to believe the CFO.It is my belief that Splunk has a dominant market position in a variety of high-growth markets, and it is making appropriate investments to maintain its position for the foreseeable future. I do not see that its growth drivers are plateauing, and in fact some of its growth drivers are new (IoT) and should help sustain growth. I am singularly unpersuaded that the use of the company's technology as a security solution is self-limiting, or that the company's pricing is going to impact its performance.The Citi downgrade has had a meaningful impact on the valuation of Splunk shares and they offer a better valuation now than they have been in some time. I think readers are well advised to take advantage of the current valuation anomaly. There is plenty of positive alpha in this name"
4177693,103480,2018-05-29T02:31:25-04:00,"Splunk shares cratered 5% after posting Q1 earnings, despite beating analyst estimates on the top and bottom line.Shares of Splunk have rallied tremendously in the year-to-date period, and despite this quarter's strong results, its >9x forward revenue multiple is difficult to digest.After the huge acceleration seen in Q4, Splunk shares are likely to see more consistent performance and lack the exciting growth that propelled its YTD rally.Despite small improvements in operating margin, Splunk still has more progress to make in hitting breakeven on a GAAP basis.","Splunk (SPLK), the machine-learning data company that uses its software to extract machine data from enterprise systems to detect possible security threats, has had its first stumble in a long time. Like many other software and technology companies this quarter, good earnings results are no guarantee of a post-earnings rally. Beginning with Alphabet's (GOOG) report at the beginning of the Q1 earnings season, despite headline beats to analyst consensus expectations, investors have tended to focus more on the negatives than on the positives this quarter. After a stellar rally coming out of a blowout fourth-quarter release, it seems Splunk was unable to defy gravity this time, and shares fell 5% after posting Q1 earnings:SPLK data by YChartsWe have to be careful to take Splunk's minor tumble in context, however. Even after factoring in Splunk's post-Q1 dip, Splunk is still one of the best-performing software stocks of the year, up 33% in the year-to-date period and climbing 76% over the past twelve months. Patient investors have been rewarded handsomely indeed.Splunk entered into its bull run last quarter (Q4) when the company's revenue growth of 37% y/y accelerated over Q3's revenue growth rate of 31% as well as bested Wall Street consensus of 28% y/y growth. Shares rallied sharply above $100 for the first time and continued climbing toward nearly $20 in the time period between the Q4 release and Q1 release, as the bullish narrative dominated and enthusiasm for Splunk's big data technologies proliferated.To some extent, the bullish narrative remains very much the same. For a company of its scale, it's growing at an impressively quick pace. For the full year FY19, Splunk bumped up its guidance to $1.645 billion, $20 million higher than its previous forecast of $1.625 billion and implying 29% y/y growth, one point higher than Wall Street consensus of 28% y/y growth ($1.630 billion). Very few companies, upon reaching a multi-billion revenue scale, are still growing this quickly - and up until this quarter, Splunk's revenues had been accelerating for two consecutive quarters.Thematically, Splunk is also in the right space, occupying a highly buzzed intersection between big data, machine learning, and cybersecurity. As more and more business processes go digital, technologies like Splunk help enterprises extract ""machine data"" from their systems and use it to evaluate patterns and trends that could expose security risks. Security is one of Splunk's core use cases at the moment, but the future uses of machine-generated data are even more numerous beyond just security. In Q1, Splunk softly rolled out its newest offering, Splunk Industrial Asset Intelligence, which is an IoT offering aimed at extracting data from industrial equipment.And most importantly, while Splunk does have some competition from fast-growing startups like SumoLogic, it essentially dominates the space with very few meaningfully large competitors.The only problem, then, is one of valuation. Even after this quarter's dip, Splunk shares still stand at 9.1x forward revenues, an extremely steep multiple that exceeds virtually every other software company that is projected to grow at around ~30%. Sure, some SaaS companies have managed to trade higher for a long period of time, like Workday (WDAY), but it becomes increasingly harder to defend a bullish case for Splunk when its valuation limits its upside. At best, Splunk is a hold - I'd argue that $100 is a fair price target for the company, representing 8x EV/FY19 revenues and still a premium to most SaaS software companies.At face value, there was nothing wrong with Splunk's earnings - it was probably the fact that the so-so results coming out of this quarter, after a far bigger earnings beat in Q4, failed to justify Splunk's valuation and sharp recent rally. Here's a look at the full results:Figure 1. Splunk Q1 earningsSource: Splunk investor relationsTotal revenues grew 37% y/y to $311.6 million, beating Wall Street estimates of $297.7 million (+31% y/y) by six points. This, of course, was an impressive result - but we have to keep in mind that last quarter, Splunk's Q4 growth rate of 37% y/y represented a six-point acceleration over 31% in the prior quarter and beat analyst consensus of 28% y/y growth by nine points. Comparatively speaking, this quarter's results were slightly weaker.The revenue growth also came in a slightly more unfavorable mix. You'll notice that there's a huge gap in the margin profitability of Splunk's license (software) sales versus its maintenance and services revenues. While license revenues carry a nearly-pure 96% gross margin, maintenance revenues only bring in 58% gross margins. Splunk's revenue streams are worth more if they carry higher gross margins, so in the long term, maintaining a high revenue valuation rests on being able to improve Splunk's gross margin, and thus its license revenue mix.License revenues grew 35% y/y to $139.0 million, representing 44.6% of Splunk's revenue base in Q1, versus 45.2% in 1Q17. Over time, SaaS and license revenues should represent an increasing mix of revenues, not decreasing. Another fact to remember - unlike most of its peers in the cloud SaaS space, Splunk hasn't yet fully transitioned to a subscription model, and a large portion of its customers still consume Splunk on a term license basis. Though the company has a goal of reaching a predominantly higher mix of subscription revenues versus term licenses (which would also help the license versus maintenance revenue mix), it still has plenty of work to do in this regard. David Conte, Splunk's CFO, noted the following on the subscription transition plan on the earnings call:One interesting note in the quarter - Splunk used to report the number of deals in excess of $100,000, but beginning this quarter it will begin reporting instead the number of deals in excess of $1 million, indicating its growing maturity as a larger-scale vendor. The company did 43 deals above $1 million in Q1, versus 35 in the year-ago quarter, and added 460 total new customers to the client base.On the profit side, Splunk didn't earn any significant kudos. Due to the company's huge stock comp expenses (dilution is a fairly significant factor to watch at Splunk), its GAAP operating losses are still massive. Operating losses in the quarter were -$121.5 million, a larger loss than -$112.7 million in the year-ago quarter, but on a margin basis, its operating margin of -39% (while still large) is much better than -50% in 1Q17. Most of the efficiencies were captured in sales and marketing expenses, its largest expense category and one which consumed ""only"" 70% of Splunk's revenues in Q1, versus 76% in the year-ago quarter.Splunk's pro forma EPS of -$0.07 beat Wall Street consensus of -$0.09, but like the revenue beat, it underwhelmed somewhat in the context of Splunk's Q4 beat ($0.37 versus $0.33 consensus).Splunk is still very much a high-quality company engaged in critical technologies that will continue at an above-average growth rate for the foreseeable future, but the stock was long overdue for a cooldown. A forward revenue valuation of >9x is very difficult to defend for any company regardless of quality, especially in a volatile market that is becoming increasingly sensitive to sky-high valuations.Despite previously owning Splunk shares, I'm content to stay on the sidelines as Splunk consolidates and wouldn't consider re-entering a long position unless the stock returns to sub-$100 levels. The risk-reward profile, at Splunk's current elevated valuation, is just too unappealing."
4167074,102661,2018-04-27T17:23:00-04:00,"Splunk offered investors a bullish outlook on its recent FY '18 earnings call and during its Analyst Day in March.In spite of strong top-line growth, there are multiple risks surrounding the company's go-forward strategy, which are revealed via analysis of the earnings call and Analyst Day presentation/discussion.These risks may severely impact revenue and margin performance, undercutting Splunk's operating structure in the process.Analysts must do more to challenge Splunk in terms of its risk profile in order to provide investors with a balanced perspective.","Not too long ago, Splunk (SPLK) announced its Q4 FY '18 and full-year FY '18 results, and those results were generally received gleefully by analysts and investors alike. Jim Cramer, for example, hosted Splunk's CEO, Doug Merritt, on ""Mad Money"" and suggested that Splunk is still in the ""early innings"" in terms of growth.On March 27, 2018, the company held an Analyst Day to discuss its performance, forecast, and strategy moving forward. Broadly, the company laid out a revenue goal of $2 BB by FY '20, with non-GAAP operating margin growth along the way. Its underlying strategy - again, broadly speaking - revolves around a transition to subscription-based licensing, additional market penetration, sales coverage, and growing the company's cloud business.In this article, I attack elements of Splunk's outlook and strategy based on irregularities/risks that I believe are exposed through an analysis of the earnings call discussion, the Analyst Day presentation/discussion, and the company's financial data.The last article I published on Seeking Alpha - nearly eight months ago - discussed my reasoning against a Cisco (CSCO) acquisition of Splunk. For reasons beyond the scope of this article, I actually hesitated to publish it. Ultimately, I did publish, and it elicited, shall we say, a strong reaction. With most sentiment around Splunk fervently bullish, I expect this article and its decidedly bearish tone might evoke a similar reaction.So be it. I reiterate from the prior article that I don't believe Splunk is in its early innings of growth anymore, contrary to the position held by Mr. Cramer. That view, coupled with the risks I discuss herein, led me to recommend that existing investors think carefully about their position.As this article became a bit longer than I originally expected, I divided it into numbered sections.

Splunk's fourth quarter revenue was $419.7 million, up 37% year over year, fiscal year revenue was $1,271 billion, up 34% year-over-year, and billings also increased healthily in both periods. But GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $23.9 million, and GAAP operating loss for the full year is $259 million.Splunk FY '18 Fourth Quarter HighlightsSplunk FY '18 Full Year HighlightsSplunk noted during its earnings call that ""for the full year, operating margin was 9.2% above our expectations due to the strength of our overall top line performance."" The company went on to say,I had originally planned to discuss operating margin toward the end of this article, but let us begin our analysis there.Splunk's non-GAAP (keyword is ""non-GAAP"") operating margin was an important topic of discussion during the Analyst Day. Before diving into the margin discussion, I'd like to reiterate another point I made in my last Seeking Alpha article discussing Splunk.I encourage readers to keep the point above in mind.Moving forward, the company, like most other software vendors selling subscription licenses, will report results under the new ASC 606 accounting standard vs. the ""old"" ASC 605 standard. Under this rule, software companies are able to recognize the full value of certain subscription licenses upfront. This is delineated in the slide below, presented during the Analyst Day:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThis accounting change impacts Splunk's reported income. For example, as per the slide below, under 606, total revenues for FY '17 decline from $950 to $944 MM, while revenues for FY '18 increase from $1,271 MM to $1,309 MM. We also see that non-GAAP operating margin for FY '18 increases from 9% to 14% under 606.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThe purpose of this article is not to go into the intricacies of the new standard, although I urge readers to review the following for a good overview: ASC 606 & IFRS 15: How the new Revenue Standards will impact Subscription Companies - Zuora).However, I do wish to highlight some irregularity in terms of how Splunk presented its operating margin results during the Analyst Day. The company presented this slide to highlight non-GAAP operating margin growth:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationNow, consider the data above in context with this slide:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationIn the slide above, on the left, Splunk illustrates the operating margin improvement for FY '18 under 606 from 9.2% to 14.2%. On the right, the company illustrates how it arrives at its forecasted operating margin of 11.5% for FY '19, again under 606.But now, look back at the operating margin leverage slide where the company appears to show non-GAAP operating margin growth. The company has mixed results from 605 and 606 accounting standards to create this growth curve. Specifically, in this slide, the 9.2% non-GAAP operating margin result for FY '18 is under 605, whereas the non-GAAP operating margin forecasts for FY '19 and FY '20 are under 606. This slide is misleading in my view. It's a bit like mixing GAAP and non-GAAP results together.In fact, if we normalize the last three data points in this slide under 606, we have the following (asterisk delineates forecast):So, non-GAAP operating margin is really not forecast to increase, it is decreasing between FY' 18 and FY '19 and actually roughly flat between FY '18 and FY '20. During the Analyst Day Q&A period, one of the analysts (Walter) pointed out that the company is staring at ""flat margins with the same profile of revenue,"" meaning the top-line goal of $2 BB by FY' 20 has remained steady over various Splunk forecasts. This analyst suggested that perhaps the ""missing link,"" in terms of why operating margin is flat, is the company's activity around reinvestment initiatives. Dave Conte, Splunk Senior VP and CFO, replied as follows, which I transcribed from the Analyst Day webcast:(If you'd like to listen to this particular question/answer, it is around the 3:41 mark - that is, 3 hours, 41 minutes.)Dave Conte's answer to the question seemed rather indirect to me. A simple answer would have been along the lines of ""Yes; operating margin is expected to be roughly flat between FY '18 and FY '20 due to reinvestment activity."" Moreover, Dave Conte's answer does not explain why 605 and 606 accounting standards were mixed on the operating margin leverage slide, although, admittedly, he was not asked that specific question. Finally, it would have been helpful if his answer explained why the company has raised non-GAAP operating margin guidance for FY '20 from 12% to 14% (the 12% figure was presented in FY '17).I'm concerned as to why the company appears to obfuscate margin performance on the operating margin leverage slide, in an effort to create the appearance of growth.Also, Splunk has provided through its own commentary some reasons to think that operating margins are at risk. As we will discuss further in the article, Dave Conte has stated that he expects subscription license durations to ease down. If that is so, an investor should wonder if that fact is in conflict with the increased guide for FY '20. After all, the company has indicated they intend to reinvest the main expense benefit that they receive under 606 (i.e. commission expense). So, if you are reinvesting your main accounting benefit, and subscription contracts - which will dominate your license mix (we'll discuss this in detail in a moment) - are expected to be shorter in duration and therefore lower in value, where is the increased operating margin guide coming from for FY' 20?I also would remind investors of Splunk's GAAP operating margin performance from FY' 2012 through FY' 2018:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY '13 - FY '18, Chart Source: Yves SukhuGAAP margin has been trending in the right direction over the last few years, but given the discussion on non-GAAP operating margin above, I'm concerned about a possible reversal.I reminded readers at the outset of this section that Splunk backs out its rather large stock-based compensation expense to generate non-GAAP results. In fairness, the company indicated during the Analyst Day that this expense is normalizing:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationWhile this may be so, it is the approach of backing out the expense, and not necessarily the expense itself that is concerning. Given the approach to calculating non-GAAP results and given how the non-GAAP operating margin figures were presented/discussed during the Analyst Day, I personally am led to believe that there may be substantial risk around future operating margin performance (both GAAP and non-GAAP).During the earnings call, Splunk noted that its ""largest tailwind is term license bookings."" By ""term license"", the company is referring to on-premise software licenses with a fixed duration (e.g. one year, two years, etc.), which of course is in contrast to a perpetual license that a customer owns forever. To be clear, Splunk also sells cloud-based licenses which also have a fixed duration but are (obviously) used in the cloud, and not on premise.NOTE: Splunk often uses the word ""duration"" to reference its non-perpetual license types (term + cloud). I will use ""subscription"" in this section and throughout the article as an equivalent term.Splunk is moving from a dominant perpetual license model to a dominant subscription license model, with term and cloud licenses expected to comprise 75% of bookings by FY 2020.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThis is not surprising, as the enterprise software industry in general is moving in the direction of subscription-licenses over perpetual licenses. However, let me inject a bit of personal anecdote here which is relevant to the discussion: No software company ""wants"" to move to subscription-based licensing over perpetual licenses if the latter was how they were previously selling. They are doing it because they don't have a choice.Analysts on the earnings call, as well as those participating during the Analyst Day, seemed to be generally pleased with Splunk's growing percentage of subscription-based licenses since none brought up any major objections/concerns. It's reasonable to assume that analysts believe Splunk will grow its subscription-license revenues at an increasing rate that exceeds the declining rate of perpetual licenses. On the surface, revenue and sales data seem to support that belief. First, Splunk's top line has continued to grow at an impressive rate, and software license growth specifically has grown at a 44% CAGR since FY 2012.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationSource: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationSecond, Splunk's average sales price has increased steadily.Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThese trends have occurred as the license mix has been shifting. However, a deeper analysis exposes potential issues that analysts/investors may be overlooking and avoiding.Stating the obvious, customers like subscription-based licenses since they allow costs to be spread out over time (i.e. versus a single up-front payment for a perpetual license).Customers also like subscription-licenses from the standpoint of limiting their ""lock-in"" with any given vendor. Arguably, customers are less likely to leave a technology for which they have a perpetual license, given the nature of the license itself, as well as the (likely) large, upfront cost that they paid to acquire the license. Since subscription licenses are temporary by definition, customers may be more inclined, at the end of their license terms, to consider their options.As I see it, herein lies the challenge for Splunk (and many other software companies) given the shift to more subscription-based licenses.The company's re-subscription rate ""may"" fall over time as competitors and new market entrants give customers pause before committing to another subscription period. In its FY 2017 Annual Report on page 19, Splunk states:As mentioned above, customer preferences have shifted toward subscription-based licensing precisely because they do not want to be locked into technologies over multiple years. Perhaps executive management indirectly makes this point on the FY '18 Q4 earnings call where David Conte stated:He goes on to say:As best I can tell, Splunk does not provide data on their retention rates for subscription licenses. But, the ""law of competition"" dictates that retention rates ""should"" decline over time. Of course, by how much and how fast is difficult to answer. From a top-line perspective, Splunk's growth in subscription revenue must obviously be greater than any declines due to subscriber loss.Moreover, Splunk may come under pressure to renew customer subscriptions at an increasing frequency if subscription periods continue to ""ease down."" You might argue that the subscription period will eventually reach a ""bottom"" because Splunk simply will not write subscription contracts for less than a given duration (e.g. one year). I agree with that argument. However, let us again think about the possible effect of competitive pressures. If competitors opt to move into shorter-duration subscription contracts (e.g. month-to-month), Splunk may have no choice but to follow suit.Granted, what I have written above is speculative. But I'd argue that it is ""reasonably probable."" I believe analysts and investors are assuming (incorrectly) that subscription-based revenue will continue to grow without any significant subscriber loss. This is a risky assumption, to say the least, in the face of a highly volatile and competitive market.To close this section, I note that not one analyst on the earnings call, or during the Analyst Day Q&A period, asked about subscription retention rates (historical or forecasted).Let's also think about the move to a subscription-dominant licensing model from a structural perspective. Splunk presently has a ""heavy"" direct sales force, with sales/marketing costs accounting for nearly 64% of total revenues in FY '18. It may prove difficult to support that kind of sales model on a preponderance of short-duration contracts because of the potential variability in revenue. If the revenue mix is going to favor shorter-duration subscription-based contracts moving forward, then Splunk will likely incur pressure on its current sales model. It would seem Doug Merritt, Splunk CEO and President, hinted at this point on the earnings call, again - without stating it directly, saying:(Readers are encouraged to review the full transcript for context.) Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY '13 - FY '18, Table Source: Yves SukhuAs we see above, sales and marketing has been Splunk's largest operating expense. Does Splunk need a direct sales model to survive? Presumably yes, unless they've enjoyed setting a match to piles of money over the last several years. Moreover, as will be discussed later in the article, Splunk intends to sharpen its focus on markets outside its core IT Operations (ITOM) and Security markets via sales coverage.It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that sales and marketing expenses will continue to be the largest operating expense moving forward. It should be pointed out that historically Splunk's ability to support such an expensive sales force has rested on a licensing mix that was dominated by perpetual licenses. So, the company's ability to maintain its current sales structure on a preponderance of subscription licenses is unclear and ""untested."" That's not to say that it cannot be done. But, it is a significant risk.Let's revisit the slide that Splunk presented on Average Selling Price:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationIt's an impressive chart, especially as average selling price has more than doubled since FY '12. As the company implies in this slide (and states explicitly elsewhere), increased customer adoption over time is driving the growth in ASP. Perhaps even more impressive is the chart displaying the number of deals over $1 million:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationNaturally, an abundance of large deal sizes helps to increase the overall ASP. Evidently, Splunk believes the trend in ASP growth will continue in spite of the change in licensing mix. ASP is extremely important, as it is a key input into maintaining/growing operating margin. Will Splunk's trend in ASP continue?I see four potential problems.1. The first problem lies with the ability for the company to continue driving enterprise adoption agreements (EAAs). The company defines EAAs as follows in its FY '17 Annual Report:Per the last slide, Splunk has done a good job demonstrating growth in these types of contracts. And the company might well continue this trend. However, there are a couple potential issues with EAAs:A decline in EAA revenue volume will drag on ASP. In fact, Dave Conte acknowledged that ""bubbles"" are possible with EAAs in his presentation during the Analyst Day. But he also indicated that he personally believed Splunk's EAA growth will continue.2. The second problem lies in the average value of subscription licenses. Average subscription license value will be less than the average perpetual license value, and Splunk noted during the Analyst Day that their financial models are built on the assumption that subscription licenses will be roughly two-thirds the size of a perpetual license. (I do leave open the possibility that there could be some unusually large subscription license sales.) If perpetual licenses become the smallest piece of the ""license pie,"" then, under one scenario, the average perpetual license deal size will have to increase to compensate to maintain ASP. Simply, the dynamics of the new licensing mix may make it more challenging for Splunk to maintain, much less grow its ASP.3. Competitive pressures are likely to drive down the average value of all license types (subscription and perpetual). Consider the following statement from Splunk's FY '17 Annual Report:These pricing and licensing moves suggest a reaction to competitive pressures, unless, of course, Splunk was feeling particularly generous in 2015. These pressures will only get worse.4. Splunk had an unusually large number of ""mega-orders,"" larger than $10MM in FY '18:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationThese ""mega-orders"" were not backed out when calculating ASP. Arguably, the ASP for FY '18 is artificially high due to the influence of these very large orders, which obviously show great variation in terms of their number year over year in the slide above. As with EAAs, there's a certain subset of Splunk's overall customer base that can ""absorb"" such a large transaction. I have no idea how large that subset is, so perhaps Splunk has many more opportunities to sell such large deals. An analyst (Jesse) inquired about the unusual number of large orders in FY '18 and asked why it happened and if investors should expect that kind of large order performance moving forward. Dave Conte replied that he could not say it was a ""new normal"" and offered no explanation as far as why so many large orders were processed in FY '18. Accordingly, investors should be prepared for volatility in terms of the number of these transactions executed year over year.If we aggregate the main points of sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, Splunk's top-line, operating margin, and actual operating structure (among other things) are at risk as the company shifts toward a subscription-dominant license model. Certainly, and contrary to everything I have presented in this section, the company could:My main issue is that the licensing model risks carry a weight that's not reflected in analyst questions/discussions with Splunk. Yes, some analysts participating in the Analyst Day hinted at some licensing mix concerns, as discussed above. But none truly challenged the company, which I think was a disservice to investors.Splunk repeatedly called attention to its total addressable market opportunity during the Analyst Day. Here is the slide presented:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationAlmost every data-centric company has a slide like this. The narrative is always the same:The rate of data growth is so high that our addressable market opportunity is expanding like crazy!This kind of thinking is misleading, and investors should be wise to it. As any market expands, competition will intensify - barring a monopolistic opportunity, which Splunk does not have in any market. So, while the overall market size grows, the ""slice of the pie"" that any particular market participant can attack may actually be getting smaller. So, the slide above is really meaningless from an investor's standpoint without the context of a detailed competitive analysis. It is notable - not in a good way - that Splunk did not offer any substantial discussion on competition during the Analyst Day, nor did any of the analysts challenge the company in regard to competitive pressures.Splunk calculates its current TAM by summing the estimated market size of the five main solution areas that the company is targeting. Splunk also mentioned the size of these markets in the prior fiscal year (FY '17) to emphasize not just the sheer size of their TAM but the strong growth rate as well. The data presented from the Analyst Day is as follows:Within its two largest markets, IT Operations (ITOM) and Security, the company noted during the Analyst Day that it has only achieved 2% and 6% penetration, respectively. (Assuming they mean that in terms of sales volume, then Splunk generated roughly $460 MM for IT Operations use cases and roughly $660 MM for Security.)All of this, according to Splunk, means the company has a massive opportunity in front of it.But I'm confused by Splunk's strategy which is to ""play"" in all five markets of the table. I come back to my comment about intensifying competition. Let's look at Splunk's two largest markets of IT Operations (ITOM) and Security where - in their words - they have only just started to penetrate and capture market share. Splunk is hardly alone in either of these markets. While they are deservedly a leader in both areas, consider some of the other ""heavyweight"" players in both markets:As an investor, would you not expect that all of the companies above are going to continue to aggressively compete in these markets as they grow? Why would any of these companies willingly cede any ground/market share to Splunk? And these companies are just the heavyweights. There are any number of startups/niche players that want a bigger piece of the pie. For example, for the Security space (specifically, the SIEM space where Splunk is a leader), here's Gartner's magic quadrant:There are quite a few niche players who presumably want to move ""up and to the right."" If Splunk has only penetrated the ITOM market at 2%, the Security market at 6%, has significant market size in both markets but also has significant competition in both markets, wouldn't it make sense to double down and focus on these markets? Moreover, both the ITOM and Security markets are changing from a technology perspective. As a (possibly oversimplified) example, security has moved from once-upon-a-time simple event capture/monitoring to complex activity analytics where software is tasked with interpreting the ""meaning"" of various system/network activity and data to detect threats. The latter is not easy to do and is why Splunk has made certain investments in the Security space over the last few years, including the recently announced acquisition of Phantom (an InQTel backed company).I don't understand why Splunk would try to attack five markets, when:One analyst (Michael) offered one question along this line of thinking during the Q&A section of the Analyst Data, asking ""why now"" in terms of emphasizing a focus on business analytics and IoT markets. Doug Merritt broadly responded that the company ""really hadn't put anyone on business analytics and IoT"" and that Splunk needs to ""put (its) money where (its) mouth is, and find repetitive patterns in those expansion areas.""In terms of business analytics, Splunk has had this market on its radar since its first year as a public company. The following is from the company's FY '13 Annual Report:So, here we are several years later, and the company is suggesting that business analytics hasn't been a focus, nor have they established a repeatable sales pattern for this market. If that's true, what makes Splunk think they can even be competitive in the business analytics market now? Business analytics is hardly a nascent market, and has become terribly saturated. Some of the major players include:The list above doesn't even consider players like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which introduced its Wave Analytics offering not too long ago, and Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), which contracted with Zoomdata (another InQTel backed company) to develop its QuickSight offering. Perhaps this saturation is reflected in Splunk's own data, as the TAM table shows flat growth in the business analytics market.So, why is Splunk targeting a market where:It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.In regard to the IoT market, it is so nebulous right now that it is hard to know what it is, and what it isn't. Last year, I had written a Seeking Alpha article about General Electric (NYSE:GE) where I pointed out the huge variations in IoT market size estimates. I should note that GE, in fact, has a partnership with Splunk for its own IoT initiative. There's little doubt that, as the sheer number of connected machines and devices grows, then the data volume they throw off will grow. But, to reiterate, it is somewhat difficult to quantify the opportunity here. For example, edge computing is another buzzy buzzword these days, where machine/device data is not ""sent"" to a central store like Splunk for analysis but is rather analyzed/interpreted ""near"" the machine/device, or on the machine/device itself. So, just because the volume of data is growing does not necessarily mean that all that data is going to be transmitted, stored, and analyzed in aggregate. The broader point in my article on GE - which I think is also relevant here - was that the company (GE in that case) was throwing around (what I perceived as) ridiculous numbers in regard to their IoT market opportunity.The application development market offers similar characteristics to the business analytics market in that it has achieved a certain level of maturity and features several heavyweight players.With a combined $34 billion market opportunity in its core markets (using Splunk's own numbers), I'm at a loss why the company would even consider stretching its resources. Think about this from the standpoint of research and development (R&D):Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY '13 - FY '18, Chart Source: Yves SukhuThe trend in Splunk's R&D spend relative to revenue is clear. Investors should ask themselves: How can the company effectively spread these limited R&D resources across five distinct markets, each of which demand specific R&D investment and are highly competitive?As per Doug Merritt, the company intends to put resources on expansion markets. Since the company clearly believes in a direct-sales-oriented approach for attacking markets, will Splunk hire more salespeople to focus on business analytics, application development, and IoT? Where will the money come from for that? How will the company maintain its operating margin guidance if it expands sales?I'm forced to ask: does Splunk have or foresee problems with its core markets (ITOM, Security), e.g. saturation, intensifying competition, etc.? If so, that would be worrisome to say the least from an investor standpoint.Splunk touted its cloud business numerous times during the Analyst Day presentation and during the associated Q&A section. The company is relying on the cloud business to compensate for declining perpetual license revenue, and to also help it capture more customers.Let's focus on the revenue aspect of this business first. Splunk estimates its cloud business will be generating $250 MM by FY '20:Source: Splunk Analyst Day PresentationI have some doubts about this. First of all, the company appears to be extrapolating a trend based on two major data points (i.e. FY '17 and FY '18 performance). So, their experience/history with significant revenues from their cloud business is limited, which - one would think - makes it difficult to forecast. Further, think about one of the defining characteristics of cloud-based solutions:They tend to get cheaper over time.Did Amazon Web Services (AWS) become the 800,000 pound gorilla that it is by charging MORE for the various services it provides? No, of course not. It captured share by dramatically under-cutting traditional IT solution providers. I remember signing up for AWS in the early days, when I'd receive - every couple weeks or so - an email detailing a continued price reduction of some particular AWS resource.I seriously doubt Splunk will be able to maintain its pricing in the cloud. Investors should expect significant competition, because, after all, it is the ""easiest"" environment for competitors to enter due to such a low barrier to entry. Today, Splunk enjoys a strong relationship with AWS, but, let me pose another question to readers:Why shouldn't AWS kill Splunk?Think about Splunk in terms of core capabilities: It is essentially a system for data collection, data storage/retrieval, data correlation, and data visualization. AWS has capabilities in all these areas, and more. They have greater development resources than Splunk. So, again, why shouldn't they kill Splunk altogether?Doug Merritt didn't exactly make this point on the Q4 earnings call, but he noted ""AWS' job is to continue to offer more and more services, both infrastructure and platform services, to the community."" He goes on to correctly note ""and our job is to keep adding more value on top of those services so that people would still want to do business with Splunk in addition to, or with, AWS. And that's just - that's a game that we all know how to play in tech."" Mr. Merritt is 100% right in his comments. But, if I were an investor in Splunk, I would be deeply concerned that the company, which is telling me cloud is core to its future growth strategy, could be killed off by its biggest cloud partner. Splunk's ""competitive moat"" around its cloud business does not look deep or wide.Naturally, if Splunk is forced to drop pricing in the cloud due to competitive pressures, then the company will have to sell more deals to make up the same amount of revenue.Splunk also is counting on the cloud business to help the company achieve its customer target of 20,000 by FY '20. As we see below, the rate of growth in Splunk's customer count has decreased and flatlined somewhat:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY '13 - FY '18, Chart Source: Yves SukhuOne analyst (Ramo - I'm not sure about the name spelling) commented about this during the Analyst Day Q&A stating that he was ""struggling"" with the fact that Splunk has been adding (more or less) 2,000 extra customers per year. He specifically asked: ""What's the thing that's keeping that number where it is? Is it lead generation? What's the driver to bring that higher?"" Splunk provided numerous answers to the question, but the answer relevant to this section came from Sendur Sellakumar who commented that Splunk looks at its partnership with AWS as a mechanism to capture new customers. Additionally, and discussed earlier during the Analyst Day, Mr. Sellakumar, remarked that one of the strategies to drive business growth with AWS is to have ""(Splunk) reps talk with their reps."" This strategy is logical, but not necessarily sustainable.It's entirely likely that the realized trend in new customer acquisition via AWS decreases over time for the reasons discussed above. I concede that such a dynamic may not happen in FY '19 or FY '20, but I think it is still probable. With respect to the approach of driving a strong relationship between the respective AWS and Splunk sales forces, this makes sense But, don't you think that every other AWS partner wants to do the same thing? As long as AWS remains ""king of the cloud,"" everybody will ""want a piece"" of their sales team to drive promotion and sales of their products/solutions. Splunk will be competing with many vendors for the ""mindshare"" of AWS reps.Splunk has painted a rosy picture of its cloud business. But I believe it is likely not to perform or grow with the strength or robustness that has been communicated. It may not be sustainable over the long term.Given all the risks I have pointed out in this article, I was curious to explore insider trading activity for Splunk. In effect, I wondered if there were any patterns that might imply insiders are concerned about risk. I looked at activity from April 2012 (the month Splunk stock first traded) through today, using data from openinsider.com.I found that:In regard to the first bullet, we all know insiders usually acquire shares via grants/options. So, the fact that no insiders made any open exchange purchases might strike investors as a ""nothing to see here nothing-burger."" Still, if these insiders believe so strongly in the company's opportunity and prospects, one might expect to see at least some open market share purchases. In regard to the second bullet, it is obviously common for insiders to enter into predefined disposition plans. But that's not to say that an insider has to enter into a disposition plan. Again, assuming there's strong belief in the company's long-term opportunity, why enter into an aggressive disposition plan in the first place?Splunk's stock price over the last 12 months has reflected an almost cult-like enthusiasm from investors and analysts:Source: InveyoFrankly, it would not surprise me to see the stock continue to test new highs throughout the remainder of the calendar year. But I believe such price movements would be entirely disconnected from the underlying business and associated risks.I believe Splunk's market opportunity and ongoing operating structure may not be as viable as offered by the company and analysts alike. Further, many analysts, particularly those on the FY '18 earnings call and participating during the Splunk's Analyst Day, seem to lack a willingness to truly challenge the company on points discussed in this article. Consequently, major risks are not - in my view - being properly discussed and analyzed by the investment community.Lastly, I'm troubled by the company's presentation of non-GAAP operating margin results during its Analyst Day which I felt was misleading. It suggests to me that ongoing operating performance may be at risk.With current market conditions for the tech sector overwhelmingly bullish, a bearish voice is likely to be drowned out rather quickly. So, I expect much of what I have laid out here to be entirely ignored. Nonetheless, for the small minority of Splunk investors looking beyond price momentum, I urge you to be cautious."
4177448,22148,2018-05-26T12:11:44-04:00,Spunk reported another strong quarter as revenues smashed estimates.The intelligence platform saw sales growth dip below 30% after years of growth exceeding 40%.The key EV/S multiple has expanded to a rich multiple.,"Despite some solid results, Splunk (SPLK) dipped 5% to close the week. The stock had nearly doubled in the last year, sending a key metric to a level where the recent stock rally probably runs out of gas. At $110, Splunk isn't the bargain it was last August when my thesis was bullish despite analysts rushing to raise price targets.Source: Splunk websiteAs 2017 played out, Splunk was facing the stock killing trend of decelerating revenue growth. The FQ1'17 report last May saw the operations intelligence firm produce what's normally impressive revenue growth at 30%, yet the amount was a huge deceleration from the 40% growth in all of the previous quarters as a public company.The ability to produce growth that accelerated to 37% by FQ4 is what pushed the stock to double in the last nine months. Watching that revenue growth dip down to a low of 28.5% despite a big $14 million beat is what hit the stock on Friday.SPLK data by YChartsA small guide up for the next quarter still leaves revenue growth below the 28.5% range of FQ1 and even the typical beat probably places growth at a similar rate in FQ2. So clearly, the above chart highlights how Splunk historically trades flat to down when growth decelerates and soars when growth rebounds.The market dynamics remain positive and the addition of Phantom makes for a compelling product suite. The company can now use the intelligence platform to predict outages and security breaches and trigger the provisioning or rebooting of troublesome servers to avoid the related issue.One can envision Splunk reaching a level where revenue growth is more consistent going forward as not many firms are able to sustain growth in excess of 30%, but revenues in the 20% range are much more manageable.The financials are improving as Splunk generated $74 million in free cash flow during Q1. A business is a lot more attractive when the company can generate cash each day it's open for business.The intelligence platform is only expected to produce earnings of $1 per share this year, but the story is much more about cash flows. FQ1 saw free cash flows nearly double from the $36 million produced in the same period last year.Even if free cash flows this fiscal year double from the $242 million generated last year, the stock trades at about 32x an estimated free cash flow of $500 million. My favorite metric to valuing growth stocks is the EV/S multiple. This multiple accounts for tech stocks not maximizing profits in the short term while revenues provide the base for producing further cash flows and profits when the company finally leverages growth.The EV/S multiple indicated that Splunk was long overdue for a rally back in 2017 and now indicates that the stock is possibly running on fumes. Splunk has seen the multiple nearly double to 7.8x forward sales estimates.SPLK EV to Revenues (Forward 1y) data by YChartsWith the bullish analysts' target hikes to $125-plus, the stock approaches a multiple of 9x sales. The desire to own the stock diminishes at that level.The key investor takeaway is that Splunk has soared mostly due to multiple expansion and now faces decelerating growth again. There really isn't much to dislike about the business other than the valuation. The stock likely heads back to the all-time highs, but the setup isn't that appealing as the market cap reaches $18 billion and sales won't reach $2 billion until next year."
4198743,104662,2018-08-14T09:15:08-04:00,"Splunk shouldn't be compared to other analytical tools, as their business model suggests higher potential.With Splunk's core offerings already having access to machine data, their additional products offer customers easy to use tools and quick integration.This creates a barrier of entry for other SaaS companies, as Splunk can offer their large customer base similar solutions all from one vendor.However, unless Splunk begins seeing more success through their additional services, their revenue growth will not support their high valuation.Splunk's ability to integrate their IoT offering could provide high revenue growth and be the next step in offering machine data solutions.","There are many names in the enterprise software industry. With companies specializing in areas such as security, authentication, analytics, cloud computing, middleware etc. investors that do not have a firm understanding of how IT infrastructure or data pipelines are set up fall into a generalization trap. I believe this is the case for Splunk (SPLK). Most articles explain that Splunk is an analytics tool, but this is a gross simplification. Comparing Splunk’s offerings with something like R Studio does Splunk a great disservice. I plan to explain how Splunk fits into an organization and where they are heading in the future, so that investors can avoid generalizations about Splunk, while also creating a better understanding of what risks are most feasible and understand how Splunk differentiates itself.Splunk’s origin was as a log analysis tool. Logs are basically data that are thrown from an application, machine, or device, that explain what the program is doing, and creates a list of messages that are stored in a file. Logs can be thought of as messages that a machine creates to explain what it is doing. Splunk served as a log analysis tool, which uses these machine-generated logs, breaks it down and organizes it, and gives IT employees a way to search through logs to find, for example, causes of an error, detect when a machine is acting differently than expected, or to determine if there is a possibility of a data breach.Source: Splunk Workshop (Presentation)The main takeaway for investors is that Splunk is used to read, organize, and analyze machine-generated data. Most analytics tools that would want to do this would require a user to import the data, clean, sparse, organize, then begin running different query searches or performing analysis techniques etc. Splunk’s products can be used this way, but Splunk was created to organize machine data to allow users to better interact with their programs.Splunk’s niche focus and easy implementation capabilities allowed them to quickly become a staple in many organizations. From their most recent 10-K, Splunk currently serves over 15,000 customers, and over 85 of the Fortune 100 companies. Splunk already has a large customer base, where they have become established within their customer’s operations, causing employees to have experience coding and using Splunk’s products to the point where a customer would suffer high-switching costs to move to a competitor. This has allowed Splunk to survive several similar offerings and open-source competitors hoping to gain some market share.Establishing the large customer base is part of what can be considered Splunk’s early mover advantage (arguably first mover). The second part is the data. Splunk is connected to their customer’s data logs already, allowing Splunk to already have data pipelines in place. Because of their core offering having access to all of the machine data, Splunk has been able to generate more creative uses of the data through additional offerings; giving customers an easy way to incorporate advanced machine learning techniques and AI capabilities for their organization.Of course, investors are looking for future revenue growth, not past growth. With an already large customer base, Splunk needs to provide a path to increase the revenue generated from their current customers in order to justify their valuation. Splunk has taken an ambitious path, providing features that bring value in areas such as predictive analytics, internet of things (IoT) communication, cloud computing, security, and data privacy, among others.Source: Splunk (presentation)Splunk does offer a machine learning platform called Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit, which offers users a nice API for machine learning models, along with incorporating Python code. This is a nice product offering, but this is used more as a defensive add-on, meaning that it is offered to ensure there are no obvious gaps in their ecosystem, preventing someone like Alteryx (AYX) to easily steal market share.Although the toolkit offers more user freedom to enter code directly, I believe the better value adding products (and the ones investors should focus on) are what I consider “insight focused"" analytics products. By this, I am referring to tools that are created for a single purpose. This allows Splunk to create products with a user friendly UI/UX for users that aren’t data scientists, versus something like their toolkit with needs more input and manipulation from the user. Providing these focused add-ons not only create several revenue generating options but also can help which lower overall costs, as a company can now have a cyber security analyst use a product such as Splunk Insights for Ransomware versus needing to outsource this to a data scientist in the analytics department.The two main capabilities Splunk is adding are through operations (infrastructure machinery, cloud computing, business intelligence) and security (threat detection, ransomware, authentication). Splunk has now expanded beyond their origins of log analysis, creating a cloud offering and IT service management tool, among others. The important distinction here, which will lead me to their biggest growth driver in the future, is that all of these capabilities come from their ability to organize and understand machine data. This is why their newest offering, Splunk Industrial Asset Intelligence, could be the big move investors have been looking for.Although not yet released, Splunk will likely set up this offering similarly to their other products. This would mean that once Splunk is integrated with the machine data that machines such as wearables, utilities, automobiles, industrial tools etc. produce constantly, a company would then be able to use Splunk’s IoT offering to have a dashboard specifically focused on how these machines release data. This dashboard will likely also be able to monitor all the different items and products that make up systems such as a connected plant, building, car, or battery, and create workflows that allow a centralized way to analyze and troubleshoot potential problems. This offering could also help create new data flows that allow something like different parts of a plant to have the ability to send data to each other.With Splunk already a staple in many organizations, their niche in handling machine data have allowed them to continuously increase their value additions. With IoT capabilities growing, and the ability to connect more and more objects to a cloud, Splunk has the foundations built to fully take advantage of the growing IoT trend and offer an easy to implement, specific IoT offering.The main competitive advantage Splunk has is what I earlier labeled “insight based"" analytics tools. This is a big differentiator between Splunk and other analytics software providers that Splunk gets lumped together with. With their core offering of log analysis, Splunk has expanded its machine data reading capabilities to build focused tools that are set up to bring insights on areas such as ransomware. The dashboard and workflows are all built to support this goal, and the customer uses the tool for the purpose of finding new insights. This is different from most analytics tools, as those are what I would consider as “method focused"" tools. Although a data scientist could then use those tools to build a data pipeline to retrieve data from a machine through a variety of cleaning and organizing techniques, those tools are built for users to have the freedom of creating their own models and testing out various machine learning techniques. Although both can be used, Splunk’s ability to provide specific purpose products allow more users to reasonably use the software, versus a product that can only be used by data scientists.Another advantage that allows Splunk to coexist with the mega-cap cloud providers is their excellence in their core offering, log analysis. For the last few years, Gartner, who provides reports covering various IT software vendors for companies, has consistently rated Splunk as a leader (see below). The Gartner reports are well known in IT departments and provide a large influence into which vendor a company may choose. Source: Gartner (available to download through Splunk)Also mentioned above, Splunk’s core offerings are based off of becoming integrated with the company's key data sources. This allows Splunk’s offerings to see less installation and integration time than their competitors due to the data already organized and in their ecosystem.It should also be noted that Splunk has several partnerships with key players in the enterprise architecture industry. Although this does not guarantee there will be no future threats, it is very encouraging to see Amazon (AMZN) choose to create a partnership with Splunk rather than focus on stealing market share. However, both Amazon and Microsoft (MSFT) have analytics tools and log analysis tools that operate within their ecosystem but not an offering that is vendor-neutral. Unlike most other SaaS companies, Splunk already has the market share and data integration established, giving them a nice defense from future competitors.With that said, there is still a risk that one of the cloud vendors attempts to push Splunk out, but this risk might be overstated. Neither Microsoft nor Amazon Web Services has made an active push to start providing vendor-neutral solutions and has rather decided to team up with companies such as Splunk.As with other enterprise companies, Splunk still has to deliver the latest innovations to their consumers. If they are unable to adapt, they will likely see their market share start to decrease. But as mentioned earlier, Splunk does have the early mover advantage, and most IT departments of large enterprises do not have an easy path towards switching vendors, especially one as popular as Splunk.The more serious risks that investors should concern themselves with is growth and pricing. Splunk is still a growth company, yet already has a large customer base, and serves a vast majority of major enterprises. Investors will need to see Splunk increase their revenue per customer in order to justify Splunk’s high valuations. If Splunk is unable to effectively push out their value additions to their core offering, then the share price will suffer.The second one is pricing. Splunk is developing a bad reputation for pricing. As the earlier mentioned Gartner report mentions, “Gartner clients that have implemented Splunk consistently raise concerns about the licensing model and overall cost to implement the solution. Splunk has introduced new licensing approaches, such as the Enterprise Adoption Agreement (EAA) as well as additional license headroom for new users with periodic license true-ups, to address these concerns.” This was also brought up in the latest earnings call, and when asked about pricing, CEO Douglas Merritt said, “Our strategy is to continue to offer different capabilities and make sure that we're pricing them in a way that makes sense based on the value delivered and what other categories of tools that are similar [in] how they [are] price[d] as well.”Simply put, this is not a good sign. Although Splunk has a very large customer base, their reputation for having bad pricing agreements is concerning. If Splunk continues to have negative reactions to how they charge for their services, customers may start considering switching vendors and taking the high-switching cost hit.Also, it should be pointed out that Splunk’s move to machine learning will not be a blue ocean market. There are many analytical tools companies, and if these services can better address the analytical needs of customers, Splunk’s revenue growth will suffer. Splunk will need to leverage their abilities to organize machine data to provide analytical tools, or else a company such as Alteryx could start seeing use cases where data collected in Splunk serves as an input to the Alteryx tool, rather than Splunk creating an end-to-end solution.As stated before, Splunk is a growth company. They currently aren’t profitable on a GAAP basis and aren’t focused on earnings. However, Splunk is FCF positive, which provides relief for investors.Source: Splunk 10-QIn the recent 10-Q, gross margin is above 70%, providing a solid path to profitability for Splunk. But we see the hit to operating margin come from the high sales and marketing and R&D costs. Total revenue for the quarter was $311.6 million, leading to a 27.7% R&D to revenue ratio, which is a respectable amount, as new value offerings will be the key to growth. However, sales and marketing to revenue expense is currently 70%, which is very high. We would expect a company that already serves over 85 of the Fortune 100 companies to see a lower sales and marketing expense. Although the high cost isn’t favorable, investors should expect to see reports of numerous new customers next quarter, and/or a very low churn rate, coupled with successful expansion of revenue generated per contract in order to justify the elevated expense.With the business model analysis complete, and a quick look at the negative earnings, we will move on to a relative valuation. For this, I will compare Splunk to Alteryx, Box (BOX), Tableau (DATA), and ServiceNow (NOW).It appears Splunk is fairly priced based on current valuation. The P/S ratio, while high, is not out of line with other SaaS growth companies, and even though the P/CF value is below average, this is heavily influenced by Alteryx's ratio. When you add in revenue growth as well, there’s a suggestion of slight undervaluation relative to their peers, but not enough to justify an undervalued thesis.Although when compared to their peers, Splunk doesn't stand out, all of these companies have a very high price relative to their revenue and cash flow, and the enterprise software sector might be considered overvalued as a whole despite the high sales growth, providing a cautious signal to investors.Their projected revenue growth doesn’t provide a relative undervaluation opportunity either, with expected growth to be less than 30%.Source: Splunk (Presentation)With this said, Splunk is seeing some good projections for future valuation purposes.Source: Splunk (Presentation)Subscription revenue growth is a positive sign for Splunk. Subscription revenues typically mean revenue stability, as these subscriptions typically are multi-year contracts, as well as generate high-switching costs. The operating margin is non-GAAP. The last quarter saw an operating margin of -39%, but a non-GAAP margin of only -4.7%, which is attributed mainly to stock-based compensation and related employer payroll tax. Investors would still like to see positive GAAP earnings, but a non-GAAP operating margin of 14% would be a nice boost in value with the estimated revenue growth. But with all this said, there is no evidence of Splunk being undervalued, nor overvalued.I believe that Splunk hasn’t had a fair analysis of the unique opportunities its business model presents and has suffered from comparisons to other analytical tools. Although there is no suggestion of Splunk being undervalued, I am bullish on their opportunity to capitalize on the growing IoT industry. With a history of being able to organize and read machine data, I believe Splunk will be a solid growth investment over the next several years, as their high large enterprise customer rate gives them a nice customer base that will be protected with high switching costs. In addition, partnerships with several big vendors including Amazon, and no evidence of cloud providers making serious efforts to provide vendor neutral offerings, I believe Splunk has a limited risk from these types of competitors.Splunk is the market leader, and with customers having to go through several obstacles to change vendors, their market share should be relatively protected. Although there is not a good entry point as of now, I believe that Splunk’s business model will allow them to succeed in the growing IoT industry and provide high revenue growth rates for the foreseeable future, as they continue to provide value adding offerings for their large customer base. I believe that relative to their peers, Splunk provides a good growth opportunity, but I believe investors should remain cautious with several enterprise software companies having high valuations relative to their fundamentals.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

4152951,103480,2018-03-03T08:04:28-05:00,"Splunk shares rose >10% and broke $100 for the first time after reporting Q4 earnings.Revenue growth accelerated yet again to 37% y/y, up from 34% y/y in Q3 (which in itself was already an acceleration from Q2).Cash flow also saw healthy growth, and the company smashed earnings and guidance targets.Demand for data and data services is ramping and doesn't look like it will taper down anytime soon.Despite all the positive signals, shares look fairly valued at 8x forward revenues.","I learned a lesson the hard way when I let go of my Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) shares in the fall of last year, missing out on a broad rally that could have taken my position 30-40% higher. And as I looked at Splunk's Q4 report, I'm kicking myself even more as the stock raced ahead to $100. There's no doubt about it: this company has emerged into the spotlight this year as a huge winner.The bullish story is very evident in Splunk's growth numbers. For some context - Splunk is guiding to a midpoint of $1.625 billion in revenues for the next year, a huge scale that precious few software companies ever reach (I'll caveat this by saying that Splunk is still primarily a license company versus pure SaaS, so it's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison with the other high-growing software companies in the market). At Splunk's current scale, it's within spitting distance of other software heavyweights like Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) at ~$2 billion in revenues and ServiceNow (NASDAQ: NOW) with ~$2.6 billion. This is, for sure, the upper echelon of software companies that have ""made it"" into the big leagues.And despite this scale, Splunk is still growing well north of 30% and accelerating revenues quarter after quarter. Nothing else says success like posting these kinds of numbers.Furthermore, the demand backdrop for Splunk's services is extremely robust. Companies are scrambling to make themselves more data-driven (or at least appear that way in front of their customers and shareholders). Some companies pay hefty subscription license fees to the likes of Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR) for access to their data feeds. What Splunk allows you to do is much better - it gives you access to your own data (the ""machine data"" generated automatically by all your connected endpoints), which is much more relevant and hits closer to home than a third-party data source. Even if it took Splunk a while to capitalize on this mass-market shift toward intensive data consumption, it's certainly benefiting from the enterprise world's data-hungry trends now.All this strength - a fantastic narrative plus the actual quarterly results to back it - has been strong justification in seeing Splunk's stock nearly double over the last year. And certainly, looking at Splunk's above-consensus guidance for FY19, the company shows no signs of slowing down.But at this point, investors do have to ask themselves if Splunk's valuation can hold. With the stock trading at ~8x forward revenues, it's not the most expensive software stock in the market (Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Workday (NYSE: WDAY) still trade 1-2 turns higher), but it doesn't have much more room on the upside either.SPLK EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAt current levels, Splunk is a hold. Investors might also want to consider locking in gains. It's nearly without question that the company will continue to outperform against Wall Street's targets, but whether or not the stock can continue to outperform the broader market when it's already been such a steady riser over the past year remains to be seen.The biggest takeaway from Splunk's fourth-quarter results (see earnings summary below) goes no further than the headline number. Revenues accelerated once again, growing a mind-boggling 37% y/y to $419.7 million. This stacks up extremely well against analyst consensus of $390.9 million, or 28% y/y growth, with a nine-point beat to expectations.Figure 1. Splunk Q4 resultsSource: Splunk earnings press releaseWhen a company gets to this size, the earnings surprises and the beat margins naturally tend to condense into smaller numbers. You can see that with the likes of software giants like Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) - it has beat almost every quarter that it's been a public company, but as Salesforce moves to the ~$10 billion scale (about 6x Splunk's size), its quarterly beat margins have gotten slimmer. Part of this is because analysts have gotten used to what to expect from the company, and part of it is because it becomes progressively harder to chase growth once you approach saturation in your market.That also leads to a second point - the fact that Splunk accelerated growth atop this massive scale is truly impressive - not just in this quarter, but last quarter as well. When a big company like Splunk shows acceleration on the top line, Wall Street's models (which always bake in deceleration) get thrown off course, causing high estimate revisions and an ensuing rally in the stock.So certainly, the growth is there. The primary argument in this thesis, however, is that at 8x revenues, that outperformance is likely already baked in. On the converse side of this situation, if Splunk were ever to miss expectations, its high valuation would take a nasty tumble.Splunk has also done an excellent job at trimming its losses, with GAAP operating loss slimming down to a mere -$23.9 million (a -5.7% operating margin, basically breakeven) versus an operating margin of -23% in 4Q17.What I especially liked seeing was the fact that the company's general and administrative costs actually went down despite the company's growth, with Splunk shaving off ~$5 million of its cost structure to end at $47.6 million in general overhead for Q4. When companies are growing, executives usually tend to use that as a wide permit for freewheeling headcount additions and excess luxuries. The general and administrative spend as a percentage of revenues will tick down by a few points year over year, but won't really move the needle by much. And unlike spending on R&D or sales and marketing, general and administrative spending has little correlation with actual growth. With Splunk, however, it showed immense discipline to down its percentage of general and administrative spending to just 11% of revenues, down from 17% in 4Q17.This, combined with additional efficiencies realized in sales and marketing, were the major drivers behind the huge margin improvements. The company's pro forma EPS of $0.37 also beat analyst expectations of $0.33 by a healthy (>10%) amount. Based on the upside guidance for FY19, even though Splunk doesn't specifically guide to the bottom line for the full year, we could see Splunk hit breakeven on a GAAP basis at some point in FY19.Cash flow, as usual, was another big plus for Splunk. The company's operating cash flows grew 42% y/y to $173.5 million for the fourth quarter. Netting out $6.6 million of capex, Splunk's free cash flow was $166.9 million, nearly doubling from $84.4 million in the prior year (though the last-year comp was colored by a seemingly accelerated capex schedule). All told, though Splunk generates a highly respectable 20% FCF margin - though we do also note that as a license company that bills a lot upfront, it's not a perfect comparison against software companies that have a more spread-out subscription billings schedule.Splunk's growth engine is undeniable, and the coming years will see even greater tailwinds for Splunk as it capitalizes on strong demand for data-oriented infrastructure software. Application software names like Salesforce and Workday are still showing robust growth, but they play in much more competitive circles than Splunk does. Within machine data, Splunk is nearly the only game in town.All this, however, seems to be fully baked into Splunk's stock price at >$100, leaving little room for value-conscious investors to find a bargain in the stock. Wall Street may sing its praises for Splunk, but valuation does place a real ceiling on hot stocks like this. At best, Splunk is a hold - this is not a name I would chase as it's going up."
4125896,103480,2017-11-17T09:15:38-05:00,"Splunk reported its best quarter in recent memory, with 34% y/y growth in Q3, an acceleration over Q2's growth rate of 32%.For a company expected to pull in ~$1.25 billion in revenue this year, acceleration is truly commendable.Guidance also received a meaningful bump, as Splunk expects a strong Q4 and introduced FY19 guidance above consensus, sending shares up to new 52-week highs.Now trading closer to ~6.5x revenues, Splunk's valuation is probably reaching its cap.Software companies in the ~6.5-7x range tend to be pure cloud SaaS companies with recurring subscription revenues. Splunk, which primarily sells on-prem licenses, doesn't fall in this category.","Investors thought Q2 was a huge win for Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), a beat-and-raise that sent shares from a $60 range (where it had traded in a range-bound pattern for months) to the high $60s. Now, an even bigger beat in Q3 has sent Splunk rallying to new highs near $80 in post-market trading.SPLK data by YChartsIt's been a good year to be a Splunk investor, as seen in the chart above. Splunk has returned ~50% year to date, outpacing both the broader S&P 500 as well as the technology sector. The company had been in a rut for most of 2015 and 2016, as software investors preferred to load up on cloud names like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). A string of strong earnings in 2017, however, has put Splunk back in vogue.With the stock pushing toward multi-year highs, at a market cap of ~$11 billion and trading at ~6.6x EV/FTM revenues, however, it's time to take a step back and think about taking profits on the trade. While I wish I had held on to Splunk until now (instead of selling post-Q2), I wouldn't be holding past this point.As a reminder, Splunk is a provider of a software platform that analyzes machine data - data that's automatically generated by activity on devices and computers. Splunk is one of the only - and certainly the largest - vendor in this space, with a large portion of the use cases in detection of cybersecurity risks.Still, however, the majority of Splunk's business model revolves around selling licenses for the software as opposed to SaaS-style subscriptions, which often raises doubts about the sustainability of its revenue base.Splunk posted revenues of $328.7 million in Q3, up 34% y/y, a huge beat over analyst consensus of $309.2 million (+26% y/y) as well as its own guidance of $307-309 million. Notably, the company's growth rate of 34% represented a slight acceleration over Q2's growth rate of 32% - and at Splunk's massive revenue scale, even holding the growth rate steady is impressive; acceleration of any magnitude is a true accomplishment.Figure 1. Splunk Q3 revenue resultsSource: Splunk earnings press releaseBillings results were equally impressive, with total billings of $381.6 million, up 38% y/y. The fact that billings growth is outpacing revenue growth by a healthy amount is a strong indicator of Splunk's pipeline. The company also added 450 new customers in the quarter.Splunk also made massive improvements in its margins, shrinking its losses down to near breakeven. As seen in the chart below, Splunk has cut all components of operating spend as a percentage of revenues:Source: Author-created chart; data from public filingsWhile the drop in R&D (both as a percentage of revenue and in absolute dollars; R&D spending was $85.6 million in 3Q16 versus $74.1 million in 3Q17) isn't necessarily a completely positive indicator, it's the major contributor to Splunk's increased profitability.Overall, GAAP net losses slimmed to -$50.6 million, a vast improvement over a loss of $93.5 million in 3Q16. Pro forma EPS of $0.17 (which adds back stock comp and one-time items) beat analyst consensus of $0.14.Guidance was the other big highlight coming out of Q3. For FY18 (the current fiscal year ending January), Splunk raised its revenue guidance to $1.239-1.241 billion, implying 31% y/y growth at the midpoint and $20 million ahead of analyst consensus of $1.22 billion. This new guidance range is up roughly $30 million on both ends from the guidance range originally given in Q2 of $1.210 billion to $1.215 billion.Billings guidance also went up to $1.485 billion from the $1.45 billion figure given in the prior quarter.Splunk also released FY19 guidance for the first time, allowing analysts to recalibrate their models and pencil in tighter estimates for FY19. Splunk is calling for revenue of $1.55 billion in FY19, implying 25% y/y growth next year relative to its new guidance of $1.24 billion in FY18. Consensus had only called for $1.52 billion.While the consensus figure represents 23% y/y growth over Splunk's FY18 guidance of $1.24 billion, it represents 25% y/y growth over consensus FY18 guidance of $1.22 billion - so it seems both Splunk and Wall Street had agreed that it would grow at 25% next year; it's just that Splunk pulled in early upside into the fourth quarter of FY18.With the full view of 4Q18 and FY19 guidance, it's also instructive to step back and take a look at Splunk's growth trajectory. The company grew at 42% y/y in FY17, is expected to grow 31% in FY18 as it closes out Q4, and introduced guidance that calls for 25% y/y growth in FY19. Clearly, Splunk is decelerating its growth on the top line - though, at its ~$1.5 billion scale, that's to be expected.Yes, the numbers are good. It's the best quarter the company has seen in a while, and, if I may be a bit of a pessimist, it might be the best quarter Splunk will have in the foreseeable future. Given Splunk's guidance range that points to 31% and 25% growth in FY18 and FY19, respectively, it can be assumed that the company's sequential acceleration this quarter was a one-time deal.Recall that Splunk relies heavily on license deals in its business model, and license deals, especially the large seven-figure deals, are extremely lumpy from quarter to quarter. While Splunk did achieve commendable outperformance this quarter, it's not necessarily upside that can be sustained into the next quarter - unlike with steady subscription companies, where big new deal signings can guarantee a stable and expanding revenue stream in relative perpetuity.Based on the risk of heightened expectations for Splunk in the wake of an excellent quarter that it might not be able to replicate, it's probably time to cash in on gains and sit out until a pullback brings the stock to more reasonable levels.Splunk's post-earnings spike has sent the company to a ~$11 billion market cap and ~$10 billion enterprise value, putting it at a 6.3x EV/FY19 revenues multiple based on its new FY19 guidance of $1.55 billion. This puts Splunk right in line with other mid-/large-cap software names, as shown below:CRM EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsSplunk's stock is no longer undervalued and already prices in the outperformance it's achieved this quarter as well as the above-consensus guidance for FY19. While its technology leadership and unique positioning in machine data analysis make it an indispensable piece of software that will never tumble the way Tableau (NYSE:DATA), a BI company with plenty of competitors, did in 2015, valuation will probably cap the company's gains in the short term."

Both its short- and long-term price action looks very strong with positive investor momentum.After a number of analyst upgrades the past few months, SPLK has jumped nearly 25%. On its daily chart, the stock looks to be trending higher at a steady trajectory. On its monthly chart, SPLK is emerging from a multi-year base pattern consolidating between $40 and $75. Should the stock continue higher and break out of its current consolidation on solid fundamental backing, its share price could run past $100 in coming years based on its current volatility profile.SPLK is a quickly expanding growth company that is beginning to hit its stride, and for this reason, investor sentiment should persist, leading its share price higher.Source: Trading ViewSPLK has had a lot of success generating returns for shareholders in recent quarters as it both improves overall operations as well as wins new projects.In its most recent quarter, SPLK generated revenues totaling $329 million, a 34% increase over Q3 of last year, according to management. Total billings came in at $382 million, up 38% over last year. Cloud revenues totaled $24.4 million, and overall software revenues, which include license and cloud revenue, grew 34% year-over-year.Growth in all regions drove both its performance and share price higher following the release of its results. Management has continuously stated that the key to long-term growth is customer success remaining its top priority and adoption of its platform. Over the quarter, SPLK added more than 450 new customers, recording 581 orders over $100,000. Management also had this to say about new business:Growing cloud orders is a positive sign for this business as it continues to expand its higher margin operations. The company also had steady international success recently. Over the last quarter, international operations represented 24% of total revenues, consistent with previous levels and comparable on a year-over-year basis.An interesting aspect of the company's earnings calls are the anecdotal discussions of projects won over previous quarters. Projects won are becoming more complex and highlighting SPLK's future potential as well as growth outlook into new industries.During the quarter, SPLK won business from the Smithsonian Institution, who upgraded its use of its services to improve threat detection and mitigation across its world-famous museums and research centers.In an unrelated industry, Daimler (OTCPK:DMLRY), the German automotive group, signed a multi-terabyte deal to replace its legacy SIEM with Enterprise and ES. The group will use SPLK as its nerve center for security, providing insights across the entire organization.Collectively, SPLK continues to use its services across a number of fields, signaling that major growth potential in coming years. Below is a chart of SPLK's revenue and earnings per share [EPS] over the last few years.What is seen on the chart is that revenue has expanded very quickly, roughly tenfold from 2012 to present day. As with many growth companies, profits are elusive at first. EPS declines look to have bottomed though over the last year and are headed higher. The combination of both revenue and EPS growth should fuel its share price higher in coming years.A way to play long-term growth in SPLK is by using longer-dated out-of-the-money call options. Specifically, I am looking at the January 2019 strike of 125 call option, trading at $1.70 currently.This allows me to speculate on long-term growth in the company as it breaks out of a multi-year base pattern with strong fundamental support. If the price doesn't look to be approaching the $125 level with roughly 30-60 days left until expiration, the position can be sold to salvage its time premium. If the call is in the money, however, it is fine to simply let it run into expiration and either cash settle in the end, or take delivery of the stock.Remember that when trading options, it is possible to lose full principle, so weight the position accordingly.Source: Think or SwimSPLK is trending higher on strong fundamental support. Its share price is breaking out of a multi-year consolidation pattern. Fundamentally, the company is expanding its operations, winning new business, as well as growing its top- and bottom-line. Using long-dated, out-of-the-money call options could be a low-risk, high-reward way to play this move."
4103862,103480,2017-09-03T21:08:00-04:00,"Splunk reported a beat-and-raise Q2, with revenue of $280 million (+32% y/y) smashing estimates of $269 million.Shares are up >10% post earnings, inching closer to 52-week highs.The run-up has left Splunk shares slightly overvalued at 6x forward revenues, as the stock has struggled to maintain a multiple in excess of 5.5x-6x for too long.Due to the largely on-prem nature of its software, the company's revenues are less recurring and thus less valuable than those of its cloud peers, leading to its multiple discount.Its technological advantage in machine data management, however, is not to be underestimated; but a better entry point is in the low $60s.","Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a valuable investment for two reasons: first, it's one of the only value names in software, meaning it's trading at reasonable multiples and is actually generating positive cash flow; and second, because it is a unique technology asset that isn't easily replicated by would-be competitors. Splunk's Q2 affirmed the latter, showing a company that is still ballooning with customers and expanding deployments. The post-quarter run-up in the stock, however, leaves current longs at risk of a correction in the stock.SPLK data by YChartsSplunk has traded in a range-bound fashion since the beginning of 2017. Each time the stock has tried for a rally, it's fallen back to $60 or slightly below, never able to break out meaningfully beyond this range. Post Q2, Splunk bulls saw an opportunity for an extended breakout, sending shares up from $60 to $67, but I believe this rally will be short-lived.Splunk is seen in the market as a value play, so it must be traded that way: when the stock is on the way down, not up. I'm a huge supporter of the company in the long term, but believe a better entry point lies in the low $60s or high $50s, where the stock has continually found support after pulling back from sudden rallies.In Q2, Splunk reported $280 million on the top line, up 32% y/y, smashing analyst estimates calling for $269 million by 6 points (+26% y/y). Maintenance and services revenue contributed to the lion's share of the growth, increasing 41% to $137 million - nearly half of total revenues. This revenue line is less valuable, as it's more one-time in nature.The company outperformed on the bottom line as well. Operating loss came in at -$82 million, or a -29% operating margin - much better than -39% in the year-ago quarter. OCF also ticked up to $23 million in Q2, up from $18 million in the prior year.Management also raised its guidance for fiscal 2018, calling for $1.21-1.215 billion in revenues and $1.45 billion in billings, up from prior guidance of $1.195 billion and $1.425 billion, respectively.Investors cheered this quarter's victories, sending the stock up from $60 to $67, its first meaningful move upward in months. But is the move deserved?Even post rally, Splunk certainly looks cheap on a revenue multiples basis, which is how all high-growth software companies are valued. Below is a look at how Splunk's valuation stacks up against other software companies growing in the ~20-30% bucket.WDAY EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWith a valuation in the mid-6s, Splunk (shown by the red line) certainly seems like a reasonable play. Like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), the company is generating strong operating cash flow, yet is trading nowhere near their multiples.But be careful in taking these relative extrapolations too far. Recall that Splunk, unlike the majority of its cloud brethren, generates the majority of its revenues from on-prem licenses and maintenance fees (nearly half of revenues, as previously discussed). Its revenue stream is much less reliable, much less profitable, and much more prone to erratic spikes and customer defections than long-term SaaS contracts.A beat in revenue one quarter may easily slip into a disappointment the next, as one-time big deals and maintenance fees can pump one quarter's earnings and leave the next dry. This is why Splunk's revenues are valued at lesser multiples than SaaS companies. And while it does earn SaaS-style subscription revenues from its Splunk Cloud (basically the hosted version of its flagship Splunk Enterprise product), most customers are still deploying Splunk in their own datacenter and paying for perpetual licenses on a volume basis of data consumed.Perpetual licenses are no longer á la mode in the software world - indeed, investors have sold off shares of on-prem companies in droves, flocking to cloud companies and pumping them with high valuations. And with the new accounting standard ASC 606 ramping up in implementation, the problem will be exacerbated for the company: more of its license revenues will be recognized upfront, while the ratably recognized portion gets diminished. Investors will see Splunk's revenues as even more transactional and one-time in nature, and will value the revenue stream even less than they do today.When Splunk trades at a valuation above pure cloud companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), caution must be taken. Salesforce is more profitable, more recurring, and much better capitalized than Splunk - eventually, the market will correct valuations to their means.Despite being currently overheated in the market, Splunk is still a unique technology play. It's the undisputed leader in machine data management, perfectly aligned to the Big Data theme that's taking over the enterprise IT community. Every business wants to squeeze usable information out of its massive untapped pools of data, and Splunk is one of the only solutions that can take millions of bytes of machine-generated data and communicate remarkable insights to business leaders, not just CIOs.As covered in this SA article, Splunk is also valuable as an acquisition play, as many legacy technology providers look to innovative software companies to save their portfolio of declining applications. The rumor that's rung the loudest is a takeover by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which easily has enough cash ($70 billion as of Q2) to buy out Splunk's $9.5 billion market cap with a generous premium. Splunk's IT monitoring capabilities, extremely useful for churning insights out of enterprise datacenters, certainly makes for a good tack-on feature for Cisco's legacy networking and server products.Don't forsake Splunk - it's a fantastic IT application with few, if any, clones, and many bigger companies are salivating at the chance to wield this unique asset. But the stock is prone to quick ups and downs, and gains can be made by trading the stock as it moves sideways. For now, wait until the stock returns to the low $60s before initiating a position. With few catalysts on the horizon, the risks to the downside are much more pronounced than risks to the upside."
4163281,98236,2018-04-16T13:32:01-04:00,"Splunk has deepened and broadened its competitive advantage in both Security Information and in several adjacent spaces.Splunk continues to noticeably expand its TAM through substantial investment in ""adjacencies"" that allow its customers to do more and achieve actionable results leveraging their data.The company has started to leverage its scale and competitive positioning with noticeable increases in GAAP operating margins.The company's guidance likely continues to significantly under-forecast its growth rate and profit generation potential.The company's operating cash flow is rising at impressive rates and should continue to do so as the company scales.","For those unfamiliar with the term, ""spelunking"" means the exploration of caves. Splunk (SPLK) the company, is focused on exploring the caves of data that are created by modern big-data applications. It is the clear leader in that space and its lead has continued to extend, despite a significant number of smaller and larger competitors.It has been about 10 months since I last wrote about Splunk. At that point the shares had been underperforming, seemingly forever. In the next 9 months, the shares appreciated by as much as 88%, and even after a pull-back, they still stand 77% higher than they were last June. Obviously, part of that run had to do with the market for tech stocks. The IGV software index has increased by 26% over the same period. But the alpha that investors have earned in Splunk shares is not inconsiderable.Why the substantial outperformance? It is rather simple, actually. Splunk has been able to find the Elysian Fields for hyper-growth businesses in which growth re-accelerates and margins start to rise as well. Last quarter, in fact, saw revenues grow by 37% and billings grow by 44%. That compares to growth of 34% in revenues, and 38% in bookings for the full year. Even margins rose, with GAAP operating margins rising from negative 23% in fiscal Q4 of 2017 (ended 1/31) to negative 6% in this past quarter the quarter.And needless to say, the company raised its guidance for both revenues and margins for the current fiscal year (2019 fiscal year ends 1/31). That said, Splunk's growth projections show the same relative compression that had been the case last June. Even in the wake of the company's new and increased forecast, the First Call consensus calls for just 28% growth this current fiscal year, falling to 25% growth in fiscal 2020.Part of that growth rate deceleration has to do with the adoption of ASC 606. I do not think it is either appropriate or necessary, in terms of handicapping the outlook for the shares to have a full-blown discussion of ASC 606. Simply put, the new accounting standard will mandate that the company recognize revenues from multi-year transactions somewhat sooner than might otherwise be the case, while deferring commission expense, until it is matched with revenue recognition.For example, the current First Call consensus for Q1 revenues is about $300 million, and in the First Call presentation that actually looks like growth of 23%. But when the company restates its Q1 2018 for ASC 606 it will wind up deferring some revenues that had previously been recognized in Q1 and the apples to apples growth rate, consistent with company guidance will go to 33%.Most published estimates for this company are based on company guidance which has a lengthy history of erring on the side of caution. I am not sure, for example, if the $2 billion goal this company has set for 2020 revenues is more than just a goal, which is something meant to be substantially different than a specific forecast. There is no specific reason to believe that if the company achieves growth on an apples to apples basis in the range of 35% this year-and that seems a reasonable place to start an estimate-that the growth it will achieve next year will compress by 1000 basis points. It is the nature of most forecasts to show reversion to the mean-it is part of what analysts do when they prepare multi-year forecasts for companies that are operating in new areas. But the details of this company's increasing TAM do not suggest that its growth will compress materially.In addition to the adoption of ASC 606, it should be noted, that Splunk, as is the case for many IT companies, is in the midst of a transition to subscription and cloud revenues. Last year, subscription revenues were 48% of the total and they are now forecast to be 65% this year and 75% in FY 2020. These are significant changes and have compressed estimated growth rates. Although the adoption of ASC 606 evens out the effect of these changes to some extent, there has been and will be some growth headwind, not precisely quantified, as the result of this shift in revenue sources to both subscription and the cloud. Management believes that subscription deals, as signed, will be about 2/3rds the size of comparable on-premise contracts, although, of course, this highly dependent on duration. Management's forecast for duration is quite conservative based on the experience of other vendors-but I have no independent view of the likely accuracy of how duration will progress. The cloud service offering alone is estimated to be about 10% of reported revenues next year, and to grow by 70% compared to this year and is likely to see shorter duration agreements.Realistically, there is probably little way that Splunk shares can reprise their performance of the past 10 months. The highest published one-year price target is $123, and while I do not really place much credence in published price targets, Splunk will have to be able to grow its revenues significantly greater than the mid 20% range currently embedded in the First Call consensus, and to exceed current targets for both earnings per share and cash flow growth to see its shares produce much alpha for investors. I think that is likely to be the case, simply because the past 12 months were a prelude to the company's rapid increase in cloud-based offerings and because the company is expanding its TAM at rates faster than its actual revenue or bookings growth. The runway has lengthened, or perhaps put differently, the company has moved its planes to a different set of airports with longer runways.The balance of this article will discuss the initiatives that Splunk has undertaken to increase the size of its market and whether these initiatives have the potential to change the company's growth outlook over the next several months and beyond. Needless to say, I think that will be the case; and therefore, I do believe the current share price pullback, modest thought it may be, and relating as it does more to geo-political concerns than anything substantive, is a decent entry point into the shares. I do not think launching a few dozen missiles over the next few days/weeks is going to lead to a war with Russia and I don't believe that either NAFTA will blow up or that we will have a trade war with the Chinese. These are rightfully topics of great interest to investors, but not ones on which I can give forth more than my personal opinions. I do believe that the IT business environment remains strong, and certainly most companies, almost surely including this one, are going to be able to beat their forecasts and to raise investor expectations.Most people who know Splunk know it as the leader in what is called the SIEM space. (Security Information and Event Management). It has been in the leader's quadrant of Gartner's analysis, seemingly forever. It has loads of visibility and almost always makes it to the shortlist of enterprise buyers of that kind of technology. It offers advanced analytics capabilities, a large ecosystem and a broad set of capabilities. When it comes to SIEM, the company has been and is likely to continue its leadership/dominance of the space. I have linked here to a typical market research study of SIEM shares that shows Splunk with a 61% share of the market. There are very few segments of enterprise software that have that kind of share metric, and in considering potential margins for Splunk it might do well to start with that kind of perspective.The issue for investors is that the SIEM market, as defined by market research analysts, is said to be growing at 12% and its total size is estimated to reach $6 billion by 2021, in the market analysis linked here. Quite clearly, Splunk needs a larger target with a higher growth rate in order to continue deliver strong growth and to achieve the kinds of financial results that would justify its current valuation and a recommendation from me to readers to acquire shares.One key growth driver for Splunk is what it calls Service Intelligence (ITSI). The most recent evolution of ITSI is the development of solutions which provide monitoring and analytics solution powered by AI technology. These solutions provides user with visibility into critical IT and business services. The most recent study of this market, about a year old now, linked here, shows that Splunk with a 28% share of the market. This opportunity is currently a bit more than $3 billion and it is growing at over 30%, with Splunk continuing to gain market share compared to all of its competitors. Splunk's growth in the space, as can be seen in the linked study is about 45%.Another major growth driver for Splunk is the use of its technology with specialized features, in the security space. One of Splunk's more interesting offerings, is called User Behavior Analytics or UBA. This tool allows users to detect anomalous behavior on the part of users, devices and applications. This is a relatively new set of capabilities and it is hard to determine the size of the market opportunity since no one has ever been able to develop this kind of solution. It is just now becoming something measurable and of a size to move the company's growth needle.Splunk recently bought a security vendor called Phantom. Phantom is being bought for $350 million. This is a pretty handsome premium; about a year ago, in a VC financing round, Phantom had been valued at $100 million, post-money. The company provides what is called security automation and orchestration and its solutions will be directly integrated into Splunk's security operations center. A few years ago, Splunk bought a company called Caspida, which had the IP that Splunk used to enter the UBA space.Security is a major growth driver for Splunk and a steadily rising percentage of total revenues. Users can and do use Splunk SIEM solutions as part of a security strategy and over the past several years, security has gone from 20% to 40% of Splunk's total revenue. Splunk has taken its technology and extended it and tweaked it significantly to produce a series of offerings called Splunk Essentials that are used by customers augment their firewalls and other security solutions.Splunk plans to release another offering this year called Waitomo which is going to be used to improve software reliability and is specifically designed to help the company in terms of new account generation. It is easier to use and provides alerts and remediation suggestions. Splunk management believes that accelerating new account wins is the best way the company has to accelerate growth, and this project is a key part of that strategy.Splunk is one of those ultimate ""land and expand stories. Currently, on average, after 5 years, users are monitoring 10X the data and pay Splunk 7X the cost of their initial deployment. That is really the growth flywheel that would appear to be most underestimated by current estimates.Finally, investors ought to note the strength of the Splunk ecosystem. Splunk had a massive order last quarter with AWS and Splunk continues to add AWS integrations. Splunk is deriving a surprising amount of revenue through the AWS marketplace which is driving growth beyond the specific borders of ITSM and IOTA opportunities. Splunk has also partnered with Accenture which has developed a vendor-specific community of practice within their security business. A further major expansion of the ecosystem revenue potential was the major win at NTT Security.I set out to attempt to depict the opportunities that Splunk has to maintain its hyper-growth status through initiatives that are beyond those involved with simply selling ITSM in the enterprise. My conclusion is that the TAM of all of Splunk's opportunities is several times the opportunity within the ITSM space. I am encouraged to see Splunk's market share gains but equally encouraged to see its many new directions. I expect that the company is positioned and run to maintain hyper-growth status for years to come.During the last conference call, company CEO, Doug Merritt, talked about Splunk's opportunities in a way that probably best sums up its [positioning. ""Organizations are increasingly using machine data to provide critical context to transactional data they store in their databases and data warehouses. Splunk's platform is the best solution to enable customers to harness these data sets to gain operational intelligence. There is no other solution on the market today that does what we do, and our customers are gaining more insights from their data than ever before."" Just how valid is that commercial? I will try to provide a few thoughts on that subject below.How much of the commercial above is hype, and how much of it is real is not something that can be easily disposed of in a few sentences or paragraphs. The article linked here provides some backdrop for readers as to why Splunk continues to dominate the market in most areas in which it competes.The latest Gartner report, which was linked earlier in this article, was published at the end of February. Many competitors are listed, (19 by my count) but the company is shown with substantial advantage over most of these enterprises. I do not think it necessary to reprise most of the commentary which is quite straightforward. According to the Gartner report, Splunk has a large ecosystem, it offers advanced analytics, users often move to Splunk Security from other use cases and the company has established itself as the default vendor of solutions in its space.The biggest concern cited, that of license complexity, has been addressed and Enterprise Adoption Agreements are making it far easier for users to consume Splunk. Most of the company's competitors are far smaller, and they focus on just one or two components of the SIEM paradigm and are not really suitable for enterprise deployments.There are, to be sure, some skeptics regarding Splunk's positioning. The latest set of negative commentary came last June, at the nadir of the company's share price. I have linked to one such article that was looked at in Barron's. I don't propose to take this analysis apart; the analyst in question has committed the classic Wall St. sin of raising his price target while retaining his rating. Just a few weeks ago, the analyst in question raised his price-target yet again. The main negative cited by the analyst, pricing in the space, has seemingly been dealt with through the advent of EAA's.There is, and likely will be, significant solution overlap from both open-source and commercial competitors. Splunk is spending over $300 million/year on research and development. That would appear to be enough to provide it with a consistent flow of new and enhanced products. It is also spending over $800 million/year on sales and marketing, again more than enough to provide the company with the visibility and coverage it needs so that it gets up to bat often enough.I am clearly not going to be the final authority on who competes best with Splunk. There are numerous competitive studies and competitive blogs in this space and trying to review them all would not be productive in terms of developing support for an investment thesis. I think the take-away here is that Splunk continues to compete effectively in its space, its solution is improving consistently, and there is nothing new that is likely to disturb the company's competitive positioning in the short term. The Wedbush thesis is interesting, but the facts on the ground the last 10 months or so, simply belie the validity of the thesis.Splunk has rarely been valued as anything other than a hyper-growth enterprise. That still remains the case and the shares have experienced more than their share of volatility to boot. That isn't likely to change either. The shares are somewhat controversial because of valuation concerns, for the most part, with First Call reporting 11 holds within a universe of 42 ratings. Most recently, the shares have seen several upgrades and one positive initiation about a week with a $132 price target, the highest yet published.Splunk currently has a market capitalization of about $15.0 billion. With a current net cash balance of $1.2 billion, its enterprise value is $13.8 billion. First Call's average revenue estimate, which I believe is highly likely to be exceeded, is at $1.63 billion, and that produces an EV/S of 8.6X. Some may say that is high-on the other hand, companies that can achieve growth of 35% or more on a sustainable basis, often trade at such a multiple or even higher. The EV/S ratio perhaps does not represent a fantastic buying level, but neither is it a complete outlier, either.Splunk significantly raised forecast for operating margins on its last conference call and that in turn has led to significant upward revisions to the First Call forecast EPS. Specifically, the company has increased its forecast for operating margin to 11.5% on a non-GAAP basis, up from 10.5%, to some extent, because it will now capitalize commission expense as is required by ASC 606. That said, the CFO also indicated that the company planned to reinvest back the savings from that accounting change into product and field initiatives. So, it is hard to tell just how much of the higher margin expectations are simply a matter of commission deferrals that have no meaning operational significance in the long-run and how much the higher margins represent real expense discipline.The company is now forecasting that fiscal 2020 non-GAAP operating margins will reach 14%, again a noticeable increase from prior projections. In this past quarter, Splunk, was able to achieve some significant operating leverage and its gross margins also continued to trend upward.Overall, operating margin trends were very favorable for this company in advance of any ASC 606 impact. In Q4, the company was able to actually reduce its general and administrative cost on a year over year basis and its largest operating expense category, sales and marketing grew by just 25% in a quarter in which bookings grew by 44%. Given the company's very strong competitive position, the robust growth of the spaces in which the company operates, and the overall economies of scale inherent in reaching a $2 billion and above run rate, it is not surprising that the company is starting to achieve far more robust operating margins than it has historically achieved.Using non-GAAP margins of 14%, and revenues of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2020, as well as the projected tax rate of 20% and a share count of 146 million, would yield an EPS forecast of about $1.60 for fiscal 2020, a bit above the current consensus. That said, I think the current high estimate for the period of $1.84 in EPS on revenues of $2.16 billion is actually a more likely forecast based on the trends that were observable both last quarter and in subsequent investor presentations. Regardless, the forward P/E of the company at around 65X, is a reasonable valuation metric for a company achieving growth that is likely to be in the mid-30% range, once the company completes restating historical quarters to account for the ASC 606 changes.Management pointed out during the call that the adoption of ASC 606, in which commission payment recognition is deferred will increase the seasonality of earnings. Commission payments for almost all software vendors are lowest in Q1 and so the positive impact of the ASC 606 deferrals will be at a low point, while revenues also show a seasonal trend. The specifics of Splunk's forecast are such that it has left itself with plenty of room to over-attain current EPS expectations when it reports its numbers, tentatively scheduled for the 3rd week of May.Finally, it should be noted that the company, historically an abuser of stock-based compensation, has brought that ratio down noticeably over the course of fiscal 2018. In Q4, for example, stock-based compensation was 63% of operating cash flow compared to 90% the prior year. The company will not be GAAP profitable in this current year, but given the steep ramp it has shown in terms of operating leverage on a GAAP basis, it could reach the range of GAAP operating profitability in 2020.During the course of the conference call, management made some projections about the duration of subscription revenue agreements. Historically, the company has seen a 2-year duration for subscription agreements, but that was when subscriptions were a far smaller proportion of total bookings than is currently projected.There can be countervailing trends in booking duration. One trend that is most firmly established relates to revenues generated by the cloud. Almost no user will choose to pay for cloud revenues in advance if for no other reason but that cloud revenues are usage based and are not based on a specific contractual agreement. On the other hand, many companies have been surprised by subscription bookings results where duration exceeded expectations. This may have to do with low interest rates, or other contractual quirks-but I doubt that the duration reduction Splunk has forecast will really come to pass.Why a paragraph on that discussion-well bookings duration for a company with a 65% subscription ratio is going to have a massive impact on operating cash flow-it is really the biggest swing factor in the operating cash flow calculation.Last quarter for example, the company reported an increase in the growth of its deferred revenue balance of no less than 61%. That is what happens when customers prepay subscriptions for terms of greater than one year. The company is forecasting that its operating cash flow will reach $300 million next year with $275 million of free cash flow. That results in a free cash flow yield of just 2% for the current fiscal, but I think the trend is more significant, in that free cash flow is forecast to double next year, despite an estimate of falling duration. Based on trending, free cash flow will grow another 60%+ in fiscal 2020.No, Splunk is not a deep value name nor is it valued on a GARP basis. It is a company that is still growing in the mid-30% range, despite some optical issues, and it is likely to continue that track for at least the next couple of quarters. Splunk has been described as a ""cloud king"" along with several other companies by a popular TV commentator. The fact is that it really does dominate a specific area of the current IT universe, and one that will inevitably grow simply because of the accelerating growth in data generation. One thing about a king, it ought to have a kingdom over which it can rule. If users want to collect and analyze information about the usage of their data, Splunk is and is likely to remain the preferred provider of the tools necessary to accomplish that undertaking. Splunk continues to offer users substantial advantages in terms of functionality and breadth of offering that are just not available elsewhere. Most Splunk projects appear to have generated or exceeded ROI's that users have anticipated.I think it is likely that Splunk continues to over-attain current consensus forecasts significantly and that is the fuel for continuing positive alpha."

The stock portion of the purchase price would result in ‘less than one percent total dilution,’ according to the company.As of its most recent 10-Q filing for the quarter ended January 31, 2017, Splunk had $421.3 million in cash and equivalents and total liabilities of $913.4 million.So, it appears that Splunk has ample resources to close the transaction without undue financial hardship.Splunk is acquiring Phantom because it believes that analytics-driven security and SOAR platforms improve security operations efficiency ‘by automating tasks, orchestrating workflows, improving collaboration, and enabling organizations to respond to incidents at machine speed.’As Splunk said in the deal statement,So, this deal represents a further push for Splunk into the enterprise Security Operations Center through Phantom’s orchestration and response system.Combining Phantom’s large number of service integrations with Splunk’s machine learning capabilities, the resulting offering should represent a more robust set of capabilities for enterprise security operations.Splunk’s stock dropped by a slight 0.82% on the announcement as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Investors appear to be taking this significant acquisition in stride, which represents 2.6% of Splunk’s current $13.4 billion market capitalization.The deal is scheduled to close by the end of Q2 2018 and will likely take at least two more quarters to integrate fully.I view the transaction as a net positive for Splunk, but investors won’t see the benefits in financial results until well into 2019."

Given the company's size, the list of potential acquirers is short.","I’ve spent most of my time recently digging for deep value – something that can be tough to find in a market at all-time highs. However, I’m not opposed to owning growth and momentum, and given the positive press surrounding Splunk (SPLK) recently, it was high time for a little bit of a look. The company had an almost fantastical run-up after its initial public offering; management was certainly popping the champagne during the 2013, but valuations have certainly come down to more reasonable levels – at least reasonable in the technology space. With the takeover rumor mill running once again, as well as some steadily improving operating results, is it time to get involved in the Splunk story?Splunk is, at its core, simply a big data technology play. In today’s world, businesses are awash in data; so much so that they have problems capturing, monitoring, and cataloguing it all. These companies know there is so much potential for driving process improvement but are often at a loss on how to make it manageable. Splunk’s flagship product – Splunk Enterprise – is a machine data platform that can collect and index petabytes on a daily basis (that’s one million gigabytes for perspective), regardless of format or data structure. Most enterprise monitoring systems are not capable of tracking this data real-time, and interpretation and the digging is left up to the analyst. As a result, it can be difficult to see the forest through the trees – unless you’re on Splunk or a comparable platform that can help aggregate and interpret data using search processing language. Splunk customers gain “operational intelligence” – the ability to improve service levels, reduce operational costs, mitigate security risks. What business would not want to make better decisions while cutting costs?Sales results are clear in my opinion, as are favorable trends surrounding them. The installed customer base has steadily grown, with the nominal number of new client additions increasing each year. Importantly to me, the number of orders exceeding $100,000 have increased dramatically over the past several years, and, perhaps not surprisingly, average order sizes have increased as well. Upset clients don’t willingly double their annual outlays to a supplier if they are unhappy in most instances. The percentage of license bookings from existing customers continues to grow as well, and renewal rates (e.g., retention) run in the mid-90s – not anything to slouch at. Even now, as a billion dollar/year company, revenue is targeted to grow 25-30% annually through 2020, as Splunk works on achieving its $2B/year run rate goal as soon as it can.Still, the business continues to evolve, despite healthy top-line growth. A major internal theme at Splunk is the move to recurring revenue, away from perpetual license issuance. This isn’t particularly unusual, as nearly every software company has been moving towards recurring revenue models over the past several years. Importantly, Splunk management has indicated it is moving carefully here. There are many Software as a Service (“SaaS”) that brute forced the shift (Tyler Technologies (TYL) comes to mind), and that often leads to short-term pain with clients. I hope this continues. While management has stated it is not putting undue pressure on customers to switch, it has nonetheless targeted 75/25 split between recurring and perpetual over the next three years, up from 47% this year. Fiscal 2016-2018 will not see much shift in this manner (just 400bps expansion expected), so the majority of the increase will come between 2019 and 2020. That’s an aggressive shift – one that the market is looking forward to – and it’s an execution point outside of revenue growth or margins that investors should pay close attention to.There are a few potential risk factors within the Splunk business, many of them not unusual for high-flying technology companies. Gross margin fell to 79.9% in fiscal 2017, compared to 82.9% in fiscal 2016 and 84.8% in fiscal 2015. This is primarily due to increased contribution from cloud-based sales, which constituted 32% of software bookings mix in the most recently completed fiscal year, compared to 12% back in fiscal 2015. Delivering software under a cloud-based model generally results in higher costs and expenses compared to the traditional on-premise license, but large customers have begun to have the expectation that software like Splunk’s be provided in this manner. This runs counter somewhat to the Splunk model; management believes in-house tends to work better, so that software can be installed behind the firewall right next to the data, but customers want what they want. The expectation should be that cloud-based contribution will continue to rise, and this will remain a headwind to gross margin that is likely to eclipse any incremental operating leverage in the immediate term. Over time, negative impact from cloud should normalize as the company moves away from having to build out fixed costs.Stock-based compensation has been a target of ire here, but it is a mixed bag. On the better side, overall rate of stock-based compensation is normalizing and in fact going down as a percentage of revenue; after peaking at 47.5% of revenue in fiscal 2015, that figure has fallen to 40.8% of revenue in the most recently reported period. However, with figures like that, dilution has been heavy: 30% since the start of calendar year 2013. Comparatively, this is a high rate of stock compensation, even for a technology company; 15-25% of revenue is more the norm. In this case, and really any company with heavy stock-based compensation, I would highly advise adding back in to reported non-GAAP results when computing earnings, as well as factoring in the impact from dilution when looking at valuations based on cash flow. It is a real and recurring expense.The number one reason that a takeover remains somewhat viable is the balance sheet. At the end of fiscal Q2 2018, the most recently reported quarter, Splunk held $1,084M in cash and cash equivalents, all with no debt. Because of the aggressive use of stock for compensation, the company is cash flow positive – at the expense of common stockholder dilution. This makes the deal much more palatable to private equity funds or the usual names that pop up in Splunk buyout talk – Cisco (CSCO) and IBM (IBM).Still, given current non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 13% by fiscal 2020, Splunk will still be generating GAAP operating losses in a few years. Any acquirer would be taking over a money-losing business; a great business, but still one that has not solved the problem of profitability. As much as I hate revenue multiples on acquisitions (often quite wild), it’s the best way to approach this one. Public valuation multiples for SaaS companies are in the 6x EV/Revenue range, with most acquisitions (LinkedIn, Blue Coat) falling in the 7.5x range. Given Splunk trades at 6.8x EV/Revenue today, so even after languishing at around the same share price for several years, there is an inherent premium built in here compared to other SaaS firms. This is likely due to Cisco’s AppDynamics acquisition earlier this year, which offers a competing product to Splunk. At 17x EV/Revenue, AppDynamics was one of the most aggressive purchases in SaaS acquisition history, and it raised expectations for what a Splunk takeover could fetch. Could lightning strike twice in the space, and a competitor come in and pay, say, $10-12B for the company? Potentially, but the list of potential acquirers is quite short at that size, and it becomes extremely difficult to justify dealmaking of that kind to shareholders – spending more than $10B on a currently money-losing enterprise? Even in the tech space, that’s a hard sell, and investors have to wonder if a company that, by most estimates, controls 20-30% of its market, can shift to profitability after years of generating double-digit GAAP operating income margins. I just can’t see justification for the long side here, other than a hope and a prayer that a large cap tech company makes a highly aggressive move.For broad investment coverage, but with a focus on small/mid cap names that don’t get much press, consider following me to get real-time updates whenever I release research."
4081988,98236,2017-06-16T12:34:44-04:00,Splunk shares have been sitting in a doghouse for the last 2 years.The company's last quarter was greeted with investor dis-approval sending the shares down a bit more.The company is a long way from achieving GAAP profitability.Concerns exist about potentially slowing growth.The company is in the midst of what some describe as a messy transition to a model that is dependent on both the cloud and term subscriptions for revenue.,"Can Splunk produce a quarter that investors and analysts like?That really is not as rhetorical a headline as might seem to be the case. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported its numbers for the April quarter a few weeks ago. On balance, a case could be made that the results were not terrible and even a bit promising, but the company missed some metrics such as license revenue and the shares were punished for what seems like the dozenth time. Overall, the shares have fallen about 15% from their pre-earnings peak.Earlier today, the shares were downgraded by Wedbush who reduced their price target about 13%. I am not too sure as to why the analyst chose today for his downgrade - there was no news since the earnings of substance. Most of the material in the downgrade might have been written at the time of the earnings release. It is possible the analyst is simply reflecting changed trends in the market with new valuation metrics on which to concentrate.On the other hand, the downgrade has really had no observable influence on the share price as I write this. Indeed, the shares have actually recovered a bit in the midst of a relatively weak tech tape. Is it possible that the negatives, which were most recently pointed out in forthright fashion by Seeking Alpha contributor Stone Fox Capital, are finally discounted?The shares have reacted poorly to at least the last four earnings releases. Indeed, the shares are one of the few tech names not to have appreciated the past year and to have depreciated going back over the past 24 months. I think it is this under-performance that has potentially made Splunk investible and much of the article will look at that case, although with a degree of healthy skepticism. On balance, after considering both the positives and negatives, I think the shares at current levels are worth buying. The shares come with issues including the dilution from stock based comp and concerns about slowing growth. The issue about dilution from stock based comp is real enough; slowing growth is a very overdone concern in my view.I have not had the easiest of times in finding a suitable investment within the cyber-security space. Even though growth in the space cyber-security space may have declined to a degree, it is still a focus of user spending priorities and will probably continue to be so indefinitely. Splunk occupies a specific niche with cyber-security and indeed initially management did not focus on the security uses of its technology.I have been rather dubious in terms of Splunk as a stock, almost since the time of the IPO. I have always wondered about the use cases for log management. But the space has come into its own at this point and some of the newer use cases for the technology will probably lead to a higher level of growth for a longer period than many observers currently credit. And that is basically why I have changed my mind about the shares.The company is most certainly a leader in its space (which is called SIEM-Security Information and Event Management) and its space remains hot. The latest Gartner Magic Quadrant ranks Splunk No. 1 in its space trailed by IBM (NYSE:IBM) and LogRhythm-a privately held vendor.Splunk has been evaluated as the strongest vendor in the space for the last several years, and there is nothing on the horizon that suggests that either the SIEM space or Splunk's competitive position in cyber-security is going to be soon disrupted.One interesting element in the evaluation of the SIEM space is linked here. It is a study by IDC to the effect that users are increasingly determined to focus their investment in the cyber-security space on technologies such as SIEM that provide warning of threats before the attacks actually takes place. In a different study recently published, Gartner says that 60% of enterprise information security budgets will be allocated for rapid detection and response approaches by 2020, up from 20% in 2015. To the extent that the study is valid, it suggests that a company like Splunk might be able to sustain 30% growth for several years, something significantly different that what is assumed today in the consensus or by most investors.The company is now in the midst of transitioning from a primarily on-prem model to one based on cloud and subscription deployments of its software. It is the transition, and its effect on reported numbers, that seems to have drawn the ire of some analysts. As mentioned in its latest quarterly earnings report, revenues from the cloud doubled last quarter which, indeed, is why the category of Maintenance and Services revenues jumped so sharply. But the rise in subscription revenue caused license revenue growth to fall and in turn that lead to what was considered to be a miss of bookings expectations. One can put together proxy metrics that suggest that the so-called miss in bookings metrics really wasn't much-but not all analysts were willing to do that work.One thing that has remained is that Splunk hasn't managed to break the habit of handing out stock based comp to all and sundry. The bad habit is still there and still a reason that there are many investors who will not buy the shares. And yet the case could be made, that the metric, as expressed in terms of its growth and its percent of revenues is starting to show less unfavorable trends. At the very least, it is one way, I suppose, one way of circumventing the $15 minimum wage in San Francisco.Just looking at the photos of its ""super-cool"" headquarters might suggest reasons for the company's success in terms of innovation and failure in terms of a rapid ascent to profitability. Investors seem a bit more concerned about profitability in recent months than has heretofore been the case. Has Splunk gotten the message?Inside the company's latest quarterly report and outlookAs mentioned, Splunk reported the results of its latest quarter about 3 weeks ago. The headlines were not too dissimilar to those that have been seen since this company went public. Revenues increased by 30% year on year while GAAP loss was $97 million, compared to $98 million the prior year. The revenue print was a beat of about 4%, more or less consistent with the performance the company has achieved throughout its brief life. Just below the headline was the less than stunning performance of license revenue which increased by 18%, while the Maintenance and Services revenue line, now the larger of the two revenue categories grew by 48%.The company's gross margin comparison was impacted by the mix shift. Overall, GAAP gross margins fell by about 300 bps. That kind of margin pressure is likely to continue as the company sees more of its revenues coming from a SaaS delivered product consumption model and while users use different pricing plans to eliminate the company's capacity charges for file indexing.There were some elements in the operating expense comparison that might suggest the company is achieving a measure of expense discipline. All of the following numbers are GAAP. Research and development costs increased by 6%. Even sales and marketing expense showed a relatively moderate growth of 20% while general and administrative costs rose by 14%.Looked at holistically, the ratio of operating expense to revenues improved by about 1500 basis year on year, although the company continues to spend more on opex than it generates in terms of gross margin. The overall operating expense ratio fell from 131% of revenues to 116%-progress, but hardly rapid enough progress for many/most investors. The company's non-GAAP operating margin of negative 0.7% exceeded its prior projection of 3 months earlier of negative 3%.The company's positive cash flow has been a product of stock-based comp which represents more than 2X the reported cash flow from operations (CFFO). CFFO increased modestly year on year while stock based comp was essentially flat. The increase, such as it was, had most to do with a smaller level of decrease in accrued compensation balances. In Q1, because of seasonal factors, (most annual billings take place in the last month of fiscal Q4) the growth in deferred revenues was negligible. That said, however, the company increased its forecast for billings by a greater amount than it raised its forecast for revenues. So, it is reasonable to imagine that the deferred revenue line will grow more rapidly than was the case in Q1, and will have a positive impact on cash flow for the year.Last year, the increase in deferred revenues was about 88% of CFFO. Most of the increase was seen in Q4. I think, again based on conference call commentary, that there will be a similar seasonal pattern this year in which half or more of the company's cash flow takes place in Q4, primarily driven by the increased in deferred revenues.The company raised guidance somewhat for the current quarter and for the entire fiscal year. That said, according to the guidance and the concomitant First Call consensus estimate, top line growth is forecast to decline to 26% for the full year, compared to the 30% growth recently reported and to the 42% growth reported last year. And the First Call consensus earnings estimates declined in the wake of the earnings release by a noticeable amount-although that was primarily a function of the company forecasting a tax accrual rate for the first time in its history.Why does it take a 30% growth in revenues to keep operating loss from rising?The frustration with this company's shares has been its inability to achieve any kind of a path to substantial profitability despite its strong top-line growth performance. Many companies try to balance their opportunities for top-line growth with the need to provide shareholders some kind of visible returns. The following quote comes from company CEO, Doug Merritt, made during the course of the conference call that was held in conjunction with the company's Q1 release, ""As you know, we are early in the market when you consider the significant growth in the amount of data being generating. (We are) investing and optimizing field coverage, segmentation and demand generation activities (that) will drive our continued penetration in our markets, accelerate customer acquisition and ultimately lead to all customers extracting more meaningful insights from their data.""I think the operative words here are ""early stage"" and ""invest more."" And that presents investors with a conundrum, I think. The company is forecasting that over the next three years, it will see its operating margins grow from the current level of 8% forecast for this fiscal year to 13% in fiscal 2020 (ends 1/31/20). That is a very slow creep over a 3-year span. Indeed, given that the GAAP loss margin last quarter was a negative 36%, it seems almost 100% certain that the company will still be making GAAP losses in fiscal 2020. That very slow cadence is clearly a negative for a certain class of investors.Part of the issue for this company in terms of its profitability is the transition to ratable revenue sources. The company is forecasting that this year about 50% of software bookings will consist of term licenses and cloud-related subscription models. It is forecasting that this proportion will reach 75% by fiscal 2020. This transition, whose impact is probably reaching its apogee in terms of negatively impacting year over year comparisons this year and the next year, is pressuring both overall reported revenue growth and gross margins. At some point, the impact will reverse and lead to higher margins as subscription renewals make up a higher proportion of revenue-but when that might be and how that will translate into the company's longer-term business model cannot be precisely forecast at this point.As mentioned, the company is forecasting a modest level of non-GAAP profitability this year. The company is forecasting that it will have 143 million fully diluted shares outstanding in Q2, and that is up 4.3% from the weighted average shares outstanding last quarter. That jump is primarily related to calculating weighted average shares when non-GAAP income is positive; the further jump forecast for the balance of the fiscal of 2 million shares a quarter or about 1.4%, relates to the dilution caused by stock based comp.The SA article cited earlier suggests that it is stock based comp that has been holding back share price progress, and perhaps that is the case. Certainly, it hasn't been a positive. On the other hand, I have to suggest that the increase in outstanding shares at 4%-5%/year is not terribly different than that of many other enterprise IT vendors whose shares have seen far stronger performance.The Wedbush downgrade cited stock based comp as one of the factors leading to the downgrade of Splunk shares. I have to wonder, if I may, where the analyst has been all the years during which he had a buy rating on the shares. Stock based comp was a little bit lower as a proportion of both revenue and non-GAAP profitability than has been the case recently. It may well be a factor limiting the increase in profitability the company is forecasting going forward although that was not cited specifically by the company. That said, it seems likely that the company is going to have to use a greater level of cash compensation and will constrain share based grants to attract employees, simply because it has not seen any increase in its share price.Why does the company have to grow at such a high rate just to achieve such a slow level of profitability improvement? The answers would seemingly relate to the transition to recurring revenue streams which means the company's ""real"" growth is quite a bit greater than its reported growth rate and the likelihood that share based comp will diminish as a proportion of total expense and will be replaced by a greater level of cash compensation.As I have written, there is some dissonance that investors have to deal with here. The top-line growth remains strong and probably greater than assumed by observers, but the path to GAAP profitability is not all that visible and very long. It is as much a question of investor preferences as something that a writer can dispositively answer.What were analysts concerned about the most last quarter?In a word, the significant slowdown in license revenue growth. Sometimes, I am perplexed as to what seems to fixate analysts. And even more, I am perplexed in trying to figure out why analysts appear to rate the same kinds of transitions by different companies so differently. I will not try to go through all of the various companies that are transitioning to cloud or to ratable revenues. It is a hallmark of such transitions to see license revenue growth either decline or crater. I imagine that amongst the larger companies currently in transition, the cases of PTC and of Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) are the most noteworthy. I will forbear going through the valuation comparisons, the cadence of transition and the organic growth of those different businesses. Suffice to say, the results being reported by both PTC and Autodesk show far worse headlines and probably far less adjusted growth. It is almost as though those names have been given a perpetual hall pass while Splunk, which is arguably growing 3X faster has seen its shares pummeled for about the same reason other companies have enjoyed share price appreciation. Were analysts persuaded that Splunk's transition was just that and that its growth was, at the least unaffected, viewed as a whole. Some were, others were not and the result was another share price retreat.In addition to the concerns bout the transition, analysts seem very concerned with what is perceived by some to be a growth slowdown. Is Splunk's growth really slowing? I have to start by wondering why analysts evinced concern about slowing growth after the quarter reported by this company, which, after all, was above prior expectations, and by the forecast for the balance of the year, which was increased.One thing to note, and a salient point, is that the company is increasing its sales capacity by the same amount in terms of people and gross dollars as it did the prior year. Analysts, especially those who have done their analysis for a long time, ought to understand how that works. Most companies at the size of this one, do make a conscious decision not to keep ramping the investment in sales capacity at a consistent percentage. They do so more because of issues with management capability and the desire of investors to see some margin improvement rather than because of declines in the growth in demand for the product. Yes, it is reasonable to expect a rise in sales force productivity, depending on the specifics of hiring plans. And this company did have an issue with the performance of its European sales force and concomitantly an over-attainment on the part of its sales force in North America.It is probably worth quoting the CEO with regard to how the company is run with regards to sales capacity. ""which is why you'll hear Dave and I harp nonstop on how do we get more feet-on-the street, more feet-on the-street. There is only so much that we can do as far as our capacity to hire, our capacity to train and then, the operating expense that we can actually bear around that. So, starting really, for years and with a hard emphasis about 3 years ago, we really started to rotate much more aggressively (to the) channel…"" There probably is a slowdown in percentage growth of some modest amount which has more to do with insuring the company grows efficiently. If the company effectively uses its channel and achieves the results it expects in its EMEA region, that percentage slowdown is going to be far less than the fears of some observers.I am not going to comment here about the company's newer use cases that are a bit beyond simple security. Management called out its initiatives in IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) which uses analytics to help IT best manage its resources. The CEO mentioned what is called UBA which is the acronym for User Behavior Analytics that can help identify cyber attacks before they are really underway. The CEO said that both initiatives are starting to drive significant revenue growth and are being included in a rising proportion of larger deals.As mentioned above, this is the kind of capability that is now receiving the most attention from users and which is likely to prolong the higher rate of growth in the market for longer than many investors might otherwise imagine.ValuationFor a company such as this, it is, or should be obvious, that the longevity of strong growth is going to be amongst the major elements either supporting, or negatively impacting valuation. I most assuredly lack the second sight that I would need to suggest that Splunk can grow at a particular percentage for a certain number of years. My belief, based on the company's track record, its range of newer use cases and the analysis of what IT buyers want in terms of their security solutions, suggests that the company will grow longer and at faster rates than are embedded in the consensus. But I can't prove that or quantify that.I do believe that the evidence on that point in the Q1 results was substantially misread, and if anything, the shares ought to have gone up rather than down. And therein, to my way of thinking, lies an opportunity. By that I mean that while Splunk shares are hardly in the value category, they are significantly less valued than they have been since the company first went public.At this point, the company has 143 million shares outstanding and the shares closed at $57.74 yesterday afternoon. That computes to a market capitalization of $8.25 billion. The company has a large cash balance. At the end of the quarter, the company had cash and short-term investments that aggregated just short of $1.1 billion. That computes to an enterprise value of $7.15 billion. At that level, and based on the company's current revenue guidance that was issued with the earnings report, the EV/S is just below 6X. That is probably a bit below the average for a company with a growth rate expected to be at or near 30%. If that growth rate persists, the EV/S ratio will become seen as a significant bargain, I believe.The company has essentially forecast full year non-GAAP EPS of about $.52. That is down from prior estimates, primarily because the company is now forecasting a non-GAAP tax rate of 27% and perhaps the models hadn't gotten the weighted average share count correctly. That estimate rises to $.78 for fiscal year '19 based on the published estimates within the First Call consensus.My own model, which is based on a 29% top line CAGR through fiscal 2020 (the company has an aspirational expectation of reaching a $2 billion run rate by fiscal 2020), a 27% tax rate and an outstanding share count rising between 3.5%-4%/year through the period forecasts non-GAAP EPS of about $1.20. That would be a P/E of 48X.As mentioned earlier, the company will still not be achieving GAAP profitability at that point. On the other hand, based on some of the factors I have presented in this article, it seems likely that the company could enjoy several additional years of growth significantly greater than 20%.While Splunk till now has really not been a cash flow story. I think that is likely to change and some evidence of that ought to be visible this year. The company generated CFFO last year of $201 million with free cash flow of $157 million.The company saw a 17% growth in cash flow in Q1. With bookings targets now raised, and the cadence of cloud bookings rising at a triple digit pace, I think it is not implausible to forecast that CFFO will be able to rise 25% this current year, At that pace, it seems realistic to anticipate free cash flow at $210 million. That would create a free cash flow yield of just less than 3%. I think it is reasonable that free cash flow is likely to grow faster than earnings, mainly because of the likely significant growth of deferred revenues as cloud bookings increase substantially as a proportion of the total over the coming years. I think by the end of the 3 year period that the company often speaks to in its investor presentations, free cash flow could reach between $325 million and $350 million which would be a substantial free cash flow yield of almost 5% on the current $7 billion + of enterprise value.I think that recommending Splunk shares is a close-run call. On the negative side, stock based comp is still elevated, although showing positive trends. And the growth in non-GAAP operating margins is certainly not forecast to be moving upward at any great level. In addition, the transition to higher levels of ratable revenue sources have made for ""messy"" quarters with license revenue growth decelerating. Further, the European sales model is very much a work in progress.But on the other side of the equation, I like the expansion in terms of new use cases which is growing the TAM significantly and consistently. I certainly see no change in the competitive landscape. And the Gartner survey as to what users wish to see in security solutions is certainly a factor to be considered in forecasting consistent top-line growth at levels greater than are currently embedded in the consensus.The shares, while certainly not a bargain based on traditional current financial metrics, are quite reasonably valued based on the growth cadence that I think makes sense to forecast. I haven't taken a step into the shares yet, but look forward to doing so in the future."
4102179,102661,2017-08-27T21:38:19-04:00,"Cisco is on an acquisition spree for software companies, and Splunk has been floated as a possible target.Splunk stock just spiked after announcing Q2 FY 2018 earnings and a bullish sales forecast.But Splunk share price may be inflated, and Cisco would likely pay a hefty price to purchase the company.Cisco shareholders would be better served by alternative acquisitions, preserving cash for future purchases, stock buybacks, and dividend payouts.","As a follow-up to my recent article on why I’m adding Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) back into my portfolio, I thought to address a rumor that has been meandering around the Internet for some time now.With 12 acquisitions in FY 2016 (particularly in the software space) alone and several major acquisitions in FY 2017 (namely AppDynamics for $3.7 billion and most recently Springpath for $320 million), Cisco has “hit the ground running” under Chuck Robbins to increase its buying pace. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) has been floated as a potential target for Cisco to add to its expanding technology portfolio.Somewhat contrary to the title of this article, I actually think a Cisco-Splunk marriage would be very positive from a technology standpoint. There are good synergies between Splunk’s data management platform and several of Cisco’s key technology markets, not the least of which are the security and application performance management (“APM”) markets. And, Cisco and Splunk already have a strong partnership. Going a step further, I would argue that a combination of the companies would be a “win-win-win” for Cisco, Splunk, and their respective customers from a technology standpoint.My concern lies with the price that Cisco would likely pay for Splunk, and how a potential purchase would impact Cisco shareholders.What would Cisco possibly pay for Splunk? Of course, that’s hard to say.As mentioned, the company ponied up $3.7 billion for AppDynamics in early 2017, whereas AppDynamics generated about $150 million in its FY 2016. So, Cisco paid ~25x revenue for the company based on its 2016 fiscal year result. Cisco’s acquisition of AppDynamics occurred in the private market; and Cisco management certainly expects major growth from the company given that its revenues are still relatively low. Also, public market valuations and private market valuations are different; and one probably would not expect such a high multiple to be applied to a public tech company. Still, it provides one guidepost to evaluate a hypothetical Cisco purchase of Splunk. (Incidentally, AppDynamics was not profitable at the time it was acquired, so no earnings multiple applies.)As we see from the following income data table generated from Splunk annual reports FY 2013 through FY 2017, the company generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in its FY 2017:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY 2013 through FY 2017. Table Source: Yves SukhuUsing the AppDynamics acquisition multiple, that would set a Splunk acquisition price of $25 billion. If that figure strikes you as high, there are probably a lot of other investors who would agree. Yet, I imagine there are some Splunk executives and major shareholders who might offer several arguments as to why the company is worth that much... or perhaps even more. After all, Splunk is now forecasting full FY 2018 revenues in excess of $1.2 billion, which is greater than 20% growth over full-year FY 2017 revenues.But, if we assume the 25x revenue multiple is far too frothy for the public market and for a company of Splunk’s size in terms of sales, perhaps we can evaluate other fairly recent acquisition events to refine our estimate. Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) purchase of LinkedIn and Symantec’s (SYMC) purchase of BlueCoat come to mind. Microsoft paid $26.2 billion for LinkedIn, representing a 7.2 revenue multiple; and Symantec paid $4.65 billion for BlueCoat, representing a 7.8 revenue multiple. If we split those multiples down the middle, we arrive at a Splunk acquisition price of ~$7.5 billion using a 7.5x revenue multiple against FY 2017 sales.This purchase amount seems a lot more reasonable, at least based on where Splunk stock has been trading. The company’s share price has more or less fluctuated between $55/share and $65/share over the past 12 months:Data Source: InveyoWith approximately 138 million shares outstanding as of the writing of this article, the company’s market capitalization has therefore (roughly) swung between $7.6 billion and $9.0 billion.With market enthusiasm (or lunacy, depending on your point of view) presently raging for tech companies, I don’t think Splunk management would sell the company for ~$7.5 billion (i.e., toward the lower range of their market cap over the last 12 months). Building on the company's bullish sales outlook, Splunk was just ranked #1 by IDC “in the Worldwide IT Operations Analytics (ITOA) Software Market and the Worldwide IT Event and Log Management Software Market”. IDC goes further in its reports and notes that “these two IT markets have the highest growth rates within the overall IT market with 32.9 percent growth in the ITOA market and 23.5 percent in the Event and Log Management market”. Splunk captured 31.2% of the overall ITOA market, with the remainder split among VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW), IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Turbonomic, Sumo Logic, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), and BMC Software, according to IDC.Given the strong growth prospects, Splunk shareholders would certainly demand an attractive price premium. With shares trading around a rough median of $60/share over the last 12 months, I think a 50% premium would not be out of the question, which provides us with an acquisition price of $90/share, or $12.4 billion.So, using the (admittedly very crude) valuation methods above, we have a set of low-range, mid-range, and high-range acquisition prices for Splunk:Table Source: Yves SukhuWith about $70 billion in its coffers, Cisco could certainly afford Splunk, but a purchase would use a substantial amount of cash even on the lower end of our range in the previous section. No matter how you slice it, Splunk would not come cheap under current market conditions. In the forthcoming sections, I argue that Cisco shareholders would be better served by an alternative acquisition.As mentioned in the introduction of this article, Splunk and Cisco have enjoyed a close partnership for several years. There are natural synergies between their respective technologies. For example, Splunk is an excellent platform for the consumption, monitoring, and analysis of Cisco network device data. However, there is overlap between Splunk and AppDynamics, with both solutions fighting over some of the same systems management use cases, even if their respective approaches are different. With the purchase of AppDynamics, Cisco should (obviously) steer customers as much as possible toward their platform. To that end, when the Cisco-AppDynamics acquisition was announced, some investors/analysts speculated that the event might calm talk of a Cisco-Splunk purchase. An Investor’s Business Daily article around the time of the AppDynamics acquisition noted Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard suggesting that Cisco-Splunk “rumors likely will cool after Cisco’s [AppDynamics] announcement”. The article goes on to quote Pritchard directly, stating:The Cisco-Splunk partnership isn’t going anywhere, and there will be many future scenarios where the two companies will continue working together. But over time, we may see (and arguably, should see) AppDynamics continue to encroach on Splunk’s “ground”, making a Cisco-Splunk marriage less attractive.Most recently, there has been chatter around a possible acquisition of Turbonomic by Cisco. The company, which is private, offers product functionality that overlaps with Splunk in the ITOA market. If the purchase goes through, Cisco will have another technology that overlaps with Splunk in regard to certain use cases.Splunk has enjoyed strong growth since going public; and the IDC report mentioned above suggests the company is in the “right” markets for continued growth. Yet, we noted in the income data table earlier that the company has recorded a GAAP loss every fiscal year since FY 2009, and that the loss per share has been increasing since FY 2013:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY 2013 through FY 2017. Table Source: Yves SukhuAs a result, its accumulated deficit exceeded $1 billion at the end of FY 2017: Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY 2013 through FY 2017. Table Source: Yves SukhuIt’s easy to see why the company is losing money through an examination of some basic expense ratios:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY 2013 through FY 2017. Table Source: Yves SukhuWith the exception of FY 2011 and FY 2012, R&D, sales & marketing, and G&A expenses exceeded 100% of revenues. Consider the same ratios for Cisco for FY 2008 through FY 2016 as a point of comparison:Data Source: Cisco Annual Reports FY 2010 through FY 2016. Table Source: Yves SukhuSplunk’s expense ratios are especially high, largely due to stock-based employee compensation, which the company omits for its non-GAAP results. But investors should carefully consider these non-cash costs. As Warren Buffet said in his FY 2015 Annual Report:Investors might ask themselves, “If Splunk software is so good, then why do they need to incur such high levels of stock-based compensation?” To that point, we could argue that Splunk’s expenses are high because they are in ""rapid-growth mode"", and therefore, these expenses should be higher until they normalize as the company matures.But I think it is possible that Splunk is no longer in rapid-growth mode, and is, in fact, already traversing through the mature phase of its natural business life cycle:Image SourceConsider that growth rates are declining across its two revenue categories of product and maintenance/services:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY 2013 through FY 2017. Table Source: Yves SukhuNow, the law of big numbers of course dictates that the company’s growth rate should slow down. After all, total revenues in FY 2009 were just $18 million, compared to nearly $1 billion in FY 2017. But consider that the company’s net customer acquisition rate is also slowing down:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY 2013 through FY 2017. Table and Chart Source: Yves SukhuAs the data shows, the company has been fairly consistent adding about 2,000 net new customers every fiscal year. While that performance is nothing to sneeze at, the fact that the customer acquisition rate has not shown an increasing trend between FY 2013 and FY 2017 could be suggestive of an increasingly crowded and competitive market. In fairness, this trend is also the result of the law of big numbers; and Splunk has been vocal about its strategy to extract increasing revenue from its install base. Still, it is not completely unreasonable for investors to expect an increasing rate of net new customers added if the company is rapidly growing. Notably, Splunk management has spoken recently about how it is redirecting its sales force to focus more on new customer acquisitions as it transitions to more subscription-based licensing over perpetual licenses. So, perhaps that was an implicit acknowledgment of moderating growth.Deferred revenue data is another point of consideration. Using the following data, I examined deferred revenue relative to approximate employee count:Data Source: Splunk Annual Reports FY 2013 through FY 2017. Table and Chart Source: Yves SukhuWe can see from the chart that deferred revenue per employee has been growing overall, but the rate is not especially large, particularly in recent fiscal years. With Splunk seeking to generate a greater proportion of its sales from subscription licenses, this data seems to undermine the suggestion that the company is still in a rapid growth phase.Splunk is admittedly in the process of transitioning from a perpetual license-oriented sales model to a subscription license-oriented sales model. But competition will only continue to heat up in its key markets. In fact, the IDC report discussed earlier does not even include competitors that the company mentions in its own annual reports, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT). These tech behemoths (should) have a vested interest attacking Splunk, positioning their own analytics and data management technologies.If growth is indeed not as rosy as I argue above, things are only going to get tougher from here. I think it’s very possible that the transition to subscription-based licensing may not go quite as well as Splunk bulls are hoping. These points in aggregate make it difficult to establish a realistic and fair valuation for the company.Cisco could buy Splunk given its substantial cash hoard. However, the purchase would not come cheap considering current investor bullishness on the latter’s growth prospects.The AppDynamics acquisition gives Cisco a technology platform that was already competitive with Splunk in certain cases; and further investment and development of AppDynamics will likely drive that technology further into Splunk’s territory. If Cisco continues to acquire products and technologies that overlap with Splunk (e.g., Turbonomic), we may see the company develop integrations between those technologies - with the resulting solution evolving into a more direct, formidable Splunk competitor.Finally, I believe Splunk may be out of its rapid growth phase, and with competition increasing in its key markets, the company's current valuation may be disproportionate to its future prospects. Cisco shareholders would be better served by restraint in regard to such a potentially large acquisition, preserving cash for dividend payouts, share buybacks, and sensibly priced acquisitions."
4090693,21815,2017-07-26T11:58:34-04:00,"Splunk offers a terrific platform for all kinds of machine data analysis that has little comparison to anything else out there.It should have considerable tailwind for some time to come from numerous sources like the Internet of Things and cyber security concerns.However, the financial path to GAAP profitability is really not clear, but from what we can see, it's pretty far away.","We're certainly not the first that in the coming era of big data, cyber security and the internet of things ('IoT'), a company like Splunk (SPLK) should benefit from some considerable tailwinds. Indeed, here is management summing that up (from the Q1CC):For an idea what its apps are capable off, this is a useful indication:Yet, so far, things have not seemed to have gone entirely according to plan. The revenue growth (at least until recently) has been impressive enough, but the company is found wanting in terms of earnings and EBITDA generation:This suggests either strong competition, or deficiencies in its business model and/or the execution of it. The latter would be somewhat ironic, given the fact that Splunk's software is supposed to help clients sort, organize, monitor, and gain insight on data generated by its IT equipment, enabling them to increase efficiency (as well as to see what's happening in real time and monitor potential threats to the business).The company should also benefit from its cyber security business, especially as it's the leader in the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) space, according to Gartner.This is the fastest growing segment in cyber security, not surprising as SIEM software which enables to detect threats before attacks even take place.It's not so difficult to figure out what is wrong with the business model, or perhaps we should say what was wrong with it. Like most software businesses, it started out selling licenses for on-premise deployments, earning income streams from updates and maintenance.However, the cloud and SaaS ('software as a service') have upended this business model, and Splunk now is in the midst of a transition to SaaS.This transition is making interpretation of current numbers a bit complicated. However, in principle, there should be two solid reasons for Splunk to increase its performance:One thing that has to be stressed is that the company will not move to the cloud entirely; in fact, quite far from it. Here is management from the Q1CC:But the reality is that despite these two fundamental tailwinds, at least so far, growth is decelerating (from 42% last year to an expected 26% this year), and the company is still making substantial losses, despite growing pretty fast and paying an inordinate amount in stock-based compensation.SA contributor Bert Hochfeld certainly has a point when he laments about analysts' inconsistent rating on companies making the transition from license to SaaS-based business models.We have seen the positive impact on Ellie Mae (ELLI), for instance, but here, analysts seem to be focused on the loss of license revenues. We're not worried about that at all, but that doesn't mean we have no worries, quite the contrary.Splunk embarked on $90M in stock-based compensation in Q1 alone (from the 10-Q), which is 37% of its Q1 revenues ($242.5M)! Yeah, you read that right. At least it's down ever so slightly from Q1 2016 ($91.37M) when it was an absurd 49% of revenues.In that sense, it's very much like another company we have analyzed, namely Tableau Software (DATA). This is another one of those companies making the transition from license to SaaS-based business model, but it spends a quarter of its revenue on stock-based compensation, and we already found that totally ridiculous.SA contributor Stone Fox pointed out the consequences with the following figure:Investors seem to think that GAAP earnings do not matter, but all that stock-based compensation is simply that, compensation. And, in Q2, we're already at 143M shares (fully diluted), rising at 2M per quarter.These cute little YCharts have the advantage that they provide these charts on the basis of GAAP figures, which brings home the absurdity of the stock-based compensation issue:Above, you have the full brutal force of GAAP. Apart from a considerable fall in gross profit margin (which could be transitory due to the change in business model), operating and profit margins are steeply almost absurdly negative, and while they did perk up a little last year, Q1 has brought them back down again.As with Tableau, this figure really makes us wonder two things:We understand that Splunk is still in a land-grab period, growing its market presence basically at any cost, but with growth itself decelerating, we don't see GAAP profitability on the horizon any time soon. Not all companies can do an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Hochfeld, assuming 29% revenue growth for the rest of the decade, argues that based on EV/S (which is roughly 6), the company might even be considered a bargain, but at the same time, he argues that GAAP profitability won't be happening even in 2020.We're not sure investors should look beyond 2020 to consider Splunk a bargain, though.The upside of stock-based compensation is of course that this is a non-cash item, which should make cash flow pretty meaningful. And, indeed:During the Q1CC, management reaffirmed the 2017 target of $250M in operating cash flow.Splunk should be a no-brainer investment. It has a leading position in some of the biggest growth markets available, and we're only in the first innings of these, and we marvel at what its platform can do and especially what it will be able to do in the future (with IoT taking off).However, that picture is marred to a considerable extent by the enormous reliance on stock-based compensation, which makes GAAP profitability all but a distant goal which will not come into view anytime soon.That is, Splunk might be a good investment, if you are patient enough for the profit metrics to improve, but for us, this generates too much uncertainty as a lot can happen between now and then, as we have little feel for the potential profitability of its platform, no matter how much we marvel at its technical capabilities.Still, we're not discarding that Splunk can emerge as a new big moat growth stock, simply based on the position it enjoys and the markets that it is participating in."
4101920,22148,2017-08-25T11:02:24-04:00,Splunk beat FQ2 results typical with most quarterly results.The stock has traded around $60 going on four years now.A couple of trends could finally quit being headwinds for the stock.,"After the close, Splunk (SPLK) reported another strong quarter. The platform for operational intelligence constantly beats estimates by a wide margin so a continuation of that trend isn't a shock.The key to the story is whether the guidance was good enough to get Splunk out of the rut shareholders have endured since mid-2016 and even going all the way back to 2013 when the stock first crossed the current price of $60.The FQ2 results were exceptional with revenues beating estimates by a wide $11.5 million. Even more crucial was the ability to show accelerating revenue growth though only slightly at 31.6%, up from 30.4% in the prior quarter.One of the issues holding down the stock was the constant deceleration of revenue growth that was over 40% last FQ3 and topped 50% the same period in the prior year. The new outlook for the current FQ3 places the revenue target at only 26%. A similar beat in this quarter would actually place revenues up towards 30% growth.SPLK Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsLicense revenue only grew 23% last quarter so that might place a damper on the excitement from the quarterly numbers. Otherwise, the market will reward Splunk in a scenario of consistent growth.Another issue highlighted in my last article is the surging diluted share count. The share count didn't cross 100 million until 2013 and is forecast to continue rising by roughly 2 million per quarter from the 143 million last quarter.The combination of these two factors have coincided to squeeze the stock price. At the afterhours price of $65, Splunk trades at a market value of roughly $9.3 billion. With revenues this fiscal year forecast at around $1.21 billion, the stock still has a stretched valuation multiple of about 7.7x sales estimates.Looking towards the analyst estimate of $1.5 billion for FY19 and considering the cash balance of around $1.1 billion, Splunk trades at a more reasonable enterprise value. When factoring in the afterhours 9% jump and the higher diluted share count, the EV/Sales multiple jumps closer to 5.5x. The number is very reasonable for consistent license revenue growth.SPLK EV to Revenues (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that the big data company isn't exactly cheap despite another big earnings beat and a stock that has traded flat for a long time. Though, Splunk does turn appealing looking into FY19 numbers without the stock rallying too far from the $60 close. Look for that opportunity to start building a position here."
4077444,22148,2017-05-30T13:39:19-04:00,Spunk easily beat FQ1 analyst estimates.Decelerating revenue growth and an alarming increase in share counts is holding back the stock.The stock still remains on the top end of the sector related stock valuations.,"After about four months since last writing about Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), the stock is right back in the channel from the last three years. The big data analytics company is worth an incredible $8.9 billion highlighting the problem for years now.After FQ1 earnings, the stock dipped back down to $62. Will Splunk finally breakout above the current lid on the stock?Splunk allows companies to harness unstructured data and use it to make real time decisions that covers operations from IT to application delivery to cybersecurity compliance. The software provided by the company allows customers to use business analytics and machine learning. For these reasons, the market has constantly provided the stock rich valuations.The data analytics company again beat analyst estimates for the quarter. Splunk has basically done this since going public back in 2012.My investment thesis though has focused on a consistent richly valued stock. Despite the revenue growth rate that historically topped 40%, as mentioned in the opening the stock has traded flat for years now.Slower forecasted revenue growth that will dip to about 26% for the year isn't helping. Still, the stock isn't seeing much traction despite consistently churning out fast growth due in part to this nugget in the earnings call.According to CFO Dave Conte, the share count is expected to see fast growth on a quarterly basis:Splunk reported a diluted share count of 139 million to end FY17 so the 2 million additional share count per quarter is an ongoing drag to results. Adding 8 million shares this fiscal year is a 5.8% drag on every financial metric.SPLK Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YChartsThis chart appears to capture more of the GAAP share counts that don't fully count outstanding stock options. Regardless, the chart accurately reflects the trend. Using a roughly 100 million share count starting 2013, the share count has surged 40% and is on a pace for nearly 50% growth by the end of the year.The impact is much more meaningful as the revenue growth rate decelerates. In essence, the forecasted 26% revenue growth rate for FY18 only amounts to roughly 19.5% per share growth when accounting for the share count surge.When considering that revenue growth per share dips below 20% this year, investors aren't buying an exceptionally fast growing stock anymore. Compared to some industry stocks like New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) and Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA), Splunk still remains an expensive stock trading at 7.2x forward sales estimates.SPLK PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that per share growth isn't what one might expect just looking at the headlines. The alarming share count growth has played a huge impact in the lack of stock gains for Splunk and appears set to cause more problems going forward."
4039782,98236,2017-01-26T13:59:00-05:00,Splunk held its annual analyst meeting and to some it presented an ambiguous picture with regard to revenue growth.The company has had a difficult time forecasting - it simply has been unable to forecast the timing of large deals and thus has over-attained in dramatic fashion.The company has been undergoing a transition to cloud that has impacted gross margins and is probably retarding revenue growth - although the raw numbers remain fantastic.Use cases for machine data - basically what this company does - continue to expand exponentially.The company continues to dramatically outclass the competition based on all manner of surveys in its machine data space.,"Splunk - The sixth state of matter means investors need a scorecard to decipher expectationsPhysics was not one of those subjects that fascinated me in during my educational career. I went to both a high school and then a university where physics was a required field of study but the knowledge imparted didn't remain. It is more than a half century on and all I remember are those little steel carts with the steel balls rolling down the inclines and a very serious lab partner who rebuffed my misbegotten attempts at humor about the how fast the little carts accelerated.So, when doing a bit of background research for this article, I discovered that Splunk is the sixth state of matter, the others being solid, liquid, gas, plasma and data. I had really never known there were six states of matter or what the name Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) means. Splunk refers to something that sees and indexes all data. And Splunk is a data engine that operates without gray areas, without shadows and without clouds. That is not a bad definition of the company's functionality and its mantra. It is a far less apposite definition as to the performance of its shares and how many observers view the company.Splunk's shares have done very little for the better part of a year and indeed are down by 16% from the high reached last August. Issues that have constrained the shares have included concerns about profitability and the potential for slowing growth. I am far less concerned about some dramatic decrease in the company's growth rate than I am in the cadence of its path to profitability.Because of the company's growth and recent share price weakness, the shares have now reached a relatively attractive valuation. And I think it is likely to see a far better share price performance and positive alpha after the quarterly report in February shows that it's not really seeing any material growth slowdown.Recently there have been observers, including one on this site, who believed that the company's recent analyst meeting held a couple of weeks ago was a veiled way of reducing guidance for the coming fiscal year. Hard to deny that the company forecast revenues for the upcoming fiscal year at $1.175 billion which would be materially less than this year's growth. Indeed $1.175 billion in revenues would be 26% revenue growth from the current consensus revenue projection for fiscal 2017, which ends early next week. that kind of growth would not be well greeted by shareholders or prospective shareholders coming after a year of 40% growth.But given the track record this company has in terms of guidance, I think I would not use the numbers that it presents as serious estimates. I expect the company will beat estimates for the current quarter and will raise guidance for fiscal year 2018 (ends 1/31). I do think percentage growth is moderating a bit as the company crosses the $1 billion annual threshold. But the question is how much is growth moderating. And my guess, is not much and not anywhere close to what is in the forecast presented a couple of weeks ago.Probably the most significant investment issue for this company has been the growth of stock based comp which has essentially been out of control the past couple of years. The numbers speak for themselves - outstanding shares have reached more than 131 million as reported and will be higher still when year-end results are reported because of the company's full-year non-GAAP profitability - the CFO said to model for 140 million shares outstanding. That is a 40%-plus increase in four years and makes the progress seen in terms of non-GAAP margins far less impressive.The company has acknowledged that a realistic path to long-term shareholder values includes managing and reducing stock based comp expense to levels that do not produce such ongoing and massive dilution. But so far, acknowledging the issue and acting to curtail share grants have been two different things and about the best that can be said is that stock based comp growth is beginning to grow at rates below that of Splunk's revenue increasesAs mentioned, Splunk shares have appreciated by about 12% over the last year or so and have declined by 16% since reaching a high back in August. I suspect that the under-performance of the last several months relates to the significant dilution from stock based comp expense and investor concern that the company is not really on a path to enhance its margins to reasonable levels.Splunk shares have appreciated by 7.60% today in the course of my writing this article. The appreciation is basically a factor of reading through from the valuation that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is paying for AppDynamics (APPD). Splunk has a market capitalization of $7.6 billion and an enterprise value of $6.6 billion. Based on the current consensus for revenues for the fiscal year that starts in less than a week, the EV/S is 5.6X, perhaps half of the valuation Cisco is paying for AppDynamics. Personally, I think that growth opportunity in the SIEM/ITSY spaces (the core functionality of Splunk) is significantly greater than the opportunity in application testing (the business of AppDynamics). But then one can never know precisely what animates specific acquisitions.Splunk shares are now likely to be seen by many traders as a potential takeover target at valuations far above those at which the shares have sold recently. That is probably not an unreasonable speculation, although I certainly have no firsthand knowledge as to when or whether Splunk might be acquired.Splunk shares have a reasonably positive First Call rating. The consensus price target is $71, more than 30% above the current price. I think the company is going to have to start achieving some real expense management even in the midst of its pivot to cloud revenue sources. (The discussion of the company's transition to the cloud is a separate discussion which is not relevant in this article. The transition is not nearly as dramatic as it has been for other companies and because of the nature of what Splunk does. It will always have a hybrid cloud model. It has already gone through losing about 500 bps of gross margin because of the transition. Ultimately gross margins will rise back to pre-cloud levels, I believe.)The company is nearing the end of its fiscal 2017 year with results likely to be reported before the end of next month. It seems appropriate to look at the company's growth drivers and see if there is a reason to believe that they might be waning or if the concerns engendered by the analyst meeting are valid.Setting the stageFiscal 2016 (essentially the 2015 year) saw full-year's revenues increase by 48% and that growth was consistent throughout the year with 49% growth in Q4. At the start of this fiscal year, the company provided guidance for $880 million in revenue and that represented growth of 32%. The company also forecast that non-GAAP margins would be about 5% for the year.Coming into the end of the year, the current consensus of the 40 analysts who publish on First Call is that the company will achieve 39% growth for the year, which will then decline to 27% next year. Last quarter, the company achieved 41% growth. Through nine months, revenue growth has been 43.5%. My guess is that the results for Q4 will produce revenues that once again are substantially greater than company guidance and the currently published consensus.The current consensus of 31% growth for the current quarter is just what management forecast during its last earnings release. But when the company forecast its Q3 results prospectively, revenues were supposed to be $229 million. They turned out to be $245 million. At one level, I could stop right here. I wouldn't take any forecast that Splunk provides as being its best estimate as to what revenues might be. I would suggest that the forecast represents something like the minimum committed revenues that are contractually committed.Currently the company is forecasting that revenues are going to decline sequentially. Does that seem terribly likely? Just for the record, last year the Q3 to Q4 growth was $46 million or more than 26%. There is no sign that demand has broken down or that the company is shifting to some lower gear of growth or sales execution. Without knowing anything more about the company's business, the sequence of forecast and performance might suggest that investors and observers would be far better served by looking at a plot of the two and using a trend analysis. They will surely get more accurate results.Oh by the way, the company is going to beat the 5% non-GAAP operating margin forecast as well. It is now forecasting 6% for that metric. Splunk's revenue growth is slowing, but by a far lower and less troublesome cadence than concern some observers. Most of the slowing really is a function of more revenues moving to the cloud which over time will actually contribute to the growth of the company.What are the demand drivers for Splunk's solutions and who does it have to beat to remain in a growth mode?As mentioned earlier, the market into which Splunk sells its software is called SIEM. Splunk has been rated the leader in the space for several years now by Gartner in its Magic Quadrant analysis. Its closest competitors include IBM (NYSE:IBM), LogRhythm, Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) and EMC. The company has been the leader in the space since Gartner started writing on the sector - four years as it happens. And there haven't been major changes atop the leader board. An adjacent market in which Splunk has become entrenched is called ITSI-IT Service Intelligence. The company has built modules for its basic technology that are oriented to insuring that IT services are delivered without interruption and that anomalies are tagged before they cause problems. Much like locating a cancer before there are any visible symptoms.Earlier this month, IDC rated Splunk No. 1 in worldwide IT operations analytics for the second year in a row. Splunk's market share in the space is 28.5%. There is no evidence that Splunk's market position is deteriorating. If the company is going to experience materially slowing growth it will be because the markets into which it sells are slowing and because the company is unable to develop additional use cases for its software.Splunk has been developing additional use cases for its log monitoring software since it has been a public company and probably before that. It is part of the way the company operates. Most recently the company has developed a series of products that that develop information about anomalies in the usage of data and are designed to be a part of a security fabric.The company has a wide variety of tools that try to extract value out of all the machine data being created. The company has solutions these days that provide analytics for Hadoop. The company has tools that allow users to make marketing and promotional decisions in real time. It can provide analysis of the data that is being received through IoT sources.Splunk's solutions continue to be used to diagnose operational issues through correlations and it provides proactive warnings by detecting patterns and anomalies. It would be tiresome, I think, to even try to describe all of the use cases Splunk has developed in the past several years. But I think the conclusion that one can readily draw is that the demand environment hasn't deteriorated, it isn't likely to deteriorate and that the concerns on the part of some investors on that subject are dramatically overblown. Splunk is likely to continue to grow revenues above 30% for several more years to come, I believe. I think that growth for Splunk is really a function of the ability of the organization to manage the absolute size of the business and to start to achieve some economies at scale.Profitability and cash flow - the reasons why companies are in businessSplunk has a very long way to go in order to become a profitable company based on GAAP standards, although it does generate positive cash flow. Last quarter, it converted a GAAP operating loss margin of 37% to a non-GAAP reported profit of 7%. Most of this difference was through the exclusion of stock based comp expense. This isn't the appropriate forum to discuss the practice - it is my belief that from a share valuation perspective this company has gone beyond the limits of what most investors find acceptable.The largest area of stock based comp is in the research and development expense segment. In that regard, while Splunk's level of stock based comp is perhaps somewhat of an outlier, it has become a typical strategy these days reflecting employment conditions for companies that are trying to increase their development capabilities. Splunk's strategy calls for rapid extension of its sets of solution and to do so it needs to increase its development capability substantially. It is not going to be easy to control stock based comp expense that will be necessary to attract developers in what is a very tight labor market. In Q3, the company's GAAP expense ratio for research and development reached 35% of its revenues on research and development, compared to 32% of revenues the year earlier. Stock based comp was actually 52% of the GAAP spend on research and development. It seems an obvious comment to suggest that Splunk will have to reform its financial management in the near term in order to start down a path to profitability accepted by most investors. Interestingly, not a single question on the conference call was addressed to that subject.Last quarter the company spent $167 million or 68% of reported revenues on sales and marketing expense. That was better than the year earlier metric when sales and marketing spend was 74% of revenue, but no one imagines that a company in the IT world - or really any other world - can spend much beyond 30%-40% of revenue on sales and marketing and make GAAP profits.Why does a company at this stage of growth spend such an incredible portion of revenues on sales and marketing? It is pretty simple really. While some analysts focused on this company's fiscal 2018 revenue forecast, a better slide to look at would have been the one in which the company provided a cohort analysis of its customers. Five years after initial purchase, the users in the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 cohorts had increased their bookings by 5X and increased their data usage 8X. The data usage upcharges clearly carry essentially 100% gross margins. With 87% of license bookings coming from existing customers, management faces a conundrum in trying to balance growth opportunities and profitability and thus far has come down on the side of growth.Given just how substantially customers increase their consumption of Splunk over the years, it is not all that surprising that the company has chosen to spend an extraordinary amount to acquire customers and to development additional solutions with which to attract prospective users. From an investor standpoint, Splunk is making a decision to maximize potential longer term returns in a burgeoning space. Doing so is going to delay and elongate the path to GAAP profitability for several years.When land and expand works, and it works in spades for Splunk, the logical strategy to employ is to spend lots of money on landing. As it happens, the average order size for this company is only $50-$60,000. Capturing customers of that size is going to be relatively expensive and it will take time before the customers captured will turn into whales. It is a conundrum faced by both this company and by observers but it is a reason as to why the path to profitability on a non-GAAP basis will be long and arduous.Overall, GAAP operating expenses were 117% of revenues in fiscal Q3 compared to 124% of revenues in the year earlier period and to 122% of revenues through the first nine months of the fiscal year. There is progress, just not dramatic progress or the kind of progress that is going to lead to significant GAAP earnings anytime soon.Despite the losses, this company has and is likely to continue to generate a meaningful level of cash flow but no one is likely to buy the shares because of their free cash flow yield. More than all of the cash flow is a product of stock based comp, although some amount of cash flow is the product of the increase in deferred revenues. As the company pivots to receiving more revenue from ratable sources such as the cloud, it seems likely that deferred revenues will rise more rapidly than heretofore but overall significant cash flow growth has to be driven by profits - there is no hidden source of cash flow and because of the company's pricing. Deferred revenues will never be substantial relative to total revenue generation.How will Splunk deal with its conundrumI think that for the most part Splunk will continue to trade off margin performance for revenue growth. During the analyst day, it forecast that it would grow 25%-30% over the next three years and that margins non-GAAP margins will reach 12%-14%. Those numbers are actually somewhat better than they might seem. Over the next several years, the company will transition more of its revenue to the cloud and at least initially the cloud has brought down gross margins by 400-600 bps and it has probably lopped a few points over reported growth  - although ironically both the cloud and perpetual license growth over-performed last quarter. I think that simply through recounting the solution areas in which Splunk creates value suggests that it is situated at a strong growth nexus that if anything is getting stronger. And I think the company appears to have a dominant competitive position within its target spaces.The basic answer here is that the company sees its TAM as $55 billion and it is about to announce a year of $1 billion in billings. It is not going to sacrifice its swing at that market to achieve better profitability - not this year, next year or any time soon. I assume the dilution will slow down from 6%-7%/year to something more modest rate as time goes on, but it is going to be a factor of some consequence because of how this company grows.For the most part the new customer growth has been relatively modest. So, the strategy has to be to sell the new customers lots more products than they initially bought and of course to enjoy the revenues that come more or less automatically because of increasing data usage in almost all customers. And the strategy has to be to sell larger initial orders and to achieve rising ASPs. That can only be done by expanding the use cases for machine data and that means that research and development spend increases are unlikely to abate significantly in the near future.GAAP margin growth and substantial free cash flow margins are not likely to be much in evidence for this company prior to 2020 or beyond. Investors looking for classical valuation metrics will not find them here.I think that the company will grow faster or develop a higher cloud component of revenues than it is forecasting. But it is not going to be able to do that and achieve the kind of substantial profitability that some readers and investors anticipate. Just as there are several different states of matter, there are different kinds of investment. Splunk is one of those different kinds of investment where profitability is going to continue to take a back seat to growth."
4037882,62963,2017-01-20T08:49:50-05:00,Splunk has surpassed $1 billion revenue run-rate.Management has outlined ambitions of reaching $2 billion by 2020.The current valuation is compelling.,"Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a misunderstood stock by the investor community and is significantly undervalued. Splunk is one of our top picks for 2017, and this article will explain why the company is such a high-quality franchise, and why now is a good time to buy.Splunk's transition from a perpetual to subscription model has been a painful one. As illustrated in the chart below, subscription bookings as a percentage of total bookings have increased from 19% in 2012 to 46%.The substantial increase in subscription bookings has been a massive drag on revenue. The drag is caused by realising the revenue using a ratable method over the period rather than upfront. Additionally, as shown in the chart below, Splunk's cloud business is continuing to grow, and will place pressure on its operating margins.As painful as this move to a ratable model is, there are benefits. These include more visibility, recurring revenues and increased stickiness in the business model. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been successful in its transition to recurring revenues, and we would expect SPLK will also make a successful transition.Before we move on to our investment thesis, it's worth pointing out free cash flow will be our preferred method to value SPLK, as it cuts through the mess associated with its transition to a subscription/ratable model.The OpportunityAs illustrated below, SPLK has a massive TAM of $55 billion, and this is one of the biggest TAMs in technology. What makes Splunk unique is it addresses multiple use cases including IT Operations, Application Delivery, Security, Compliance and Fraud, Business Analytics and the Internet of Things.Over time, with the growth of data and the development of additional use cases, the TAM could grow further.Competitive DynamicsSPLK is differentiated in two key ways:1) The ability to collect and act on any machine data with schema-on-the-fly with different people asking different questions on the same data.2) This leads to scale and a vast set of use cases and applications for the product.There are many competitors to Splunk, but none come close to being a true platform like SPLK, except for private company Palantir (PALAN). PALAN appears to focus on the more larger enterprises and government clients and its use cases appear to be a little different. We are keeping a close eye on Palantir, however the market is large enough for both big data platforms to win.Path to $2 billion in revenuesAt Splunk's recent analyst day, management articulated the path to $2 billion in revenues by 2020. There are three key drivers necessary to get there:1) Grow customers from 12,700 today to 20,000 in 2020.2) Grow orders over $1 million from 140 to 300.3) Increase ASPs from $50k to $80k.Given SPLK's massive TAM and key differentiation, $2 billion is certainly achievable, and we would agree with management that this is possible with the current use cases/organic means. We believe the company can achieve this target without acquisitions, which is an indication of SPLK's runway ahead and massive TAM.Valuation ModelThe above table illustrates the gross margins, growth and valuation of Splunk, Adobe, ServiceNow and Salesforce. NOW and CRM are 100% cloud, ADBE's transition to cloud is largely complete, and as discussed, SPLK is facing massive headwinds with its move to the cloud and a ratable model. This means SPLK's growth over the past few years would have been higher if it wasn't for the headwinds mentioned.SPLK and NOW are growing revenue the fastest at around 40%, and revenue growth will slow to around 26% and 30%, respectively, next year. ADBE and CRM are both growing between 23% and 25% currently and slowing to 21% next year.The last column shows the free cash flow multiple of each company, and all are trading between 22 and 26 times free cash flow. SPLK's valuation appears to be exceptional value, as it has rarely traded below 30 times free cash flow.Key RisksAs mentioned earlier, SPLK has a strong competitive position. Some of the key risks include:1) Management articulating the move to cloud and ratable model to the investor community.2) Execution of sales and operations teams on the ongoing move to cloud.3) Palantir competition.4) Management's ability to execute its 2020 roadmap and ambitions.Investment SummarySPLK is well placed to benefit from the secular growth of big data and has a massive TAM to grow into. It is well placed competitively, with a horizontal platform of endless use cases.The secretive Palantir appears to be a threat; however, both platforms should be able to succeed.SPLK is undervalued, underrated and is trading at attractive levels. It has a $1b in revenue run-rate and is looking ahead to $2 billion. We recommend buying at current levels."

The stock has long fought the over-optimism following the post-IPO rally to above $100. My article about a year ago highlighted why the stock wasn't likely to catch a bid this year.Now at $60 in after-hours trading following FQ3 results, Splunk has questionable value, highlighting the problem all along. The stock chart though could provide a key signal of the possibility of a near-term breakout.The biggest issue facing Splunk is one always faced by fast growing companies. Revenue growth in excess of 40% isn't supportable long term, and the market doesn't like decelerating growth.The FQ3 results repeated the theme of the last year where quarterly results and guidance beat analyst estimates, but the absolute growth remains on a downward path. Revenue growth recently peaked over 50% last FQ3.Source: Seeking Alpha earnings pageSplunk generated revenue growth of 40% last quarter, but the company guided to only 30% growth for the current quarter. Sure, the big data firm typically beats analyst estimates by somewhere near $15 million. A similar beat for FQ4 would produce revenue of $300 million to generate growth of 36%.When a huge beat leads to a 400 percentage point reduction in the growth rate, the stock usually has a problem rallying.So while the story on momentum is a problem, the company has some promising numbers. Free cash flow reached $32.3 million in the quarter, up some 50% from last FQ3. Splunk remains on path to easily surpass the $104.3 million in free cash flows generated last year.The problem though is the stock value now tops $8 billion in after-hours at $60. Splunk forecasts revenues that will fall short of $1 billion this year. Due to license revenue, earnings aren't necessary beneficial to analyze, but even free cash flows of $150 million for the year leave the stock aggressively priced at over 50x that number.The stock will tell the story on valuation. Splunk has been trapped in a tight range for years now. A rally above $60 sets up a more bullish view on the stock from a trader's standpoint, but one has to question how far the stock goes as the valuation reaches $10 billion at only $74.Similar comps such as Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) already trade at lower P/S ratios. One has to expect an expansion of the gap in this ratio to justify Splunk heading higher and not owning the other stocks instead.SPLK PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Splunk doesn't offer a lot of value. The stock could head higher on these strong quarterly results, but the risks remain that slower growth crimps any stock gains."

Splunk was founded in 2003 and went public in 2012. They have yet to show profits. In fact, losses and dilution continue to grow which are extremely worrisome. I remember my father telling me a story about a business one of his friends was trying to get off the ground. He told me ""a company that loses money for a year is a business. A company that loses money for two years is a hobby."" Well maybe he was a bit short-sighted as it can sometimes take many profitless years to produce a profit, but Splunk has been around for over 16 years and they still haven't found a path to profitability. In fact, they went from a loss of $11 million in 2011 to a loss of $287 million in 2015. Their trailing 12 month loss is a staggering $340 million.It is very accurate to state that their revenues have been growing at an incredible rate; the CAGR over the last 4 years from 2011 to 2015 was 53%! The problem is that R&D and SG&A have grown at a combined rate greater than revenues - a staggering 61%. This gives the company increasing operating and net losses. If revenues were growing at a huge clip and expenses were growing, but at a slower rate than revenues, this may make sense, but they are increasing losses each year they stay in business.· Chart built by author using data from Morningstar.comIn addition to losses that Splunk can't seem to get a handle on, they continue to dilute existing shareholders. From Q2'15 to Q216 (July 31, 2015 to July 31, 2016) they increased the outstanding shares from 126.6 million to 133 million, an increase of 5.06%. Let's pretend that instead of issuing shares to pay employees they would have paid cash to employees. Since they issued 6.4 million shares and the price right now is around $60 per share this equates to another ~$384 million in costs. If this $384 million was included in SG&A they would have a lost another $384 million to the already large operating loss of $333 million over the last 12 months. This would bring the total operating loss to over 90%; $717 million on $793 million in revenues.In addition to the massive losses and dilution that continue to grow, quarter over quarter and especially year over year revenue comps continue to decrease. As you can see, year over year revenue growth has gone down from 50% in Q3 '15 down to 43% last quarter. It will be very interesting to see what the results for Q3 will be when they release them in November given that the $174 million in revenues in Q3 '15 will be a tough comp. If they continue to see deceleration in revenues it could be a sort of ""watch-out-below"" moment for the stock since Splunk's stock price seems to be levitating based upon their ability to grow their topline.· Numbers come from 8-K filings and calculations by the author.Splunk currently has a market cap of $8 billion and an enterprise value of $7 billion. They have an extremely clean balance sheet with loads of cash so there is no imminent threat of bankruptcy due to their continuing losses, but it will be extremely interesting to watch how the stock continues to trade if they can't find a way to become profitable and continue to destroy shareholder capital."

The cause of this decline is arguably three fold: increased competition has lengthened the sales cycle, pushing Tableau's earnings back; nerves over operating losses against revenue; and a tax and assets setback further contributing to concerns. Additionally, the company blames a changed sales strategy, which it claims has now been remedied, as contributing to market jitters that led to its share price slump.

(NASDAQ:SPLK) develops and markets software which enables its customers to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data. The company's products empower users to collect, sort, index, search, monitor and analyze their data and use it to improve their operations. There are an incredible amount of insightful customer stories on the company's website, here.Specifically, SPLK's software is capable of addressing diverse data sets (""big data"") and is specially designed to work with machine-generated data. Machine data is data generated by software applications and devices across an organization and typically contains a definitive, time-stamped record of various activities, such as transactions, customer and user activities and security threats. The company's products help users in various roles, including information technology, security and business professionals, to analyze their machine data and achieve real-time visibility into and intelligence about their organizations' operations.As more companies look to leverage the data collected across their organizations, SPLK is ideally positioned to provide the software they need not only to efficiently collect and organize their data, but also to produce valuable insights that can be used by managers to increase operational efficiency/profitability.During the recent Analyst Day on 1/12/2017, SPLK management slightly lowered its guidance for the next few years and I believe, positioned the company to ""under promise and over deliver"" over the next 2-3 years. Additionally, I believe management is taking the correct, longer-term view, of investing in infrastructure to support cloud products and realigning sales management's incentive structures to focus on new customer development. As the big data market grows I believe SPLK is positioning itself as an organization capable of delivering value to shareholders. The specific reasons I am bullish on SPLK are as follows:1. Conservative guidance of management has resulted in a good buying opportunity2. Customer satisfaction and focus on new customer growth3. ValuationConservative GuidanceDuring the analyst day, management reset expectations for the next few years by lowering guidance in the near term (FY17-FY18) as the company restructures sales team to focus on new customer acquisition. I believe with the impending growth of the big data market on the horizon, the new revenue targets set by management are well within reason and will allow the stock to outperform when SPLK beats guidance.Source: Analyst Day PresentationCustomer Satisfaction and Focus on New Customer GrowthOne of the most interesting aspects of SPLK's story is that its customer satisfaction rates are stellar. In fact, according to its presentation, it has achieved Maintenance Renewal Rate of over 90% since mid-2014.Source: Analyst Day PresentationAs a result, it has continued to see a significant amount of its license bookings come from existing customers.Source: Analyst Day PresentationThis begs the question... why has it not had more significant New Customer growth? At the Analyst Day, management addressed this issue by announcing it would be restructuring and altering its sales team incentive structure through 2018 to focus more intently on new customer growth. For the first time in a few months, I am excited about the approach management is taking to sales and expect, combined with the growth of the total addressable market (""TAM""), that SPLK will outperform its revenue guidance. Management has projected revenue to be $1.175B in FY18, which I believe is conservative and positions the stock for a bounce on upcoming earnings announcements and positive guidance.Source: Analyst Day PresentationValuationMy price target of $65/share is based on a 6.5x multiple of EV/FY2018E revenue of $1.5B. Assuming a slightly above average peer multiple of 6.5x EV/FY18 revenue - peers include Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), etc. - I expect shares to appreciate to $65/share once management beats guidance over the coming quarters.Source: InternalSource: FactSet and Piper Jaffray EstimatesIn addition to the upside potential, I believe there is a floor under the stock price as it would be an attractive acquisition for a number of enterprise software providers and is relatively cheap compared to the Price/FY+2 revenue multiples associated with recent acquisition targets (far right column in the table below.) Source: Piper JaffrayDownside RisksAlthough I believe SPLK is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing big data market, there are a number of downside risks that could impact share price in the near term.Should management be unable to increase new customer growth due to internal or external factors and/or if existing customer revenue growth declined, the company's stock would be impacted.Additionally, should there be a lull in M&A activity or a transaction be consummated well below SPLK's current valuation, then the stock would be negatively impacted.SummaryWith its strong existing customer base, renewed focus on new customer acquisition and leading position in the growing big data analytics space, I believe SPLK should be able to beat guidance in the near term and consistently boost guidance over the next 2-3 years. Once existing management has proven itself with one or two quarters of outperformance, I believe the company will be rewarded with a EV/FY18 revenue multiple in line/slightly above its peers.Finally, I believe the M&A activity and/or rumors in the space will provide additional support to the share price should any near-term operational headwinds arise."
4011018,48501,2016-10-09T11:07:34-04:00,"Splunk is the leader in the nascent and rapidly growing IT Operations Analytics market.Splunk is also a leader in the Security Information and Event Management Market.At 6.75x FY18 sales, Splunk is inexpensively trading given its growth outlook.","Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) provides software that enables institutions to monitor, search, analyze and visualize massive streams of real-time and historical machine data (big data) coming from a variety of sources.Following Splunk's Q2 earnings release, investors expressed concern about the company's declining gross margin [GM], in Q2 -- 79%. To put the GM in perspective, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has a gross margin in the mid-70s, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is in the high 60s, VMware (NYSE:VMW) is in the mid-80s, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) is in the mid-60s, and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) is in the low-80s. Splunk's GM is at the upper end of the range for software vendors and investors' concern about GM is overblown as the company is investing in staff to support sales that are forecasted to grow at 41% in FY17 and 36% in FY18. Additionally, while Splunk's leadership and some of the Street's analyst are currently calling for an inflection point of GM, I see GM continuing to decline on higher maintenance and service expense, primarily because of continued investment in salary and benefits meant to augment future sales. The divergence between the Street's expectations and actual GM performance could create buying opportunities; conversely, if GM performs as expected, future sales growth could be adversely impacted.Over the next three years, it's mission critical that Splunk continue to maintain its leadership position within IT operations analytics and capture the growth opportunity that lies ahead, which could mean sacrificing some GM. The IT operations analytics market crossed $1B in sales during 2014 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 19.34% to $2.5B by 2019. The total market grew 37.5% in 2015 with Splunk capturing the largest share of the market at 28.5%. If Splunk can grow at about the rate of its core market in that specific product category and gain traction in its secondary markets, then investors could be looking at 25%+ sales growth through 2019.Splunk is positioned in Gartner's leader quadrant for Security Information and Event Management alongside IBM (NYSE:IBM) and LogRhythm. IBM's QRadar Security Intelligence Platform is an attractive product offering because of the robustness of the platform, including the as-a-service option, with IBM providing full management; among the negatives is the required use of third-party technologies for endpoint monitoring for threat detection and response or basic file integrity. LogRhythm is likely to have trouble gaining scale outside of North America because it lacks the distribution channels; granted, the firm's SIEM offering is highly competitive with Splunk's SIEM offering. Splunk's advantage is partly attributable to its position within IT operations; the security attachment is a smooth transition because Splunk Enterprise is already installed. The knock on Splunk is its basic predefined correlations for user monitoring, and reporting requirement relative to the richer content of use cases provided by competitors. Nonetheless, the company has launched a successful and highly rated attachment to Splunk Enterprise.While Splunk faces challenges in terms of improving its profitability, the company's leading position within the nascent IT operations analytics industry and its leadership position within SIEM outweigh declining profitability while the company remains in high growth mode. Consequently, I see Splunk as trading (6.75x FY18) inexpensively relative to the industry (5.2) on a forward P/S basis with sales expected to increase by 36% in FY18. Additionally, the average analyst estimate for FY17 sales is $914.4M, pricing in a substantial slowing of revenue growth during the back half of the year; I see sales coming in at $942M, which is still at a slower rate of growth than the first half of the year heading into the seasonally strong time of year. Simply stated, Splunk should easily be able to beat sales expectations in Q3 and Q4.Cloud, Security and Intelligence Help Drive GrowthSplunk has grown from almost half a billion dollars in sales during FY15 to almost $1B of sales in FY17. While license sales have been phenomenal over that period, growth is really being driven by maintenance and services, including the as-a-service offerings. As previously mentioned, the profitability over the period has deteriorated; in my view the company is operating inefficiently because it is challenging to right-size a company that is growing at the rapid pace that Splunk is growing. I expect an improved profitability picture when the pace of growth slows and management gets a better feel for demand; for example, Splunk Cloud is growing at twice the pace that leadership envisioned.For FY17, I see revenue growing 41% to $942, which is above the Street's estimate. That comes with an 80% gross margin and a -45% operating margin. For FY18, I'm forecasting sales of $1.28B (+36% y/y) with a gross margin of 76% and an operating margin of -45%. Leadership does need to tighten up on operating expenditure by squeezing more out of the R&D and sales budgets.I'm forecasting deteriorating cash flows from operations, but CFO will be enough to cover capital expenditure. The key thing here is that if management doesn't reign in the expenditure as a percentage of sales, then there is an adverse impact to CFO. That will have longer-term adverse implications, but at the same time, Splunk has quite a growth engine going right now and that should be priority number one.There is plenty of liquidity on the balance sheet and no debt. I don't expect management to issue debt any time soon because given the growth profile, there really isn't a need to make a large strategic investment and the cost of debt could be punitive given the profitability profile. Share repurchases aren't likely for the foreseeable future.Fresh Bull Market and Cheap SharesSplunk should be starting a new primary bull market after undergoing a primary bear market that lasted from FY14-FY16. The MACD is showing a bullish divergence and the moving averages are above the signal line, indicating ""buy."" Additionally, the share price is above the 50-week moving average, indicating that the trend is bullish.The profitability-based valuations aren't meaningful because Splunk doesn't generate GAAP EPS and GAAP EBITDA. On a F P/S basis, Splunk is trading at a 30% premium to industry based on FY18 sales that are expected to grow by 36%. The industry's 5-year revenue CAGR is 14.7%, with Splunk's 5-year CAGR being 58.8%. At 8.5x FY18 sales, the share price would be $76.50 or 25.6% higher than the current share price."
4036747,22148,2017-01-13T13:19:11-05:00,Splunk provided FY18 guidance below analyst expectations.The company continues a trend of decelerating revenue growth.The stock could go splat despite all signs that Splunk remains a strong company with a growing market opportunity.,"At an analyst meeting, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) guided towards FY18 revenues below analyst estimates. The difference wasn't material, but any reduction to revenue growth keeps my investment thesis on track.The stock traded down by 2% on the day to close at $56. Splunk saw a decent bounce off the low, but the downside catalysts are in prime view now.The basic thesis for why Splunk has struggled to break significantly above $60 over the last year was the negative trend in revenue growth. As revenue growth decelerates, a stock that trades at a rich multiple tends to struggle.Over the last year, my previous analysis highlighted how the growth rate had trended down from 50% to guidance in the 30% range for this quarter. The longer-term trend is even worse.SPLK Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsNow Splunk guided to FY18 revenues of $1.175 billion. The amount only misses analyst estimates of $1.194 billion by a meager $19 million. The key though is that guidance was for 28% annual revenue growth. Hitting the new target would see annual growth plunge to only 26%.The company has a history of beating estimates, but as Splunk descends to beating lowered guidance, the growth trend is still going to decelerate. Ultimately, the actual results override beating analyst estimates.One of the best ways to understand the story is to view the impact to a similarly valued company that ran into the growth wall. Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) resides in the general big data area and weak results has seen the PS multiple absolutely collapse.SPLK PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsBoth stocks had a couple of years were revenue growth held in excess of 40%. Tableau Software ran into extended deal cycles and saw growth rates plunge to where guidance is only for a growth rate possibly dipping below 10% next year.This scenario might not happen to Splunk, but an investor will want to see the company change the growth trajectory. Decelerating growth has to stabilize in the mid-20% range on an annual basis for the stock to hold the current multiple.Brian White of Drexel Hamilton remains a bull on the long-term story. The total addressable market expanded to $55 billion, but investors have to focus on the facts that Splunk lowered estimates below analysts.The key investor takeaway is that Splunk remains a solid company with a valuation question. As long as revenues are decelerating, the stock is likely to head lower for now."
4005127,61281,2016-09-09T03:47:02-04:00,"Splunk's stock price almost doubled since its February lows and slightly declined after recent earnings.Unlike other big data players, Splunk attracts attention from potential buyers for its  value-added services in the cybersecurity area.While Tableau and Splunk receive most of the attention in the market, Splunk remains my favorite investment in that field.","In the last few years, big data analytics has been one of the hottest sectors in tech investing. Investors have been amazed by the idea that companies have found a way to monetize the unbelievable increase of data that is being used, processed, and stored every second as a result of the incredible adoption of consumer electronics devices and their related usage. When thinking about it, in theory, it's a phenomenal achievement to use this huge amount of data to improve and optimize on many operational fronts and generate a sales increase in the end. The most popular vehicles to benefit from the rise of big data analytics were Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Tableau (NYSE:DATA), which operate in adjacent segments: one in machine-generated data analytics (Splunk) and one in data visualization (Tableau). Both of these companies were such attractive targets for investors in this sector that their stock prices were almost entirely correlated, and the corporate events occurring in one company affected the other one.This is an interesting case as Splunk and Tableau are complementary services and not competing services. For a long period, investors expected and received impressive growth rates from both companies that justified the steep multiples in which they were traded. However, as time went by, Splunk's and Tableau's growth started to slow down naturally as the companies grew into mature software vendors, and investors' expectations lagged behind in a trend that caused several sharp drops in stock prices in the last two years, as shown in the chart below.In the last years, the market increased its expectations from the two companies when Tableau benefitted most from that trend. Compared with Tableau, Splunk seemed like a more solid and stable stock, but both of these stocks yielded very impressive returns for investors. However, when Tableau disappointed the market in a Jan. 2016 earnings release, its stock price dropped 50% in a move that balanced the market's expectations and real growth pace amid normal challenges to expand worldwide, closed deals with mega cap companies, and transferred it from a tech startup to a mature company. To make the move to the next level, Tableau hired new CEO, a former AWS executive, to strengthen the company's weaknesses and lead it forward. In the upcoming months or quarters, I believe Tableau will go through a transition phase as management changes. Then it will take a few more months or quarters for the new CEO to implement his strategy and beliefs fully. As I wrote before, the CEO change by itself is not a reason to go ahead and buy Tableau. Investors should probably wait to see whether or not the change is successful and whether or not it benefits the company in the way investors want.On the other side of that duo, Splunk continues the same trend of progressing. Even though it keeps beating market expectations, and its YoY year growth narrows every quarter, it still maintains itself at a very attractive level as presented below.As major data analytics get bigger and gain more attention, they present an interesting segment for many companies to penetrate. The most significant company that penetrated that segment was Amazon after it started offering essential big-data analytics' tools for its customers. Also, P-E firms find many companies attractive for a strategic acquisition that could later generate enormous amounts of cash. The latest example of this is Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK) that was acquired recently by a P-E firm named Thoma Bravo. It will probably be sold later on in one piece or more to larger tech companies or other P-E firms.As part of that trend, some rumors have reached me in recent years from potential buyers interested in Splunk, from IBM (NYSE:IBM) to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, what differentiates Splunk in my eyes from other big data analytics vendors is the company's broad solution that could be used widely in the cybersecurity industry, which is expected to keep growing as cyber threats increase and cyber attacks become more common than before. In my opinion, that is one of the primary advantages of Splunk compared to Tableau, and it still reflects massive opportunities in the future.After Splunk impressively doubled its stock price since it had bottomed in February, it attracted most of the attention (in my opinion) in the big data analytics market. As I wrote in the previous article, it will not surprise me if Splunk will be acquired either by a tech giant that wants to penetrate this market quickly or by a cybersecurity firm that wants to expand its portfolio. I believe Splunk is better positioned for future growth than Tableau is. Even though the market reacted negatively to the latest results that beat expectations and delivered reasonable YoY growth and higher guidance, I remain bullish on Splunk, which continues to be my favorite big data investment."
4002652,98236,2016-08-28T22:00:33-04:00,Splunk reported the results of its fiscal Q2 late last week and beat revenue and EPS estimates.The shares declined by 10% because the company did not raise Q3 guidance above the consensus (it did raise full-year guidance) due to more ratable bookings.The company saw a couple of downgrades by some less observant analysts.It almost certainly significantly beat its bookings target for the quarter.Splunk has developed a wide range of use cases that immunize its results from the possible slowdown in spending for IT enterprise security solutions.,"A beat by any other name would still be as sweetFor anyone unfamiliar with Chattanooga Choo-Choo, it is the iconic song of Glen Miller and the Big Band era. The train is supposed to leave from Penn Station (NYC) Track 29 about a quarter to four, have dinner in the diner, have your ham and eggs in Carolina, and when you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar, then you know Tennessee is not very far. It is actually a song to which the servicemen of the era were supposed to dance, and it always reminds me of the brave men (and women) who saved our country and the world from fascism and militarism.Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), so far as these things can go, is supposed to be something like that train, leaving every day from Track 29 and getting you to Chattanooga regularly and comfortably the next morning (well, maybe the next quarter is the better time span for Splunk) at some level of comfort and efficiency. The train never really went through Carolina - the Southern Railway of that era sent its train called the Tennessean through Virginia and Knoxville and then on to Chattanooga. As we will see, that is sort of like the route that Splunk's recent quarter might be said to have taken. A bit of a detour, but more from the point of view of optics than business. If you liked Splunk before, but couldn't stand the valuation, this is probably as good a time as any to climb aboard. Our journey is going to start with a review of the quarter the company reported late last week.How was the journey in Splunk's Q2?Well, it was really quite a nice trip, although some of the passengers and their travel agents didn't understand the vagaries of accounting and revenue reporting that were hallmarks of the quarter. I initially wrote about this name back in March. The stock price was $47 per share at that point, and they recently reached a high of $65+ before Friday's unpleasantness. The shares are not really suitable for the queasy - even by the standards of the company's hi-octane brethren, its beta of 2.13X is at the upper end of the range. That being said, the shares have appreciated 29% in the past 5 months even in the wake of the sharp pullback on Friday, compared to the appreciation of the 14% seen by the IGV over the same span. I would not normally choose to write an article about Splunk but for the pullback that appears to be one in a quarter that was bafflingly misunderstood by some commentators who really ought to know better. In point of fact, the growth of the company's business has actually increased noticeably since my initial article, to the point where on a relative basis it is a better value now than it was then.In terms of metrics of the journey, the headlines look pretty promising. Revenues were up by 43%, and the company actually made a little money non-GAAP and generated a bit of free cash flow, although all of that is a product of stock-based comp. The growth in license revenues was 32%, which was clearly considered by some as a kind of a speed bump. The realities are that it was anything but that, but therein lies the some of the genesis of the share price reaction - and so far as it goes, the opportunity for investors.The earnings actually were an upside - although at these levels, that is not perhaps the most important consideration. Revenues increased by 13% sequentially, which is probably not the shabbiest of results, especially as they beat the top end of the prior revenue forecast by 5%. The company increased the number of new customer signings by more than 10% from Q1 to Q2. License revenues increased by 15% sequentially and services revenues increased by 14%.Fuel consumption wasn't all that tragic either. All of the figures presented here are non-GAAP. Gross margins fell from 83% to 69%, although that wasn't really a function of any pricing or expense pressures, as I will discuss below. Research & development expense were at 31% compared to 32% in the year-earlier quarter. Sales and marketing expense came in at 70% compared to 76% in the year earlier quarter. Hey, I said fuel consumption wasn't so bad - not that it was great. General and administrative expense dropped from 20% of revenues to 16% year on year. Stock-based compensation increased by 39% year on year and increased by 5% sequentially. At least a bit of relative progress.The company is building another rather costly station in terms of its South Bay campus. When the Chattanooga Choo-Choo first ran, the Southern Railway built a special terminal at some considerable expense, which has since been turned into a hotel and a tourist attraction. I cannot envisage the same fate for Splunk's new headquarters. It lacks - well, when this article is finished, I will let readers decide what it might lack.Although the company hasn't told us the exact cost of the building, it would appear to be in the range of $30-35 million. The only picture of the new 235,000 sq. ft. complex is that of a back hoe. The background building in the picture suggests this building is definitely not going to break any ground in terms of aesthetics or architectural innovation. The area is said to be ""the premier location in the South Bay with great dining, stores and other amenities, our employees are excited to have such great options just outside their workplace."" Gee, I though employees were excited to go to work to build great products and sell lots of software. But I don't begrudge them their great dining options - we have better here in the New York metro area.The dining car of the train offered some tasty snacks, importantly including additional functionality for AWS, particularly functionality that Amazon EC2 container service has added Splunk native logging, making it easier to run containers at scale. If it tastes good, you shouldn't need to ask the ingredients in the recipe. If the performance of a train is mainly measured by it being on time, then this Choo-Choo arrived in Chattanooga more than a bit ahead of schedule.So where do people think the train might have derailed?The company provided guidance for its fiscal Q3 of $229 million of revenue, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 5-6%. Basically, these estimates were consistent with estimates prior to the quarterly earnings release. Investors have been habituated to quarterly beats and raises, and this was not that. The company did raise guidance for the full year that will end on January 31, 2017, from by about $18 million - 2% more or less, about half of it relating to the Q2 beat and the other half because of more rapid growth.Splunk is a hybrid company in the sense that it offers both on-prem and cloud product acquisition models. It is really not feasible for any company to forecast the rate of its cloud transition on a quarterly basis - I defy any company to have an unbroken string of successful forecasts of cloud/on-prem mix. And Q2 was a quarter in which the cloud proportion of orders significantly exceeded the prior forecast. Cloud bookings were double the level that had been expected. Since the level that had been expected was pretty healthy growth to start with, the actual result represented something significantly in excess of 150% growth.While unsaid during the conference call, Splunk has been assiduous in developing relationships with the three major cloud suppliers, i.e., Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of integrating its engine with their cloud offerings. Given the enormous growth of cloud deployments at all of those 3 companies, it is not particularly surprising that more of Splunk's deployments are choosing ratable deployments. The company has forecast lower percentages of ratable bookings in 2H than it has just reported; to a certain extent, the integration this company has with the large cloud suppliers may militate against that forecast. I really don't have that quality of crystal ball.Cloud bookings do a few things, none of them unique to this company. The revenues from cloud bookings flow into services and not license. The revenues that flow into services are far less than the revenues that would have flown into license, and the change in the mix from license that has mid-90%'s gross margins to services that has gross margins of around 80% puts pressure on gross margins. As I and probably many, many others have written many times before, in the long term cloud bookings will produce more revenue and more margin than a comparable level of on-prem bookings, but the crossover point is 3-4 years, after which the headline numbers will show material improvement.This company just started offering a cloud version of its solution 2.5 years ago. If it were actually to show the kind of cloud bookings growth it showed last quarter, it would almost inevitably take at least another several years before the crossover point became visible - but I doubt anyone, including this writer, believes the results of Q2 can ever again be repeated. (Honestly folks, the quarter wasn't just good - it was spectacularly good, despite what the share price might be saying).Depending on one's point of view, it is surprising, disappointing or a significant opportunity to see experienced analysts who do not understand the difference between on-prem and subscription billings or just how much MORE a cloud booking is worth than an on-prem booking. And to the extent that other observers are confused about the inevitable result on gross margins due to a mix swing from on-prem to subscription, the confusion is an even greater opportunity, I believe.As long as other investors misapprehend that very basic fact, there are great opportunities to trade against that misapprehension, I believe. Just how substantial is the misapprehension? Well, here is a question - the third in a string from different analysts on the same conference call: ""I am curious, are you seeing customers starting to - with regards to cloud bookings, are you starting to (see) customers select one cloud over your on-premise license products; and did you see an uptick in that type of activity this quarter? And then a quick follow-up for Dave (Dave Conte, company CFO), if you were to see a continuation in momentum from your cloud business in the second half, maybe above expectation, how do you think that would impact margin expansion progression over the next 12 months or so?""Now, I have a rather severe hearing disability, although fortunately, I have a remarkable implant - but the answer to those questions really doesn't need great hearing. Just a modicum of concentration. As far as I know, it is pretty standard practice for a perpetual license to cost about 3X-3.5X the cost of a single-year subscription. The perpetual license usually carries a 20% maintenance charge. Much of the time, users elect to buy subscriptions one year at a time with evergreen clauses and sometimes minimums in their contracts. Sometimes the users will pay for several years in advance to secure a fixed (discounted) price - especially these days of zero interest rates. But often, users only pay once a year in arrears.This company, for many reasons, hasn't chosen to try to specifically quantify bookings, aggregate, cloud or anything else. That is unfortunate, but not new for this company. But here is something to note of interest. 4 of the company's 10 largest transactions were based on subscription terms. All of those transactions were greater than $1 million. The math is such that simply those 4 transactions would have subtracted $12 million from on-premise license revenues in this last quarter. I think if analysts had seen that $12 million in the headlines, the share price reaction, and frankly the questions on the call, would have been far different.We would have to know the average length of the signed subscription contracts as well as their value to calculate just how strong the quarter was for Splunk - but the fact is that subscription bookings were double expectations and were 47% of the value of transactions, and that is actually less than the 51% ratable mix in Q1. It might be noted that this was the second quarter in the fiscal year in which the company's subscription business more than doubled.Cloud revenue, as opposed to cloud bookings, has a way to go before it will be separately disclosed. It will need to be more than 10% of reported revenues, and that probably will not be seen until later this year or in the next fiscal year. The CEO said he was not completely pleased by the percentage of business that is coming from Enterprise Adoption Agreements (EAA). But that is more something that has more to do with sales management than sales generation, at least in the short term. (Sometimes users cheat on their usage payments and EAAs, and their concomitant app do help to prevent cheating.)Far from derailing, this train is traveling safely and comfortably at very high speed, and the speed was as high or higher than it has ever been in Q2.Why is this train traveling at high speed where some of the other security vendors are seeing far more difficult comparison?I think it is far harder to provide a great answer to that question, although I will see if I can provide a few thoughts that have nothings to do with trains. What the CEO of the company, Doug Merritt, talked about was a user swing to understanding broad-based security analytics is important. One thing to note is that Splunk is rated the leading vendor in what is called the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) space. So, part of the reason is probably competitive. It would appear that Splunk does security analytics better than its competitors, and that seems to be what customers are looking to have these days. The company has had a fair amount of success with using the analytics as part of a fraud and risk management solution, even though the products it sells are not really labeled to do that. The company has actually been labeled the best fraud protection product for two years running without having a specifically labeled fraud protection product.Another factor cited by the CEO was that the average Splunk customer has 168 independent products, and the ability of the Splunk solution to provide seamless insight in what's happening across that landscape has been a demand driver as well.It is probably worth noting that while most investors and analysts tend to lump Splunk in with all of the other vendors of IT security solutions, users look at the log data for other purposes besides just security. Without going through all of the use cases customers actually look for in buying the stock, the stated percentage that is for security is less than 50%. I tried to outline a significant number of use cases when I last wrote on this company, and focused to an extent on how the rise of Big Data has been a major demand driver. I won't reprise that section of the earlier article, but some common use cases relate to looking at host details and comparing hosts in terms of their efficiency. Many users essentially use Splunk to proactively detect performance issues and take proactive steps to prevent those issues from impacting end users.Overall, Splunk Splunk enables IT administrators to make sense of the large volume of log files that can give them insight into the performance of their networks. Cybersecurity is a relatively newish application, which is why the company hasn't precisely productized the value that log analytics can provide in terms of threat management. There are many applications that are built on top of the data that one can derive from the Splunk engine, and they do lots of different things. But optimizing IT ops is probably one of the primary demand drivers, and Splunk's engine does that as well as anything else that is apparently on the market. In all, what is important is that while there is some correlation, the correlation between the company's revenue growth and the growth of IT security spending is nowhere as close as might be thought in the minds of some investors, and the fact that some IT security vendors have had quarters that have disappointed some hasn't really impacted demand for Splunk's business and is not likely to do so in the near future.I might say that Splunk takes care of requirements that have existed for a very long time in a totally new way, and users apparently feel these new ways of identifying cybersecurity threats are more valuable or better address compliance issues than the traditional firewall solutions.But just like I think there is not likely to be a forecast for ratable percentages for this company on any consistent basis that comes close to being accurate, I also think it is a mistake to try to assign one demand driver or the other to the success this company is enjoying.I think the company has a significant level of sales momentum that grew in Q2, that its pipeline is strong, that its Q2 linearity was normal or a bit better than normal and that its competitive position, at least according to the Gartner MQ, remains at the absolute top of the heap. Users like the value they get from Splunk, and if that value isn't quite security or any other single category, it doesn't indicate there is an issue with demand.ValuationI am going to start out by reiterating that neither this company nor any other is going to be able to forecast the ratable mix with any great degree of accuracy - definitely not quarter to quarter, and probably not much better year on year. And yet, the ratable mix is going to determine many of the headline financial metrics. That is likely to deter some potential share buyers I suppose, but there is no way to forecast something like that - there are far too few specific data points and no really wonderful correlations to use. I am basically going to use Splunk's guidance as the numerators or denominators in my valuation calculations, recognizing that the company has likely underestimated demand and may or may not have a handle on the ratable mix in the 2nd half of this fiscal year. No one can really plot FY'18 - and yet, for a company like this, the numbers for FY'18 are far more important than the numbers in the current fiscal year.After Friday's 10% share price pullback, Splunk has an enterprise value of $7 billion based on 138 million outstanding shares, including full dilution. The forecast that the company provided for revenues this fiscal year, which is embodied in consensus expectations, is $914 million. So that is an EV/S of 7.7X, which is a bit of a discount compared to other enterprise software companies such as ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) that are growing at similar rates and have a similar lack of profitability. The EV/S is 6X. I imagine some of the difference in valuation between this company and so-called peers such as WDAY and NOW is that this is a company with hybrid revenue sources, while the others are pure subscription. I would also say that in particular, WDAY's growth is a bit depressed during its transition to the use of 3rd parties to provide most of the consulting and support for its base. WDAY probably has a few points of higher growth than the headline numbers it reports, when adjusting for that trend.Splunk is forecasting EPS of about $.30 this year, and the consensus for next year's earnings is around $.50. No one is buying these shares because of the company's short-term profitability. ""Normal"" profitability is years in the future, and the number of years in the future is a function of when growth moderates significantly and the company decides to rein in sales and marketing spend particularly. Splunk has a projected business model with 25% operating margins, a little more profitable than forecast by some of the other $1 billion unprofitable software companies that are still in adolescence. I do not think many investors pay lots of attention to those charts where future target spend ratios are discussed. The company, as discussed earlier, spends 70% of its revenues on a GAAP basis on sales and marketing. On a non-GAAP basis, the spend ratio is still 52%. Most of the path between the current non-GAAP level of profitability and that is just above breakeven, and 25% will come out of that line.The company has forecast a cash flow from operations margin of 23%. That implies CFFO of $210 million for this year. Given the construction of the new HQ, free cash flow this year is projected at around $160 million. That is a free cash flow yield of 2.3%. Using estimates for FY 2018, when management will have finished its major real estate investment, CFFO margins should rise by 200+ basis points, leading to CFFO for the year of about $300 million and free cash flow of $280 million. That is a free cash flow yield of 4%, not that unreasonable for a company with growth prospects that appear to be like that of most any other mid-sized software vendor. Is the current share price a gift? Hardly so. Does it represent a decent entry point? I think it does, and I urge investors to take advantage of the pullback. The analysts who cover this name are likely to figure out soon enough that this past quarter was one of the stronger ones that Splunk has had, and that the future looks encouraging as well.The investment case for SplunkSPLK shares are, perhaps, expensive for some observers. And it might be said that with the rapid migration of Splunk demand to ratable purchasing solutions, its story is a bit more complex. But even with that migration, the company still was able to raise full-year guidance. I think it behooves investors to take advantage of the share price impact to initiate or add to positions in SPLK."
3978620,61281,2016-05-30T15:50:01-04:00,"Splunk beat Q1 revenue consensus and increased outlook.Investors are not impressed and concerned about growth, SBC, OpEx and profitability.Splunk will have to handle all these problems sooner or later.I remain cautiously bullish.","The data analytics software vendor, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), reported its Q1 FY2017 earnings last week with better than expected quarterly revenues, in line EPS and an increased annual outlook. This type of earnings news is usually a positive indicator that triggers an uptick in a stock's price and reaffirms a company's growth plan. However, in Splunk's case, investors already know that the company provides a light financial outlook each quarter that will increase later on. Therefore, to understand how the company performed in the previous quarter, investors look to other factors like OpEx out of revenue, SBC growth, margins and profitability trends, and assign greater weight to these factors than whether the company meets the market consensus.Splunk's biggest appeal to investors is the company's rapid double-digit growth as well as being a potential acquisition target by one of the tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and more. I have been following Splunk since it went public in 2012, and I have been covering Splunk on Seeking Alpha since 2014, and throughout this period, Splunk was rumored to be acquired so many times that it became a cloud hovering above the stock, and the double-digit growth is just not enough for investors that look for indicators for long-term sustainable growth.Earnings results for Q1 2017 were not significantly different from previous years' first-quarter results when the top-line figures dropped 15% quarter-over-quarter and grew 48% year-over-year. This is a normal trend for Splunk as Q1 is historically its weakest quarter each year mainly due to the fluctuation in the licenses revenue segment, which accounts for 54% of revenues. Splunk's impressive growth is represented in both revenue segments as shown in the chart below; however, while revenues keep growing in double-digit percentages, the growth pace is slowing down.Obviously, this slowdown is normal and expected for a maturing tech company, but at this stage, investors start looking for balanced financials and a clear path to profitability. When no indication is given about a target for GAAP profitability, it only increases investors' concerns about further potential growth and the future of the company.Each quarter, the company presents new customers, more deals and many new partnerships that drive revenues higher; however, at the same time, OpEx has kept at an incredibly high level, above 120% in the last two years, with no inflection point in sight to reduce the spending. Another aspect of the increased operational spending was the rising cost of revenue out of total revenues, from 10% in Q1 2012 to 21% in Q1 2017.Looking into the drivers behind the amazing growth in spending and incredible OpEx/Rev ratio reveals that SBC played a significant role in this trend. In Q1 2017, Splunk spent more than $90M on SBC, which is 49% of its quarterly revenues and 37% of its quarterly OpEx while Tableau (NYSE:DATA), for example, spent $45M, which is only 26% of its quarterly revenues and 23% of its quarterly OpEx. Looking at the SBC trend reveals that SBC has risen each quarter, in dollars, while the company has tried to keep the SBC/Revenue and SBC/OpEx flat. This methodology only drives SBC expenses higher and the breakeven point further away.After this extensive explanation as to why investors should stay away from Splunk, sharp readers will probably ask why I am holding Splunk long. The answer for this is relatively simple: it provides alpha, and I believe the cybersecurity offering of Splunk is attractive to many companies in both the cybersecurity and datacenter markets. Splunk has a great product with many different usages that customers are willing to pay for and, as evidence, the company is growing its license revenues 52% YoY. Such a high growth rate is something that many companies can only be jealous of and should not be taken for granted. That amazing sales growth that was also supported by the rise of the big data analytics market and the entire cloud and datacenter markets drove Splunk's stock price high and allowed me to generate an 85% return on equity and options.In earlier articles, I discussed my investment strategy regarding Splunk, but I set my PT according to my model and worked according to it while adding some options strategies at the same time. I still believe Splunk is a good long-term investment mainly due to the acquisition potential and the fact that management will have to calm down SBC spending sooner or later just to keep the ship going. I'm sure that Splunk's executives, as well as many other investors, know this, and I know that the company's SBC and OpEx levels are not sustainable under the current growth rates.As an ultra-growth company, when the markets are unstable, Splunk is usually one of the first stocks to plunge. For now, I narrowed down my position waiting for any indication of a significant long-term catalyst or M&A development. Assuming there are no macroeconomic events this year (and it's a huge assumption), I believe the company will generate $940M in revenues, and that reflects a $69 stock price and more than 20% upside from its current price. However, the macroeconomic events in the air and Splunk's stock price reaction to these events prevent me from increasing my position for now."
3959532,100336,2016-03-18T12:29:04-04:00,"Splunk is a great company.It has shown great results and continues to outperform.However, considering the revenue model of enterprise software companies, it seems to be grossly overvalued.","Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is an enterprise software company based in San Francisco, California. It produces software for searching, monitoring and analyzing machine-generated big data via a web-style interface.Splunk's program has a multitude of potential applications and uses. In fact, it is aiming to provide users with ""real-time operational intelligence,"" which is very key for both military and industrial customers. It was founded in 2003 and became a publicly listed company in 2012.Splunk has shown a remarkable increase in consumer base which is evident from the table below:Source :Morningstar.comLet's also look at the profitability position for the last five years:Source: Morningstar.comIt is fairly clear from the chart above that Splunk is completely foregoing its bottom line profitability while concentrating on the top line growth. The company is incurring heavy selling and marketing expenditures which is eroding its profit margin.Before we talk about the valuation of Splunk, let's first understand the typical growth phase and the revenue model of an enterprise software company.A software company mainly earns its revenue from two sources:1. Sale of new software licenses2. Renewal of existing licensesMarket penetration is generally not easy for these companies. Therefore, in the initial growth phase, these companies incur hefty selling and marketing expenditures in order to increase their customer base. They are ready to compromise on their margins and EPS, with a single focus on top line growth. Once the company has a decent customer base, it will continue to earn recurring revenue from the renewal of existing licenses. This income does not require the company to incur any additional marketing, or for that matter, any kind of heavy expenditures, and therefore can earn a huge margin for the company.However, selling new licenses beyond a certain level (say for e.g. once the company reaches the $1 billion mark) is extremely difficult. Basically, the software is very expensive. The customers have to spend a lot of time, money and effort in implementation training their employees on the new software. Therefore, once a company is accustomed to a particular software, it's extremely costly as well as time prohibitive to switch the existing vendor. Also, there is tremendous competition from the established players as well as the new players who will be ready to compromise on the cost front.If you look at the loss to date which Splunk has incurred, it will be impossible for the company to sell its product below a certain price.Valuation:Now that we understand the revenue model of a software company, let's find out which valuation ratio would be appropriate.P/E ratio not a very useful measure for Enterprise Software Companies, especially in the growth phase.The success of a software company depends on how much can it expand its customer base in the initial years. Since typically these companies incur losses in the initial years we will not be able to compute their P/E ratio. However, as soon as the marketing expenditure reduces, and the company does not have any other significant cost, the turnaround is almost immediate and the company may have a higher P/E ratio for a short time. If the customer base does not continue to grow, the company will stabilize at a certain point and still continue to report decent earnings.Enterprise Value/Sales (EV/S) is a better valuation ratioSo, instead of the traditional P/E or the PEG ratio, EV/S is a better valuation indicator of such companies. It tells us how many times compared to the current sales are investors willing to pay for investing in this company.Let's look at the EV/S ratio for Splunk as well as its competitors.Source: Morningstar.comThe above table indicates that Splunk is grossly overvalued. Considering the current losses that the company is incurring, it is clear that the company faces severe competition. It is going to be very difficult for Splunk to compete over time with the new entrants in the market place.Bottom Line:Having said all of the above, I maintain my stand that Splunk is a great company with a strong product. Its existing customers, the increasing customer base and revenues from license renewals will definitely turn the tables around. However, justifying the current valuation for the company is extremely difficult. In fact, on a closing note, it is probably a good idea for investors to evaluate fairly valued companies like Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) for potential investment."
3961236,98236,2016-03-28T02:53:13-04:00,"Splunk shares have been in an extended downtrend since last summer and are selling for 36% less than they were 5 months ago.The company continues to beat consensus expectations significantly and to raise guidance almost continuously.It has a unique and perhaps under-appreciated ratable business model that will, over time, lead to significant levels of product revenue without additional costs.While there are plenty of competitors in the software space, the specific solution set that is offered by Splunk is simply not offered by large or formidable competitors.The level of Splunk's stock-based comp is disquieting and will undoubtedly cause many potential investors to avoid the name.","What's the problem with Splunk's share price?Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) announced the results of its 2016 fiscal year (ended 1/31) on February 25th. The results were a blowout, and two Seeking Alpha contributors were felt impelled to write articles talking about the strengths of the quarter. The articles are concise and to the point, and present much of what happened during the just passed quarter and fiscal year. And yet, the shares basically have done nothing to reflect the strength of the quarter or the forward guidance.Splunk shares did rally somewhat over the post earnings week or so, but by the end of February, the rally was over, and the shares have traded in a narrow range since that point. And Splunk shares had been rallying with the market since well before the earnings release. From the trough of $31 set on February 11th, the shares rallied to $37 before the earnings release and to $47 in the week afterwards. Essentially, Splunk shares, despite the awesome Q4 that was reported, more or less tracked the price pattern of other highly valued momentum names in the software space. The rally, while awesome from the February 11th lows, still leaves the shares down by 19% since the start of the year and down by no less than 36% since they made their high for 2015 back on July 26th.Yes, the shares still are highly valued, at least to some observers, but far less so than they have been at any point in the 4 years or so that this company has been public. Yes, other pseudo competitors have blown up, but that happened before 2/25 - no new news there. And yes, Splunk does not make, nor will it make GAAP profits for some time to come, but it is certainly starting to generate a meaningful amount of cash. I think it is time to examine some of the negative arguments that have apparently been weighing on the shares and try to present the case that Splunk shares are significantly undervalued at their new ""normal"" price. A controversial thesis? Perhaps, but then again, beauty is in the eyes to the beholder, and this beholder sees a lot to like in both Splunk the company and the stock!How does an Investor Play Big Data Analytics?Many investors in tech have heard about Big Data for the past several years. Some will say, ""But Big Data is so 2012."" Others will say, ""But haven't the companies in the space disappointed and been bad investments?"" And still others will say, ""I own Oracle or SAP or IBM, and I get my exposure to Big Data analytics that way."" And finally, if all of the above objections can be successfully answered, the question is, ""Why invest in market leader Splunk? Isn't it outrageously valued both in absolute terms and relative to its peers?""Most of these objections are urban legends that come pretty close to the story about McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and its liability for selling hot coffee. There is, no doubt, some kernel of truth regarding all of the perceived objections to buying Splunk shares, but when one really looks a bit closer, the exact dimensions of the objection seem to shrivel before one's eyes.Splunk is, has been and is likely to remain the leader in what it does which simply put is to ""make machine data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone. ""The key to what the company really does is in the words ""useable"" and ""valuable."" Basically, Splunk is all about data analytics of various kinds and the ability to actually get value from all of the multiple data sources that flow into modern enterprises, but which are totally useless unless they can be catalogued, indexed, and used as part of a predictive analytics platform. The flagship Splunk product also has features that, in combination with other cybersecurity platforms, can help determine if the data being indexed has in some way been corrupted.Splunk has never been a cheap stock using any kind of classical valuation metrics. In fact, the shares are cheaper today than they have been at any time since this company went public back in 2012. The company does spend an enormous amount of money on sales and marketing. It really did spend 82% of its revenues on sales and marketing last year, up from the 76% of revenues it spent on sales and marketing in its fiscal 2015 year (ended 1/31/2015).The people who run Splunk are neither fools or knaves, nor have agendas that are antithetical to shareholder values. The company's initial CEO, Godfrey Sullivan, in fact, managed to sell Hyperion Solutions to Oracle for $3 billion. Almost anyone familiar with that story would have said that Mr. Sullivan succeeded in putting lipstick on one of the nastier pigs in Silicon Valley.The current CEO, Doug Merritt has held executive product marketing roles at SAP, Cisco and a couple of valley start-ups. The company's CFO actually ""worked"" in various personal investing activities, and prior to that, he was the CFO of Opsware when it was bought by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HP). Another very dark night, but a pretty nice bonanza for Opsware shareholders at that time.On the surface, it seems scarcely credible that a company would deliberately go out and spend 82% of its current revenues on sales and marketing. So, why has Splunk elected to pursue what seems like such a ruinous strategy? Basically, the reason why company management is comfortable with that kind of spend rate is that the customers it lands today will almost inevitably spend several times or multiple times their initial purchase on Splunk over the years. The company has a somewhat unique pricing model in that users pay for a fixed amount of data to go through software indexers, and then must pay overage charges when additional data goes through the Splunk indexers. Every year, the volume of data rises at most enterprises by as much as 50%. The bet that Splunk is making is that the huge costs associated with customer acquisition are going to be amortized through the years over a substantially higher amount of revenue than that which is being currently reported. I will discuss the Splunk pricing model in a bit more detail later on, but that model is one of the reasons why the company is likely to be one of the more profitable enterprise software vendors over the next decade.In its last reported quarter, ASPs for Splunk more than doubled from year-earlier levels. The basic reason for the steep rise in ASPs is that Splunk offers an option called Enterprise Adoption Agreements (EAA), which, in return for much higher fixed prices, does away with ratable overage pricing. EAAs cost far more than standard Splunk licenses, and while their adoption is very far from universal, they led to record number of large deals for Splunk last quarter.That being said, ironically, Splunk booked 53% of its business - an all-time record for the company - on ratable contracts last quarter. While the EAAs might seem to limit growth upside, at least for the customers that sign them, in point of fact, data volumes and use cases are growing so fast that they typically slop over the contractual limits of the EAAs.Hindsight, to be sure, is 20/20. But if we might all look back on the decisions this management has made to spend a fortune on S&M and to use non-GAAP measures in measuring profitability, I think we are likely to find that the tactics were correct and will have led to great results for investors!I really thought that the boom in Big Data was over? Didn't a whole host of competitors' crowd into the space, and aren't users discovering that the benefits of Big Data analytics were overhyped, and that Big Data projects often are big embarrassments that cost lots and do not deliver?You remember that old story that ""he who represents himself has a fool for a client? What Splunk does is relatively complex in that it takes several quite different processes and integrates them into a single, easy-to-use application. It is used to be that there were a variety of software companies which were organized and thrived on doing pieces of what Splunk does. Just to name a couple of examples that come to mind, Ascential Software, long since bought by IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), and Informatica, bought by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) just a year ago, did data integration. The BI vendors, at one point, were said to do some of the things that the company, does today and they have long since been bought as well. And Splunk produces what are called data logs that are used by network security vendors to measure potential threats to the data being aggregated. In fact, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Splunk have joint, tightly integrated solutions. To some extent, the current firewall technology depends on statistical logs in order to be successfully implemented.As it happens, Splunk's biggest competitors are really not Oracle or IBM or SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), but homegrown data logs that produce primitive and custom analytics. As a user, you could go out and buy pieces of software from loads of different vendors to do what Splunk does and attempt to build a Big Data analytics solution internally. Most Big Data projects fail because the users who try to develop solutions using consultants and bits and pieces of software from multiple vendors essentially have themselves as clients and get generally predictable results.Perhaps Big Data analytics doesn't get the hype that it might gotten 4 years ago, but the fact is that the amount of data that needs to be somehow filed and cataloged and used keeps growing exponentially. That hasn't changed, one customer specifically mentioned on the Q4 conference call started with Splunk, with a multi-gigabyte per day license. Fast forward a few years, and the license is now up to an exabyte per day. Now, it obviously isn't every customer which grows quite like that. But the point is that this customer started with Splunk with a license that was in the range of $40,000 and has now signed an EAA for in excess of $10 million. It seems likely that whatever Splunk paid to onboard that particular customer was really worth the cost - the amount of selling required with a customer like that is negligible after they decide to standardize on a supplier of packaged logs and analytics.The latest Gartner survey says that the amount of data generated globally will increase tenfold over the next 6 years, doubling every two years. I will not speak to what kinds of data are getting created and what kinds of data needed to be indexed securely, but the fact is there are really very few areas in the enterprise software world that have such a powerful demand engine undergirding growth.I think it is important to understand what it is that this company does that is different than the stack vendors, who certainly all have solutions in the space. First of all, Splunk is neutral as to data source. Most very large users have multiple vendors of application software whose output is machine data. To the extent that they can index data at all, they do a very poor job in indexing data from sources that are not part of their own stacks.But, of course, the biggest issue is one of speed. The stack vendors are simply not set up to index data nearly as fast as Splunk or, for that matter, any of the specialized data indexing vendors. Splunk spends what can only be described as an unprecedented proportion of revenues on R&D. What the company has apparently gotten for the investment is technology that dramatically reduces the number of filers necessary to index the transactions. On the call, management spoke to reducing the required number of filers by 60% in two years. The BI vendors have simply not tried to spend the money necessary to create solutions that do what Splunk and its far smaller peers are trying to do.When the company first started, I wondered for quite some time how it was that it would do a job that the BI vendors were supposed to do and had been at for a decade or more. But I think it is quite evident that, to use a rather pedestrian phrase, Splunk has simply been eating the lunch of the BI vendors in the data indexing space, and more and more users are beginning to believe that they ought to be indexing and analyzing all of their data.Simply put, Splunk does not have the competitors that it might be expected to have, the market continues to expand at breakneck speed and the torrent of data is rising rapidly. Big Data may command far less press than heretofore, but it hasn't ceased to be a significant user priority.But I thought Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK) play in the Big Data space as well. Why did those companies blow up last quarter, and how do I know Splunk won't blow up for the same reasons?I don't propose to write a treatise on the different missions of the three vendors. But think of it this way. Tableau and Qlik are companies which want to put their software on every desktop. Splunk wants all of the data of an organization to be processed by its software. Other than the fact that all of the companies involved deal with data, there really aren't analogs. Qlik and Tableau do grab data from different sources, and they do have some basic analytic capabilities that can tell users if the source of the data might be corrupted. But the goal of both the companies is to develop apps that allow desktop users to visualize the data and to create usable graphs and charts of various kinds to visually represent data as part of decision support systems. The software that Tableau and Qlik sell is not designed to index data, it isn't designed to ensure that the data is being charted or graphed or whatever comes from pure sources, and that threats to the data have been statistically analyzed.For Qlik and Tableau to grow, they have to sell more and more seats of their technology to users. The reason that Qlik Sense, for example, is thought to be a potential savior for Qlik is that it is cheap enough and easy enough to use so that it expands the market to more and more desktops. I have written that for me, trying to get more and more users within an organization to be able to visualize data is really a counter-intuitive sale. I really do not think it is necessary or even desirable for every knowledge worker in an organization to deal with data visualization. It is a job far better left to data analysts and professionals than it being ""democratized.""For Splunk to grow, the enterprise has to use more data and have more use cases. No one cares how many desktops use the software - the pricing is based on how much data is indexed per day. It is simply far, far more difficult to persuade more and more users that they need to put data visualization tools on more and more desktops than it is to tell a user that the volume of data flowing through the Splunk indexers has doubled or trebled or something like that, and it is time to get a new license.At this point, 70% of Splunk's revenues are coming from existing customers who are developing more use cases and processing more data. The customers themselves do the selling. I do not think something like that will ever happen in the market for data visualization tools. If Splunk never sold another new name account, it would continue to grow for some years, and to the point of some observers, it would be far more profitable. If either Qlik or Tableau stopped selling, they would destroy their financial models, such as they are, within a brief span.Again, Splunk sells much of its software on a ratable basis. Qlik and Tableau do not and cannot, and therein, is the huge difference between what the companies do and why Splunk is far less likely to blow up than the companies who are perceived by some as competitors.How does Splunk compete with its rivals, and why should it continue to maintain the competitive advantages it has enjoyed?I think Splunk is a company that, at its scale, really lacks direct competition from the larger software vendors. Management maintains it has an 85% win rate, and I am inclined to believe that statistic, since CEO Merritt said that an 85% win rate is a sign that the company is simply not engaged with all of the potential customers who could use its product.Another factor is that Splunk actually partners with many of the companies that might be thought of as potential competitors. For example, at this time, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is probably the company's most important partner, and it has other strategic relationships with both Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and EMC Corp. (EMC). All of those companies might be thought of as potential competitors, but they are partners instead, and these are real partnerships in the sense that the Splunk solutions are part of overall solutions sold by those companies, and their salesmen get both quota credit and normal commissions for selling its solutions.Splunk does face numerous competitors, but most of them are companies you have never heard of before and are unlikely to hear of in the future. An industry publication called DataFox Digest listed 8 Splunk competitors. It doesn't really attempt to rank the competitors by functionality. But what strikes one in considering the list is just how small the competitors are. They are all still funded by VCs, and their funding is quite small.Another industry publication called Quora recently put together list of potential Splunk competitors that was developed by its readers, who are mainly IT professionals. As one reviewer suggested ""I have tested other solutions from the other vendors and there is always something missing."" One manager who responded to the survey said that HP ArcSight and LogRhythm are the two strongest competitors in the space. While I recently wrote a positive article on HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), I do not imagine there is any observer who imagines that HP, at this time, is going to be effective in terms of competing with a company that has a strong sales and marketing effort.LogRhythm is a security intelligence company. It monitors what is called log data and network and endpoint monitoring. While it is in the leader's quadrant in the Gartner analysis of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), it is said to be significantly behind Splunk in terms of completeness of vision.To be fair, both Tableau and Qlik are listed by another market research firm TrustRadius as competitors in the SIEM space. The users said they loved the products and reported that they presented excellent homegrown functionality. I think the issue really is that while Tableau and Qlik are focused on visualization on the desktop as a core strength, Splunk's core competency is in data analytics and data security. There isn't a one-for-one match-up.At this point, none of the more logical suspects really offers either software or appliances that compete directly against Splunk. IBM is said to be a leader in SIEM, but if you want analytics or a broader base of functionality, you have to go elsewhere within the IBM offering before you can build a solution. At this point, neither Oracle, SAP nor Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are said to compete in the SIEM space.Even large companies have limitations on all of the development projects they can undertake. I think it is relatively obvious that the priorities of large competitors these days is to improve their cloud offerings and not to worry so much about adjacent markets like SIEMI think that the major takeaway in considering Splunk competitors is that for a variety of reasons, none of them really is likely to derail Splunk's overall go-to-market strategy anytime soon.But isn't Splunk still expensive, and why does it have such a minimal level of even non-GAAP profitability?No one is likely to confuse Splunk with a value investment as it is classically defined anytime in the near future. And the company does not enjoy the specific benefits that I see in subscription models that generate lots of cash and lots of recurring revenues. Splunk has offered a cloud alternative to its on-premise software for a couple of years at this point, and it partners with AWS and others, where it provides the vendors of cloud-based services with the tools that users want in terms of SIEM and analytics. But so far, the company's major revenue stream is license revenue, which made for 61% of total revenues last year. The percentages are changing, but not precipitously. In the prior year, the company got 63% of its revenues from licenses. We really don't know precisely the percentage of cloud revenues, and it is certainly less than half of the balance of revenues not coming from licenses, as services still makes up the preponderant share.Splunk is growing its top line rapidly, and it has lots of momentum. But other companies in other spaces are growing rapidly as well. I think the underappreciated and not-so-secret sauce in this company's business model is its ratable pricing. Last quarter, 53% of Splunk's deals were done on its ratable model. As I mentioned earlier, Splunk has a variety of ratable options, but the standard contract essentially allows users to designate sources from which data can come, and then indexes the data so it can be analyzed. A typical Enterprise license will specify how much data a user can index per calendar day. Enterprise licenses are standard software on-premise licenses modified to provide for a fixed level of indexing volume. If more data goes through the indexers, the user has to pay tiered fees.Given the growth in the volume of data generated by most enterprises these days, it is almost inevitable that users wind up paying significant overage fees at some point during the course of their agreements. Not all customers pay overage fees, of course, as they may have purchased adequate capacity initially, or more likely they have been pushed into EAAs. And we don't know the statistics for overage fees either, as the company doesn't disclose that type of revenue breakdown. But we know it is substantial, based on the answer given by the CEO to a question, during the last conference call, regarding the composition of the company's business mix. ""That big transaction that I talked about earlier in my prepared remarks is a great example where they actually came back more than a year in advance and consumed-made sure they were able to consume significantly more. And that was a transaction that when it was assigned, the people though oh my gosh, that looks like it's just going to cover them forever."" Just to make a bit of sense of the answer, what the CEO wanted to say was that a customer who wasn't yet consuming the maximum data throughput actually back to re-up a year earlier and significantly upped their data consumption levels, leading to a very large sale that was unexpected by the sales people.To my mind, the growth in data volumes is basically a force of nature at this point, and investing in Splunk will certainly provide investors with the most direct correlation to the rapid rise in aggregate data volumesOne thing that the ratable model does is to delay the timing of some revenues. In the instance cited above, that was mitigated because the user actually wanted to stop paying overage fees and opted for a new license more than a year prior to the termination of the old agreement that brought them to another consumption tier. When users elect to buy more data throughput than they actually use, then Splunk does not account for all the revenue immediately, even if it is billed and paid for. While the company has nothing like the deferred revenue balances relative to its size that subscription vendors have, it has seen some increase in product deferred revenues that have shown up in operating cash flow.Splunk's EAAs are very tiered, and the company has reduced, and will continue to reduce, the entry level into the new tiers to accelerate the adoption of its software into more use cases. As a result, it is even hard to hazard a guess as to how valuable new customers are going to be. But this model is, in some ways, the exact opposite of the traditional software business model. When customers buy a database license from Oracle, it is good for a certain number of seats. Almost everyone winds up buying more seats than they need, and even if that is not the case, the growth from installed customers is small. Users do develop new applications, of course, and the seat count can grow in other ways, but it isn't a significant component of the revenue stream.With Splunk, the opposite is true. Almost all of its customers are going to consume more data over time than they signed up for. They will either start paying substantial overage fees or renegotiate their license to allow them to consume more data. It would be nice if I had some kind of data that would allow readers to figure out just how much a typical new customer is really worth to Splunk. But it is this phenomenon, i.e., the extremely rapid growth in revenues per customer over time, that has led the company to spend so much of its money on sales & marketing expenses. If one looks at sales and marketing expense on a static basis, of course the 82% expense ratio is extraordinary and not sustainable. But if one takes a look at the revenue dynamics engendered through customer acquisition, investors would actually want Splunk to spend more on S&M than it does, since it will generate so much additional revenues from the new customers that it captures as to more than mitigate the current seemingly undesirable expense ratio. It is this phenomena, at least to me, that makes the shares look like a bargain.Obviously, the people who run Splunk are not unmindful of shareholder concerns about generating real reported net income. As the CFO commented during last quarter's call, ""the Splunk model has lots of built in leverage and at our scale you are going to see some leverage."" There are some signs that the company is beginning to rein in the growth of its S&M expenditure growth, although, admittedly, not from the numbers that were presented in the earnings release press release. The company reduced the growth in its quota carrying head count to 42% last year - a bit less than the growth in license revenues, and substantially less than the overall growth in product revenues, some of which are now going into the services line. It will be a balancing act between growing the user base to take advantage of the overage fees and in improving profitability.Management guidance for the current year is for 32% overall revenue growth, and while that rate was a significant increase in guidance at the time it was given, it means growth in the current fiscal year is to drop significantly from 48% last year. The CFO said that the guidance was adjusted based on the financial turmoil seen in the world markets during January and concerns about deteriorating global macro economic conditions. Indeed, the Splunk forecast that informs consensus expectations is that most of the growth would take place in the latter half of the current fiscal year. Despite - or in some sense, as a concomitant of the expected growth slowdown - the company is forecasting non-GAAP operating margins in the current year of 5%, up from 3.8% in the prior year. But unlike some stories out there, this will never be a margin story until it ceases to be a hyper-growth story. The plan, as articulated by the CFO, is to increase non-GAAP operating margins by about 1-2 percentages points per year. That is a bit better than it might sound, as the company will gradually be getting an increasing proportion of its revenues from subscriptions, which will depress short-term revenues and margins.Stock-based comp is not a minor item for this company, and I imagine the level of stock-based comp will deter some readers from considering an investment in the company. Stock-based comp was $283 million last year, which was over 40% of revenues. At least that was down a bit from the 47% that was recorded for fiscal 2015. I imagine that over time, the company will continue to reduce its stock-based comp as a percentage of total revenues, but it would be foolhardy indeed to expect such expenses to be less than 20% of revenues for the foreseeable future.Splunk's other operating expenses are far greater than most observers might expect for a company of this scale. G&A is 18% of revenues. That is at least 50% above what would be considered normal for a company of this size. R&D is an extraordinary 32% of revenues. Most software companies spend half of that or less on development. So, there is really loads of operating leverage lying in plain view at Splunk. It is really a question of when and at what rate it chooses to pull the profitability levers.Splunk is starting to generate a significant level of cash flow. For the year, the company generated $156 million in operating cash flow, up 51% from the prior year. Most of the cash flow is coming from stock-based comp as well as a significant increase in the deferred revenue balance, which was up 48% over the prior year, reflecting both the nascent cloud revenue stream, coupled with an increased proportion of revenues coming from EAAs, where some of the revenue is deferred until the customers fully utilize the capacity that they have bought.The company's free cash flow was $104 million last year. Free cash flow was depressed last year due to one-time facility purchases, including the company's SF headquarters. It will be similarly depressed in the current year because of the build-out of Splunk's Silicon Valley campus. Normalized expenses for capex are unlikely to exceed $20 million/year after this year for the foreseeable future.Splunk has a lengthy record of beating and raising estimates, and I have little reason to believe it will not be able to do so this year, and so far as that goes, for the estimates analysts have made for fiscal year '18. Overall top line growth should continue to exceed 30%, absent any pronounced swing to cloud deployments. There is just so much potential leverage in the company's business model that, at least for the next few years, EPS will be more a matter of company choice than anything else. Splunk is forecasting non-GAAP EPS of $.28 this year, and that is up 25% since before the earnings release last month. I would be surprised if the real numbers weren't significantly greater, although they will not enough to make this any kind of a value stock.Some final thoughtsHow much do you value a company with a unique business model that is growing at 30%+ and ought to be able to continue to do so for the at least another several years? How much is the built-in future revenue from overage fees worth to an investor? How much is the company's potentially enormous operating leverage worth to investors? And to what extent should the shares be penalized for its excessive use of stock-based comp?I would be the last person to suggest that there is some formulaic right answer to those questions. Some readers are going to look at the level of stock-based comp and be completely turned off from any further consideration of Splunk as an investment vehicle. Some investors are going to be really enamored with the huge future revenue potential of one of the few really ratable pricing models in the software industry. And some investors are going to wonder how long Splunk can exist in a hot market without attracting far more formidable competitors than it currently deals with.Many years ago, I worked for BMC Software. Why is that relevant? Well, BMC basically charged users in those days based on the MIPS, i.e., the size and power of the CPU that they owned. In other words, there wasn't a set price for the software products that the company sold - all of the pricing was predicated based on how many MIPS the user had deployed and that were being ""managed"" by BMC Software. It was really a license to print money, and of course, for some years, the company did exactly that. Of course, BMC spent relatively little on sales and marketing - it offered 90-day trials and telesales, and its R&D budget was constrained, to say the least. In the long run, that latter point did in the company.That particular issue, i.e., spending too little on R&D, is not going to haunt Splunk anytime soon. It spends an extraordinary amount on people, even by the standards of a San Francisco-based software company. A rough estimate is that Splunk spent over $400,000 per employee last year. That is probably 1/3rd higher than typical employment costs go at software companies these days. Most of that extra amount is stock-based compensation. I think the combination of more profit-focused financial management, coupled with a rising proportion of revenues coming from overage payments will change those statistics over time.I am not suggesting to readers and investors that Splunk shares are in the value category. But they are significantly cheaper than they have ever been since this company has gone public, and the outlook for what the company does has as much or more promise than has ever been the case. The shares are quite volatile, and they aren't defensive. But, in my opinion, Splunk is the best way to play the continued data explosion that seemingly has no end point in sight."
3976579,101584,2016-05-20T05:30:46-04:00,"After starting the year off in slump, Splunk is set to rebound.Splunk is a leader in a growing industry and has a superior product line than its peers.Technical indicators and option chain market outlook imply that the company is in good position to continue its rally.","After a promising beginning in the years following its IPO, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) has hit a fairly rough patch this year. Despite its promising sales and revenue, investors have had trouble overlooking its net losses and the rate at which they are increasing. Yet, it seems as though the whole market has decided to overlook where all this money is going. The company is currently throwing all of its money into sales and marketing, an essential money-suck for companies looking to grow quickly in an already competitive but growing market. This sell-off has lowered Splunk's stock price that makes right now a great buying opportunity. Below is its stock price chart since its IPO. As you can see, it has had some slight recovery since its trouble at the beginning of the year and I expect this to continue.To start, let us take a look at the company's financials. The gross profit margin is increasing at an impressive rate. In a business focused on growth, net income is often a secondary goal. This is what we are seeing with Splunk. As shown below, gross profit has increased 44.9% YoY which shows that its increased spending on marketing is increasing its growth rapidly. In addition, its gross profit margin is currently 83% vs. 85% in its previous year. While this may seem like it is moving in the wrong direction, the company's ability to keep its impressively high gross profit margin while growing at this pace is a promising sign for the future. What makes Splunk such a valuable growth proposition is how it is positioned in the market. While open-source systems might be useful for small companies to be able to analyze their systems and gather data. This becomes more difficult to do as companies grow. The open-source formatting does not scale to the degree that Splunk's systems do. However, many of the systems that are able to do data analysis for large scale systems don't scale down to be valuable to smaller companies. This ability to range from small scale to large scale effectively gives Splunk a leg up. For companies that are growing quickly, using Splunk offers them the ability to grow without fear of outgrowing their system analysis methods. This not only puts Splunk in a position to earn business from small companies but gives them an edge in the larger scale market by allowing them to retain these companies as they grow. We saw how this opportunity can manifest itself in Zillow's (NASDAQ:Z) decision to move to Splunk from open-source systems. Zillow represents one of the larger online companies and could be the first of many to make the switch as data analysis becomes more and more important.Splunk is not only in position to succeed fundamentally, but also represents a good option technically. Splunk recently (May 18th) exceeded its 50-day moving average in a bullish manner. This is true with many of its technical indicators as shown below. Another great indicator of the stock's potential future movement is market sentiment. The most data-driven way to look at this is its option chain. A quick look would show that the Delta of the stock price hitting $55.50 (a $5 increase) by June 10th is approximately .3 or 30%. Meanwhile, the same movement in the opposite direction ($45.50) has a delta of .23 or 23%. This means that the market has a positive asymmetric risk/reward view on the near-term future of Splunk's stock price."
3707736,22148,2015-11-23T18:54:44-05:00,"Splunk crushed quarterly results, yet the stock declined.The big data market opportunity remains intact and the company continues to raise revenue guidance.The recommendation remains to sit on the sidelines until the risk/reward situation turns more favorable.","When a company crushes quarterly numbers and guidance and the stock drops, one big concern remains with the stock. In the case of Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), the big data analytics company has a further issue of a CEO switch.The stock has seen a stable to up trend since the collapse in early 2014, typical of hot IPO stocks in the last few years. The big concern with so many of these tech stocks is that the quarterly revenue numbers are a magnitude smaller than the market caps. Should investors use this post-earnings dip to buy the stock?Market OpportunityThe prime reason that Splunk and data analytics buddy Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) keep generating blowout quarterly results is the relatively low penetration of big data tools along with the large intent of enterprises to shift spending to the segment.Splunk itself lists a total addressable market of $45 billion. With revenue not even on tap to exceed $1 billion next fiscal year, the forecast of Splunk confirms the market data included in my investment thesis.At the time, Snowflake Computing conducted research that found only 5% of enterprises had fully deployed big data strategies. This compares to 41% of companies that had done nothing but acknowledge an interest in big data.The market opportunity makes it clear why investors remained interested in the stock and awarded Splunk a lofty valuation, but the biggest problem with the stock was the over-hyped value.Size TrapAs my last investment thesis all the way back in April highlighted when the stock traded at $63, the valuation was too stretched for a rally. In the time since that call, Splunk has done nothing but raise guidance and watch the stock trail off.As the below chart highlights, the revenue guidance for FY16 has gained this year from $615 million to now over $650 million. The forecast for next fiscal year is on the rise as well while the stock declines.SPLK data by YChartsNormally, a stock would see a strong rally in that situation. The problem is that Splunk has a market cap of over $8 billion while the sales guidance is only $650 million. Even the FY17 guidance is only $850 million. One might start considering the proposition of owning the stock as the P/S multiple dips below 10.The only problem with such a scenario is that one must assume Splunk hits a market cap of $10 billion to generate a 25% return from this level. So if the stock drops to 5x forward sales forecasts, a shareholder loses 50%. If the stock jumps to roughly 12x forward sales, the investor makes 25%.The risk/reward in this scenario doesn't add up. This exact scenario is a prime reason that the stock struggled all year.TakeawayThe inability of Splunk to catch a bid after another strong quarter further highlights that the stock valuation is too lofty. Not to mention the CEO switch never helps, though the current CEO shifting to the chairman position is the least disruptive option. The reward in owning Splunk at the current valuation still doesn't justify the risk."
3896126,61281,2016-02-15T10:58:12-05:00,"Big data analytics vendor Splunk will report its Q4 2016 earnings next week.Splunk’s stock price sell-off accelerated after Tableau’s earnings.Most of the potential fluctuations are already baked into the stock price, and valuation is attractive, but investors should be careful before adding more shares.","The big data analytics company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) will report its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results next week following the massive sell-off in enterprise software stocks. For a long period, earnings results of the data visualization company Tableau (NYSE:DATA) are used as an indicator of Splunk's earnings, which usually report a few weeks after Tableau. This unique relationship between Splunk and Tableau goes beyond only statistical correlation. It is also based on the fact that both companies are leading pure-play big data players - their products are complementary to each other, and they service the same audience.Even though I was very bullish in my previous coverage of Spunk and Tableau, I mentioned a few times that investors' expectations of these companies are unrealistic. Both of these companies traded with high multiples that reflected the potential growth investors applied to investing in these stock. However, it also reflected the embedded risk in investing in these stocks. Unrealistic expectations drove Tableau's stock 45% down after the company reported a 42% YoY top-line growth that was followed by weaker guidance than analysts' consensus. For Tableau, it's the second time in a relatively short period that the company has experienced a double-digit plunge in stock price after releasing its financial reports - it also happened for the company's Q2 earnings. When investors expect a company - no matter which company - to grow in double digits YoY every quarter and hike guidance every quarter, they are inflating a bubble. No company could maintain that pace for very long.After the recent, disappointing earnings report by Tableau, Splunk's stock price dropped 15% and completed a 58% plunge from July 2015. As shown in the chart below, this is the second time that Splunk has experienced such a sharp drop since the company went public in 2012. In 2015, it took Splunk's stock three months to hit a bottom while in this case Splunk's stock has been dropping for seven months, and this is probably not the bottom of the sell-off yet mainly due to the global stock market's weakness.As the big data analytics market grows, more companies want a piece of that growth - IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are in different stages of penetrating and gaining market share in this field. Introducing new solutions by big tech companies does not mean that market share and revenues of small pure-play companies like Splunk and Tableau will be affected. However, when these companies have much deeper pockets than pure-play companies, and they offer many complimentary services like infrastructure, ERP, CRM, storage and more to their network of clients, they are well-positioned to have successful penetration.The competitive landscape became much more complex for Splunk and that it could impact financials in the long run. There are currently many rumors of possible companies interested to acquire Splunk to expand their big data analytics offering that includes Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), IBM and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), but investors should not invest in Splunk based on possible future acquisition as these type of rumors go on for years. The current situation of Splunk may resemble Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) or 3D Systems a few years ago. They were great companies with great growth potential that were blown out of proportion by hype, and when their growth started to halt, their stocks plunged. Of course, there are many differences between the big data analytics and the 3D printing markets, but many aspects of buzz, stock price appreciation and investors' expectations are similar.I still believe Splunk is very strongly positioned in the big data analytics market, and big data analytics is the future of enterprise software, which means it has incredible growth potential. The recent sell-off brought Splunk's stock price roughly to the area where it closed on the first day of trading - and four years later, Splunk generates x10 the quarterly revenues it used to, $200M instead of $20M. This fundamental change improved the company's P/S ratio to 6.7, which is much more reasonable than the company's P/S ratio of 20 that it traded at for a long time.The current consensus is that Splunk's revenues for the 2017 fiscal year will be $854M, a forecast that reflects a share price of $45 and assumes a 6.7 P/S ratio. The current share price (at the time of writing) takes into account Splunk's likelihood of following Tableau and issuing soft guidance for next year and the market's reaction to such disappointing guidance. This is mainly because, in the beginning, Tableau's earnings serve as an indicator of Splunk's earnings. As most of the change is already baked into the current share price, I believe that Splunk's stock price will fluctuate slightly as a result of its earnings. The current P/S ratio is attractive, and the company still has impressive growth potential. However, investors should be very careful about adding more Splunk shares because of what we witnessed in the 3D printing market. I remain long SPLK, with a bullish outlook, and I'm not planning to make any changes in my position for now."
3940136,61281,2016-02-29T11:00:30-05:00,Splunk reported Q4 2016 earnings last week and surprised the market with higher than expected results and strong guidance.The correlation between Splunk and Tableau is fragile and begins to break.I remain bullish on Splunk.,"Data analytics company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported its Q4 2016 earnings last week with better results than expected and provided strong guidance for fiscal year 2017. The Splunk earnings report came just three weeks after another big data player, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) - the visualization segment leader - reported disappointing results that triggered an industry-wide sell-off in big data and enterprise software stocks. In recent quarters, Tableau's results were used as an indicator of future performance of pure-play big data companies like Splunk, Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK), Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP), New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) and more. When Tableau reported its Q4 2015 and issued soft guidance for Q1 2016, many used it as an indicator of an upcoming wave of underperforming pure-play big data companies that will end in a sharp drop in stock prices.As I mentioned in an earlier article, in Splunk's case, Tableau's disappointing results accelerated a downtrend that was already in place and reached a massive 58% correction in stock price. Splunk traded at around $30, the lowest range that the stock was traded in since it went public and more than $40 below its stock price one year ago. Contrary to expectations, Splunk not only beat on EPS and revenues but also increased its fiscal year 2017 guidance and dismissed investors' concerns of a continued correction and accelerated slowdown.As shown in the chart below, Splunk has grown its top line revenues (and each segment) exponentially in the last six years, which created high expectations with investors that Splunk will continue to present amazing double-digit growth rates for a long period. However, with the recent uncertainty in the market, the general technology stock correction, and a strong indication from Tableau's earnings results, Splunk's Q4 2016 results caught investors by surprise and triggered a 16% rally after hours and impacted other big data players including Tableau itself.In my opinion, there is more to this earnings release than the financial results and guidance for next year. This is the first quarter that we see that the correlation between Splunk and Tableau is fragile and starts to break. For a long time, Splunk and Tableau were mentioned and analyzed together as they are similar companies competing in the same segment. However, the latest developments in the visualization market, along with a number of tech giants penetrating that field and the amount of investment required for a global expansion, start to unveil the differences between the companies.While competition in machine-generated data analytics also grows as it has in the visualization segment, Splunk's dominance is not yet at risk, which enables the company to continue its expansion plan, expand its customer base, and generate record high revenues in Q4 2016 and fiscal year 2016. However, as Splunk continues to grow rapidly, tech giants that operate in the big data market like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), etc., might be interested in accelerating their efforts to penetrate that market. For now, since Splunk is worth $5.5B, I don't believe that a full cash-only transaction is a reasonable scenario. However, a cash and stocks transaction for a big portion of the shares is a valid scenario in my opinion. Having said that, every year rumors of a possible acquisition are raised so I will analyze this further.Beyond the incredible QoQ and YoY growth rates that Splunk presented, it also increased its license ASP, increased the number of large deals in a quarter, increased its number of partnerships, expanded its customer base and added some big names like Shell, Bloomberg, and SoftBank. Improvements in these factors reflect a fundamentally sustainable growth that highlights Splunk's unique positioning in its niche, strengthens its competitiveness, and determines its unofficial leading pure-play big data vendor title. Splunk provided improved guidance for fiscal year 2017 of $880M annual revenues. This number reflects a 32% YoY growth and a share price of $59 which reflects an additional 40% upside from the current price. I remain bullish on Splunk with a $59 price target. However, I remain very cautious about adding more shares due to the current unrest in the markets."
3978251,76505,2016-05-27T10:59:08-04:00,"Since I initially wrote on Splunk last year, the stock hasn't performed all that well, falling from about $75 to $55.Furthermore, the stock has shed some more value after its latest earnings report.While the stock hasn't performed as well as I had hoped, I still believe in the growth story at Splunk. Valuation may have caught up to the company somewhat.Splunk should be able to get back on track within the near future, and may start attracting the eyes of M&A departments in larger IT firms.Splunk is going through some growing pains at the moment and is wisely sacrificing some in the short term to invest in its future.","San Francisco, California-based Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) hasn't exactly met my expectations since my initial write up on the firm. Since July 2015, the share price has declined from around $75 to where it stands today at about $55. What's more, the price has dropped further after the company's latest earnings report, adding insult to injury.(Photo credit: Bloomberg)To understand what happened, let's take a look at why the market reacted the way it did, and whether it should be of material concern to Splunk investors and potential shareholders.The Last QuarterAs I summarized in my prior article, Splunk is essentially a machine data software provider. Their products help governments and private industry organize and use massive chunks of data effectively and efficiently. Splunk's business model is split into two main parts: licensing revenue and maintenance/service elements. The appeal of Splunk's software rests largely on its ease of use as well as its multitude of applications.Splunk has been able to best analyst revenue forecasts for the past six quarters - quite impressive. However, the market didn't take too kindly to their last quarterly report. Despite Splunk delivering a quarterly revenue increase of 48% year over year, to $186 million, the stock got hammered in after hours to the tune of 8%.Let's break down the results to see why. The $186 million figure was split between the two segments of the company: licensing revenue and maintenance/services. Both saw quite healthy growth year over year: 41% and 57.9% growth, respectively. While Splunk exceeded their own estimate that revenue would come in between $172 million to $174 million, they did not meet guidance for operating margins.Unfortunately for Splunk, operating loss came in at $1.4 million, or an adjusted operating margin of negative 0.7%. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, Splunk turned in a net loss of $100.9 million, or $0.77 per share. But on an adjusted basis, which excludes items like stock-based compensation, Splunk's net loss was a much narrower $2.6 million, or $0.02 per share.Keep in mind that this adjusted per-share loss actually came in at precisely what analyst consensus projected. Furthermore, revenue significantly exceeded said estimates, which projected $174.1 million. The stock still fell after the earnings release, however, probably in part due to some investors being tired of Splunk's sideward trending stock price not keeping up with the firm's strong revenue expansion. But to me, this selling is shortsighted and represents bailing from a ship that is far from sinking.Just last quarter, Splunk was able to broaden its user base by about 450 new enterprise customers, with big names like the University of Virginia, Chipotle, Tesco, Clemson University, Chicago Public Schools, World Bank Group, and U.S. Courts being added to the firm's clientele. Also, the corporation has maintained a commitment to foster growth through an increase in research and development (up 50.7% to $67.4 million) as well as sales and marketing (up 42.3%, to $145.2 million). This short-term, up front investment does hurt operating margins somewhat now, but provides an invaluable foundation for future growth.The Potential for RecoverySo how can Splunk bounce back from this drop? Perhaps the most obvious and achievable ways in the short term is to meet is boosted guidance. For the full fiscal-year 2017, Splunk has increased its guidance from $880 million to between $892 million and $896 million.To me, the firm's raised guidance for the year's outlook is a reaffirmation of the strength of the business model and should help ease concerns for now. Management still believes they can not only hit their previously set revenue and margin goals, but actually exceed them. If Splunk is able to hit these new goals in stride, the stock will be a bargain at these levels.But that is an admittedly big if. I'd begin to be concerned if Splunk's margins contract more over the next few quarters, as the company needs to prove it can and will be profitable. If the higher revenue keeps coming at a larger up-front cost, that would show the company isn't able to keep costs down, which would be a warning sign.As of now, however, there's no need to be overly worried yet, especially considering how substantially Splunk has been able to boost its revenue. The aforementioned marketing and R&D costs have not been spiraling out of control or unreasonable. With the margins miss being relatively small last quarter, Splunk appears to be well-positioned to meet or exceed the raised guidance. In an era where many big-name tech companies or tech initial public offerings struggle to produce consistent revenues, Splunk is in a comparatively favorable position.As Steve Symington of the Motley Fool writes, ""Long-term investors should be content as Splunk continues to consciously forsake bottom-line profitability in favor of successfully driving the top-line higher, and taking market share in these early stages of its growth story.""Buyout Incoming?Something else investors should have on their radar is the potential for a Splunk buyout. A couple years back, rumors swirled of a Splunk-Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) marriage, but that did not materialize. Perhaps another big name in the IT industry, like IBM (NYSE:IBM), might be interested in picking up Splunk at these lower price levels.Why would this make sense for IBM? Well, IBM is currently struggling to find ways to increase its stalling revenue. What better way to do that then bring the Splunk team on board, which has been able to engineer some outstanding organic revenue growth with technology IBM has been working with?An objection to this is that Splunk might be too pricey for IBM right now. As Mark Holder writes,Keep in mind, however, that Holder wrote this nearly 6 months ago. The market cap has decreased somewhat since then (to around 7.2 billion) and may go down further after the time of this writing.Furthermore, what I don't see in Holder's argument is a unique, warranted reason as to why Splunk would be an ""immaterial"" addition to the firm. He simply crunched some numbers, deemed 1% of revenue to be ""insignificant,"" and moved on. Maybe if you look at the situation purely from a monetary standpoint the argument might make sense. But the key to a Splunk-IBM deal is in how IBM could integrate Splunk's software in its quest to be a major player in the Internet of Things. Right now, you'd be hard pressed to put a price tag on that as the growth potential is enormous.Brian Nichols has a great argument to the contrary and makes some good points as to how Splunk could help rejuvenate IBM. Splunk's software is precisely what a company like IBM needs to be able to track vital data for an increasingly interconnected Internet of Things economy. Whether the deal will happen or not is hard to say, but I think the chances are decent enough that Splunk will be scooped up by some larger tech firm due to the success of its core product and the numerous applications for what Splunk does.ConclusionI still believe that Splunk is a good growth story in the making. While its stock performance over the last year hasn't been awe-inspiring, the share price is somewhat disconnected from its improving financials and positioning for the long-term. The stock hasn't matched revenue growth, probably in part due to admittedly high valuations.But management has a wise outlook and healthy perspective on Splunk's current state and ability to expand, which are especially valuable traits in this market climate. Whether through an acquisition or a continued growth trajectory on its own, Splunk is a company to look into, especially after the post-earnings drop. Especially in the context of a potential acquisition, as long as Splunk is continuing to see improvements in customer numbers and revenue, the company should do fine."

However, I will revisit my short-term thesis after Tableau’s earnings.","Machine-generated data analytics company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is expected to report its Q3 earnings at the end of November in light of Q2 earnings and increased guidance. Over the last three months, the company's stock price has lost around 25% since its peak at the end of July 2015 (shown in chart 1 below), and it's currently near the 52-week low price.I have covered Splunk a number of times in the past (article list available here) laying out my bullish thesis extensively in many of the previous articles. However, as the market is in a correction mode right now I thought that Splunk might be worth another look in the current environment. In brief, Splunk is an ultra-growth company with an average quarterly revenue growth rate of 14% quarter-over-quarter and 61% year-over-year. The company provides big data analytics solutions for machine-generated data that could be used for a variety of purposes, from user behavior to IT analytics to cyber security. Splunk leverages its market leadership position and offers to its customers a comprehensive solution that includes visualization, advanced cyber security and various productivity features through a wide net of partnerships and alliances with other market and segment leaders. As shown below, Splunk continuously increases its revenues each quarter and has a clear and distinct quarterly revenues trend.Splunk has two known habits that relate to each other: the company usually beats its guidance each quarter and also increases its revenue guidance. Investors already anticipate this behavior and the market expectation for a bigger beat and bigger guidance increases every quarter. These habits have created an unrealistic expectation from Splunk to beat and increase every quarter. However, as we saw in Tableau's (NYSE:DATA) case, any slowdown in the pace of growth could drag the stock price down drastically. The recent sell-off in Splunk's stock price that was mentioned above probably helped to reduce some of the unrealistic expectations from Splunk toward upcoming earnings. However, investors might receive slower growth rates than those presented above as disappointing, and the stock could easily lose more of its value.In earlier articles, I mentioned a number of times that a price range of $50-$55 is attractive to enter a Splunk position. However, under the current sentiment in the market when investors look for value instead of growth in their investments, Splunk's fall could continue until the market correction finally settles. While I believe the current price is attractive, I highly suggest, for investors looking to enter Splunk, to purchase a small quantity now and enter additional small buy orders for $52, $50 and $48 to benefit from a possible additional sell-off in light of the delicate situation with the company's earnings next month.Usually, earnings results of data visualization company Tableau can serve as an excellent indication of Splunk's results ahead of earnings. Tableau reports at the beginning of November, so I will revisit my thesis right after its earnings."
3360825,24157,2015-07-27T15:18:12-04:00,"Unprofitable business faces multiple threats.Negative ROIC leaves little pricing power or flexibility.Already high valuation, even taking into account a potential acquisition.","In early 2012, Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) burst onto the scene with one of the biggest IPOs of the year. As the first in a new line of ""big data"" companies to go public, Splunk was seen as a trailblazer in an exciting industry. Since then, the stock price has ridden the hype and is up more than 320% from its IPO price of $17/share. This price increase should raise serious concerns for astute investors. A combination of profitless growth, an unattractive pricing model, and overvaluation places Splunk in the Danger Zone this week.Just Another Revenue Growing Tech CompanyMuch like Twitter, a recent Danger Zone feature, Splunk is similar to many other tech companies that boast impressive revenue growth but fail to turn any of it into profits.Since 2013, Splunk has grown revenue by 51% compounded annually. In contrast, net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) has fallen by -220% compounded annually from -$21 million in 2013 to -$211 million in 2015.Figure 1: Profits on the DowntrendSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsSimilar to Demandware (NYSE:DWRE), another recent Danger Zone stock, Splunk's widening losses come from costs rising much faster than revenues. In 2015, cost of revenues and research and development expenses grew by 91% and 99%, respectively, year-over-year (YoY). Sales and marketing expenses also grew by 60%. These cost increases dwarf the 49% revenue growth Splunk achieved in 2015.With negative profits, it's no surprise that Splunk has never earned a positive return on invested capital (ROIC). Splunk's ROIC has declined from -36% in 2013 to -39% in 2015. Pre-tax operating margins (NOPBT) have become progressively worse as they have fallen from -10% in 2013 to -47% in 2015.Some would argue that Splunk could achieve profitability by reducing sales and marketing and product development expenses. Even if these two expenses were cut in half, Splunk would be left with NOPAT of roughly $25 million. This value is miniscule considering the company's market cap is over $8.6 billion. The largest market cap for a company that earns $25 million NOPAT is XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO), which has a market cap of only $3.5 billion.Increasing Competition From All AnglesMany competitors have jumped on the chance to claim their own share of the big data pie, including tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ). Compared to Splunk, these companies provide a much larger set of solutions that cater to a variety of big data needs across a corporation. For example, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, Azure, provides not only data analytics, but also networking, virtualization, cloud storage and web/mobile app development all rolled into one suite. In a survey conducted by Computing magazine, 56% of respondents preferred large generalist vendors while only 14% of respondents preferred small specialist vendors.Due to their greater infrastructure and scale, these tech giants possess two key advantages vs. Splunk. First, they have more resources to develop new products. Second, they have profitable businesses that can offset initial losses from expanding into a new business. Splunk's losses are not sustainable.Figure 2: Splunk Pales in Comparison to CompetitorsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsSplunk also faces competition from other specialized software vendors. Sumo Logic is a vendor that directly competes with Splunk in log management and analytics software. The private company, which offers an affordable and highly accessible cloud-based platform, is rapidly threatening Splunk's market share. Sumo Logic recently reported customer base growth of over 300% and increased bookings by 400% year-over-year.The open-source log analytics platforms offered for free could pose the biggest challenge to Splunk's ability to ever achieve profits. Elastisearch BV's ""ELK Stack"" is one of the most powerful open source platforms currently available. When it comes to functionality, ELK can process and analyze various types of data just as efficiently as Splunk. With over six million downloads, the open source provider needs to monetize a mere fraction of its users to top Splunk's 9,000 customers.Furthermore, Splunk already has 79 companies in the Fortune 100 as customers. Even with such an impressive customer base, the company sees accelerating losses. This situation places Splunk between a rock and a hard place. Splunk can either continue to spend heavily on growth, further deteriorating profits, or it can cut down expenses, which would leave the company making measly profits from existing customers.Threats to Splunk's Already High PricesWe're not here to dispute Splunk's product quality. When it comes to data processing and analytics, IT professionals rave about Splunk's power and efficiency. They are not big fans of Splunk's pricing model, however.Instead of charging a flat price, Splunk bases prices on daily indexing capacity. While the company reduces the price per gigabyte for larger licenses, the bottom line is that the more data customers require, the more they will have to pay.Not only does this model turn off many would-be customers that expect to process large amounts of data, it also adds a factor of unpredictability to clients' expenses. Given a choice, most businesses will take predictability over unpredictability. For example, when compared to VMware's (NYSE:VMW) Log Insight, which charges based on how many locations from which data is gathered, rather than by data volume, Splunk seems less attractive. Splunk should be in the business of supporting growth in big data, not penalizing it.Bull Case Overlooks Business Model WeaknessesMuch of the bull case for Splunk focuses on huge expected growth of the big data sector in upcoming years. There's no arguing that big data is expanding at a rapid pace, but investors often get caught up in the hype and overlook company fundamentals as well as potential industry changes. As the big data industry grows, analytics will become an increasingly commoditized product. A commodity service leads to price wars, and Splunk has neither pricing power nor positive profit margins. Look for Splunk's profits to keep declining as management has warned that the company may not be profitable in the future and even expects operating expenses to increase over the next several years.Stupid Money (Buyout) RiskThe strength of Splunk's technology and software potentially makes the business a strategically sound target. However, with a market cap of $9 billion, only a few potential suitors exist. Back in early 2013, when Splunk's market cap was just over $3 billion, there was much chatter about a potential buyout by IBM (IBM) or Oracle (ORCL). Given that this possibility fizzled out when Splunk was less expensive, we think it is unlikely that a large company will move to acquire Splunk now that there is more competition, many suitors have developed their own products, and SPLK is three times as expensive. Moreover, even if an IBM or Oracle were interested in acquiring the business, it is only financially reasonable at a much lower price per share as we explain below.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we have made several adjustments to Splunk's 2015 10-K. The adjustments are:Income Statement: we removed $7 million in non-operating expenses hidden in operating items. One key adjustment made was the removal of $1 million in non-operating income, consisting mainly of interest income. After removing this non-operating income hidden on the income statement, net adjustments totaled $6 million. Despite removing expenses, Splunk's NOPAT remained negative.Balance Sheet: we made $883 million worth of balance sheet adjustments to calculate invested capital. The largest adjustment is the removal of $486 million in assets related to mid-year acquisitions. This adjustment equals 54% of reported net assets.Valuation: we made $412 million worth of adjustments. The largest adjustment to shareholder value is $289 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities. These liabilities represent 3% of Splunk's current market cap.Valuation Ignores Reality - With or Without Being AcquiredOptimism about Splunk's potential to be acquired has helped drive the share price to new heights. We believe the acquisition hopes are blind to the facts about just how expensive the stock is under multiple acquisition scenarios. First, the basics on how expensive the current valuation is: to justify its current price of $73/share, the company must raise its pretax (NOPBT) margin from -47% to 5% and grow revenue by 30% per year for the next 22 years. While this expectation is extremely optimistic, it doesn't account for the possibility of a tech giant, namely IBM or Oracle, purchasing Splunk. To evaluate this possibility, we create two different scenarios.Scenario 1: IBM acquires Splunk. In this scenario, upon acquisition, Splunk's NOPAT margin and ROIC would immediately rise to IBM's 16% and 13%, respectively. After these formidable improvements in profitability, Splunk still must grow revenue by 20% compounded annually for 40 years to justify its current price. A more realistic price IBM might pay for Splunk is $4/share, which is the value of the business based on the NOPAT in year 1 of the acquisition.Scenario 2: Oracle acquires Splunk, and Splunk immediately achieves Oracle's NOPAT margin and ROIC of 29% and 25%, respectively. Even in this more optimistic scenario, Splunk must still grow revenues by 20% compounded annually for 18 years. A more realistic price Oracle might pay for Splunk is $11/share, which is the value of the business based on the NOPAT in year 1 of the acquisition.No matter which way you look at it, the expectations baked into Splunk's current stock price are simply too high to warrant investment in the company.Catalyst for SharesSPLK experienced heavy selloffs after the past two quarterly announcements despite beating earnings both times. As a result of its overvaluation, not even significant beats can meet the high expectations for revenue growth embedded in the stock price. Considering this stock action, just a small miss on earnings in the upcoming quarter could send the stock plummeting.Short InterestShort interest stands at 10.2 million shares, or over 8% of shares outstanding.Insider SellingIn the past 12 months, insiders have bought 200,000 shares and sold 1.9 million shares, for a net of 1.7 million shares sold. This represents 1% of shares outstanding.Executive Compensation Unrelated to Profits, Focus Mainly on RevenueAs long as leadership gets paid based primarily on revenue and not true profits, we can expect more of the same poor financial performance.In addition to their base salaries, Splunk's executives receive a short-term cash bonus and long-term equity awards that are tied to company defined goals. Cash bonuses for sales executives are based mainly on the achievement of target bookings, with some weight given to individual performance metrics such as in increase in the number of customers and increase in international revenue. Cash bonuses for non-sales executives are based on the achievement of target revenues.Starting in fiscal year 2016, long-term equity awards for executives will be given as a mix of 50% restricted stock units and 50% performance share units. These awards are determined with equal weight on revenue and operating cash flow percentage relative to revenue growth. Because of the implementation of a revised compensation plan this fiscal year, none of Splunk's executives, except the newly hired Senior Vice President of Field Operations, received equity awards in 2015.Dangerous Funds That Hold SPLKThe following ETFs and mutual funds allocate significantly to SPLK and earn our Dangerous or Very Dangerous ratings.Disclosure: David Trainer and Max Lee receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, or theme."
3323885,24663,2015-07-14T09:32:35-04:00,"Analysts are praising Splunk's acquisition of Caspida.
        Not only can Splunk now address cyber issues, it can also identify threats quickly.
        This makes it a direct competitor to FEYE.
        The difference is that SPLK is still a fast-growing company in big data analytics.","Just about every analyst has praised Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) for its $190 million acquisition of the security company Caspida, a Palo Alto-based startup. Personally, I tend to agree that the acquisition is transformative for the big data machine analytics company, a move that could put it head-to-head against FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) of all companies, and establish itself as the superior investment..First and foremost, you have to understand what these two companies do, and how similar each company's respective approach is. FireEye provides a transcendent cybersecurity service that both detects and eliminates advanced persistent threats. This is possible because it has a network of more than two million virtual machine-based security platforms that work together. Once a threat has been identified on one machine, it alerts the others. Therefore, FireEye's platform continues to evolve, and becomes more advanced as the threats grow more advanced. In other words, FireEye collects data, learns from that data, and adjusts accordingly.Meanwhile, Splunk has always been seen as a machine data analytics company. It creates data from essentially anything that's considered a ""machine"", like computers, servers, websites, smartphones, etc. Splunk then uses that data to help its customers make more informed business decisions, such as knowing when and how to successfully market a product, or the smartphone use patterns for a certain demographic. Splunk uses this data like all data analytic companies, it just happens to focus on machines.With that said, Splunk's new focus is security, which really fits the company well since cyber threats occur within servers, computers, or other devices that are connected to the web. Splunk's ability to analyze machine data lets customers know how to respond once a breach has been identified. This is possible because of the data that Splunk obtains from devices, knowing what worked in past instances to eliminate threats. This business is a big deal for Splunk, accounting for one-third of Splunk's $125 million in revenue last quarter. Notably, Splunk's security business hardly existed at the beginning of last year, but is now seen as a key element in the company's sub-50% top-line growth.Nonetheless, the one thing that Splunk has missed is a way to detect threats early and fast. This is what differentiates it between FireEye, as both companies use data analytics in their cybersecurity platforms, just differently. FireEye relies on a network of two million virtual machines to produce data, and Splunk relies on things that it defines as machines. However, like I said, Splunk still needs a way to identify threats early so that its services can be effective, stopping a threat before it becomes a real problem. That's where Caspida comes into play.Caspida uses pattern recognition, algorithms, and behavioral analytics to identify malware and advanced persistent threats (APTS). Notably, the identification of APTs is what made FireEye so famous a couple years back, as that used to be their core business service. Like FireEye, Caspida's software can notice when there is an intruder searching for sensitive information, and can identify other threats by finding patterns against the norm. It then alerts the customer, and now, this technology can be used with Splunk to eliminate the threat.Therefore, Splunk is starting to look very much like FireEye. That said, if you want to invest in either company, you must pay for it. Both companies have created just under $500 million in trailing-12 month revenue and trade between 16.5 to 18.5 times sales. However, those big valuation premiums reflect an enormous opportunity for growth.Last year, there were more than 42 million reported cyber-attacks worldwide, a near 50% increase year-over-year. As a result, global spending on cyber security rose 8% last year to $71 billion, and is expected to grow 8% both this year and in 2016. Importantly, the need for malware protection, firewalls, etc. have created this large market, but it's new technologies from the likes of FireEye, and now Splunk, that is driving growth in this industry. Therefore, one could argue that Splunk and FireEye have an equally big opportunity to grow much larger as the need for advanced cyber-security services soar.In my opinion, the big difference between Splunk and FireEye besides cybersecurity is that Splunk is also a direct investment in the rise of big data analytics, selling data to businesses that hope to learn from such information. IDC figures that the amount of collected data will surge 10-fold between 2014 and 2020 as the number of connected devices grows at an equally impressive rate. That means that Splunk will also collect more data, thereby making its services more valuable to customers, thus creating upsell opportunities. In total, big data analytics is expected to grow from a $60 billion market last year to $115 billion in 2019, becoming one of the fastest growing large industries in the global economy.As a result, if I had to pick one company over the other, I'd definitely go with Splunk. While FireEye has built a reputation for being a highly advanced cybersecurity firm, I expect Splunk to do the same, as its acquisition does appear to be a game-changer for the company. Already, various research firms have expressed similar beliefs, saying that Caspida opens new doors for Splunk and not only creates upsell opportunities but makes Splunk a legitimate competitor in the cybersecurity industry. This, combined with the existing opportunity to sell big data analytics, is why I would buy Splunk over FireEye following the acquisition of Caspida."
3423156,61281,2015-08-10T12:48:30-04:00,"Data visualization leader Tableau reported better than expected earnings at the end of July.Investors’ expectations were too high for the company, and that triggered a sharp correction in its stock price.Splunk and Tableau are usually highly correlated, and Splunk investors should be prepared to benefit from such a correction.","Data visualization market leader, Tableau (NYSE:DATA), reported its Q2 2015 earnings at the end of July, beating analysts' expectations for revenues and EPS by 65% and 40% respectively year-over-year. Moreover, Tableau also increased its next quarter and full year guidance. In any other sector, in any other industry, and in any other company, Tableau's stock would have risen after such strong financials, not necessarily by double digits, but even a modest increase in price to represent an increase in demand for a company that has beaten guidance and expectation for a while. However, Tableau and Big Data are not operating under regular conditions.In an article I published in May, just before Tableau's Q1 2015 earnings, I discussed investors' unrealistic expectations for Tableau. Investors became accustomed to Tableau beating revenue expectations by almost 18%, with more than a 70% year-over-year rise. In that article, I described my concerns that investors' appetite for growth might not be correlated with the company's business cycles and feasible growth. Currently, the company beat guidance and analysts consensus in 16% and 13%, respectively, while ending 75% higher year-over-year. I got hammered on social media while Tableau's stock price rose above $100, climbing all the way up to $130. A fantastic rally by the data visualization company.However, it seemed to me that, as another quarter went by, and the earnings and impressive YoY growth only fed the expectation that excellent results in Q2 earnings would drive Tableau's stock above $130. Unfortunately, this is the time when a reality check comes to visit and cools down the unrealistic expectations for Tableau.I think that Tableau is a great company with a great portfolio and incredible growth potential, but investors' expectations are simply too high. As seen in chart one below, Tableau has beaten analyst consensus and company guidance in the last six quarters at an average rate of 13% and 16%, respectively. In Q2 2015, Tableau beat consensus and guidance in only 6% and 9%, coupled with 'only' 65% YoY growth, which triggered market disappointment for Tableau.I believe the strong 25% sell-off is a healthy correction toward a gradually more vigorous increase than happened in the last few months. At the same time that Tableau soared on earnings and buzz, another big data player was directly affected - Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK). The big data analytics company is the pure-play market leader in the analytics industry, while Splunk and Tableau are two of the most prominent pure-play companies in the big data sector. Historical earnings taught us that Tableau's results can serve as an excellent indicator of Splunk's results.I believe that, like Tableau, Splunk will beat estimates but with more modest figures than investors are used to seeing. According to my Splunk revenues model, the company will report $142M of revenues in Q2'16, which is 2% above guidance and 1% above consensus and represents a 40% year-over-year growth. Like in Tableau's case, this might trigger a sharp sell-off and a drop in the stock price if investors do not cool their expectations of Splunk.I reiterate the price target of $81 previously published (accessible via this link), and I believe that a sharp sell-off will present an appealing entry point to Splunk. Tableau, in turn, might experience a very sharp sell-off, which will represent a very attractive buying opportunity. I set my buy orders at $65 and $60 to benefit from a likely correction."

3475216,24663,2015-08-28T13:55:48-04:00,"SPLK and DATA have both reported second quarter earnings.DATA has officially closed what was a wide gap in both revenue and free cash flow between it and SPLK.SPLK remains the more valuable company, but DATA will soon surpass SPLK in just about every metric measured by analysts and investors.","In choppy post-earnings trading, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is currently 3% lower after reporting its second quarter, although the stock still sits about 6% higher over the last three sessions. Overall, Splunk had a strong quarter, beating revenue and EPS expectations and adding 500 new customers to top 10,000 total. However, while Splunk remains a force to be reckoned with in data analytics, it's still an inferior investment when compared to Tableau (NYSE:DATA).Both Tableau and Splunk have now announced calendar second quarter earnings, and for two companies of near similar size, the performance couldn't be more different. Let's take a look at a few key metrics from the second quarter of both companies, metrics that are watched closely by investors in the data analytics/ data visualization space.In reported revenue, Splunk and Tableau are just about neck-and-neck. But in terms of growth, Tableau is on a completely different level. As you can see, Tableau and Splunk are just about even in terms of expected revenue for the full year. This is an amazing accomplishment for Tableau because last year it reported $412 million compared to Splunk's $450 million. The year before that, Splunk reported $300 million in revenue and Tableau created just $230 million. In other words, Tableau is closing that gap fast, and showing no signs of letting up. For 2016, analysts expect Tableau to report $860 million in revenue, about $50 million more than Splunk. Hence, Tableau has been gaining on Splunk, and will soon surpass its annual revenue, as seen below.Granted, Splunk is a slightly more profitable company than Tableau on a free cash flow basis, but like everything else, Tableau has quickly gained in that arena too. Next year, Tableau will likely surpass Splunk's annual free cash flow.DATA Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsAll things considered, for companies like Splunk and Tableau, profitability is not typically the valuation metric that Wall Street emphasizes. Instead, investors typically look to things like revenue, revenue growth and the company's price/sales ratio as a better means of measuring its valuation. The reason is because of how fast these companies are growing, and the fact that neither company is valued on its past or present fundamentals but rather what it can ultimately become 3-5 years down the road.On a forward revenue basis, Tableau trades at 8.1 times next year's expected sales, or 7.3 times sales minus cash & equivalents. In comparison, Splunk trades at 9.9 times forward revenue, or 9.5 times sales minus cash and equivalents. Either way you look at it, Tableau is the cheaper company, but also happens to be the faster growing company as well. Given the fact that Splunk and Tableau operate in the same industry, are of near similar size, and at similar stages in their business cycle, it's not often that Wall Street makes such a visible mistake in how it values such companies. That's why if I was seeking an investment in big data, or exploring either one of these two companies, I'd definitely go with Tableau. Not only does it appear to have far more long-term stock upside, but it will also be the larger, more profitable company."
3944056,22148,2016-03-01T10:14:31-05:00,The positive reaction to FQ4 results is a sign of turning momentum on a beat down stock.The strong 2016 guidance along with the lower stock price reduced valuation multiples to more reasonable long-term levels.Splunk is finally a long-term buy even for those missing the recent bottom.,"Hopefully investors learned a lesson by the stock reaction of Splunk (SPLK) after the last two earnings reports. Despite generally strong results for both quarters, the stock had completely opposite moves.My previous research focused on the concerns surrounding the valuation of the stock after failing to rally on strong FQ3 results. Subsequently, Splunk lost over 50% of its value from the late November high by falling all the way below $30.Unfortunately, time didn't exist to write a focus piece on the collapse, but now let's look at Splunk trading near $44 following the big rally from the February collapse.Concerns PersistDue in part to the Tableau Software (DATA) collapse, Splunk didn't hold strong gains on Friday after reporting FQ4 results. The stock surged to nearly $45, but ended the day at $41.51. Even with the big guide up, the market wasn't willing to pay a price where the stock traded above for the majority of its public market life since the IPO back in 2012.Tableau Software was on a similar path before 2016 guidance roiled the markets. The biggest issue with that data analytics firm was multiple compression as revenues slowed down from growth rates above 60% to the current expectations of a still solid 30%.On the positive side, Splunk saw enormous growth with partners and large customers. The Q4 license average selling price nearly doubled to $80,000, up from a prior level of $40,000 to $50,000. The prime reasons were 102 seven-figure deals and three eight-figure transactions as customers continue to scale to multiple use cases.These bigger contracts are coming at a cost of soaring sales and marketing spending mostly fueled by stock options. For FQ4, the diluted share count grew 4% YoY to 133.8 million shares. Splunk did produce over $100 million of free cash flow for the year, but the ability to generate cash is inherent in growing sales via paying stock options.Splunk did end the year with around $1 billion in cash.Rolling The Calendar ForwardAlong with other fast-growing stocks, the rolling of the calendar has investors focusing on the forward analyst estimates. A prime example is Splunk where the FY16 revenues hit $668 million and the FY18 estimates are up at $1.13 billion.The valuation of Splunk is highly dependent on whether investors view the past or the future for the machine data analytics firm. At a market cap of $5.7 billion, bulls really need the market to move on to the revenue expectations for FY17 and FY18.The company guiding FY17 revenues to $880 million versus the $854 million analyst estimates is a very positive sign. The stock valuation gets reasonable assuming the company can generate these higher levels of revenues. My past comparison to the likes of Salesforce.com (CRM) highlights how a market leading firm can continuously trade at current P/S multiples. Salesforce.com is worth nearly 9x the value of Splunk.SPLK PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe downside is that any disappointment and the P/S multiple will take a large hit similar to what happened to Tableau Software.TakeawayThe key takeaway is that Splunk appears headed to high prices in the future as the market was more bullish on the recent earnings results. The stock traded at a more reasonable multiple due to the collapse following the Tableau Software warning. Hence, momentum is now finally on the side of longs.The recommendation is for investors to buy Splunk on dips going forward. A P/S multiple of nearly 7x forward revenues is reaching peak valuation levels, but at these levels the stock should produce long-term gains for investors as the growth rate quickly eats away at what appears expensive at the moment."

Not only does it provide an important data management service for consumers, but it also should continue to grow in the wake of hacking epidemics and the well-timed acquisition of Caspida.What Splunk DoesEssentially, what Splunk does is provide its customers with an easy way to sort through the terabytes of data that come in from devices every week to find profitable, useful and actionable information.(Source: Splunk)As the above chart shows, Splunk's program has a multitude of potential applications and uses, one of the foremost being security. In fact, Splunk is aiming to provide users with ""real-time operational intelligence,"" which is very key for both military and industrial customers.Splunk's Enterprise software is aimed at large corporate customers with huge amounts of data to sift through. But as Investopedia notes,If Splunk Light starts becoming more widely adopted, then it should provide another crucial revenue stream and help Splunk become profitable.Why Splunk Will Continue GrowingIt's important to note that Splunk's software capabilities are in a niche market. Internet of Things data is largely what is known as ""time series data,"" or information processed every day, second, or even every millisecond. Splunk's software is mostly intended to and does a great job of keeping track of ""log file data,"" or data that records events with timestamps. So while log file data will be a big part of the IoT, time-series data is the predominant focus. Splunk's software will remain the major player of the ""log file data"" sector of the IoT that it's geared towards but does have some time-series data applications.However, this is where Splunk will continue to rise and profit. Splunk's software is exceptional at what it does, and with both corporate and individual applications, Splunk is making good headway into both markets.Also, Splunk recently acquired the security analytics/threat-detection software vendor Caspida for $190 million to bolster its security operations. This move has been lauded by analysts across the board. As people become more concerned about the potential for cybercrimes, especially in light of a recent massive data breach of government employee Social Security numbers, Splunk is right there to step in and help mitigate those fears.(Source: The Tech Bulletin)Also, speaking of analyst opinion, financial gurus tend to agree that Splunk's stock is a solid bed on the IoT. Analysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated an ""overweight"" rating and set a $84.00 price target on shares of Splunk in a research note on Friday, while JMP Securities stood by their ""market perform"" rating and set a $81.00 price target on Splunk shares. DA Davidson and Cantor Fitzgerald analysts both came out with ""buy"" ratings at $90.00 and $83.00 per share price targets, respectively, while FBR & Co. also has a $90 price target and an ""outperform"" rating. Out of 37 professional firms tracking Splunk, 27 currently have ""buy"" ratings and 10 have ""hold"" ratings. None have ""sell"" ratings. While the opinions of stock market experts could potentially be just as wrong as yours or mine, it's good to know how the experts value a particular stock.Value ConcernsWhile we're talking about value, let's touch upon Splunk's valuation. Some Splunk skeptics have come out and decried the firm's valuation. For example, a Wall Street Journal article back in February of 2015 noted that Splunk's shares at that time stood at an astounding 630 times forward earnings and 14 times forward sales, both indicators that the stock was quite expensive on a valuation standpoint.However, while valuation concerns are valid, Splunk is a momentum type stock and should grow into its pricey valuation. The pricey valuation means investors are putting a lot of confidence in the company's ability to continue growing. And with regard to that, Investopedia again puts it best when they said,Splunk is in a special situation and reminds of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) a couple years back. Facebook's IPO was priced too high, and thus its investors suffered through large stock price declines. But over the last year or so, Facebook has righted the ship and has seen its shares rise to new heights. Even though Facebook has been and remains a pricey stock, investors continue to pour money into the company due to what they perceive as its continued growth potential.The same kind of special situation is here with Splunk. Although its share price seems disconnected with reality, in this type of bull market, Splunk should continue to rise as more investors are attracted to its solid business model.ConclusionSplunk does have its issues, largely due to high marketing costs and the realities of being a Silicon Valley startup. But despite its challenges, Splunk's software is becoming more widespread in its use and applications. Splunk seems to be a strong stock to hold as the Internet of Things continues to ramp up and its growth story remains solid."
3227736,61281,2015-06-01T15:27:43-04:00,Splunk reported higher-than-expected revenue and EPS results for Q1’16.Earnings beat followed by an increased full-year guidance could not stop the price correction.Reiterate my price target and expect additional 20% upside.,"Big data analytics vendor Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported its Q1'16 earnings last week with impressive results that beat top-line and bottom-line expectations and were followed by an increased full-year guidance. Investors were not satisfied with the company's results, which were an exact replicate of Q1'15 results. Splunk's stock dropped 2% AH followed by an additional 5% drop on the day after the earnings. Based on the market's reaction, one could think that Splunk severely disappointed investors. However, this is clearly not the case. In this article, I will present Splunk's Q1'16 earnings in their proper perspective and discuss investment strategy for the upcoming quarter.Q1'16 Earnings in PerspectiveIn an earlier article published just before Splunk's earnings, I estimated that Splunk would report revenues of $125.4M and provide a price target of $81 for the stock. In fact, Splunk reported revenues of $125.7M, which is pretty close to my estimate and reflects a 46% year-over-year increase that continues the trend of eroding growth in quarterly revenues started in 2014. That decaying growth rate and increased competition drove Splunk's stock down post-earnings as investors concerns rise. However, all of this information was already known before the earnings call and was supposed to be added to the share price already.Chart 1 below presents Splunk's revenue trend and beat rate in the last earnings events. In my opinion, the real reason for the decline in Splunk's stock price was the slightly lower beat rate in Q1'16 than investors and analysts were used to seeing on actual revenues higher by 9% than the company's revenues. When Splunk reported only 6% beat above guidance, it drove many investors to sell shares at low $70s before the price drop to high $60s.This temporary, short-sighted sell-off is not a rare event in Splunk's case, as shown in Chart 2 below. Chart 2 presents Splunk's stock performance over the last two years and the immediate impact of its quarterly earnings results. In each of the nine quarters captured below, the company beat both revenues and EPS guidance and consensus that were translated into price increase only in 5 out 9 quarters.If we exclude the impact of Q4'14, in which the entire big data market experienced a sharp correction, the current quarter can be compared to Q1'14 and Q1'15. It is not a coincidence that after the first quarter in the last three, Splunk's stock was negatively impacted by positive results, Q1 is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year in the enterprise software market and might start the year in a gloomy light. However, in both Q1'14 and Q1'15, the stock rallied shortly afterward, as happens a few weeks after every earnings release.Investment StrategyI reiterate the price target of $81 mentioned above and set my next buy/sell orders accordingly to optimize my return from the post-earnings stock price trend. In my experience, Splunk stock goes into a correction mode for a few weeks before climbing back up toward Q2'16 earnings. I'm benefiting from the downtrend with put options while collecting more units during the drop with purchase price points set at: $63, $60, $57, and $50 (if it gets that low). So far, my forecasting model proved very accurate, and my investment strategy for SPLK has yielded 38% from September 2014 until now, which is almost double what SPLK returned during the same period. Therefore, I will continue with my current plan as described above and will revisit my revenue estimation and price target toward the Q2'16 earnings.ConclusionSplunk beat analysts' expectations for revenues and EPS but suffered from increased concerns of growth decline and increased competition. I reiterate the target price of $81 that reflects a 20% upside from the current price, and I plan to use the potential correction in share prices to increase my position and maximize returns."
3224806,24663,2015-05-31T13:01:09-04:00,"Big data was found to be a superior investment to the cloud in a recent article.Within big data, DATA was called the best investment.After trading higher, is DATA still the best bet over SPLK?","Back in March I did a side-by-side comparison of the cloud versus big data to determine which fast-growing industry is best suited for investors. The conclusion was that big data is where investors should be, and that Tableau (NYSE:DATA) was the superior investment over others likes Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK). However, given the stock performance disconnect between the two companies, is this still the case?Big data will be one of the fastest growing industries of the next five years. Thanks to the Internet of Things, IDC recently estimated that there will be a tenfold increase in data collected by 2020. This will occur as the number of connected devices worldwide increases from just under five billion to 25 billion by 2020, according to Gartner. Lastly, 451 research estimates that from this increase in data, monetization will rise, growing big data analytics from a $60 billion market last year to a $115 billion market by 2019.Two companies that are gobbling market share by the quarter and are among the most promising in big data analytics are Tableau and Splunk. The two companies are different, but share the same concept of using data to help customers make better business decisions.Splunk collects data from machines, whether it be smartphones, manufacturing equipment, or data centers (internet). During its last quarter, billings grew 45% year-over-year and its deferred revenue balance increased 57% to over $300 million. This outpaced revenue growth of 46%. With full-year revenue guidance of $612 million, Splunk expects to grow about 36% this year.Meanwhile, Tableau has essentially perfected the use of slow data (data compiled over time) in just about every industry. The company's real gift is providing a platform where customers can easily access data and implement business-changing decisions based on that data. Because of its user-friendly platform and broad use, Tableau's revenue rose nearly 75% during its last quarter. Based on its full year guidance, Tableau will be just about the same size as Splunk in terms of revenue by year's end, growing almost 50%.All things considered, both stocks have performed very well over the last year, but Tableau has created some separation as of late with gains of 13% during the last month. Splunk has traded flat during the same period. As a result, the two stocks are no longer as closely valued relative to free cash flow and trailing 12-month sales, as seen below.Given the above information, it might be easy to assume that Splunk would present the better long-term investment opportunity, trading at a lower price/sales and price/FCF multiple. However, those numbers alone can be a bit misleading.With the two companies expected to produce just about equal revenue this year, and Splunk's current market capitalization being $500 million greater, Tableau is actually the cheaper stock on a forward-revenue basis. The reason is because Tableau is growing faster, which in itself is worthy of a higher multiple. Furthermore, Splunk's operations are still nowhere near profitable, and there's no telling when it will become so at negative 48%. Meanwhile, Tableau's operating margin is near breakeven, quite impressive for a company that's spending heavy to promote its product and is growing at such a fast pace.As a result, despite the disconnect between Splunk and Tableau's stock over the last month, it still appears that the latter is an investor's best bet in big data analytics. Recently, Tableau was covered on Tipping The Scale, being applied to the 10 scale, 0-100 point rating system, and now ranks among the top 10 stocks with the most long-term upside. So far, I have been right with my bullish call on Tableau, and given the information presented herein, I expect no change in the current trajectory of its stock."
3214586,61281,2015-05-27T09:40:20-04:00,Splunk will report its Q1’16 earnings Thursday in light of its increased full-year guidance and Tableau earnings beat.Revenue estimates suggest Splunk will beat analysts’ consensus and company guidance for revenue.The estimated price target suggests a 17% upside in stock price.,"Big data analytics software provider, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) will report its fiscal Q1'16 earnings Thursday, following results by Tableau (NYSE:DATA) that beat consensus and guidance estimations. Tableau's results and the last rally in Splunk's stock price drive investors' expectations, reflected by a 93% bullish sentiment on StockTwits. As many Splunk investors already know, the days around an earnings release involve sharp fluctuations in stock price. In this pre-earnings article, I discuss the Tableau correlation, previous earnings results, and provide a revenue estimation for Q1'16, followed by a price target for Splunk.Fiscal 2015 Earnings RetrospectiveIn Q4'15 (ended January 31, 2015) Splunk reported better-than-expected EPS and revenue results, supported by a 90% increase in the number of customers year-over-year and impressive year-over-year growth in deals above $1M and $100K. As happened a few times before, Splunk hiked its 2016 full-year revenue guidance from $575M to $600M, which is also $20M above consensus. This impressive earnings release sent Splunk's stock up by 7.3% AH and 3.1% in regular trading; it reached an all-time-high price of $74. Even though the stock's reaction to Splunk's results was a surprise, Splunk has a history of beating its guidance and analysts' consensus following a temporary surge in stock price.As shown in Chart 1 below, Splunk's stock price reacted sharply to the company's beating/missing the earnings goal in fiscal year 2015, with an average of 4% AH increase post-earnings release. Splunk's stock price was extremely volatile, with large fluctuations around the earnings release, also driven by its high correlation to the performance of visualization market leader Tableau.The high correlation between Tableau's and Splunk's stock prices is stronger than a simple technical-statistical output, and the business rationale backs it. The two companies are the pure-play market leaders in their niches, and their products are not only complementary to each other but also optimized together. This strong relationship drives a 0.98 correlation in revenue and a 0.86 correlation in stock prices. As both companies are highly correlated, Tableau could serve as a useful indicator of Splunk's earnings.In its first quarter earnings release, Tableau beat analysts' consensus for revenues by 13% and its guidance by 16%. These higher-than-expected results sent the company's stock up 8% AH, which triggered a 15% rally in stock price since. Tableau's revenue beat, increased guidance, and stock rally are positive indicators for a similar case in Splunk's first quarter earnings.Revenue EstimationAs mentioned above, Splunk has a history of beating revenue guidance and consensus estimations. In Chart 2 below, I summarized Splunk's 2015 revenue results that, by surprise (or not), are 9% higher than the company's guidance each quarter. After a blowout fourth quarter, Splunk is expected to present a 15% quarter-over-quarter decline in its top-line in Q1'16 that match the company's revenue trend and the cyclic motion of the industry in the first quarter.I estimate that Splunk will deliver revenue of $125.4M +/- 5% in Q1, which is translated into $620M annual revenue and reflects a price target of $81 with a P/S of 16. This price target reflects an impressive 17% upside in the next 12 months, which is lower than the 50% upside investors experienced in the last year. However, from the experience in previous quarters, Splunk stock is expected to surge at the release and might start to correct the day after or two days after the release. Usually, catalysts for the correction include concerns of overvaluation, executive compensation terms, and SBC expenses, as well as management changes, and lower-than-expected guidance hikes.Investors who are holding Splunk for the long term, as I am, should buy Splunk's stock during the possible correction to achieve a higher upside than 17%. I have set my next buy orders for $63, $60, and $57 to maximize my return and benefit from the trends in the stock price.ConclusionsSplunk will report Q1'16 results tomorrow after the markets close. Investor sentiment is bullish going into the earnings following Tableau's recent earnings results, the 2016 full-year guidance hike in Q4'15 earnings, the recent stock price rally, and a historical trend in a conservative direction. My revenue estimation suggests that Splunk will beat revenue guidance by 8% and consensus by 7%, which should trigger a short-term surge in stock price. Experienced Splunk investors, already aware that the positive trend in the earnings day could be corrected in the next day, should be ready to buy more shares at the drop. I will revisit my bullish thesis after the earnings and will publish an update and earnings analysis next week."
2981156,61281,2015-03-06T15:27:09-05:00,"Splunk reported Q4 earnings last week with better than expected results.As many Splunk investors feared, the stock has already dropped 15%, similar to the sell-off post Q3 earnings.Based on my bullish thesis and my forecast model, I expect an upside of 30% to 40% on my Splunk position.","The big data analytics company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported its fourth quarter and full 2015 year (ended Jan 31, 2015) results last week with higher than expected revenues and EPS figures, and increased its full-year guidance for 2016 from $575M to $600. Shortly after the earnings release, Splunk's stock price soared more than 7% to $74.65 and completed a 40% rally in February alone. The next day, 11 research firms published their updated Splunk reports, providing an $83 average price target, and it seemed like Splunk was on the road to the $80s. However, as many Splunk investors feared, the stock dropped sharply to 15% from the $74 price peak, reminding them of the Q3 post-earnings sell-off.The similarity is amazing between the market reaction to Splunk's Q4 and Q3 earnings. In November 2014, Splunk reported better than expected revenues and EPS for the third quarter, increased its full-year guidance, and received an analyst average price target of $75, which was 16% higher than the pre-earnings share price. From that point, Splunk's stock dropped 27% to $51 at the end of January 2015.Right after the earnings, I sold some of my position at $75, realizing a 20% gain. I immediately thought of the article I published after the Q3 earnings, where I set a $75 share price as my next checkpoint and provided a $145M estimate for Q4 revenues. After the ""I told you so"" feeling faded, I started to think about my action plan for the Splunk position and how to benefit from the market reaction.Once again, I want to mention something I pointed out in my earlier articles. I believe that the big data analytics market is headed upward as the flood of data increases, and I think Splunk, which is the biggest pure-play in big data analytics, is the right pick to monetize that increase. Splunk's presence in the booming cyber security market is an additional catalyst for a possible upside in its share price. Its proven success in generating an increasing amount of revenues every year is a positive indicator for my bullish thesis.(Readers who want to read more about my Splunk bullish thesis can find it here.)Revenue OutlookThe first step in my action plan is to update Splunk's revenue forecast according to the Q4 actual earnings results, manual inputs driven from the earnings call, and Splunk's latest announcements. On top of these inputs, I also take into consideration Splunk's historical trend and conservative estimations for expected revenues in each segment. As shown in chart 2 below, I estimate Splunk to deliver revenues of $125M +/- 5% in Q1 and $620M annually, which reflects a share price of $81 with a P/S of 16. In its earnings release, Splunk provided a guidance of $117M for Q1'16, slightly below analyst consensus of $118M. These figures reflect a quarter-over-quarter change of -20% that's drastically lower than the -12% historical average for Splunk's Q1 revenue. Splunk's full-year guidance, I think, is lower than it should be, reflecting a $78 share price at the end of the year.Now that I set my price target, I want to wait until Splunk's correction is done before I add more shares to my position. Looking at the Q3 earnings case, Splunk is expected to drop at least to 20% until it bounces back up, and I want to pick some shares on the way to maximize my return when Splunk reaches my price target. I set my next purchase point at $60 and $55 and even $50, if the stock will get there. As my forecast model proved to be pretty accurate in the last few quarters and as I tweaked it from time to time, I believe that my approach could yield between 30% and 40% upside, depending on the quantities I will buy in every price point mentioned above. I did the same exercise with Splunk in the previous quarters and was able to gain between 20% and 30% yield every time. That increased my total return on Splunk significantly. Certainly not a bad investment.ConclusionsSplunk's stock price dropped sharply after the impressive Q4 earnings results. My Splunk forecast model and the company's guidance reflects a target price of $78 to $81 per share. Assuming Splunk's stock will react in a similar way, as it did after the Q3 earnings release, investors could use the correction to boost the return on their Splunk position."
2922246,67775,2015-02-17T09:41:32-05:00,"Splunk well positioned in Big Data analytics in the US and abroad.High quality customer base, continually growing.Q4-15 results due Feb 26, guidance probably conservative. Revenue ‘beat’ likely.Fundamentals good but valuation is in top quartile.","After a weak calendar 2014 for Splunk's (NASDAQ:SPLK) share price (-14%), what does 2015 hold? The business fundamentals are strong, with SPLK's exposure to high growth sectors, such as cloud security, continually improving along with the size and quality of its customer base. SPLK is due to report its Q4 results on Feb 26, which could surprise on the upside given the strong business momentum.Splunk, allowing its customers to make better business decisionsAs a quick reminder, Splunk is a software provider which enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence from their existing data sets (commonly referred to as Big Data) and includes the utilization of data derived from activities such as business transaction numbers, customer & user activities and security threats. Splunk's products help drive new insights for its customers that can be used to improve service levels, reduce operating costs, mitigate security risks, demonstrate compliance and help drive overall better business decisions. Some 80% of revenues are currently US derived, split licensing (approximately 60%) and Maintenance & services (approximately 40%), with Q3-15 (to 31 Oct) total revenues registering some 48% y/y growth, to $116 million.Core activities, markets and customersSplunk does not report divisionally, but its key business segments are cloud, the public sector and new markets. Looking back at SPLK's Q3 results, CEO Godfrey Sullivan stated that SPLK had a ""great Q3"" in Cloud, partly driven by a doubling of the customer base - mainly due to SPLK's security intelligence platform which focuses upon Big Data analytics and represented some 40% of quarterly revenues - strong momentum with Amazon and one very large Security order with a US sporting goods company. In the public sector, SPLK gained business with enterprises such as the US Department of Energy, Dept of Homeland Security and the US postal service, mainly all for security analytic services, so this was indeed a strong quarter in this business segment. Other customers gained in the quarter included Coca cola, GE Capital, AT&T and NASDAQ, so clearly SPLK is building a high quality customer base, which augurs well for future revenue growth, especially since some 70% of Q3's revenues were derived from existing customers. That said, SPLK also gained some 500 new customers in the quarter, the strongest growth in the customer base so far.Outlook for Q4-15 (to Jan'15) and beyondThe fourth quarter is traditionally SPLK's strongest and most profitable business quarter, with company guidance of between US$ 135 - 137m in revenues and a positive EBITDA margin of around 4-5%. I suspect this guidance is cautious and there could well be significant upside when the actual revenues and margin is reported on Feb 26. This should lead to full year revenues of (at least) $440 million according to company management. Looking to FY'16 (i.e predominantly calendar 2015) revenues are likely to be around $575 million, according to management guidance. Interestingly, SPLK has consistently been cautious on its revenue guidance, as the chart below highlights, so assuming this trend continues, the coming results may hold revenue upside and thus valuation upside potential.Fundamentals good but valuation high, so outlook guidance needs to be strongWith cash of around $1 billion and no debt on the balance sheet, SPLK is in a strong position, given its strong revenue growth outlook and now, positive margin advancement. That said, SPLK's valuation is high on around 12x FY'15 EV/Sales when most of its competitors are on mid single digit multiples, so SPLK must continue to deliver strong revenue growth and to provide a strong revenue growth outlook to justify this multiple. Looking at blended DCF methodology, my model suggests value per share in the mid $50's per share (utilizing the official management revenue guidance), but as I have mentioned above, this may well turn out to be too cautious. Given SPLK's very high EV/sales multiple however, I think its prudent to wait until the Feb 26 results for confirmation of the positive growth trends. My Levered Returns DCF model is shown below."
2963566,47691,2015-03-02T06:26:23-05:00,,"By Sarah RodenSplunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) produces software to organize machine-generated data into operational intelligence. By sifting through large troves of data, Splunk is able to extract business insights, thus allowing companies to operate more efficiently and strengthen cyber security measures. Splunk went public in 2012 and recently released an impressive fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2015 report on February 26th.Highlights of the Q4 report include total revenue of $147.4 million, a 48% year-over-year increase. GAAP losses per share widened from -$0.30 in the last quarter to -$0.47. Splunk has continued to gain customers as the company posted licensing revenue of $98.1 million, up 43% year-over-year. CEO Godfrey Sullivan noted that Splunk is ""proud to welcome more than 600 new customers to the Splunk family, which now includes over 9,000 customers around the world."" Splunk's customers include the U.S. Department of State and Toyota. Sullivan commented that the report reflected the ""best quarter yet for both Splunk Cloud and the Splunk App for Enterprise Security.""Looking forward, Splunk provided guidance of $116 million to $118 million in total revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2016, exceeding analysts' estimates of $115.5 million. Additionally, Splunk expects total revenue for fiscal year 2016 to be approximately $600 million, above analysts' estimates of $580 million.On February 27th, analyst Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated a Buy rating on Splunk and increased his price target from $85 to $90. White believes Splunk is ""well positioned for strong growth"" due to ""a significant uptick in large-sized deals, a broader portfolio, opportunities overseas, strong momentum in security and the tailwind surrounding the Big Data trend."" Looking forward, White estimates next quarter's revenue to be $121 million. The analyst also raised his revenue estimate for fiscal year 2016 from $575.3 million to $600.9 million. Both of White's figures are above Splunk's estimate and the analyst consensus.Brian White currently has a 71% success rate recommending stocks and a +19.9% average return per recommendation.Separately on February 27th, analyst Joel Fishbein of BMO Capital reiterated a Market Perform rating on Splunk and raised his price target from $69 to $75. Fishbein acknowledged that ""All metrics, including license growth, guidance, upsell activity, large deals, and mix of enterprise/term agreements, were strong and supportive of the narrative around Splunk's ability to add increasing value in a diverse set of use cases."" However, the analyst is concerned about the company's valuation noting, ""With business transition issues around pricing and concerns around the company's ability to scale up the business smoothly diminishing, valuation alone is the only knock on the story. The multiple continues to be among the highest in the group, even compared to SaaS peers."" Despite strong fundamentals and Splunk's strong position in Big Data, Fishebein remains ""at Market Perform pending a pull back.""Joel Fishbein currently has an 81% success rate recommending stocks and a +20.4% average return per recommendation.On average, the top analyst consensus for Splunk on TipRanks is Moderate Buy."
2899556,61281,2015-02-09T15:18:58-05:00,"Splunk will report its Q4 earnings in two weeks in light of its increased full-year revenue guidance.After Tableau's impressive earnings results, expectations from Splunk are high.According to my estimates, Splunk is expected to improve its top line and beat analysts' expectations.Better-than-expected earnings results will drive Splunk's stock price up and continue its rise since the Tableau's earnings release.","Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is set to report its fourth-quarter and full-year results for the period ending on January 31, 2015, after the close on February 26. While the company presented strong third-quarter results, its stock price plunged, and concerns were raised about a possible drawback to the price levels of mid-2014. Global market weakness and geopolitical turmoil had an impact on Splunk's stock price, as investors looked for solid ground. Splunk, which reported record high quarterly revenues and increased outlook for the year, is still a high-growth company that presents high margins and increasing revenues alongside GAAP net loss and high multiples. This sort of combination may drive investors away as the markets continue to fluctuate.In light of the global unrest in the markets, when investors fear declining oil prices and instability in the Eurozone, I believe that growth companies like Splunk can provide the required alpha that investors look for these days. This note might seem irrational at first, but when mega events as those mentioned above take place, a market-leading company that operates in a fast-growing industry and delivers strong results quarter after quarter might be the logical investment.Splunk has a seasonal revenue trend where its lowest sales are in the first quarter and the highest in the fourth quarter. Splunk guided Q4 revenues to be in the range of $135-$137M, which reflects a 36% increase year over year and 18% quarter over quarter. In addition, the company lifted its 2014 guidance from a midpoint of $425M to $439M, representing a 44% increase compared with 2013 revenues. Splunk's firm guidance is not farfetched; the company's revenues have grown at a quarterly rate of 12% in the last four years. Splunk increased revenue continuously for a few years, but also increased its customer base and the average revenue every customer generates. The company produced 1.74 times more revenue from each customer in Q3'14 than it did in Q1'11 while its customer base grew 3.2 times that period.Highlights to Look ForEven though Splunk presented an impressive top line growth in recent quarters, it has not reached the operating profit and bottom line; on a GAAP basis, these two figures are negative. In Q3 earnings, Splunk CFO Dave Conte provided an outlook for a profitable year on a non-GAAP basis, making Q4 the third consecutive quarter in a row that the company presented a positive non-GAAP net profit. As mentioned above, Splunk's fourth quarter usually has the highest revenues, which drives the historical trend of that quarter being non-GAAP positive. However, if Splunk completes 2014 with a non-GAAP net profit, it would make it the first profitable year for the company and a step in the right direction toward a GAAP profitability.In its Q3 earnings, Mr. Conte guided 2015 (ending January 31, 2016) revenues to reach a record high of $575M, reflecting a 30% year-over-year increase compared to current-year guidance. If Splunk can meet its expectations for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014, it will be an important milestone on the way to 2015 revenue. However, missing the revenue outlook for the fourth quarter may put the 2015 figure at risk and will drive the stock further down.On the operational side, there are a few points to pay attention to that might impact the company's plans to grow revenues and turn profitable:Revenue EstimatesBased on Splunk's historical seasonal revenue trend and conservative estimations of Splunk's operating segments towards Q4, I estimate that Splunk will report quarterly revenues of $145M that will drive annual revenues of $448M, well above Splunk's outlook and the analyst consensus presented in chart 1 below. That revenue level reflects a $70 stock price under a P/S ratio of 18.5, which is 12% higher than the current price.Last week, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) reported its Q4'14 earnings with record-high quarterly revenues that beat every estimate and comparable metrics, as shown in chart 2 below.Following impressive fourth-quarter earnings, Tableau's stock soared 17%, and Splunk's stock followed it with a 9% increase in price. According to my estimates above, Splunk is expected to beat analysts' consensus, and the company's guidance will drive an additional stock price increase toward the $70 price mentioned above."
3066496,22148,2015-04-14T13:23:42-04:00,Splunk remains highly valued based on normal investing metrics such as over 13x forward revenues.The data analytics sector continues to display major growth potential with most corporations not even implementing big data plans yet.Constantly rising shares outstanding are a major concern for a stock already richly valued.,"If shareholders of Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) learned anything since the latest quarterly earnings report, it is that price matters. The stock initially soared on the strong guidance, but it has since slumped some 20% to trade around $60. The good news from the machine data analytics firm couldn't offset the high valuation.While Splunk is making great progress with the top line, a very concerning trend continues to eat away at the earnings per share of the company. The future of the data analytics firm appears bright, but the question is whether growth is strong enough to overcome this troubling trend.Huge Potential Overshadowed By ValueThe huge growth opportunity of Splunk continues to come with a high price tag. Investors and analysts were excited about the 48% revenue growth in Q4, yet the valuation multiple on a PS basis remains lofty and the PE ratio is still astronomical.Splunk even trades slightly more expensive than Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA). Trading at roughly 13.2x forward revenue, investors need to realize that the stock isn't likely to rocket higher. The more likely scenario is annual stock gains that match the revenue growth forecast at around 30%.While some investors will focus too heavily on the forward PE ratio of over 200, the stock does trade at a more reasonable price to cash flows. For FY15, Splunk produced operating cash flow of $104 million and free cash flow of $90 million. Those numbers should grow this year with the company targeting operating cash flow of 20% of revenue that is growing at a 30% clip. With a market value just under $8 billion, Splunk trades at only 20x trailing cash flows.So while valuation is a concern, research continues to show that big data software deployments are still only in the infancy. According to a survey by Snowflake Computing, a full 70% of companies have yet to make any investment in big data. Even more interesting, those same companies continue to increase investments in their existing data warehousing investments.A good sign that Splunk is in a great industry, if only the price of the stock would cooperate.Shares OutstandingA big concern with some tech stocks is the out of control stock option awards to employees. Or maybe more correctly stated, the hidden cost of rising share counts. While a big fan of non-GAAP earnings that exclude stock-based compensation, it is still important for investors to understand the impact of large share issuances.For FY15, Splunk recorded a $214 million charge for stock-based compensation. The charge might not appear large for a stock with a $8 billion market cap, but in reality it is an absurd amount for a revenue base of only $451 million.The below chart details the fast growth of the diluted shares outstanding on a GAAP basis. Ironically due to the losses generated by the stock-based compensation, the GAAP shares are lower than actual shares outstanding. In the latest quarter, the actual diluted shares were 128.6 million, up from 118.7 million in the year ago period.TakeawayNo matter how large the sector growth potential, it is extremely difficult for a stock trading at over 10x revenue to make appreciable short-term gains. Even more troubling, a stock like Splunk faces a difficult path to gains with shares outstanding surging. The resulting situation is where investors can expect gains similar to the growth rate less any share increase.Splunk originally crossed $60 back in September 2013 and it hasn't seen any gains in those 18 months due to value concerns. The stock probably heads higher, but it will consistently run into an overvalued situation similar to with the strong earnings report."
2763505,61281,2014-12-17T15:36:25-05:00,"Splunk has lost roughly 12% since the beginning of December.Even though the December decline seems dramatic, in light of Splunk's historical monthly returns, it is not an unusual event.U.S. market weakness driven by geopolitical turmoil and the drop in oil prices contributed to Splunk's decline.New Relic and Hortonworks IPOs drove funds from Splunk to these companies.All drivers are temporary, and with no fundamental driver for the decline, I keep my Splunk price target unchanged.","In an early December Seeking Alpha article about Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), I discussed my bullish thesis for the company and provided my $75 price target. Splunk has plunged roughly 12% (as of the final hour of trading Wednesday) since that article was published for a decline of approximately 18% year-to-date. Given that the company reported strong Q3 results with increased guidance and received two new buy ratings since the beginning of the month, many investors wonder what caused the drastic drop. In this article, I offer my humble attempt to explain Splunk's overreaction.Historical OverviewA historical overview of Splunk's stock price volatility provides a good background for understanding SPLK's latest pullback. Since Splunk went public in April 2012, it has been highly volatile.Splunk's high volatility is best highlighted by looking at the annual and monthly returns. SPLK has a disappointing 2012, dropping 18% with an average 0% monthly return. In 2013, things were completely different, as SPLK soared 135%, returning 6% monthly. In 2014, Splunk's stock went the other way, falling markedly year-to-date with a 0% average monthly return.Another indicator of the stock's volatility is the number of times its monthly return changed from negative to positive or the other way around. In 2012, 2013 and so far in 2014, that happened three, one and seven times, respectively. So Splunk has been volatile since its IPO in April 2012, but is the drop in December 2014 unusual?A decline in the low-to-mid teens in two weeks is always significant, particularly when the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) only drops by approximately 3% in the same period. However, as shown in the table below, Splunk's stock has had four months this year that were worse than its December performance thus far:Insider SellingWhen a stock declines sharply in a short period, I often hear investors cite insider selling as being responsible for the drop. I decided to check whether this is the case with Splunk this month. As shown in chart 2 below, the net insider selling (insider selling minus insider buying) has not increased substantially in the last few months. Only in March 2014, when insider selling is high and the share price declined 20%, could insider selling be a driver for a drop in SPLK. That said, there is little correlation between insider selling and the share price, so that cannot indicate any impact on the stock price.Market Affect And Big Data IPOsSplunk's decline can be explained by two drivers: general market weakness and recent big data IPOs.Since the beginning of December, the entire U.S. stock market is experiencing a pullback, reflected in negative returns of the leading index ETFs. As the market went south this month, investors should have taken into consideration the risk an investment in Splunk entails, given that it has a beta of 1.53 and a volatile price history. The sharp decline in the stock market triggered by a drop in oil prices and geopolitics turmoil is an external driver of Splunk's decline that had a low probability, but most investors did not take that into account in their positions. Once investors noticed that the indices' drop did not stop after a few days, they preferred to grab their profits and leave SPLK to protect their capital.In the middle of December, two leading big data companies went public: New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) and Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP). Investors interested in these IPOs, who did not want to increase the big data portion of their technology portfolio nor increase its risk, had to sell SPLK to buy NEWR and HDP.ConclusionSince the beginning of December, when my previous Splunk article was published, SPLK dropped by about 12%. As the historical trend shows, December's decline was not the largest monthly decline Splunk had this year. In fact, considerably more significant monthly drops happened a few times this year. The turmoil in the markets, together with high-profile big data IPOs, drove Splunk into a temporary pullback. As Splunk's financials remains strong, full-year guidance is unchanged, and, no, the company has not released any announcement that could have a negative impact. Therefore, I'm keeping my SPLK position in place. The correction will come; it is just a matter of time. It will probably happen sooner than can be forecast right now. I keep my price target of $75 unchanged for now."
2805075,61281,2015-01-07T20:14:56-05:00,Small software vendor Splunk fiercely competes with tech giants in the Big Data analytics market.The company managed to spot industry trends and translate them into revenues that drive impressive top line growth.Splunk offers a possible 40% upside for investors who are not intimidated by the risk associated with this investment.,"In earlier articles about Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), I touched on different aspects of the company and explained why certain actions or developments supported my buy thesis; however, I haven't yet laid down my full buy thesis on Splunk. As Splunk's stock price goes south, I feel this is the right time to provide some more insight into the company and the Big Data analytics market than I previously did, and present my buy thesis on the company.In this report, I will describe the Big Data analytics industry and Splunk's unique offering within the industry. I will present Splunk's impressive growth in revenues and customer base, as well as price and valuation analysis.Big Data Analytics IndustryBig Data is a widely used term to define an amount of data so large that it cannot be handled using traditional tools. Such a large amount of data can be generated either automatically, for example, by tracking user activity in a website, or manually, for example, by uploading many documents to a cloud storage. The data generated needs to be collected, stored, aggregated, and indexed to become accessible for queries. Analytics tools are used, at this point, to investigate the data for trends, correlations, unusual behavior, etc. Once patterns are identified, they are presented with dashboards and visualization tools specialized in Big Data. Visualization is an important part of Big Data analytics, and assists corporations to drive actions and decision-making based on data analytics.The economic potential in the Big Data analytics market is driven by the significant growth expected in the amount of data in the upcoming years due to the increase in the number of electronic devices commonly used. A few years back, the main electronic device used was the personal computer. The amount of data generated grows as computing technology has advanced from desktop machines to mobile computers, mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, etc. Every new electronic device increases the total number of electronic devices in use. People are still using mobile computers, even though they have tablets and smartphones too. The amount of data generated from an increased number of devices grows rapidly. In an IDC report, the consulting firm forecast that the total amount of data in the world will increase from 130 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) in 2005 to 40,000 exabytes in 2020 (as shown in the graph above, on the left). Not all the collected data is valuable if tagged and analyzed, and currently, only 25% of the data is considered valuable if analyzed. However, this figure is expected to grow to 33% by 2020, which reflects a five-fold increase in the amount of valuable data from 2,500 exabytes in 2015 to 13,200 exabytes in 2020 (as shown in the graph below, on the right).The growth potential of Big Data analytics has attracted many software vendors of all sizes, from small start-ups to well-known tech giants, to the market. Players in the Big Data analytics industry fall into four primary categories:As it becomes clear from the above categories, Splunk is not one of the largest players in the analytics market. However, its disruptive technology competes fiercely with giants like IBM, Microsoft, BMC, and CA. Not only does Splunk challenge the big players, but it also leads its category of the pure-play analytics vendors (category 3 above). New Relic and AppDynamics are more focused on application performance monitoring, and offer machine-generated data analytics through firms specializing in this activity, such as Splunk, Sumo Logic, and Loggly. These three competitors offer equivalent solutions. However, Splunk provides a broader solution to the high number of applications and add-ins available for its customers.Splunk's OfferingThe company's flagship product is Splunk Enterprise 6.2, which allows corporations to collect machine-generated data from data centers, cloud storage, and mobile devices, index the data, and then search and analyze it in real-time to spot patterns. There are three primary use cases for Splunk Enterprise: IT intelligence, business intelligence, and cyber security. IT divisions in corporations use Splunk Enterprise to monitor network usage and prevent infrastructure outages, troubleshoot incidents in real-time, and gain real-time information on users' behavior that can be used to improve infrastructure in the future. R&D divisions use Splunk Enterprise to understand customers' experience, analyze transactions, and track key performance indicators. Besides IT and business intelligence, Splunk Enterprise allows corporations to improve their cyber security by enabling these corporations to identify unusual usage patterns or transactions that allow a quick response to a possible security incident.Splunk has three more products that are complimentary to Splunk Enterprise and provide a broader analytics solution:In order to enhance users' experience with Splunk's software solutions and to provide a broad solution to its customers that meet all their requirements of data analytics, the company offers its customers an extensive list of complimentary applications and add-ins. These add-ins and apps are developed through collaboration with Splunk's strategic partnerships with leading tech companies in various areas of expertise, such as Microsoft, Amazon AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), VMware (NYSE:VMW), Symantec (SYMC), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Tableau (NYSE:DATA), Cloudera, and Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP), to name a few.Splunk's GrowthSplunk revenue has increased at an impressive rate of 12% each quarter from the beginning of 2011. In 2014, it crossed for the first time a $100M quarterly revenue milestone, and headed for a record high annual revenue of around $450M. As shown in Chart 2 below, Splunk's revenue and average revenue per customer increased continuously since the beginning of 2011. The company's revenue for the quarter ended on October 2014 at 5.5x the revenue in the quarter ended April 2011. The number of customers is now 3.3x that of April 2011, and the number of deals above $100k closed in a quarter is 6.3x that of April 2011.In a recent earnings call, Splunk's CFO, Dave Conte, provided preliminary guidance toward 2015 revenue, and stated $575M as the current target for next year. $575M reflects a 29% increase from the estimated annual revenue for this year (ending January 31, 2015) and an impressive 375% growth since 2011.Splunk's top line growth is driven by two main factors: innovation and sales execution. The company is spending every quarter around 35% of its revenue from product development, and 75% of its revenue on sales and marketing. Product development expenses and sales and marketing expenses are sufficiently correlated with the revenue, and every additional investment in these operational sectors returns in the form of revenue.Examples of Splunk's innovation include the launch of Splunk Hunk to address the evolving Hadoop and NoSQL markets, and the launch of Splunk Cloud to address increasing demands for a cloud-based Big Data analytics tool that does not require full deployment of the internal infrastructure. Even though in the future Splunk Cloud might cannibalize some of Splunk Enterprise's market shares, it is following a trend of transferring as much of IT applications as possible to the cloud to save costs. Also, the massive number of add-ins and applications available to users, aimed at enhancing their use of Splunk, is an example of ongoing innovation to expand Splunk's solutions beyond the boundaries of Splunk software. Evidence for the effectiveness of the company's sales can be found in the steady increase of around 400 new customers each quarter, and in the fact that they have reached almost 300 deals a quarter that are greater than $100,000.Splunk's ability to spot industry trends (such as Hadoop, security, cloud, etc.) and translate them into revenue is a critical point in the company's growth, and one of the most important factors when looking to invest in a growth company like Splunk.Price and ValuationAs a growth company in a highly growing market, Splunk's stock has been very volatile since its IPO in 2012. In almost two years, the stock rallied more than 250 percent and reached an all-time high of $92 in February 2014. From that point, it dropped more than 50 percent and hit a 52-week low of $40 in August 2014, only to rally again to a stock price of $67 toward the end of the year. From that point, Splunk's stock price has been going south, and is currently being traded in the mid-$50s. Many external factors impact the stock price: prices of enterprise software vendors stocks, cyber security stocks, growth and momentum stocks, and general tech stocks trends. As Splunk is considered by many to be a momentum stock, its success or failure in beating analysts' consensus impacts its price sharply, as well as the performance of other momentum stocks that might not be related to Splunk's business.Splunk stock is extremely volatile, which drives many investors away from it, and if the stock's price volatility did not drive away enough investors, then the company's valuation would take care of the rest. Even though Splunk's stock is down almost 50% from its 52-week high, it is still not cheap at a P/S ratio of 16. This steep P/S ratio is higher than most tech companies' and does not fall within the definition of a bargain. However, investors looking at Splunk may be interested in grabbing a share of the Big Data analytics boom that has the company as one of its leaders.Considering that Splunk will continue to deliver innovative solutions to the market and translate these solutions into revenue, it will be able to maintain its current trend of customer base and large deal increases each quarter. Based on the Big Data revenue forecast model (introduced in an earlier article, available here), Splunk is expected to reach $600 million in revenue next year +/- 5 percent, which reflects a share price of $79 with a P/S of 16. Splunk's CFO took a more conservative approach and provided $575 million preliminary guidance for 2015, which reflects a share price of $76. In either scenario, Splunk's stock remains almost 40 percent above the current price of the recent turmoil in the global markets.Splunk, as a growth/momentum stock, is one of the first stocks to experience a crash as investors hurry to sell it and buy other safer, less volatile stocks. However, once the current turmoil in the global markets erodes and equities return to their track (it will happen sooner or later), Splunk's stock will regain some of its appeal, and investors will again be attracted to its fantastic growth potential.Looking at the major investment firms, they have not issued any change in ratings and remain bullish on Splunk:Catalysts and RisksThere are a number of catalysts that could drive the stock price appreciation beyond the points described above:On top of the catalysts, there are a number of risks that could drive Splunk's stock price down:SummarySplunk offers an attractive upside opportunity for investors willing to absorb the risk associated with investing in the company. With a market leader position and a proven track record of innovation, Splunk is one of the exciting companies operating in the Big Data market. Its ability to monetize innovation and continuously increase its customer base and revenue is placing Splunk in the front of Big Data growth. Investors interested in joining the fantastic growth potential of the Big Data analytics business should buy Splunk at the current low prices. As revenue for next year is expected to grow to around $600M, investors could benefit from a possible 40% upside."
2721675,61281,2014-12-01T13:46:20-05:00,"Splunk rallied 40% since it hit the 52-weeks low in June.Splunk reported strong Q3 results and increased its full-year guidance.Historical revenue trend, next year’s guidance, and analysts’ price targets suggest a possible 12% to 28% upside to Splunk’s stock.","Back in June of this year, my first Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) article was published, wondering whether Splunk's most recent partnerships with Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Symantec (SYMC) could help the company stop its stock decline. At the time the article was published, Splunk stock price was $47 after a 32% drop from the beginning of the year and 49% from the peak in March. In that article, I concluded that the only trigger to a rally in Splunk stock price is the revenue growth that the company should present in the following quarter. At that time, I added Splunk to my watch list and followed it carefully.At the beginning of September, my Q2 earnings review was published and discussed the better-than-expected results that started a Splunk stock price increase. In that article, I highlighted Splunk's high quarterly revenue growth rate and its sharp stock price fluctuations that might not be suitable for every investor. As shown in chart 1 below, I purchased the stock in the dip of mid-September at $58, the high price at that time. However, the substantial revenue growth rate that is so important in the big data market was trending as I expected, and the increased guidance coupled with strong technicals indicated that Splunk may be on the verge of an increase.One month later, I discussed Splunk's growth potential in an article and provided a $115M estimation for Q3, $8M above the analysts' consensus. To build my forecast, I used Splunk's revenue trend, the big-data analytics market trend, the company's latest announcement, and a P/S valuation. In mid-November, Splunk reported $116M revenues in Q3'14 ($9M above analysts' consensus) and a 48% year-over-year increase, and the stock reacted with a 7% increase after several hours. My sell order was executed that day with a $70 price limit, gaining 19% return in two months. In the following week, after hitting $70, Splunk stock dropped 5%, and I bought again at $66. My next profit-taking price limit is $75, based on Splunk's historical revenue, next year's guidance, and analysts' price target expectations.Revenue TrendAs shown in chart 2 below, in the last four years, Splunk has increased its revenues at a quarterly rate of 15%. Quarterly revenues' growth rate incorporates sharp fluctuations. For example, the average quarter-over-quarter increase for the first quarter is a 12% decrease, while, in Q2, the company reports an average of 20% quarterly revenue increase.In its Q3 earnings call, Splunk provided a conservative guidance of $136M (range mid-point) for Q4 that reflects a 17 percent increase quarter-over-quarter. Although that figure by itself might sound high, Splunk reported 27 percent quarter-over-quarter in the same period in 2013, 25 percent in 2012, and 39 percent in 2011. The analysts' consensus is also relatively conservative and reflects an 18 percent quarter-over-quarter increase for Splunk in Q4. Based on the historical pattern and conservative estimation of expected revenues in the licenses and services segments, Finro estimates that Splunk revenues will reach $145M, representing a 25 percent growth quarter-over-quarter. Revenues of $145M in Q4 will drive Splunk's annual revenues to $448, which represents a $70 stock price based on 18.5 P/S ratio.Company's guidanceOn the earnings call, Splunk's CFO, Dave Conte provided preliminary guidance toward 2015 revenues and stated $575M as their current target for next year. Splunk's guidance for next year reflects a 29 percent year-over-year increase, which is lower than the 48 percent the company is expected to achieve in 2014, and continues the downtrend from the 83 percent the company had in 2011. The decrease in the year-over-year growth rate is part of the maturity process the company is going through. Even though revenue growth is expected to decline next year, the annual revenues increase offers an upside in Splunk's stock. A 10% -/+ range from the $575M guidance reflects a stock price range of $74 to $85, which is 12% to 28% upside from the $66 price mentioned earlier.Shortly after Splunk released its Q3 earnings results, a number of research firms increased their price target for the company to be within the range described in the previous paragraph: Deutsche Bank from $65 to $75, Canaccord Genuity from $68 to $80, Goldman Sachs from $65 to $72, FBR Capital from $78 to $83 etc.ConclusionsSplunk's stock price dropped 58% after it hit an all-time high of $95 in March of this year after the company had reported disappointing Q1 results. Since then, Splunk beat analysts' expectations in Q2 and Q3 and increased its annual revenue guidance from $425M to $439M. Finro estimation for the fourth quarter revenues is higher than the company's guidance and reflects $448M in annual revenues for Splunk. Splunk expected annual revenues together with a firm guidance for next year, and higher analysts' price targets make Splunk a buy in current levels."
2702295,24276,2014-11-22T11:00:17-05:00,"Splunk shares popped overnight on a solid beat on revenue, although the company is still losing money.Companies that analyze Big Data stores are the next big thing in cloud.There will be few opportunities, as venture firms want to keep them and large firms want to buy them.","A big beat on earnings at Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is sending its stock, and those of other data analytics outfits, into overdrive.Splunk lost money during its most recent quarter, but revenue of $116 million was up 48% over the same quarter a year ago, and it signed up over 500 new enterprise customers. The company has never shown an annual profit, although it came close in 2011. For the most recent quarter, losses were more than half of the revenue.Splunk, like many new cloud companies, is based on free software, but that software is complex enough that companies usually want to buy support and other services. Splunk creates visualizations of large collections of data, making its collection worthwhile. Among the features launched during the most recent quarter were Splunk visualizations directly from an Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) EC2 console.Shares in Splunk jumped $5 overnight, and opened at $71 Friday morning. But other companies involved in ""Big Data"" analytics, cloud applications that use vast amounts of data, are also on the rise. Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK), which reported strong earnings but soft guidance last month, rose 4%. Varonis Systems (NASDAQ:VRNS), which went public just in February, rose more than 6% overnight.There has been a latent hunger for cloud application stocks on Wall Street for some time, since it's natural that as cloud grows, so would its software. The problem is that larger companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) have been gobbling up application companies almost as soon as they emerged, in an effort to tie customers to their proprietary databases.Splunk and its brethren are a new breed. Rather than focusing on functions such as Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management or Human Resources, these companies focus on analyzing data, seeking patterns and bringing them to management's attention. They make these vast data stores useful, no matter what they were first collected for. Splunk, for instance, has found a growing niche in cyber security, as it can pinpoint the machine where data was generated, measure performance against pre-set parameters and issue alerts on divergences from norms.Investors haven't been able to get a taste for these companies, in part because venture firms have been so avid to invest in them, taking multiple rounds and keeping them off the public markets. The main impact of Splunk's newfound public market success is likely to be a number of IPOs next year as other analytic products are brought to market. The data flow may be restricted, however, by larger companies seeking to buy such companies out in advance of a public offering, which is one reason Splunk itself - despite its current lack of profitability - may be seen as a pearl of great price."
2954796,73745,2015-02-26T14:22:52-05:00,,"By Chris Burniske, Analyst: Web x.0Every day enough data is added to the world's digital universe to fill 1.45 billion Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6 devices. Yet, lots of data will simply remain a pile of 1s and 0s, eventually dissolving into the ether, unless it's analyzed and put to use. The uses of this data are nearly infinite, from optimizing quick delivery of a package to predicting voting trends from a sea of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) feeds.Useful data is a subset of the digital universe. Currently, this subset stands at a quarter of all data and will grow to 37% by 2020, according to an ongoing joint study by EMC (EMC) and the International Data Corporation.As it increases share in a rapidly-expanding universe, useful data is in the process of exploding. Between 2015 and 2020, useful data is expected to grow 7.5-fold, as shown below.The opportunity to derive insights from rich data is similarly evolving rapidly. Yet, an overwhelmingly large proportion of useful data is left unanalyzed for lack of affordable hardware and software sophisticated enough to ingest, store and analyze the volume, variety and velocity of data.As the graph above shows, analyzed data is gaining share because companies recognize the value of useful analytics. Consequently, the big data start-up space is growing rapidly. Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP) and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) made headlines with IPOs at the end of 2014, while companies like MapR and Cloudera are considering their own offerings. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) has been a leader in Big Data since going public in 2012. The amount of data Splunk analyzes is likely to grow almost twice as fast as is useful data, as shown below.Splunk's positioning as a broad yet powerful analytics tool for machine-generated data is driving growth as devices proliferate. Splunk's combination of ecosystem partners, its thriving app-store and integration into various aspects of a company's operations creates a sticky platform. Splunk is increasing its market share despite charging a 10-fold price premium per gigabyte analyzed, a testament to the value of the company's platform and the return on investment (ROI) it generates for customers.Splunk is riding down the technology cost curve, providing an increasingly valuable service at lower price points. Though Splunk has cut list prices by roughly 25% annually over the last few years, revenues have grown 45%-80% per year. Splunk will continue to increase revenue despite falling prices in part because its expected price erosion should be less severe than other Big Data companies.Taking into account projected pricing and the rapid increase of data analyzed, Splunk's addressable market will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars by 2020. Its revenue and market share growth, despite premium pricing, speaks to the value of its platform. Splunk is on pace to surpass $2.5B annual revenue in 2020, a five-fold increase above its 2015 projections, while only penetrating 1% of its addressable market.Disclaimer: ©2014, ARK Investment Management LLC.

The company has zero exposure to Big Data hardware.One of the reasons why Splunk’s revenue is growing so fast is because the company has many large customers. Splunk signed a deal with Volkswagen in 2013.","Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) shares have been on a roll lately, gaining 20% after the company announced better-than-expected revenue and earnings. Splunk realized revenue of $101.5 million, translating to a healthy 52% year-on-year growth, while non-GAAP net income per share clocked in at $0.01, whereas most analysts expected a loss.SPLK data by YChartsSplunk shares are currently trading at $56.54, well below the $93.30 they achieved in February before the giant selloff that saw them tank by more than 40%. Many analysts rate the stock a buy. Let's take a look at the general outlook for the company and whether there is any significant short-term or long-term upside.Big Data MarketAccording to Wikibon, the Big Data market is currently worth about $28.5 billion, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.7% to reach $50.1 billion in 2017. The Big Data market is highly fragmented, with more than 50 significant players. Overall, IBM is the leader in Big Data in terms of revenue, with 7.35% market share. Splunk's market share in 2014 is just 1.95%. You can get a peek of the leading Big Data players here.Source: WikibonThe market for Big Data Services currently accounts for the biggest percentage of the Big Data market with 40%, followed by hardware and then software. 71% of Splunk's revenue comes from software, while 29% comes from Big Data Services. The company has zero exposure to Big Data hardware.Source: WikibonThe fragmented nature of the Big Data market certainly works to Splunk's advantage. The field looks crowded with many big names such as IBM, HP, TeraData, Microsoft, and Cisco to name but just a few large players. However, IBM, the largest player, has just 7.35% share of this market, while the others have much less. The Big Data market seems to be divided into many small niche markets. Splunk excels in providing premier solutions that help businesses collect massive swathes of data. Tableau Software (NYSE: DATA), another relatively new player in the Big Data landscape, specializes in the provision of powerful visual analytics tools that display complex data in easy-to-grasp ways.The rapid growth of the Big Data market is being powered by the mobile explosion. There are tons of data being generated from consumer devices that companies want to analyze so as to target their customers better. Big Data solutions helps them easily do this by creating a differentiation layer to separate useful data from the noise.Terrific growth and new customer winsOne of the reasons why Splunk's revenue is growing so fast is because the company has many large customers. For instance, Splunk signed a deal with Volkswagen in 2013 to become the chief provider of Big Data software for its data lab. Volkswagen plans to use Splunk's Big Data solutions to help its engineers visualize its next generation of electric vehicles during development in real-time.Splunk signed a multi-year agreement with General Electric that made the company GE's preferred platform for operational intelligence. Other recent big customer wins for Splunk include a multi-year deal with Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods, to supply it with solutions to help it analyze customer shopping behavior, and MLB Advanced Media, an interactive media arm of Major League Baseball, as well as antivirus software maker, Symantec.What is Splunk's Fair Value?Splunk shares currently trade at EV/Sales multiple of 15.6. The average EV/Sales multiple for enterprise IT companies is 8.7. The high-software sector has a 10-year EV/Sales multiple average of 9.5. Splunk, however, has been growing its top line at 50%+ over last several years, while the industry growth average is just 24%. The shares still look a bit overvalued, and might not have a lot of near-term upside potential. However, allowing for a EV/Sales multiple of 12.5 for fiscal 2016, 125 million fully diluted shares, and sales of $570 million, the fair value about 12 months from now would be around $65.40, suggesting upside potential of about 16%.The median S&P 500 EV/Sales multiple is at an all-time high. This implies that there is a lot of investor optimism in the air, and Splunk shares are not the only overvalued shares here. It won't therefore come as a surprise if the shares tuck on significant gains before the year ends.Over the long-term, however, investors should tread with caution. Goldman Sachs warns that studies done on publicly-traded companies in the U.S. over the last 30 years show that stocks with the highest EV/Sales multiples rarely manage to meet the growth expectations implied by their stratospheric valuations. In fact, Goldman says that rather than grow into their high valuations, these stocks routinely lag their peers over the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year horizon. You can read that report here. It certainly gives sobering food for thought when doing long-term investing for pricey shares like Splunk's."
2580825,61281,2014-10-21T18:21:59-04:00,Splunk introduced a new partnership with AWS that allows the company to expand its offering into the largest cloud infrastructure provider.Splunk has increased its revenues in a quarterly rate of 11% from 2012 and expected to report a quarter-over-quarter increase of 4% to 14% in Q3.Splunk revenues forecast offers an upside of around 20% in stock price.,"At the beginning of October, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) held its user conference in San Francisco and announced a few new app releases targeted at expanding the company's current portfolio. The company introduced a new version of its enterprise app, a beta for a new mobile app, Mint, and a new partnership with Amazon Web Services.Splunk has two strategic goals in its business model. The first one is to enable customers to unlock great potential in other areas using Splunk solutions, and the second one is to offer better and more comprehensive alternatives than competitors. Splunk strives to achieve these goals with a high-end research and development operation that delivers quality products and by partnering with industry leaders. Partnerships with VMWare (NYSE:VMW), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) allow Splunk to meet the first goal, while partnerships with Symantec (SYMC) and Tableau (NYSE:DATA) allow Splunk to achieve the second goal. Because of these partnerships, Splunk's customers find real value in their data through optimized data analytics, and Splunk provides high-quality products that meet customers' needs.The announced partnership with Amazon Web Services supported Splunk's first strategic goal and was targeted to integrate Splunk Hunk into Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services customers will be able to use Splunk Hunk either by automatically providing the app at an hourly rate or using their existing licenses to Splunk Hunt in order to analyze data stored in Amazon EMR. The business model described above has been proven successful for Splunk, which was able to increase revenues every year, and the Amazon agreement set investors' expectations very high. As shown in chart 1 below, Amazon has more than $3B of annual revenues from cloud infrastructure and almost 60% market share, making it the most significant player in that market. The Amazon-Splunk partnership will allow Splunk to expand its Hadoop and NoSQL analytics apps into the most major cloud infrastructure provider. The growth potential for Splunk Hunk with AWS's customers is tremendous and could drive the company's revenues higher.Q3 Revenues EstimationAs shown in chart 2 below, Splunk has increased its revenues at a quarterly rate of 11% since 2012. Revenues suffer from seasonality but stay roughly around the same quarterly growth rate year-over-year. For example, the quarter-over-quarter change for the quarter that ended in July was +20% in 2012, +17% in 2013, and +18% in 2014.Splunk provided a conservative Q3 revenue guidance of $106M that represents a 4% quarter-over-quarter increase. The quarter-over-quarter growth is considerably lower than the 18% quarter-over-quarter growth reported in Q3 last year and the 17% quarter-over-quarter growth in Q3 two years ago. The company's guidance is conservative, not only with regard to the historical trend, but also compared to analysts' expectations of 6% growth. Based on the historical pattern and conservative estimation of expected revenues in the licenses and services segments, Finro estimates that Splunk revenues will reach $115M, representing a 14% growth quarter-over-quarter.In the previous earnings release, Splunk provided a quarterly revenue guidance of $106M and annual revenue guidance of $425M, which represents a $66 stock price based on an 18.54 P/S ratio. Morgan Stanley reaffirmed the stock price when it upgraded Splunk from Equal-weight to Overweight and announced a $66 price target at the beginning of October. Summit Research, Deutsche Bank and Stifel Nicolaus provided similar price targets for Splunk's stock and all provided Buy ratings for the company. In Q3 earnings, Splunk is expected to update the market with the progress of its current partnerships, and investors will be able to see whether the most recent partnerships with Tableau and Symantec generate revenues at an acceptable pace. Moreover, Splunk's management will shed some light on the Amazon partnership and its estimated benefit for the company.ConclusionsSplunk is constantly looking for additional partnerships in order enable their customers to optimize their data analytics. Splunk partners with industry leaders such as VMWare, Microsoft, NetApp, Symantec, Tableau, and Amazon. The Amazon partnership offers significant growth potential for Splunk that is expected to increase their revenues up to $425M this year, reflecting a $66 stock price. As Splunk's stock has declined almost 40% since the March 2014 highs of $90, every revenue figure that the company will report on the earnings released on November 27th that reflects an increase of 6% to 14% quarter-over-quarter will drive Splunk's stock price up. The company's conservative revenue outlook and investment firms' price targets offer an 18% upside for the stock price. If Finro's estimations for Q3 revenues materialize, the company will end this year with substantially higher revenues that offer an even bigger upside in the stock price."
2532375,22148,2014-09-30T16:38:38-04:00,"Big data remains a mega-trend with a huge market opportunity for Splunk to explore.Strong FY15 guidance should make true believers like the stock even more.Despite the large drop of nearly 50% from the highs, Splunk still trades at valuation multiples that are high.","Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), a big data software firm, is another prime example of how price matters to fast-growing tech stocks. After a huge run in 2013, which culminated in a gain of over 300% at the peak in March 2014, the stock plunged over 60% in just a few months. Now with the passage of time and the stock sitting nearly 50% below all-time highs, Splunk is worth a look.The company continues to report phenomenal growth while turning annual losses into small profits - the type of actions that naturally make a stock attractive to investors. But it's always key to pay the right price. Just like with previous articles on FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) here and Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) here, the huge gains of 2013 led to different levels of value following the sell off in the Spring.Big Data, Big MarketMost people in the business world know about the big data concept and want to figure out a way to harness all the data generated by the proliferation of smartphones and tablets making the market opportunity huge. According to Gartner data, the amount of corporations using big data has only reached 13%.The good news for software makers, the majority of firms are in the investigation process of how to deploy technologies to harness the concept. Based on this research, Splunk still needs to do a lot of work to convince corporations that the implementing related software is worth the cost.Big ValuationProbably the biggest concern facing the Splunk investment thesis is that the stock remains highly priced following the sell off earlier this year. In fact, it far outpaces the values placed on fellow researched stocks of FireEye and Tableau Software. Even when excluding the substantial cash and investment balance, Splunk still trades at the highest enterprise value multiple of revenue in the group.SPLK PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsShould Like Splunk BetterSplunk spent the better part of the last year trading at levels higher than the current price around $55. In theory, investors should like the stock more now especially after the latest quarterly results beat estimates.Back in August, the company increased FY15 (Jan.) guidance for revenue to reach roughly $425 million. The number was a major improvement from the previous guidance of around $406 million. The company recently passed on savings from costs cuts with Amazon Web Services helping drive growth. Analyst Ed Maguire at CLSA-US was enthusiastic that the 33% price cut in the Splunk Cloud service would set the stage for more customer expansion. The analyst placed an $80 target on the stock.TakeawaySplunk is another prime example that price matters. The stock is still down nearly 50% from its highs back in February at $106 while at the same time recently increasing guidance. With the highest valuation multiples in this group of tech stocks, a new investor might wait for a better entry point. The stock needs more time at this level with a few more quarters of solid growth to justify higher prices. This is a prime example of how investors paid extreme valuations back when the stock raced pass $100."
2467065,61281,2014-09-03T05:17:00-04:00,"Splunk reported Q2 earnings results with record-high revenues that beat analysts’ expectations.The company is still in a growth mode and struggles to balance revenues and expenses.High stock-based compensation can flip the coin from a GAAP net loss to a Non-GAAP net profit.Frequent sharp ups and downs in the stock price make Splunk’s stock a bit risky for the everyday investor, but might possess a short-term opportunity for a sophisticated investor.","Big data analysis and mapping software developer Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported its second-quarter earnings last week with record-high results that beat EPS and revenue expectations. Splunk presented an impressive revenue increase of 18% quarter over quarter and 52% year over year and beat both the company's guidance for the quarter, which was in the range of $92-94 million, and the analysts' consensus, which estimated revenue at $94 million. A deeper look into the revenue figures shows that revenue for the quarter that ended in July 2014 followed the seasonal pattern shown in chart 1 below. Constant increase in revenue and the seasonal revenue trend bring Splunk to a quarterly revenue growth rate of 11% over the last two years.Splunk is still in growth mode, and even though it has increased its revenue at a quarterly rate of 11%, it has also increased the cost of revenue and operating expenses at a 16% quarterly growth rate. The steady increase in cost drives the rise in net loss, which hit $61 million in the quarter that ended in July 2014. In the last two years, the percentage of revenue Splunk dedicated to operating expenses and cost of revenue climbed and reached 159% of the company's revenue in the recent quarter. As shown in chart 2 below, Splunk steadily increased its operating expenses and cost of revenue. Percentage of total expenses out of revenues soared from 110% in the quarter ended in July 2012 to 159% in the quarter ended in July 2014; this is a 50 percentage point gap that highlights the amount of resources the company puts into product development, sales, marketing, and management compensation.Comparing Splunk's GAAP to the Non-GAAP results highlights a very sharp increase in share-based compensation across the company, which has a $59M impact on the PnL. Splunk's share-based compensation increases in quarterly growth rate of 41%. Even though this is not a cash expense and does not affect the operational cash flow, the increasing double digit amount is alarming. Stock-based compensation out of revenue increased from just 9% in the quarter ended in July 2012 to 59% in the quarter ended in July 2014. Stock-based compensation (together with employer payroll tax on employee stock plans and amortized intangible assets) flip the coin from a GAAP net loss and per share loss of $0.51 to a Non-GAAP net profit and per share profit of $0.01.Business OverviewIn Q2, Splunk continued to increase its customer base and added another 500 customers to a total of 7900 worldwide. As part of its partnership strategy, Splunk announced a new strategic alliance with Syncrost to deliver machine data insights from mainframe systems. An earlier announced partnership with Internet2 to offer a 3-year license of Splunk Enterprise to higher education institutes with dedicated pricing attracted 25 universities since it was published two-quarters ago. Splunk's management is yet to provide any results or updates on the previously announced partnerships with Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Symantec (SYMC).Splunk introduced the Splunk app for streaming that is based on the Cloudmeter technology and offers real-time streaming wire data that gives customers access to all data from different sources at one time and enables customers to gain high-quality information from that data. This is the first product that Splunk launched that is based on the Cloudmeter acquisition, and it is currently a free app. The streaming app is targeted to bring better results for existing Splunk customers and attract new customers that would like to use that functionality on top of other Splunk solutions. The success of Splunk's strategic partnerships and app releases could be reviewed in a few quarters once the company gathers enough data to release to the market. These efforts supported the growth trend of Splunk and were targeted to bring additional revenues in the long run.Stock AnalysisSplunk's stock reacted strongly to the earnings results and completed a 19% increase the day after the release. As shown in the chart below, Splunk's stock suffered many ups and downs since the beginning of the year after an extended increase in stock price. The recent jump in stock price reflects the guidance in higher revenues that the company's management provided in the earnings release, taking into account a 14.7 P/S ratio.ConclusionsSplunk announced higher-than-expected revenues and EPS (Non-GAAP) that had an immediate impact on stock price, increasing it to 19% on the day after the earnings release. Splunk is still in a growth mode, increasing revenues each quarter, while simultaneously increasing expenses that drive the negative bottom line (GAAP). Splunk continues with its strategic partnerships plan to build a strong portfolio and revenue streams in the long run. The company released new versions for its existing products and new apps to enhance these products to maintain its core revenue stream from Splunk Enterprise. In light of the recent sharp increase in stock price and recent price targets provided at the end of August with a range of $52 to $56, the current level of Splunk stock might not be an attractive entry point. Furthermore, the frequent and severe fluctuations in stock price make it a risky alternative for the ordinary investor; however, the ups and downs could be used for the short-term profit of sophisticated investors."
2701025,22148,2014-11-22T02:50:27-05:00,Splunk reported Q315 earnings.The stock remains a buy.The original investment thesis anticipated that the Spring sell-off was overdone and that the strong results would lead the stock to rebound.,"The quarterly numbers for Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) were again impressive. The big data analytic firm again exceeded Wall Street consensus and continued a rebound from the stock swoon back in the Spring. The company famously gave tepid guidance for the fiscal year back in February when the stock was sky high. Splunk has now smashed the original guidance that led to the stock cratering from over $106 to a low of $39 in a matter of months.For Q315, Splunk reported revenues that surged 48% YoY to $116.0 million. Operating income was $2.7 million for a minimal operating margin of 2.3%, but the number far exceeded the guidance at the start of the year for breakeven operating margins. Splunk earned $0.02 and slightly beat analyst estimates for earning $0.01. The guidance was even more impressive with Q4 revenue expected between $135 million and $137 million, compared to analyst estimates for $133 million. The full-year revenue numbers for the period ending in January were raised to $438 million to $440 million, far above the original guidance of around $400 million. Splunk guided to a fiscal 2016 revenue number of $575 million that exceeded analyst estimates of $570 million. As with the fiscal 2015 example, it is very probable that this initial estimate for 31% revenue growth is far below the actual number when the year completes in January 2016.The original investment thesis in the article ""Splunk: Price Matters"" accurately depicted a scenario of where investors were too concerned with momentum and not actual results. The actual results didn't justify the stock collapse and provided alert investors with solid entry points below $50. With an after-hours valuation approaching $8 billion and a forecast for revenue of only $575 million next year, the stock no longer provides a bargain. Since the stock is now riding momentum higher, investors should continue owning it with the real possibility of testing the original highs again."

Its IPO was priced at $17 after an initial range of $8-10 that was in turn revised upward to $11-13. The stock mostly churned in a wide range from there and even ended the year with a loss. From there, the stock climbed ever skyward. It clocked a 137% gain for 2013 and did not peak until February 28th as most of the momentum universe peaked along with SPLK. The stock remains in negative territory for 2014 but has made an impressive jump from the bottom.Splunk successfully retested 2014 lows from June and is now facing its next hurdle during an impressive post-earnings jumpSource: FreeStockCharts.comDuring this entire trading history, SPLK has not made a penny in profit (although it has logged impressive sales gains). Insiders however have clocked plenty of profit from the company. According to Yahoo! Finance, insiders have sold $181M in shares since June 4, 2013.These sales have occurred on a very regular basis over this time. (I posted the raw data in an Excel spreadsheet for posterity). To put this amount into perspective, compare it to the financial stats below for SPLK since it began publicly reporting. The latest sales were reported to the SEC on September 12, 2014. It was these four SEC Form 4s that originally caught my attention. I thought these particular sales were notable until I saw the entire history.This is essentially a company that has lost an increasing amount of money since it went public while earning $688.9M in revenue over the last two and a half fiscal years. Never mind the lack of profit, even the revenues are only a small multiple of the amount of shares being sold. For example, the two quarters of fiscal 2015 cover January 31, 2014 to July 31, 2014. During this time insiders extracted the equivalent of 36.6% of revenue or $68.6M. Talk about creating money almost out of thin air! With a market cap of $7.0B, SPLK is valued at a nifty 19.7 times 12-month trailing sales, thus facilitating the impressive sums of money that insiders have been able to extract.In these cases, I am always careful to note that I do not begrudge insiders the massive amounts of money they are able to make from their company. They should indeed take everything the market is willing to give them. In this case, the market is willing to offer a LOT. I also recognize investors will be very grateful if these insiders manage to transform the company one day into a multi-billion earner with the hefty profit margins most software companies are able to achieve.In the meantime, SPLK is trading at an important level, just under its 200-day moving average (DMA). This level is currently capping an impressive bounce off the stock's recent bottom (see chart above). I am positioned assuming SPLK will fail this test, especially with some of the ominous warning signs I have observed in the general market. If I am wrong, I will take my lumps and move on.Usually, such profitless, highly-valued companies attract a lot of short interest, but not SPLK. Only 5.8% of its shares are sold short. The total shares short are an all-time high and represent the culmination of a ramp that occurred shortly after SPLK peaked.Splunk shares short have ramped back up to all-time highs since the stock peaked earlier this yearSource: Schaeffer's Investment ResearchBe careful out there!"

        Growth is impressive, gross margins even more so, as costs are on the increase.
        Focus on the GAAP earnings instead of the non-GAAP earnings amidst excessive stock-based compensation.","Investors in Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) finally have a reason to celebrate again as the company demonstrated very impressive topline sales growth, in what has been a very difficult year for shareholders so far.Despite the operational momentum in sales, I am worried about the continued increase in the cost base and the level of sustainable operating margins at a more mature phase in the company's life cycle.For that reason, I continue to be worried, remaining on the sidelines as a short position remains too risky.Second Quarter HighlightsSplunk posted second quarter sales of $101.5 million, a nearly 52% improvement compared to last year. Reported revenues came in far above the company's own guidance and analysts consensus at $93.8 million.Spending has been on the rise as well with operating expenses more than doubling resulting in greater GAAP losses. Reported losses came in at $60.8 million versus a much more modest $13.7 million loss as reported last year. On a per share basis, losses came in at $0.51 per share.There is quite some discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP accounting metrics with the company posting a penny profit on a non-GAAP per share basis versus the loss of a penny last year. Analyst expected the company to report a modest non-GAAP loss of two cents.Looking Into The NumbersReported headline sales growth of over 50% is rather impressive with the nearly 52% reported growth rate actually accelerating on an annual basis compared to the first quarter performance.Total license revenues rose by 43.8% to $62.1 million as revenues from maintenance and other services rose by 66.7% to $39.5 million.Overall gross margins came in at 85.2% of sales, which are simply very impressive numbers. Despite the high absolute level, gross margins were down by some 370 basis points compared to last year. This is due to lower than overall revenue growth at the licensing business which carries incredible gross margins of 99.9%.Yet all of this revenue growth was made undone by operating expenses which rose by 101.8% to $146.8 million. Within the cost segment expenses on R&D, sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses all rose sharply. The aggressive cost base expansion explains the steep increase in reported GAAP losses.Note that the $60.5 million loss was entirely explained by stock-based compensation. On the website Splunk states that it employs over a 1,000 employees. If the company would indeed employ a thousand workers, this compensation would come down to $60k per worker for just a three months period.The company cited a myriad of operating metrics to show the momentum which in all honesty is quite impressive. During the quarter it signed deals with 500 customers, ending the quarter with some 7,900 corporate clients across the globe. Despite the strong growth in the number of customers, it have actually been the existing customers being responsible for 70% of the license bookings growth through upgrades and expansions.New customers brought in less revenues as they typically order solutions which bring in lower than average sales. This came after many new customers were attracted to the 33% price cut in Splunk's Cloud offerings as well. Of course the hope is that these new customers will upgrade over time as well, thereby becoming more valuable customers.Comforting OutlookFor the current third quarter, Splunk sees sales coming in between $105 and $107 million which is actually largely in line with consensus estimates. While this still demonstrates healthy sequential growth, this growth is expected to slow down to roughly 35% on an annual basis. While this would represent quite a slowdown in growth on an annual basis, take into account that the company issued a conservative guidance for the past quarter as well. Again the company aims to squeeze out a tiny non-GAAP operating margin of a percent.For the entire year sales are seen between $423 and $428 million versus the previous outlook for sales between $402 and $410 million. Analysts anticipated that the company would raise the guidance to a level of around $418 million in sales.The new guidance implies that fourth quarter sales could come in around $132 million. It should be noted that the last quarter typically is seasonally strong, and that the outlook calls for year-on-year sales growth in the thirty to mid-thirty percentage range.ValuationAt the end of the quarter, Splunk held roughly $935 million in cash, equivalents and investments while it has no debt outstanding. All of this results in a very comfortable net cash position.With some 119 million hares outstanding at the end of the quarter equity in the business is valued at $6.2 billion at $52 per share. Excluding the cash holdings of the firm, operating assets are valued at around $5.3 billion.Based on the revised full year guidance, shares now trade at about 12.5 times sales.ImplicationsBack in June after the release of the first quarter results for the fiscal year, I last checked out the prospects for the business. While non-GAAP earnings have improved, the ever increasing shareholder compensation expenses have actually resulted in larger GAAP losses for the quarter.It must be said however that the company had a very strong quarter with revenues and non-GAAP earnings coming in much stronger than anticipated. As such the company has the capacity to perhaps surprise towards the upside even after already raising the full year guidance.The very high gross margins make the valuation at 12 times revenues not even that ridiculous, especially given the pace of the current growth. Yet the real worry is the operating expense base, and notably the insane stock-based compensation expenses which are very high. As such I argue that investors should not be fooled to look at non-GAAP accounting metrics as these expenses really do dilute the ownership base in the company.At the time following the disappointment from the first quarter results shares have been trading in the low forties, while I argued that a short position would be very risky as well despite the problems with the valuation. Sentiment in these kind of companies can shift very quickly, something which has indeed occurred in recent months.Despite the improved operational momentum, the high margins and forecasted growth I am not a fan of the shares given the operating losses at the moment.This leaves me wondering what the true sustainable GAAP margin of the business can become at a more mature phase in the company's life cycle. This makes the risk-reward scenario not attractive in my opinion at this point in time."
2426505,66493,2014-08-16T08:44:47-04:00,"Splunk needs to find a significant and sustainable revenue stream. Management believes Hunk and the cloud will be able to deliver.
        Hunk isn't well positioned and doesn't have a major competitive advantage in the highly competitive Business Intelligence industry.
        Management's cloud guarantee is a high risk and low reward strategy which could cause issues.
        Even after a 59% decline, Splunk's stock is still overvalued based on earnings and revenue valuation metrics.","Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a provider of real time data analytics software. Their software can be used to analyze real time data streams for security, business, and application analysis. Over the last few years, the company has been growing rapidly. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of 71.5% since fiscal 2010. In Q1 2015, revenue grew 50.2% y/y. Management is focused on continuing the company's rapid expansion with their international push. During the Q1 2014 conference call, Godfrey Sullivan CEO stated ""it's still such early days in especially our international expansion that there's still a lot of investment we have to do to get critical mass in huge markets like Japan or Germany or UK. We have a long ways to go still..."" Although the company has grown, management has been sacrificing profitability in pursuit of this growth.The company's operating margin has declined from -20.9% in 2010 to -25.9% in 2014. In Q1 2015, operating margin was even worse at -58.4%. Management's pursuit of growth at any cost strategy has made the company a very risky investment. Especially since, the company's growth rate has been declining. Revenue growth in 2011 was 89.3% but has steadily fallen reaching 50.2% in Q1 2015. Management has created a situation which requires significant revenue growth just to reach operational breakeven. Keeping total operating expenses flat at $444 million (NYSE:TTM), revenue would have to grow 34% to just breakeven. With management's international expansion plans, expenses are expected to continue to rapidly grow. This means management will need to find significant and sustainable revenue streams.Management believes their Hunk and cloud solutions will be able to deliver this growth. Yet, these solutions are facing a difficult competitive environment. Hunk isn't well positioned or suited for the current Business Intelligence industry. Splunk's cloud solution will suffer from similar problems as Hunk but with an additional issue caused by management's recent guarantee.Hunk Not Well Suited For Current Business Intelligence MarketBusiness Intelligence revenue is highly concentrated at the top. In 2013, Gartner estimates the top 5 companies generated 69% of the Industry's revenue. These companies mainly focus on offering their software and solutions to large enterprise organizations. These enterprise organizations need solutions which can quickly handle very large datasets. Hunk is more than capable of handling large datasets and quickly producing significant insight. Yet, the top 5 companies have similar software which can perform just as well. However unlike Hunk, these large Business Intelligence companies can offer a more complete software solution. They can provide an ERP system all the way down to the Business Intelligence software. Requiring a complete enterprise level solution has made this market segment difficult to penetrate. Since 2009, the same five vendors have only lost 2.3 percentage points in market share, according to Gartner. They have been able to dominate the Business Intelligence industry due to their complete enterprise level offerings. Splunk's lack of a more complete solution puts it at a major disadvantage in this market segment. What about the small to midsized market segment?Hunk could be used to target the small to midsized Business Intelligence market. However, this market segment is highly competitive. The two top small to midsized vendors are Tableau Software Inc. (NYSE:DATA) and Qlik Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:QLIK). In 2013, Tableau had an operating margin of 1.6% and Qlik an operating margin of 0.7%. These companies have two of the best small to midsized software solutions but still have problems with profitability. This is because the industry requires a high level of sales support and research and development to stay ahead of the competition. Additionally, Hunk would struggle in this market because of the shift in spending. Gartner reports spending in the industry is shifting away from the IT department and into other operating segments. This requires easy to use software solutions. Unfortunately, Hunk requires a high level of user sophistication in order to operate and gain meaningful insight.Hunk is a great analytics tool but has several major disadvantages in the current Business Intelligence environment. Splunk can't offer enterprise customers a full ERP to Business Intelligence solution. The small to midsized market is highly competitive and requires a simple user friendly software solution. Hunk is a powerful analytics tool but lacks the simplicity needed in the small to midsized market. Hunk should be able to gain some traction in the IT segment but that market segment is very mature. Additionally, the future of Business Intelligence spending is outside of the IT department. Hunk is going to struggle in the Business Intelligence industry and Splunk's cloud strategy isn't helping.Risky StrategySplunk recently dropped the price on its cloud solution by 33% and guaranteed 100% uptime. The price cut occurred after their costs of delivery had dropped substantially. Splunk runs its cloud solutions on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services which has been constantly reducing its price. Amazon has reduced its compute and storage prices over 40 times in the last 6 years, according to Information Week. Splunk's price cut should generate more customers without impacting margins. Yet, the 100% guarantee is a risky strategy. Mind Touch selected Splunk specifically for its 100% guarantee, according to Information Week. Mind Touch's CEO talked about the 100% guarantee in an Information Week article ""It's not a difficult problem, across multiple Amazon availability zones, to set up cloud infrastructure to guarantee uptime, so I'm confident they'll be able to hit 100% and I don't think it's just a BS marketing gimmick,""Mind Touch's CEO believes a 100% uptime is achievable but doesn't even offer it to his own customers. Mind Touch guarantees a 99.9% uptime. Splunk is guaranteeing 100% uptime but will have difficulty delivering on this promise. InfoWorld has a list of the largest cloud outages in 2013. The list features top technology companies like Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), FaceBook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). These large companies can't deliver 100% uptime, how can Splunk? Especially since, Splunk runs its cloud solution on AWS which only guarantees uptime of 99.99%. Management has decided to guarantee 100% uptime but doesn't run on a platform which can guarantee the same. Additionally, AWS has trouble even delivering 99.99% with several major outages in 2013, according to USA Today. The ability to deliver 100% uptime would be a major competitive advantage. Yet, several large technology companies can't produce 100% uptime and Splunk will have a similar problem with its guarantee.The problem with Splunk's guarantee isn't only the loss of customers when they fail. Management stated they will pay for their failures. So, management is pursuing a high risk and low reward strategy. The company will more than likely fail to deliver on its guarantee then will lose and have to pay customers. Any competitive advantage from offering a 100% guarantee will be lost once the company fails to deliver on its promises.Stock Still Not Cheap After DeclineSplunk's stock has declined 17.3% over the last year and 59.7% from its 52 week high. Yet even with the significant decline, Splunk's stock is still a very risky investment. Management has focused on revenue growth and has ignored profitability. This makes using earnings metrics problematic. The company can more easily be compared and valued based on revenue metrics. Even using revenue based metrics, the stock is trading at a significantly high valuation.Data: Yahoo Finance- Key StatisticsAs seen above, the company is trading nearly three times higher on a P/S and EV/Revenue basis than competitors. Additionally, Reuters reports the company is trading four times higher on a P/FCF basis. Even if Splunk can grow rapidly, the company's stock would still be a very risky investment. In order to reach a P/S ratio of 4, revenue would have to grow 279% from $331 million to $1.26 billion. Investors have simply priced in a significant amount of growth which makes the stock very risky.Splunk RiskySplunk is a provider of analytics software. The company has been expanding rapidly over the last few years. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of 71.5% since 2009. Despite rapid revenue growth, the company has been unable to produce an operating profit. Management has and is continuing to focused on expanding operations. This should keep expenses growing at a rapid pace. In order to become profitable, management will need to find a significant revenue stream. Management believes the Business Intelligence industry will deliver this revenue stream.Yet, the company's Hunk and cloud offerings have several major disadvantages. Splunk's offerings require significantly more knowledge than other software. This puts Splunk at a disadvantage because the Business Intelligence industry is trending toward simplicity. Splunk's lack of a complete enterprise level software solution makes competing with large Business Intelligence companies extremely difficult. The company's recent cloud guarantee will be nearly impossible to deliver and could end up hurting the company. The company will have a difficult time positioning and gaining market share in the Business Intelligence industry.Even after a significant decline, Splunk's stock is trading at a high valuation. The company' s revenue has grown fast and investor have priced in a significant amount of future growth. This along with managements total disregard for profitability makes Splunk's stock a very high risk and low reward investment opportunity.Disclosure: The author is short AMZN.

But is there any way that investors could have seen this ""fall from the clouds"" coming?For investors in Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) shares, there was one clear warning sign on March 5 when the stock was trading $92. That's when SPLK became a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell. And since then, the stock has consistently been a #5 or #4 Rank Sell. This week is no exception as shares have been cut in half since March.How Did the Rank Predict the Kerplunk in Splunk?Splunk provides a software platform, which collects and indexes data and enables users to search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real time. Sounds like a red hot, growing area of Technology.But the Zacks Rank doesn't care how exciting the industry is or how great the company's story is. It's a quantitative model that only focuses on one thing: Earnings Estimate Revisions (EER) from Wall Street analysts. When the analysts are raising estimates sufficiently, a stock can earn a Zacks #1 or #2 Rank or Strong Buy or Buy, respectively.When EER are headed up, a stock's price usually follows. And when EER are headed down, they lead stock prices lower. Here's a look at what's happened in SPLK shares since estimates took a dive and make it a #4 or #5 Rank...The February earnings report (4QFY14) that shifted the Zacks Rank to a #5 Strong Sell was accompanied by a big miss in expectations when the company reported a GAAP loss of $0.27 for the quarter vs. the consensus of -$0.07.Then the May report (1QFY15) delivered a whopping 600% EPS miss with a GAAP loss of $0.42 vs. expectations of only -$0.06. Clearly, even Wall Street analyst expectations for the company were fooled again, as you can see in the chart above when they had to drastically reduced estimates again last month.The turnaround in Splunk shares may be around the corner. But let the Zacks Rank tell you when the best predictor of stock prices -- Earnings Estimate Revisions -- has upgraded the outlook."
2265813,61281,2014-06-12T11:24:36-04:00,"After disappointing first-quarter results and full-year guidance, Splunk stock price dropped to a 52-week low.Splunk announced new partnerships with Symantec and Tableau to offer a comprehensive big data analysis solution.New partnerships support the company’s strategic business model and will partially improve revenues, but can they help to stop the stock price decline?","Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), a big data analysis and mapping software developer, reported its first-quarter earnings for the year on May 29. Splunk stock plunged 16% to $41.86 after the company provided disappointing results, with higher operating losses and lower growth rates than provided in the previous quarter. Investors are concerned with the growth rate and with the company's ability to scale its business and increase headcount successfully without impacting execution or profitability. This decline in stock price is part of a 60% drop since the $95.5 high in February. Can the new partnerships be the catalysts for a stock upside?Gartner introduced the term big data in 2001 to define an amount of data so large and complex that it can hardly be accessed and used efficiently. Many companies develop software tools to map and analyze different aspects of big data to make it accessible and usable. For example, Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) develops tools for human-generated data, Splunk develops tools for machine-generated data, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) develops software solutions for visual analysis and presentation of big data, Symantec (SYMC) provides security solutions, and SAS provides statistical and visual analysis.At the beginning of February, Gartner forecast that by 2016, 25 percent of large global companies will have adopted big data analytics for at least one security or fraud detection use case. Gartner's vice president, Avivah Litan, said that enterprises can achieve significant savings in time and money when using big data analytics to stop crime and security infractions by stopping losses and increasing productivity. Gartner's forecast, together with IDC's forecast that digital data will grow from 130 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) in 2005 to 40,000 exabytes in 2020 incorporates an opportunity to benefit from these trends. The Splunk-Symantec partnership that was announced on February 28 aimed to benefit from that growth opportunity by combining big data analysis and security services. The partnership will provide corporations with a solution to investigate incidents and detect advanced threats through big data analysis tools. This partnership possesses a potential revenue growth opportunity for Splunk that needs to be translated into dollars, allowing the company to return to its past growth rates.The Splunk-Symantec partnership is another part of Splunk's strategy to enable its customers to unlock great potential in other areas using its solutions. Splunk already has a few software solutions in place that optimize data management in various environments and applications. For example:Adding Symantec security capabilities to its portfolio can be an attractive complementary feature that can attract new customers and be translated into additional licenses and higher revenues.As part of its journey to increase revenues and find new growth engines, on March 5, Splunk announced a new strategic partnership with Tableau to integrate visual analysis and real-time machine-generated data. Splunk's senior vice president of Products, Guido Schroeder, said that the alliance with Tableau extends the value that Splunk software unlocks in machine data. Using Tableau to visualize structured data with machine data in Splunk will enable people to gain new business insights. It is still too early to know whether this strategic partnership will be translated into revenues, but it clearly makes sense for Splunk's and Tableau's customers. The new solution is relatively simple. The use of an ODBC driver to link between Splunk data and Tableau capabilities will enable customers to benefit from both companies' comparative advantage. Although it is too early to judge this partnership, it seems that this solution alone will not increase revenues drastically, as customers theoretically could create a similar solution in-house, whether they use Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAS, or Splunk platforms. However, customers looking for a comprehensive and simple solution and who do not want to spend the extra time and money developing the feature can benefit from it if they are Splunk customers. Although the Tableau feature seems useful, it seems more a nice-to-have feature than the wow feature that will make customers transfer from other platforms to Splunk.ConclusionsA promising big data software developer, Splunk experienced some tough months after releasing lower-than-expected results and guidance. The company continues to maintain its existing products that enhance VMWare, NetApp, and Microsoft products, while looking for new opportunities. To drive higher revenues, Splunk is looking for new growth engines, and has announced two new partnerships with Symantec and Tableau. Although the Tableau feature seems nice, I can't see customers shifting to Splunk solely due to that. However, the Symantec partnership that adds a security capability to Splunk big data analysis can drive higher revenues. Taking into consideration IDC's forecast for an increase in digital data and Gartner's forecast for big data security demand, I believe that the Symantec partnership could generate higher revenues for Splunk. Having said that, I am not sure it will be enough to gain investors' trust again and stop the stock decline. Investors in the big data market want to see revenue growth, and unless the company presents high growth rates again in the next earnings release, the stock will not return to February's highs. I will follow up in the next quarter.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        Incremental information obtained at Splunk Live materially increased the intrinsic value to $52 per share.
        The technicals are bearish with a support zone at $30-40 per share.","As can happen when a substantial amount of capital flees an asset, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) has become undervalued. While a technical bottom isn't in place yet, the bottom probably isn't far away. I look for solid first quarter and second quarter results to attract bids.Splunk has a tremendous runway in front of it. The company will likely increase its presence in the Fortune 100. There is definitely room for international expansion. And the company still primarily relies on a couple of products. Management plans on adding capacity particularly adding experienced sales personnel. Most importantly, Splunk solves a major problem for companies by increasing operational intelligence.Consequently, I think a material reduction of the risk premium and the associated increase in the intrinsic value ($52.33) is warranted.Recent DevelopmentsAnalyst's NoteSplunk develops and sells software that enables customers to collect, index, monitor, and analyze large amounts of data generated by a wide variety of systems, applications, and devices. The company is organized into two business segments: License contributed 66% to revenue in fiscal 2014, while maintenance and services contributed 34%.Coming off of Splunk Live in New York City, I have a better understanding of the use cases of Splunk Enterprise. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York uses Splunk to improve electronic data security. Also, NBC Universal utilizes Splunk to improve the performance of its websites and applications for the end users; the capabilities, log analysis, weren't available to the firm's IT staff prior to Splunk. The platform has allowed IT staffs to solve problems proactively. Additionally, the business analysis tools allow companies to incrementally increase revenues.There are a number of ways for Splunk to continue to grow. The company is increasing its channel partners; for example, Splunk is available through Amazon. Companies can find new use cases and that includes developing apps to run on top of the core engine. Splunk continues to add headcount in sales and develop personnel with domain expertise. The company has room to increase its presence within the Fortune 100, as companies can apply Splunk to business analytic, IT operational intelligence, and security problems. While the pace of growth will vary, given the limited competition, Splunk has a relatively clear runway in front of it.For the first fiscal quarter, I'm expecting revenues growth of 40% with a gross profit margin of 88%. The operating loss is expected to be 20% of revenues, and the net loss is anticipated as coming in at 25% of revenues. My first quarter estimate is in line with the street, but my full year forecast is about $20 million above the street's forecast. Data usage growth and customer wins are forecasted to drive revenues growth.The company should continue to have ample liquidity. In terms of cash flows, there could be $25 million of cash provided by operations and $21 million of free cash flow to the firm. In 2014, cash provided by operations totaled $74 million and free cash flow to the firm totaled $65 million. So, there should be excellent growth of cash flows during this fiscal year.Splunk is expected to post solid growth numbers and cash flows numbers this year. The company has an excellent and potentially sticky installed base, being a majority of the Fortune 100. Management hopefully will be able to further penetrate the market by increasing awareness of the ROI through use-case awareness. Strong cash flows growth and a solid ROI for end users should drive Splunk's revenues into the multi-billion dollar per year range.Portfolio & ValuationSplunk is in a bear market of intermediate and primary degree. But there is an excellent support zone a few dollars down. I expect more signs of accumulation in the $30-40 per share zone.Using a fundamentals-based model that incorporates the company's lifecycle stage, it appears that Splunk is undervalued. After attending Splunk Live and chatting with the IT attendees, Splunk employees and channel partners, I materially reduced the risk premium that I am charging the company, which increased the intrinsic value estimate. Based on my estimate, Splunk is 20% undervalued. To be more specific, I reduced the required return on equity from 10% to 8% as a result of speaking with Splunk's customers, executives, and technology partners; the company's solutions are a value added for several large enterprises, and the competitive environment is favorable. Thus, the estimated price target and the forward P/S multiple associated with that price target increased substantially. The company is currently trading at 13 times 2015's revenues, which isn't a high price for 40-60% annual revenues growth.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in Splunk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2284323,24473,2014-06-24T14:22:38-04:00,"Operating income fell to $50M from $16M Year over Year in Q1 FY15.Revenue growth is slowing from 52% in FY14, to a projected 36% in FY15.Tons of dilution because share count is rising rapidly, up 15% Year over Year in Q1 FY15.","IntroductionSplunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) shares are down 24% YTD, and for several good reasons. The big data software provider had an incredible 2013, when its stock price ran from $30 to $70 per share, but there is no doubt its valuation was, and still is very stretched.Most of the bullish analyst notes on Splunk (the main factor in driving shares higher) focus on the opportunity in the big data market. After gauging how many billions will be made in 'big data' 5 years down the road, they assign Splunk a chunk of that market.This flawed, but all too common analysis has led to Splunk sporting a market capitalization of ~$6.2B. As far as I can tell, this is about as bubble like as it gets. My main reasons, in no particular order, are below.Revenue Growth is Declining FastIn theory, the explanation for Splunk's valuation is lots of growth for many years to come. That may indeed be possible, but Splunk's revenue growth has been declining rapidly for the past 4 years.*projectedAs Splunk matures, its growth rate is declining, as one would expect. If Splunk is unable to maintain growth above 30%, many of the high expectations placed on the company will be put in jeopardy.Operating Income & Operating Margins Declining DramaticallyLong-term Splunk investors better hope the recent trend in the company's gross & operating margins will reverse very soon.Splunk's operating income was ($50.10M) in Q1 of FY15 (ending April 2014). That's an operating margin of -58.3%, which is even worse than the abysmal -27.4% reported in Q1 last year. This chart from Google Finance, accurately sums up the situation.In short, the company is spending more than it's making. Operating expenses are growing significantly faster than revenue, a trend adversely affecting profitability.Dilution, Dilution & More Dilution are Destroying Shareholder ValueSplunk's diluted shares outstanding were only 80M at the end of FY13, and increased to 105M by the end of FY14. A jump of more than 30%.Today (as of Q1 FY 15), Splunk's share count is 117.3M. This means in just 5 quarters, a shareholder who owned 1% of Splunk at the beginning of 2013, now owns just 0.68%.This consistent increase has been a consequence of premium employee stock option plans, and Splunk needing to raise more capital to fund growth via the equity markets.What's even more noteworthy, and misleading, is the fact that Splunk loves to tout its cash flow every quarter (generally positive as the company receives upfront payments for multi-quarter contracts). This gives the appearance of growth, when in reality, after factoring in dilution, free cash flow per share is declining.Valuation - Where's the Profitability??What I find hardest to comprehend is why investors are willing to wait so patiently, at such a high price, with no profits in sight.Below is a financial model I made with revenue projections significantly above Wall Street's. The model also assumes that revenue growth will begin outpacing OPEX growth starting next year. Meaning Splunk will have to start turning things around very, very quickly from a profitability standpoint.Another key assumption to note is the 87% gross margin. This is well above the sub 84% gross margin Splunk reported in Q1 FY 15.Lastly, I assumed a dramatic reduction in the pace of dilution, which has been consistently increasing the company's share count at 10-15% per year. Instead I used a much more modest <5% growth in the company's dilution share count.Even with these generous assumptions, Splunk doesn't reach profitability on an operating basis until FY 2021, 7 years from now.ConclusionTo make its current valuation a good investment, Splunk needs to turn dramatically profitable in the coming years. But, even with torrid revenue growth projections well above Wall Street's estimates, shares look overvalued by a significant degree.Management will be forced to slow down its dramatically increasing operating expenses, or Splunk has no chance to report a profit.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I continue to be very cautious, and don't think the latest sell-off automatically translates into a buying opportunity.First Quarter HeadlinesSplunk reported first quarter revenues for its fiscal 2015 which came in at $85.9 million, up 50% on the year before, and ahead of consensus estimates at $80.5 million.The company reported a rapid increase in its net losses which more than tripled to $50.8 million. GAAP losses came in at $0.43 per share.Based on non-GAAP metrics, Splunk reported a loss of $0.04 per share with of course stock-based compensation being the major driver behind the discrepancy between both metrics. Analysts were looking for a loss of six cents.Looking Into The ResultsSplunk's license revenues rose by 41% to $51.3 million. Direct costs of these revenues are incredibly low resulting in extremely high gross margins of 99.85%. The company signed up some 400 new customers during the quarter to end the quarter serving 7,400 customers across the globe.Maintenance and service revenues were up by 64.8% to $34.6 million with gross margins coming in at 59.3% of revenues. This meant that margins were down more than seven percent points compared to last year.The expense management has been disappointing with operating costs growing much quicker than topline revenue growth, increasing by 84% compared to last year. Research and development expenses as well as general and administrative expenses each more than doubled compared to last year.The company ¨spent¨ $43.2 million in stock-base compensation over the past quarter. With over a 1,000 employees this comes down to an average stock-based compensation of $43,000 for this quarter alone!Second Quarter OutlookFor the second quarter, Splunk now anticipates revenues between $92 and $94 million, ahead of consensus estimates at $91.5 million. This implies that growth is seen between 38 and 41% on an annual basis.Non-GAAP margins are seen between negative 2 and negative 4 percent.For the full year revenues are seen between $402 and $410 million which compares to a previous guidance of revenues of $400 million. Non-GAAP margins are seen around zero, consistent with the company's own guidance.Valuing SplunkSplunk ended the quarter with $827 million in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company does not have any debt outstanding.Trading around $42 per share the company is valued at $4.9 billion which values operating assets at $4.1 billion. This values operating assets of the company at around 10 times annual revenues as seen for this year.Splunk does not pay a dividend at the moment.Great Product, Good Company, Lousy StockSplunk's solutions look amazing in their ability to generate operational intelligence. Data and information from virtually any source can be searched, monitored and analyzed in real-time.The growth opportunities in this area are huge with companies being able to boost operational excellence at relatively low costs. The rapid growth and exciting products attract staff to work for the company. Another big plus is the average of more than $43,000 in stock-based compensation for a period of just three months.Still I am not excited about the slowing revenue growth in combination with widening losses. Worse, increased stock-based compensation results in quicker dilution with the stock price having suffered lately. This implies that Splunk has to award more shares to its workers to keep them happy.Shares of Splunk peaked at over $100 earlier this year on the back of runaway momentum. After a 60% correction, shares still trade at 10 times forward revenues while the company is not even close to breaking-even on a GAAP basis.For this reason, I continue to shun the shares as momentum is still negative and the fundamentals still can't provide support at the moment. I would argue that it is late in the game to initiate a short position as momentum players and a shift in market sentiment could easily result in a sharp rebound in the company's shares.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2435295,68415,2014-08-19T10:57:51-04:00,"At the current closing price of $42.75, the market is fairly valuing SPLK.This valuation is hinged on continued top line growth, which may not be reached given IBM's recent entry into the market.Investors should be cautioned if considering taking a long position in SPLK - the downside risk far exceeds the upside.","Company OverviewSplunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) was started in 2003 with the purpose of bringing machine data analytics to companies. Machines data is generated by software applications and devices and contains time-stamped records of any activities ranging from transactions to security threats. Companies use machine data to get an understanding of daily operations at a micro-level.Companies across industries use machine data to increase operational efficiency. However adoption rates for machine data is actually quite low. Splunk's success is entirely dependent on its sales force educating clients on what exactly machine data is and how it can be used (Source: RBC Capital Markets Research Report).But there is nothing revolutionary about the Splunk product. Aggregating machine data and presenting it in a dashboard format can easily be done by any company that has the capabilities to analyze big data. Without a strong barrier to entry, Splunk's marketing efforts on educating the world about machine data could very well be marketing for another firm.The presence of IBMIn 2013, IBM released the IBM SmartCloud Log Analysis which, all bells and whistles aside, performs the basic functions of the Splunk Enterprises system. Earlier this year, IBM added predictive insights capabilities to the existing system, far beyond what Splunk can offer. If IBM wanted to make a push in machine data, Splunk's market share would suffer tremendously. Splunk already spends 70% of revenues on marketing and sales, and this is only used to educate clients on the use of machine data. With increased competition, Splunk will have to up marketing even more to differentiate its product.Valuation(Source: Own Calculations)(Source: Own Calculations)The key assumptions underlying the DCF model I used are that Splunk will take nine years to reach steady growth/maturity stage and will keep the same all equity capital structure. Licensing revenues will continue to grow into 2015 at the 46% rate, however due to the lack of a strong economic moat, this growth rate will decline given increased competition from IBM and others. Maintenance revenue will grow in line with licensing revenues and services revenues, i.e. training fees is projected to grow as a percentage of licensing revenue as the user base grows. Licensing costs will remain steady and maintenance and service costs are assumed to flat line at 20% of M&S revenues.Research and development costs will flat line at 10% of total revenue. Sales and marketing, the key driver for Splunk's growth, will increase in absolute dollars terms of $100 million. As the majority of the S&M expense pertains to salaries, the current rate of growth will allow Splunk to hire approximately 100 additional sales employees. G&A expense will continue to growth at 3%. Other items such as interest income and other income/expense remain the same. The nominal tax rate is expected to be 30%. Capital expenditures and D&A are both projected to grow at 10% year-over-year.With these assumptions, Splunk will be profitable by 2017. The implied price per share is $42.07, in-line with what the market is currently valuing the company. The potential upside that investors are expecting may come from capital restructuring to leverage the company or from higher growth than what I projected. However I personally do not believe Splunk has any more potential to grow.The possibility of being acquiredSplunk in many ways is reminiscent of SPSS which was bought by IBM in 2009. SPSS, like Splunk, was a pioneer in statistical analysis and data mining, with an interface that fits well with clients. IBM paid $1.2 billion for SPSS, a 42% premium over SPSS's closing price. IBM stated that the purpose of the acquisition was to strengthen its data mining and data analysis departments. IBM can just as easily make the argument that Splunk would strengthen its machine data analysis department. At today's market value of $5.07B, a 42% premium would imply IBM would pay $7.2B for Splunk. The most IBM paid for an acquisition was $5B for the Canadian business intelligence company Cognos, which had annual revenues of $979M and 3,500 employees. To justify paying over $7B for a company, Splunk will have to first break $1B in total revenue, which may take 3-4 years.Advice for investorsIn terms of valuation, the market is fairly pricing Splunk. The potential upside comes from an expanding market and strong top line growth. However, it is unreasonable to believe that competition will not dampen the expected growth. My prediction is that Splunk will see diminishing revenue growth for the next 7-8 years, and from there growth will be at a minimum of roughly 2% year-over-year, which results in an implied valuation of $42.07/share. The potential downside comes from increased competition by IBM and others. There is hope that 3-4 years down the line Splunk will be acquired by IBM, however Splunk will still have to break $1B in sales and significantly increase its sales team. As of today, I caution new investors from initiating any long positions in Splunk and for current investors to hold and watch for signs that growth is slowing down.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2078713,24279,2014-03-10T14:18:57-04:00,"Participated in the acceleration of data mining pure plays in 2013.The company has executed a solid business plan with its disruptive technology in operational intelligence.Based on traditional econometrics, the company seems overvalued at this juncture.Macro headwinds and a lack of accelerated revenues could cause the equity to fall further.","Mining and analyzing unstructured machine data is a business practice that's here to stay. Last year was a huge year for many small cap ""Big Data"" stocks. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA), and Datawatch (NASDAQ:DWCH) doubled, and even tripled in value. Much larger competitors in the business intelligence arena didn't fare so well. EMC (EMC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP) had lackluster performances in a year that the S&P 500 was up nearly 30%. That said, the smaller data analytic securities appear to be overvalued, most notably Splunk.The CompanySplunk is the undisputed leader in operational intelligence of the data analytic pure plays. Its software detects gridlock in a corporation's networks, and can massage data in innovative ways to improve organizational performance. CEO Godfrey Sullivan talks about two examples in the most recent conference call:To paraphrase the most recent 10-K, the core of Splunk's software is a proprietary machine data engine that enables dynamic schema creation on the fly. End users can run queries without having to understand the structure of the data. Splunk complements the core product with additional content in the form of apps or add-ons that can be deployed on top of the main data engine. It doesn't require customization, long deployment cycles or extensive professional services commonly associated with traditional enterprise software applications. It works like a browser, much like Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Chrome.Last quarter, Splunk added 500 new customers, upping the total to 7,000 worldwide. This includes roughly 60 of the Fortune 100. Although this is a significant penetration of the upper echelon in business, the statistic is somewhat misleading. Those 60 companies don't encompass the entire organization, but may represent just a department or two for each specific entity. Nevertheless, Splunk is making inroads with its disruptive technology.If this is just the dawn of the machine data revolution, there is plenty of room for growth. For instance, the company's year-over-year quarterly revenue has grown by over 50% in each of the past four quarters, as reported by Investor's Business Daily. Although this growth may not be sustainable, it may still continue at an above average rate, at least compared to the competition like an IBM.In reading the prepared remarks in the conference call, you come away impressed by the new and upcoming revenue streams created by Splunk partnerships. These relationships include:In order to stay ahead of the technology curve, Splunk spends a considerable amount of money on R&D, $41.9 million in fiscal 2013, almost double the $23.6 million spent in 2012. Although fiscal 2014 R&D expenditures won't be released until early April, Splunk has a history of pouring money back into the company for future business development. In addition, what it can't create in-house, it goes out and gets. BugSense was bought in Q3 to enable direct access to data from mobile devices into Splunk. In Q4, the company purchased Cloudmeter so clients can capture data directly from their networks.ValuationSplunk had a tremendous Q4 reporting revenue of $99.9 million. Full year fiscal 2014 sales were $302 million, up 52% year-over-year. Although earnings per share for the quarter equaled $0.03, its full year non-GAAP net loss was $3.1 million, or $0.03 loss per share based on a share count of 105 million. The company will probably continue to incur losses, or break even as it plows more money into R&D, acquisitions, and expanding headcount. For example, employees grew by 300 for the full year, making the total 1,000 under the Splunk umbrella.For fiscal 2015 (the current calendar year), the company provided guidance of $400 million in revenue. In Q1, sales projections are for $78-$80 million, with an operating margin of minus 8%-10%. I believe that it can be safely stated that a young public company like Splunk should not be valued on an EPS basis because it's investing considerable amounts for growth. It probably won't be profitable for awhile, and if it does get into the black, net profits will be negligible. However, Price/Sales can be utilized as a barometer as to how expensive the equity is.Utilizing Yahoo Finance statistics, we can observe that the Price/Sales for the trailing twelve months is 32. That's extremely expensive for a company that is guiding revenue growth of roughly 33% for the full fiscal year. Price/Book for the most recent quarter is 12.6. Another generous metric. The market cap is a whopping 9.8 billion. The short float as of February 14th is 3.1%, which may have trended lower since the stock has pulled back significantly the last week. Its intraday high was $106 on February 28th, but has sold off this past week to $88. Quite a drop if you were riding the momentum.ConclusionMy personal preference in investing is growth at a reasonable price. At this juncture, Splunk doesn't fit the bill, although you may make money with the stock going forward. Consensus opinion calls for a $105 price for Splunk during the next twelve months. Many analysts believe it's a ""market perform"", which means it will trade in conjunction with the overall indexes. The high price estimate is for $122, the low comes in at $78. Depending on who you follow, you can probably still make a profit with Splunk, but the easy money has been made. It rallied from $28 to its current price of $88 in 15 months.It is of my opinion that the overall indexes are backing and filling right now, and could continue to move sideways for the next quarter. In addition, some market pockets such as biotechnology, 2013 IPOs, and the data mining pure plays have made huge runs, and could be ripe for a sector rotation. Geopolitical issues are always a headwind, especially with Russian invasion of Crimea we are currently experiencing. Combine those opinions with the fact Splunk's revenue growth may be slowing based on the overall expansion of the company, you've got yourself a perfect storm for obtaining shares at a reduced rate.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

All these shares were sold pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.SEC Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Splunk's insider activity by calendar month.There have been 3,204,666 shares sold, and there have been zero shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.FinancialsSplunk reported the fiscal 2014 full-year, which ended January 31, financial results on February 27 with the following highlights:The seven insiders sold their shares after these results.Splunk's revenue growth has been slowing down since 2012.OutlookSplunk's guidance is as follows:CompetitionSplunk's competitors include CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA), Compuware (CPWR), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). Here is a table comparing these companies.Splunk has the highest P/S ratio among these four companies.Here is a table of these competitors' insider activities this year.Compuware has also seen intensive insider selling during the last 30 days.ConclusionThere have been seven different insiders selling Splunk, and there have not been any insiders buying Splunk during the last 30 days. Two of these seven insiders decreased their holdings by more than 10%. Splunk has an insider ownership of 29.30%.Splunk has a $74 price target from the Point & Figure chart. I believe there is an opportunity for a short entry with the $74 price target. I would place a stop loss at $106, which is the all-time high. The four main reasons for the proposed short entry are a bearish Point & Figure chart, relatively high P/S ratio, negative earnings, and the intensive insider-selling activity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in SPLK over the next 72 hours.

2137343,39121,2014-04-11T10:32:57-04:00,"Big data is still an early opportunity.Tableau, Splunk and Oracle growth metrics compared.Tableau and Splunk partnership – a powerful combination.","Big Data has received a lot of attention recently, and for good reason. Every day, more and more data is being generated, and companies are eager to understand how the information can improve their business.There are many companies in the big data space in one form or another. This article is going to focus on two of the more recent IPOs, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK). Both companies have been delivering impressive sales growth since going public, and continue to invest heavily in their businesses. As a point of reference, this article will compare the financial performance of DATA and SPLK with database leader Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Readers may already be aware DATA and SPLK have recently formed a partnership. This could turn out to be good news for investors, as both companies appear to be executing well on market opportunities. SPLK is viewed as a premier solution for collecting and organizing data (the platform), and DATA is heralded as having developed an intuitive, powerful and quick method for displaying the data in meaningful ways (visual analytics tool).The demand for new database solutions appears to be high, but so far, most deployments from both companies are user or department-specific. It appears they have yet to make significant inroads into enterprise-wide deployments currently owned by companies like Oracle, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others.Both DATA and SPLK have reported a full year of financial performance, so let's take a look at how the numbers stack up with the database king ORCL. We start by looking at the top line sales growth for all three companies over the last four quarters:Data provided by MarketSmithFew technology companies can lay claim to the sales growth DATA is currently experiencing, and SPLK is not far behind. There is little doubt it becomes more difficult to grow top line revenue when you become the size of a company like ORCL. Still, with all the money it spent on acquisitions in recent years, you would expect more top line growth.Next, we turn our attention to bottom line growth.Data provided by MarketSmith# - Year-ago quarter was negativeCompared to Oracle, who has delivered small but consistent earnings growth over the last year, DATA and SPLK have a long way to go. Both DATA and SPLK have just started to generate positive earnings, with DATA doing a better job of dropping money to the bottom line over the last year.For another look at earnings, we can compare the following metrics:Data provided by MarketSmithEPS Growth Rate is a proprietary MarketSmith measure of earnings growth over several historical periods. Earnings Stability is a proprietary MarketSmith measure that ranks companies from 1-99, with lower scores representing a more stable earnings history.Here again, we see a more mature earnings picture in ORCL. DATA and SPLK are investing heavily in their business, and are not expected to generate meaningful earnings growth for the next couple of years.The next set of data shows how both DATA and SPLK are pouring money back into the company via R&D. We also see a much lower Annual Pre-Tax Margin compared to ORCL.Data provided by MarketSmithThe large Cash Flow vs. EPS % Last Year for SPLK is not impressive considering it lost money over the last year.A few other helpful metrics:Data provided by MarketSmithClearly, DATA and SPLK have been able to attract customers and propel themselves into mid-cap stocks, based on rapid sales growth in a hot space with tremendous potential. If either company is able to attain one-third of ORCL's current market cap through organic growth, they would grow by a factor between 8-10. This is why investing in this type of company is so attractive.The explosive sales growth DATA and SPLK have experienced does come at a price. Both trade at high valuations. The dynamic place in technology these disruptive companies are focused on represent huge growth curves, and investors are rewarding their strong top line growth with high valuations.However, both companies have a lot of work ahead. DATA and SPLK's current financial position might explain part of the reason why both stocks have been hammered so hard in the current pullback. DATA is down around 30% from 52-week highs and SPLK 42%. The expiration of shareholder lock-up expirations and recent follow-on stock offerings by both companies may also be impacting the current stock price. Those are just a couple of the risks often associated with young public companies.Another risk associated with both DATA and SPLK has to do with their underlying technology. Large enterprise database deployments are complex, and customer needs varied. It is possible the current technology set of DATA and SPLK will be limited in their ability to expand in the enterprise. It is also a competitive environment, with many companies, some very large, focused on delivering big data solutions, which could limit growth for DATA and SPLK.The recently announced partnership between DATA and SPLK may help both companies overcome the big challenge of continuing to expand deployments beyond specific workers and departments. Integration with IT departments and an enterprise sales strategy will become a more important part of future growth for both companies. SPLK may have an advantage here, based on the success it has had in the IT security market. DATA, on the other hand, appears to have a larger customer base (17,000 vs. 7,000 for SPLK). It may turn out the recently announced partnership is what represents the next leg of growth for both companies.It appears both DATA and SPLK have arrived at a time when the demands of database customers has increased significantly and are expected to continue to grow for years to come. Both companies have delivered impressive top line growth, and their recently announced partnership may signal their confidence in a bright future.Disclosure: I am long DATA.

2130553,48501,2014-04-08T05:21:46-04:00,The recent sell off could be a buying opportunity for nimble traders.The shares appear about 50% overvalued.The technology appears relatively useful and nascent.,"The momentum names have been taking a beating lately, and Jim Cramer said on the Monday morning CNBC show that if he were still in the game that he would be purchasing shares of some of these momentum names. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a momentum name, and from a pure technical perspective, it would likely be wise to accumulate shares once the technicals signal accumulation.From a fundamentals perspective, the platform appears to be useful. The integration with key applications from leading vendors suggests Splunk has staying power. Also, the revenues growth rate is phenomenal. Additionally, the balance sheet is strong.With that stated, I think the shares are overvalued. I think the intrinsic value is closer to $26 per share, and that currently the shares are priced for perfection, which doesn't exist.Recent DevelopmentsAnalyst's NoteSplunk develops and sells software that enables customers to collect, index, monitor, and analyze large amounts of data generated by a wide variety of systems, applications, and devices. The company is organized into two business segments: License contributed 66% to revenue in fiscal 2014, while maintenance and services contributed 34%. The firm is not yet profitable.Splunk Enterprise 6 is available for download; the platform is based on the idea of operational intelligence for everyone. It comes with several apps, which are available for download, that interact with services and apps from other providers, such as AWS and Citrix XenDesktop. I may be losing a portion of the functionality by using Enterprise 6 on a Mac rather than on a Windows-based PC.After a few hours of setting up Enterprise 6, I was able to gain some operational intelligence. Granted because of my inexperience the intelligence was limited, but what I gathered from the platform is that some people think Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ""sucks"" and that we are in a historic bull market. Specifically, in December of 2011, the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted its best December performance since 1991. Additionally, the indexes started to sell off with 10 minutes to go in 2010.Simply stated, once I found the ""stocks"" app, I was able to generate data that was relatively meaningful. But the analytic capabilities of the investment recommendation portion of the app may be of limited use based on the extensive (soon to be borderline excessive) training and experience that I have earned. If I worked with the developers, the app could be more useful. Overall, I'm substantially less than certain about how to use Enterprise 6 and the data that it generates, but I get the impression that it is useful and nascent.Revenue growth of 40% in 2015 and 2016 is anticipated to be driven by the continued implementation of big data solutions in the enterprise and SMB spaces. Management is likely to continue to reinvest those revenues into marketing, selling, and general administrative expenses. Consequently, Splunk is forecasted to continue generating operating losses in 2015 and 2016. As the firm nears the $1B of annual revenue level, operating income may move closer to the breakeven level.The liquidity appears ample and the solvency position seems solid. I think revenues growth outpaces assets growth. The financial leverage ratio is expected to stay roughly inline with peer companies. Also, some of the cash raised in the equity offering is expected to be used, which results in a declining current ratio.I think we continue to see strong cash flows growth driven by revenues growth. Obviously, management will have to invest in working and fixed capital. But free cash flow to equity should cross the $100M mark in fiscal 2016. I'm not forecasting an additional equity offering in the next two fiscal years.Splunk appears to have long-term staying power as the firm is forecasted to generate annual revenue over $500M during fiscal 2016. The firm collected an estimated $361M in cash from customers during fiscal 2014. While the return on capital is negative near-term, as Splunk gains traction in the market, the return on capital will increase.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in Splunk.Portfolio & ValuationSplunk is in a bear market of at least intermediate-term degree. The share price hasn't formed a technical bottom yet, which suggests that the shares are likely to continue to trade at lower prices. So the play here is to wait for a bottom.Using a fundamentals-based model that incorporates the company's lifecycle stage, it appears that Splunk is overvalued. A 50% decline from the current share price would put shares closer to inline with the estimated intrinsic value. At 21.7 times sales and 9.4 times book value, shares of Splunk are priced for perfection.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Splunk's insider-trading activity by calendar month.There have been 2,694,394 shares sold, and there have been zero shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.FinancialsSplunk reported the fiscal 2014 third-quarter, which ended October 31, financial results on November 21 with the following highlights:OutlookSplunk's guidance is as follows:CompetitionSplunk's competitors include CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA), Compuware (CPWR), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM).

1934781,59771,2014-01-09T13:30:00-05:00,,"Despite Large Revenue Growth, Splunk's Shares Priced for Perfection and Then Some. Numerous Catalysts Provide a Great Shorting OpportunitySplunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), or the ""Company,"" is the perfect example of a company that we believe is a great short candidate: the company has recently benefitted from a confluence of substantial revenue growth, good market timing and good luck (SPLK: Right Place, Right Time). Shares have skyrocketed from their IPO price of $17 in April 2012 to a current price of $70.78. This combination of fortuitous events has caused analysts and investors to project continued hockey-stick growth, lose sight of the fundamentals, and completely ignore any number of potential risks, both idiosyncratic and market-wide. We are not suggesting that Splunk is doomed to fail, merely that at its staggering valuation of 32x TTM P/S and 29x fiscal year 2014E P/S, the Company is wildly overvalued. The market is betting that Splunk is going to be able to continue to ride its wave of growth for a very long time. We believe there are a number of catalysts, which could prove problematic for this overly optimistic assumption. Since long-term perfection is priced into the stock, we believe that any one of these catalysts will cause the shares to come crashing down like a tidal wave.Business OverviewSplunk provides an innovative software platform that enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data. Splunk's software can be used to analyze a whole range of machine generated structured and unstructured data. For instance, Splunk allows a client's IT department to analyze, in real time, what terms their customers are searching, what sites they come from and go to after browsing through Splunk's client's site and pretty much anything that the customer does while on their site. In addition, companies have used Splunk's software for a variety of tasks, from better understanding the characteristics of their energy usage to enhancing their security profiles.The Bull CaseSplunk bulls focus on the company's tremendous ability to grow its revenues and acquire new customers. Since Splunk has grown its revenues from $9mm in FY 2008 (January 31) to a guidance of $292mm for FY 2014 (midpoint of range), their 2012, 2013 and 2014E revenue growth rate is an impressive 83%, 64% and 47%, respectively.In addition to growing revenue, SPLK's sales team has managed to add an impressive 1,600 new customers over the past 12 months, leaving them with a current customer base of around 6,400 (3Q14 - Release). Considering that many customers sign yearly maintenance and service contracts (which the company proudly flaunts as having a 94% renewal rate (94% - 3Q14), the addition of customers will supply an increasing source or annual revenue going forward. Just as importantly, if not more so, as CFO David Conte explained in their 4Q13 earnings release, ""on average, [existing] customers spent approximately 4x their initial purchase in the 3 years following their original order."" (4x Initial Purchase - 4Q13)Add all of these positives to a company that generates positive cash flow and expects to be profitable next year (on a non-GAAP basis), mix in the secular demand for ""disruptive"" tech-stocks, and you have the formula for the perfect investment, so the current valuation implies.Bringing the Current Valuation into PerspectiveAt 32x LTM Revenue and 29x FY 2014E Revenue, SPLK is aggressively priced. To better understand what these multiples imply, we'll consider what assumptions investors must be making to value SPLK at its current price. As shown below, investors are making extremely aggressive assumptions regarding both Splunk's future growth and its future profitability. If Splunk is able to generate 30% revenue CAGR for the next 5 years and it is able to achieve a 20% net margin in FY 2019, at its current price of $68.67, Splunk will be valued at a very high P/E ratio of 39.3. Below, we will detail why we believe these assumptions are overly optimistic.As described in the previous section, and shown in the graph above, investors appear to be confident that SPLK can continue to grow extremely fast while also becoming enormously profitable. Thus far, growth has been impressive, but it has been decreasing at a meaningful rate, as shown below. For reasons that we will detail in the remainder of this paper, we expect the decline in annual growth to continue.Although growth to date has been commendable, Splunk has not been able to achieve profitability. In fact, as the Company has grown its revenues, EBITDA has decreased.Since we expect these trends to continue for both revenue and profitability, we think that it is highly unlikely that Splunk will ever grow into its current valuation.Headwinds to Revenue Growth1. Revenue RecognitionOne risk to SPLK's growth is due to their revenue recognition policies. As disclosed in their 10-K, ""we typically enter into perpetual license agreements, whereby we generally recognize the license fee portion of the arrangement upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied."" (Emphasis Added) (2013 10-K - PG 16). In fact, as the company has repeatedly explained, around 70%-80% of their revenue comes from ""perpetual licenses."" The remainder of sales comes from ""term licenses,"" under which, revenues are booked ratably across the length of the contract. (3Q14 Earnings Release)Although existing customers tend to upgrade and expand their usage of Splunk, each new sale they make, by definition, reduces the total future demand for their product (in the sense that ""demand"" means demand for data usage, not necessarily customers). We believe that the company has already picked most of the low hanging fruit, and as a result, additional revenue growth will continue to be marginally more difficult (costly).Because companies using a perpetual license business model front-load revenue, they generally command a lower multiple than term license companies do (Perpetual License vs. Term License). Management started to address this issue back in 2012 with their introduction of Splunk Storm, a cloud based suite of services with a Software as a Service model (""SaaS""). Because a SaaS, cloud-based model would potentially cannibalize their enterprise sales, many commentators questioned Splunk's dedication to the service (Splunk Just Surrender?). Ultimately, Splunk decided to scratch the SaaS model and now offers a free, limited version of Splunk as a promotional tool. The company just released this tool in their most recent earnings release, and they were forced to take a $2.1mm charge for capitalized R&D Assets.In another attempt to increase (or at least to try and lead investors to believe an increase) recurring revenue, management has recently been highlighting their ""Enterprise Adoption Agreements"" (""EAA"") (4Q13 - Introduction of EAAs). These agreements allow company-wide adoption of Splunk products and are priced based on an estimated amount of data usage, where Splunk generally won't penalize the company for over usage for three years, and after the three-year ""term"" they will renegotiate the contract if the customer requires more data. Starting in the beginning of calendar '13, management disclosed the type of agreement to the public and highlighted that these agreements generally had a ""three-year duration,"" implying that they were term licenses. Management's ambiguous portrayal of these agreements caught the eye of the SEC, which recently asked management to clarify their description of EAAs (SEC Inquiry into EAAs). Through these correspondences, management admits that these agreements generally contain perpetual licenses, as well as term licenses and maintenance agreement (SPLK's Response to SEC). The company also admits that for perpetual licenses sold as part of these EAAs, ""at the end of the three year period, the customer must enter into a separate maintenance agreement"" but ""The customer has the right to use the perpetual software license after the three-year period irrespective of the maintenance renewal."" However, to the company's credit, they have increased their guidance of term sales to perpetual sales to 20%-30% of sales from 10%-20% of sales. (33% Term License - 3Q14 Earnings Release)We think this trend will only continue to grow as SaaS becomes a more meaningful part of SPLK's market. The adoption of SaaS has revolutionized many subsets of the IT industry and we don't believe that big data will be any different. As you can see from the below chart, a majority of the IT spend growth is expected to come from the Cloud.SaaS provides a number of benefits to the end user, including lower cost of ownership. Splunk has attempted to grow its SaaS offering through the release of its Storm, Splunk Cloud and Hunk: Splunk Analytics for Hadoop. As SaaS sales are recognized as revenues over a term, instead of immediately upon sale, this shift will impede SPLK's attempts to consistently grow quarterly revenues. In addition, as nearly all of SPLK's costs are fixed in the short run, this shift in revenues will negatively impact margins.Yet the analysis above assumes that SPLK is successful in developing a SaaS platform. In their recent 10-Q, management stated that they weren't going to offer a SaaS service on their Storm platform and took a $2.1mm write off for their capitalized R & D related to this service (Here). This makes sense in light of how a SaaS offering would impact Splunk's revenue growth rate and margins, yet it opens up an enormous competitive threat. SaaS models have been well received by the enterprise community primarily because they typically offer a lower cost of ownership to the customer. Many of Splunk's most well regarded competitors, including Sumo Logic and Loggily, offer a similar product to Splunk's but in a SaaS format. We expect this to create a meaningful headwind to growth, as Splunk's customers are likely to prefer a SaaS offering as this market matures.2. CompetitionSo far, we've only focused on how SPLK's growth may slow due to company specific attributes. We believe that a larger risk the company faces is the risk of technological obsolescence. As of today, Splunk is the premier player in its space and has benefited from a technological advantage over its competitors. As a result of the success that Splunk and its big data competitors have enjoyed, there is an enormous incentive for other companies to create an offering with better capabilities than Splunk's Enterprise 6. To continue to grow, Splunk will have to effectively compete with both large, well established tech service companies and small venture capital backed start-ups. This risk is heightened since nearly all of SPLK's revenue comes from one productMany of Splunk's most relevant competitors are products owned by large, well-established tech service companies. These larger players present a formidable risk to Splunk, as they have tremendous resources on which they can draw as they attempt to innovate. The most relevant examples are HP (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (NYSE:IBM), TIBCO (NASDAQ:TIBX), and EMC Corp. (EMC).In addition to the companies above, other large players such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA), BMC Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:BMC), etc. view Splunk's market as an attractive one. As many of the core markets in which these companies operate have recently slowed, they are all looking outward for new growth opportunities. One example is Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) September 2013 investment in Splunk rival Loggily. Although the investment is small for Cisco, it represents an interesting move, as the networking giant doesn't typically invest in internet start-ups (here). We believe that Cisco's investment shows their desire to be a major player in the space.Besides the well-established tech giants mentioned above, there are a number of start-ups that pose an additional threat to the future of SPLK. Loggily, a cloud-based log management service, has recently raised $10.5 million from a collective of venture capital funds and Cisco (Here). Loggily offers a similar service to Splunk's, however its SaaS model costs much less than SPLK's perpetual license does. Another competitor, Sumo Logic, recently released its Logic Anomaly Detection service, which helps IT and tech providers better predict and thus prevent applications or system outages, and helps security professionals similarly predict potential security attacks or out-of-compliance scenarios before they happen. (Sumo Logic Unveils Logic Anomaly Detection). Sumo Logic is another SaaS competitor of SPLK, it has raised over $50 million in venture capital and is contemplating an IPO in the future (Sumo Considers IPO). Finally, a third noteworthy competitor is venture capital backed security firm, Palantir. Palantir recently raised $58 million from investors giving it a roughly $9 billion valuation (Palantir). Palantir's security software analyses an enterprise's big data in order to detect suspicious behavior. On top of being backed by PayPal co-Founder Peter Thiel, Palantir boasts funding from In-Q-Tel, a non-profit venture-capital firm established by the CIA.With the success of companies like SPLK, Tableau Software, Palantir, etc, big data has become an established interest in the venture capital community (see article). We believe this poses an enormous risk for Splunk, as creative destruction is the foundation of the VC world. We aren't in the business of forecasting what technology will or will not come out of Silicon Valley, but we don't like to bet against innovation, and SPKL is facing technology risk. The big data market is in its infancy and the likelihood of drastic technological innovation is high. As one product comprises nearly all of Splunk's revenues, we believe a slight technological breakthrough by a competitor could greatly reduce Splunk's intrinsic value.At 29x FY2014E revenue, we don't believe Splunk's current valuation accounts for the enormous competitive and technological risks the company faces. In order to grow into its valuation, Splunk will have to dominate its market for many years. We believe competition from larger, better-capitalized players as well as promising start-ups, poses a significant risk to the company that Splunk's investors are not taking as seriously as they should.Likelihood of ProfitabilityEven if the company is able to achieve the impressive revenue growth that the market expects, we believe the prospects of the company becoming profitable enough to justify current valuations are slim to none.Any investor that listens to management discuss the results of Splunk's operations without conducting their own due diligence hears a story about an emerging growth company that is experiencing exploding revenue growth, is improving their operating margins and is on the verge of becoming profitable. Unfortunately, only the first part of that statement may be considered fact, and even a cursory inspection of Splunk's financials reveal a company willing to grow revenue at all costs. By ignoring management's ""supplemental"" disclosure, one notices that the company is actually becoming less profitable (both nominally and as a percent of sales) as the company grows.To start, it's important to point out the distinction between GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics, and why non-GAAP financial metrics may be helpful (or deceitful) for evaluating a company's performance. The value of any financial asset is the present value of the future cash flows. Since many companies (including Splunk) do not pay dividends, investors use certain financial metrics, such as EBITDA or net income, as proxies for the future revenue stream they will receive from a company. Since investors are making a current determination based on future performance, investors want to get a sense of what the ""normal"" earnings of a company are going to be in the future. Management teams often attempt to provide support in this process by disclosing certain non-GAAP financial metrics.However, management sometimes adds back certain expenses that, in our opinion, stretch the bounds of rationality. This is the case with Splunk. They ""supplement"" their financial statements with non-GAAP financial data that excludes stock based compensation and tax expenses related to stock based compensation. They do so because they believe ""that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about Splunk's operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making."" (Emphasis added). Although we generally caution investors when looking at non-GAAP numbers, we believe that there are instances when they can be helpful. However, we vehemently disapprove of stock-based compensation add-backs, and even more so with companies whose main cost is employee related, like Splunk. A company can choose to pay its employees in cash or stock, but either way, the company incurs a real cost. When cash is paid to an employee, the cost is obvious. When stock is paid, the cost is subtler, yet it's still there. In the case of stock-based compensation, shareholders are incurring costs through dilution. The issue we have with SPLK is that through their use of their non-GAAP Earnings figure, the Company is attempting to appear as if they are not incurring the full costs of paying their employees.By excluding stock based compensation, Splunk manages to turn a negative 15% net margin into a less than 2% negative net margin by ignoring these costs.Alarmingly, the percentage of stock based compensation is increasing as a percentage of revenue, and we believe that is a result of the increasing marginal cost of acquiring new customers.The Company's disregard for its growing costs is not surprising in light of Management's incentives. To date, the Board has only incentivized Management to grow revenues, and has not implemented any compensation policies tied to an earnings metric. According to their most recent Proxy Statement, (2013 Proxy Statement - Page 34), ""The target bonus opportunity for our CEO and Messrs. Conte (SVP & CFO), Stein (SVP, General Counsel & Secretary), and Schroeder (SVP, Products) was based 100% on achievement of target revenues"". (Emphasis added) The incentive compensation formula as shown in the table below provides a clear incentive for Management to grow revenue at all costs. With the ability to double their bonuses with only 11% outperformance, and no repercussions for excessive costs, Management incentives are not aligned with those of the Shareholders.Similarly, since the IPO, the market has only reinforced the incentive to grow revenues at all costs. Splunk is up over 300% from their April 2012 IPO price of $17.00 per share. Over this time, their trailing LTM revenue has increased 122%, meaning SPLK's revenue multiple has increased dramatically over this time period. Since management has such a large stake in the company through existing shares and options, this has only reinforced their emphasis on revenue growth at all costs.As shown above, GAAP earnings are only growing more negative as the company grows. The company's expense growth has dramatically outpaced revenue growth primarily from increased hiring. We believe this trend is likely to continue for multiple reasons:In addition to our anticipation of increased costs going forward, Splunk's aggressive use of stock-based compensation masks additional costs that the Company will have to recognize over the coming years.According to ASC 718 (ASC 718), when a company awards a stock option, they can amortize the cost of the option over the life of the vesting period. As a result, the company doesn't have to recognize the full cost of the option when it's first granted. Under a company's stock based compensation note to the financial statement however, the company does have to disclose how much expense they have yet to recognize as a result of their stock based compensation. In Splunk's case, they have over $144.5mm in compensation expenses that they have yet to be recognized on their income statement (PG 9-10 - 3Q14 10-Q). That means that $144.5mm of stock compensation that has already been paid to SPLK's employees will be recognized on the books over the next three years. This $144.5mm isn't reflected anywhere on the balance sheet, and thus should be added as a liability when analyzing this company.To sum up our thoughts, we don't expect Splunk to be profitable anytime soon. Expense growth will continue to outpace revenue growth, because over time, the marginal customer will become more difficult to attain. This, combined with Management's lack of incentive to achieve profitability, will cause Splunk to struggle to produce GAAP earnings, even in the long term.Risks Associated With Shorting SplunkContinued Stellar PerformanceSince we are not arguing that SPLK's products are faulty or that we believe that Splunk is a bad company, there is a risk that the company continues to outperform expectations for a number of years. If the company executes perfectly, can successfully expand their product base and continue to satisfy their customers, the company may, one day, warrant a $9 billion valuation. Although we think that it's unlikely for all of the reasons discussed above, it is not out of the realm of possibilities that Splunk will continue to surpass expectations for years into the future.AcquisitionsAny short thesis, especially when dealing with technology companies, has to consider the likelihood of an acquisition. However, we think that an acquisition is unlikely due to the following reasons:The acquisition would require a large dollar outlay (over $10bn), but the acquirer would inherit miniscule revenue. For an acquirer to do this, they would have to believe in one of two theses:Furthermore, we believe Splunk represents an extremely dangerous acquisition due to its small economic moat, excessive reliance on a single product and enormous technology risk.ConclusionSPLK has had the good fortune to have rapidly grown revenues at a time when the market values this attribute over all others. The performance of the tech sector over the past year reminds us of the catastrophic bubble of the early 2000s, and although we don't believe valuations have reached those levels, it's hard to argue that the market isn't frothy. This leaves current SPLK investors exposed to multiple risks. If growth continues to slow, which we believe it will, multiples will contract, and at Splunk's current valuation of 29x FY 2014E revenues, this drop is likely to be significant. Yet growth doesn't have to slow for SPLK to drop from its sky-high level. Another risk is that investors start to demand more from SPLK than just revenue growth. As SPLK is only moving further away from profitability as it grows, investors may lose faith in the ""grow at all costs"" business model. We subscribe to the Nassim Taleb school of thought when it comes to forecasting…don't do it when there are ""unknown unknowns."" As a result, we see no greater opportunity than shorting a high-flying tech stock with significant business and technology risks like SPLK. We don't know what technology the future will bring, but when a stock is priced for perfection, an asymmetric risk is created.Disclosure: I am short SPLK.

1666732,25120,2013-08-30T12:11:21-04:00,,"Shares of Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) make another move higher, marking the fact that shares have almost doubled in 2013 alone. Investors appreciate the rapid growth, accompanied with continued operating margin improvement.Yet I remain cautious. On the back of the outstanding operational achievements, the current valuation has become way too rich for my taste.Second-Quarter ResultsSplunk generated second-quarter revenues of $66.9 million, up 50% on the year before, thereby comfortably beating consensus estimates of $63 million.The company reported GAAP operating losses of $13.3 million, while non-GAAP losses came in at $0.8 million. Non-GAAP losses came in at $0.01 per share, while GAAP losses came in at $0.13 per share.Analysts were looking for non-GAAP losses of $0.03 per share. CEO and Chairman Godfrey Sullivan commented on the past quarter developments:Looking Into The ResultsThe potential for operating leverage in Splunk's business model remains incredible as gross margins are sky-high, especially on license revenues where they are above 99%.Overall gross margins rose by 35 basis points to 88.9% of total revenues, which are simply unprecedented margins.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose by a full 9 percent points to 108.8% of total revenues. As a result of growing revenues and widening negative operating margins, net losses tripled to $13.7 million.OutlookFor the current third quarter, Splunk anticipates revenues to come in between $69 and $71 million. Non-GAAP operating margins are seen between flat and minus 2%. The guidance implies that revenues are seen up 35% on the year before, and up 5% compared with the second quarter.Full-year revenues are seen between $275 and $281 million, with the guidance being upped from a previously guided $266 to $274 million. Non-GAAP operating margins are seen around flat. As such fourth-quarter revenues could come in around $84 million, up 29% on the year before.Consensus estimates for full-year revenues stood at $275.4 million.ValuationSplunk ended its second quarter with $347.1 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates without the assumption of debt, for a solid net cash position.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $124.1 million, up 52% on the year before. Net losses increased to $29.8 million in the meantime.Factoring in gains of 10% in pre-market trading, the market values Splunk at $5.5 billion, or its operating assets around $5.15 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at 18 times annual revenues.Splunk does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Splunk were eventually sold to the general public in April of 2012. Shares were sold at $17 per share, far above the preliminary $11-$14 price range. Shares immediately moved into their 30s but fell back to their high-20s at the end of 2012.Since the start of the year, shares have seen an impressive run-up. Exchanging hands at $53 per share, they have nearly doubled in just 8 months.Between the calendar year of 2009 and 2012, Splunk has increased its annual revenues from merely $35 million to $199 million last year. At the same time, losses kept increasing to almost $37 million over the past year.Investment ThesisSplunk had a decent quarter in which it added another 400 customers, bringing the total count to 6,000. Despite the slower guided year-on-year revenue guidance, Splunk forecasts more new customers and enterprise deals in the remainder of the year, adding to future revenues.Internal predictions from Splunk reveal that customers will spend 5 times the initial purchase amount in three years following their initial purchase. Therefore news about customer additions and deal wins are even more important compared with your ""average"" cloud or data-analytics company.Back in June of this year, I last took a look at Splunk's prospects. I concluded that investors were comforted by solid revenue growth and margin improvements. The second quarter was excellent with notably revenues coming in ahead of consensus estimates. GAAP losses kept narrowing on a sequential basis.I continue to applaud management with the great results as the company is moving forward to break even. Due to the high valuation, I remain hesitant to go long. The combination of a valuation at 18 times annual revenues and a slowdown in year-on-year revenue growth in the remainder of the year makes me hesitant.Still I won't initiate a short given the limited free float of the company and the rather modest market capitalization, which could always spur merger and acquisition activity. Yet growth might pick up after the major release of Splunk Enterprise in the remainder of the year and the beta program of the much promising Hunk program.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

So while the company continues to add new clients at high growth rate, existing clients are realizing value and increasing their utilization across multiple business and operational lines.Robust Customer AdoptionSPLK's customer base has expanded to over 6,000 clients worldwide. Of these, approximately 200 of the Fortune 500 are engaged with Splunk at some level. SPLK had strong new deal flow and Q2 revenue grew 50% YoY. While average deal size remains consistently around $35k, the company reported that there were 163 deals that were over $100k in size. These larger cases generally represent Enterprise Adoption Agreements (EAAs) which are designed to enable broad adoption of Splunk application software within a given enterprise. These EAAs are perpetual commitments by clients that are usually in the 7-figure range but contain provisions which require them to be deferred and treated ratably in terms of revenue recognition over the course of a set period of time - typically 3 years. In other words, these sales create a stream of revenue off of a single sale that will be recognized by the company over the course of several quarters or years.Commitment to Growing SalesMost growth companies invest heavily in sales infrastructure and SPLK is no different. The company added 15 new account reps to its sales force in Q2, bringing total headcount in sales to 189 and management expects to have 210-220 reps in the field by year-end. Management has indicated a learning curve of 9-12 months for new reps to be fully productive and estimates that due to new additions to staff over the past year or so, only 50% are current at that fully productive level. The trajectory of the sales staff buildup however implies billings per productive rep are down 15% year over year. However, much of this can be attributed to a strategy put in place earlier this year of increasing the number of specialized product sales reps, as well as adding a dedicated renewal team. This strategy, while it does not show up on the ""production per rep"" metric, has increased renewal rates from the mid 80% range 18 months ago, to 94% in Q2.Q2 By The NumbersDriven by strong customer license sales, Splunk, Inc. recently posted a solid Q2 with revenue coming in well above consensus at $66.9 million, a 50% increase from Q2 of last year.SPLK Revenue Quarterly data by YChartsTurning to the balance sheet, SPLK finished Q2 with the $347 million in cash, $40.7 million in accounts receivable and no debt.Going ForwardDuring its earnings call, the company said it expected revenues of between $69 million and $71million for the third quarter and raised full year revenue guidance to $275-$281 million (from $266-$274 million). The company expects Q3 non-GAAP operating margin of between -2% and 0% and still expects full year non-GAAP operating margin to break even, implying Q4 non-GAAP operating margin to be net-positive.Key Value DriversConclusionWhile the stock, at $61.98, is trading at an all-time high, strong sales growth and healthy margins support that price. Since the latest earnings and investors call took place well into Q3, management had plenty of clarity for its current quarter revenue guide. Still, +35% YoY seems light given the ramp in sales capacity and roll-out of a broader product portfolio so I anticipate room for further upside. SPLK isn't a value play, so investors waiting to get in at a lower price may well find themselves empty-handed.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1478671,25120,2013-06-04T04:37:04-04:00,,"Shares of Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) continue to set fresh highs. The software platform which allows users to monitor and analyze their data reported its first quarter results for its fiscal year of 2014 on Thursday the 30th of May after the close.Unlike other cloud-based and technology firms, Splunk was hardly impacted by weak corporate spending in the first quarter. Investors remain confident amidst a solid growth in revenue and prospects for margin expansion.First Quarter ResultsSplunk generated first quarter revenues of $57.2 million, up 54% on the year before. Revenues comfortably beat consensus estimates of $54.1 million.While revenues continued to grow, operating losses were increasing from $6.2 million last year to $15.7 million over the past quarter. Net losses narrowed from $20.5 million to $16.1 million as last year's losses were heavily impacted by a $14.1 million charge due to the valuation of preferred stock warrants.GAAP losses per share came in at $0.16. Splunk reported non-GAAP losses of $0.06 per share which came in line with expectations.Splunk signed some 350 new enterprise customers during the quarter bringing the total worldwide client base to 5,600.A Detailed Look At The ResultsLicense revenues rose by 48.3% to $36.2 million while maintenance and service revenues rose by 64.3%.Gross profits came in at 88.3% of total revenues down 20 basis points on the year. Margin pressure is largely explained by the outperformance of maintenance and service revenues which carry higher cost of sales compared to license revenues which essentially cost nothing to produce.The company stepped up its research & development efforts. Spending on this line item rose by 350 basis points to 25.3% of total revenues. The company increased spending on selling, general and administrative expenses by 720 basis points to 72.2% of total revenues.One bright spot were selling, general and administrative costs as theyfell by 10 basis points to 18.3% of total revenues.Looking Into 2014For the current second quarter, Splunk anticipates to generate revenues of $61-$63 million. Based on the midpoint of the guidance, this implies that revenues are expected to increase by 8.4% on the quarter and 39.3% on the year. On average, analysts were looking for second quarter revenues of $61.7 million.Non-GAAP margins are expected to come in between minus 4 and minus 6%, which compared to non-GAAP operating margins of minus 9.2% over the past quarter.For the full year of 2014, Splunk expects to generate annual revenues of $266-$274 million, up from a previously guided $260 to $270 million. Non-GAAP margins are expected to come in around the break-even level.Analysts expected that Splunk would raise its revenue guidance a bit more. Full year revenue consensus estimates stood at $270.4 million.ValuationSplunk ended its first quarter with $331.3 million in cash and equivalents. As the firm operates without the assumption of debt, Splunk holds a solid net cash position.For its fiscal year of 2013, Splunk generated annual revenues of $199.0 million, up 64.5% on the year. Net losses more than tripled to $36.7 million in the meantime.Following the favorable results, Splunk is exchanging hands at $45 per share, valuing the firm at $4.6 billion. This values operating assets of the firm around $4.3 billion. As such, Splunk's operating assets are valued at 22 times 2012's annual earnings.Given the lack of profitability and the investments still required to grow the business, Splunk does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Splunk made their public debut in April of 2012. Shares were sold to the general public at $17 per share, which was up significantly from a preliminary price range of $11-$13 per share.Since the start of 2013, shares have witnessed a steady but strong rally. Shares have risen more than 60% in 2013 alone, exchanging hands around its all time highs at $47 per share.Between its fiscal 2010 and 2014, Splunk has seen incredible growth. Revenues rose from merely $35 million in 2009 to an expected $270 million this year. The company has reported losses in each of its past years.Investment ThesisSplunk's products remain among the hottest developments in the ""big data"" theme. The range of its applications is diverse as large companies struggle to use data for security prevention, analysis of customers demand,and streamlining of internal processes.Key clients which either subscribed or upgraded their products with Splunk over the past quarter were Bank of New York Mellon, Level 3 Communications and Nordstrom, among others.Market research firm Gartner recently mentioned that Splunk is one of the fastest growing names in the new generation of IT operations management market vendors. Complex log files and data can be readily converted into visualization tools aiding business decisions.Besides gaining new customers and increasing the revenues from current users, overseas expansion represents a massive opportunity. The company generated merely 21% of its first quarter revenues abroad. This was up 200 basis points on the year before as European, Middle East and African revenues were up 74%, while the APAC region nearly doubled its revenues.Strong growth is important for the future backlog as internal investigations of Splunk reveal that customers of Splunk spend 5 times the initial purchase amount in the three years following their initial purchase.Overall investors are relieved with the solid outlook and the strength over the past quarter, when many competitors saw some weakness which was being attributed to general macro weakness and federal budget costs.I can only complement Splunk's management with the great applications and services which really spur revenue growth. The growth outlook is solid as the company expects to report improvements in non-GAAP margins for the remainder of the year. The outlook implies that the company expects to report positive non-GAAP operating margins in the third and fourth quarter of the year.While the valuation seems extremely high, I remain hesitant to short. The limited capitalization of the firm and interesting developments could spur interest of large names. Earlier this year Splunk was already tied to a possible acquisition by IBM (NYSE:IBM).For this reason alone, I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1870871,20521,2013-12-02T08:44:44-05:00,,"According to recent reports, worldwide big data hardware and software revenues grew 59% last year to $11.59 billion. The market is projected to be worth $18.1 billion this year, translating to growth of 61% over the year. The market is estimated to grow 31% annually to $47 billion by the year 2017. IBM is the market leader in big data products and services, with revenues of over $1.3 billion from the segment. Other smaller players are making their mark in the industry as well.Splunk’s FinancialsSplunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), the big data analytics software solutions provider, is one such player that is seeing impressive growth. Revenues for the third quarter grew 51% over the year to $78.6 million, compared with the market’s projections of $71.1 million. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a break-even quarter compared with the Street’s estimated loss of $0.01 per share for the quarter.On a GAAP basis, losses have widened owing to continuing increase in expenses. research & development expenses grew 71.2% year to $53.0 million, and sales & marketing expenses grew 61.5% to $53.0 million. Splunk’s other general & administrative expenses have also seen strong growth at 69.4% to $12.9 million. GAAP losses for the quarter grew from $0.06 per share to $0.16 per share.By segment, revenues from license sales grew 47.2% to $50.9 million and maintenance and services revenues grew 58.7% to $23.7 million.For the current quarter, Splunk projected revenues of $88 million-$90 million, compared with the Street’s projections of $86.1 million. The company expects to end the year with revenues of $291 million-$293 million, compared with Street’s projections of $280.7 million.Splunk’s AcquisitionDuring the recently ended quarter, they announced the acquisition of mobile analytics solution provider, BugSense Inc. Founded in 2011, BugSense offers analytic solutions that help with determination of mobile app performance and collects information to troubleshoot problems. BugSense’s solutions help support Android-, iOS- and Windows Phone-based devices. Splunk plans to leverage the acquisition to improve their customer base as they will get access to BugSense’s customer base which includes names like Box, Trulia, Skype, and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO).Splunk’s Product OfferingsBesides inorganic growth, Splunk is also focused on driving growth through product improvement. In a quarter when big players like Oracle have reported weak results because of weak macroeconomic conditions, Splunk’s increasing product offerings have helped it to deliver strong growth. During the recently ended quarter, it released the upgraded platform for machine data, Splunk Enterprise 6, for general availability and its integrated analytics platform for Hadoop, Hunk. As part of the sharpening focus on the cloud, Splunk also announced the general availability of Splunk Cloud, a new service that takes the Splunk Enterprise to the cloud.Among other new product launches, Splunk released the Splunk App for Unix and Linux. The new app helps developers by providing them insights into large-scale Unix and Linux environments. Finally, the company released the Splunk App for Okta, which enables Okta service users to leverage the capabilities of Splunk Search Processing Language to manage security by visualizing log-ins and app utilization and monitoring suspicious activity.Splunk is doing well on the stock market. The stock is trading at $72.16 with a market capitalization of $7.63 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $74.97 earlier last week, having risen significantly since its list price of $17 last year. But Splunk’s profit-generating capabilities remain a matter of concern. The recent acquisition is also expected to continue to add to costs."
1618442,48501,2013-08-08T11:59:09-04:00,,"Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a growth company that provides a software platform to enterprises seeking solutions to their big data challenges. Splunk went public in 2012. After finding support at roughly the $27 level, the share price formed a double bottom with a minimum implied price objective of $53/share.That is where investors should look for a top, of this overvalued company, to form. The share price is currently trading in that zone; thus, a top could form soon. Year-to-date, Splunk is up 78% while the S&P 500 is up 20% on a total return basis.All of that said, at over 20 times sales and book value, this company is overvalued. Splunk probably won't grow into that multiple anytime soon. I think Splunk is benefiting from investor's optimism about the future of big data.The investing strategy here is to get short, use solid money management skills, and cash in when the valuations decline substantially. As previously stated, Splunk is probably nearing a top. The share price can keep going up; hence, good money management skills (planning) are critical to the success of the mission.RisksBusiness ProfileSplunk provides an innovative software platform that enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their machine data. Its software collects and indexes data at massive scale, regardless of format or source, and enables users to quickly and easily search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data in real time. Splunk believes its software addresses the risks, challenges and opportunities organizations face with increasingly large and diverse data sets, commonly referred to as big data, and is specifically tailored for machine-generated data.The core of Splunk's software is a proprietary machine data engine, comprised of collection, indexing, search and data management capabilities. Its software can collect and index hundreds of terabytes of information daily, irrespective of format or source. Its machine data engine uses its proprietary data architecture that enables dynamic schema creation on the fly, enabling users to run queries on data without having to understand the structure of the data prior to collection and indexing. Its machine data fabric for data collection and indexing delivers speed and scalability when processing massive amounts of machine data. Splunk's software leverages improvements in the cost and performance of commodity computing and can be deployed in a wide variety of computing environments, from a single laptop to large globally distributed data centers.Splunk complements its core product with additional content (""apps"" and ""add-ons"") that can be deployed on top of its core data engine. These apps and add-ons, which are generally available for download via the Splunkbase website, provide incremental functionality in the form of pre-built data inputs, searches, reports, alerts and dashboards. Most of these apps and add-ons have typically been available for free download, but there are also premium apps, developed by Splunk and third party developers in the Splunk community, who charge for content, such as the Splunk App for Enterprise Security and Splunk App for PCI Compliance. Splunk, along with a number of third-party developers and customers, have developed hundreds of apps and add-ons for specific use cases in its core and adjacent markets. Examples of apps and add-ons that it developed and currently offers include Splunk App for Enterprise Security, Splunk App for PCI Compliance, Splunk App for VMware, Splunk App for Microsoft Exchange, Splunk App for Microsoft Active Directory, Splunk DB Connect, Splunk Hadoop Connect and the Splunk App for Hadoop Operations. These apps make it easier and faster for its customers to extend the value of their machine data and the Splunk platform to solve specific use cases. This software content has also enabled Splunk to target new markets and disrupt markets traditionally served by point solutions. Often, as customers use additional apps, this generates expanded usage, licensing and revenues for Splunk's core platform.In fiscal 2013 it released Splunk Storm that provides, on a subscription basis, a subset of its Splunk Enterprise software's capabilities as a cloud-based service and is presently tailored for cloud-based developers and applications running in the cloud.As of January 31, 2013, Splunk had over 5,200 Splunk Enterprise customers, including over 60 of the Fortune 100. Splunk Enterprise customers pay license fees generally based on their estimated peak daily indexing capacity needs. Splunk Storm customers pay a monthly subscription fee based on the amount of data stored.Splunk's goal is to make its software the platform for delivering operational intelligence and real-time business insights from machine data. The key elements of its strategy are to: Extend its technological capabilities; continue to expand its direct and indirect sales organization, including its channel relationships, to acquire new customers; further penetrate its existing customer base; develop additional solutions in adjacent markets as well as products that enable organizations to use its software in different ways; grow its user communities and partner ecosystem to increase awareness of its brand, target new use cases, drive operational leverage and deliver more targeted, higher value solutions and become the developer platform for machine data.The key technologies are: Schema-on-the-fly; machine data fabric and search processing language.The schema-on-the-fly feature collects and indexes data irrespective of source and format. Rather than requiring that data be input into a pre-defined structure, its software's schema-on-the-fly technology creates structure as it searches the data from a single query, allowing users to ask new and different questions at any time without having to re-architect a schema as would be required in a relational database.The machine data fabric feature enables users to process machine data no matter the infrastructure topology, from a single machine to a globally distributed, virtualized IT infrastructure. This machine data fabric allows customers to address the complexities of handling massive amounts of real-time, dynamic, heterogeneous machine data. Its APIs enable users to forward data from Splunk's software to other parts of their IT network, creating a machine data fabric across the organization irrespective of whether the data is used by Splunk's software for analysis and reporting or as a conduit to other systems.The search processing language provides a proprietary search language that is specifically designed for working with machine data. Its search language supports basic arithmetic operations to refine searches and conduct calculations with the results of a query in real time. Statistical and reporting commands native to its search language let users perform more robust calculations and analysis. Splunk's software can also learn about the structure of the machine data through the searches users conduct, allowing users to utilize the machine data structure and knowledge garnered by previous Splunk searches.Splunk Storm is used by organizations developing applications on cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Google App Engine and Rackspace. Splunk Storm enables users to diagnose and troubleshoot application problems, gain rapid visibility and insight into cloud-based applications and monitor critical business metrics for more effective operational intelligence.What Employees and Customers SayAs with most things in life, there is the good and the bad. There are times when the bad outweighs the good; such is the case with the employee reviews. On the customer side, the good outweighs the bad. Combining both sets of reviews, I would probably say that the good outweighs the bad.The employees like the compensation, the food, the games, the product, and the company. Employees don't like their boss's egos. There is a lot of comments about inexperienced managers with ""big egos."" Some people feel like they can't contribute suggestions because of senior management's egos. Also, some of sales people say the open source versions are competitive with Splunk's offerings.To be realistic, I don't think there are going to be many senior managers with an extensive track records of success applying to a young growth company. Consequently, a young inexperienced management group with big egos who will probably grow into their roles over the next 2 years to 5 years is expected and is a yellow flag. It is not a red flag. Further, enterprises with $1+ billion of revenue are less likely to use open source software.So, the customers like the products, and the employees like the products and the company. Thus, I like the products and the company. Also, Splunk was named a leader in the 2013 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Security Information and Event Management, according to the company's website.Financial Performance ForecastI think revenue growth will slow in fiscal 2014 to between 30% and 60% relative to fiscal 2013's revenue growth rate of 64%. That said, the market for Big Data analytic software is growing at a rapid pace, and I'm forecasting Splunk's revenue to grow at an above market rate, which means Splunk would be increasing market share. The financial performance forecast is bullish for the valuations.The increase in fiscal 2013 revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the number of customers. As an investor analyzing a growth company, I prefer the increase in revenues to come from an increase in customers rather than an increase in prices. The increase in revenue is bullish for valuations.A large portion of the increase in historic operating expenses are attributable to personnel increases, which represent variable costs. Consequently, Splunk's operating leverage is lower than it otherwise would be, if the increase in operating expenses were primarily attributable to higher fixed costs.Splunk's sales, general and administrative expenditure is high as a percentage of revenue. Most of the expenditure is attributable to personnel expense. Splunk is strategically investing revenue in marketing to increase brand awareness, revenues and cash flow from operations, which could be bullish for the valuations. On the other hand, it could be a huge waste of capital that could be being put to better use.Splunk has a substantial valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets. Currently, the company isn't expecting to release the valuation allowances. If management decides to reduce marketing expenditure, thus generating operating income, shareholders would benefit from low income tax expenditure related to the net operating loss carry-forwards.In fiscal 2014, I expect revenues to continue to be driven by an increase in customers, operating expenses to remain a relatively high percentage of revenues, and the net loss to be a smaller percentage of revenues.The change in the fair value of preferred stock warrants expense, which was about 40% of the loss before income taxes in fiscal 2013, won't occur in fiscal 2014. The resulting increased net income, all else equal, is bullish for the valuations.So, I am looking for revenues in the $258.7 to $318.4 million range. The operating loss should be about 12% to 16% of revenues, and the net loss should be about 12.4% to 16.4% of revenues. The worst case net loss scenario using this model would be about $42.43 million.At the end of the fiscal 2014 first quarter, Splunk had about $331 million of total cash; the liquidity position and solvency position are rock solid. There was about $46 million of operating lease obligations at the end of fiscal 2013; there isn't a need to adjust the liabilities to include the operating lease obligations given the significant amount of cash the company has on its balance sheet.Also, deferred revenues are growing inline with revenues.ValuationsSplunk is a growth company; thus, a discounted cash flow model wouldn't be appropriate for valuing the common equity shares. Also, given the company's limited trading history, some multiplier model valuation techniques would be inappropriate. So, I am going to use the enterprise value and multiplier models on a time series and absolute basis.Splunk is valued at 23.5 times sales, 22.7 times book value, and 93.5 times cash flows. Also, shares of the company are trading near a peak in valuation. The multiplier models suggest Splunk is overvalued.I estimate the enterprise value of Splunk to be $5.22 billion. That means Splunk is trading at an EV/sales of 23.8. If fiscal 2014 revenue comes in at the high end if my range, Splunk would be trading at an EV/sales of 16.4. Based on these measures, I would say Splunk is overvalued.I wouldn't buy any shares of Splunk until they were trading at roughly half of the current valuation. At these valuations, Splunk isn't a takeover candidate for one of the larger technology enterprises. With a solid money management plan in place, Splunk would be an excellent company to sell short. Sales would have to more than double for this company to be trading at 10 times sales, at the current market capitalization.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1243481,22148,2013-03-04T09:24:12-05:00,,"Last week, both Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) released earnings for the quarter ending January that saw massive revenue growth. While both stocks had hot IPOs in 2012 and trade at what are generally considered expensive multiples, they had different reactions after their respective earnings reports.Palo Alto is a leading network security provider that competes against the likes of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), while Splunk is a provider of real-time data analysis commonly referred to as ""Big Data."" Palo Alto is more focused on taking market share, while Splunk is creating a whole new market.Ironically, the arguably cheaper stock and the one with the fastest reported growth dropped 4%, while the more expensive stock jumped 7%. This further highlights the momentum nature of the market to be analyzed in the sections below.January Quarter Operations HighlightsPalo Alto reported the following highlights for Q2 2013:Though the company had a phenomenal 92% gain in deferred revenues, investors were concerned about guidance that was in line with previous views.Splunk reported the following highlights for Q4 2013:Splunk generally increased guidance, explaining the jump in the stock. The unexplainable part is that Palo Alto expects to be profitable in the April quarter while Splunk expects a considerable loss. The slight uptick in revenue growth shouldn't have made the stock any more attractive.Valuation ComparisonWhile relative valuation doesn't always play so well in the short term, over time it inevitably drives the stock price. Investors should be cautioned that valuations could stay at what are perceived high levels for years. In the case of Palo Alto and Splunk, the market presents two extremely fast growing technology stocks with revenue growth rates in out years expected to exceed 30%. Naturally, investors want access to those stocks and are willing to pay up for them.The table below highlights the forward multiples combined with the expected top-line growth:Click to enlarge images.The very odd part of these results is that Palo Alto has the higher expected growth and higher earnings, yet it has the lower multiples. Investors also need to be careful as both stocks have over 10% additional shares outstanding when using fully diluted shares that are only counted when GAAP income is positive. Note the companies utilized these share amounts for the non-GAAP income calculations, but data service providers don't pick up the numbers when providing market caps.Stock ChartAs highlighted in previous articles (see the one on Palo Alto here and the one on Splunk here) regarding the expensive IPO valuations of both stocks, it was going to be a struggle to see after-market gains. However, Splunk is on the verge of a breakout to new highs after the latest report. Since Palo Alto went public back in July, both stocks have managed to outperform the Nasdaq Composite. At the time, Splunk was trading around its lows, so the big gain is a little misleading and only gets investors back to the initial trading levels.ConclusionAnyone interested in these stocks needs to tread lightly. Both have extremely high valuations, but appear set for positive gains after a tepid period following strong IPOs. As noted from this research, Palo Alto Networks provides the better valuation, yet investors taking the opposite approach have 12% larger accounts after trading on Friday following the earnings reports. Based on the results and even guidance, the trading action wasn't logical -- but that's how the market works.The one stock perceived to have provided weak guidance didn't fare as well no matter the valuation discrepancy. In the end, the value issues will be resolved toward a mean -- though possibly not anytime soon. If investors must own one, Palo Alto provides the better value now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Shares quickly doubled to levels around $36 in the days after the offering. Shares fell back to $27 after the company reported its first quarterly results as a public company, but recovered to highs of $39 in September. Splunk's shares are currently exchanging hands around $31 per share.Between its fiscal 2009 and its current 2013, revenues grew from $18.2 million to an estimated $193 million this year. Splunk has been reporting annual losses in each year since its existence.Investment ThesisSplunk had a decent third quarter, beating consensus estimates on both revenue and earnings expectations. Despite the beat, revenue growth is slowing down. Revenues grew 19.6% on a quarterly basis in the second quarter. Quarterly revenue growth came in at 16.9% in the third quarter, and is expected to slow down to 13.5% on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter.Growth was partially driven by the addition of new customers including Daimler AG, Kohl's, Newell Rubbermaid and Vodafone Australia, among others. Splunk released the latest version of its Splunk Enterprise flagship product. The GA version of Splunk Storm, the company's cloud service, was also released during the quarter.I reiterate my investment stance for Splunk. At the presentation of the second quarter earnings, I argued that an investment can not be justified from a traditional valuation standpoint. Despite the insane valuation, at 14 times this year's annual revenues, the company is not an obvious short candidate. Given the rather limited valuation of $2.7 billion for its operating assets, an acquisition by a cash-rich technology company with cloud ambitions, remains a very real possibility.For those investors being bearish about valuations in the cloud industry, I would urge investors to evaluate the prospects of Workday (WDAY). Shares of the company trade at even higher revenue multiples compared to Splunk, and the greater market capitalization makes a possible acquisition of the company less likely.Disclosure: I am short WDAY.

1868301,48501,2013-11-29T04:16:50-05:00,,"Since the last time that I wrote about Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), the share price has increased substantially; I was looking at Splunk as a short candidate, back in August. I think my biggest mistake was viewing Splunk as a value play rather than as a momentum play. From a value perspective the company is overvalued, but from a momentum perspective Splunk can continue to meet and beat growth expectations. I was wrong, and I'm going to have to eat a slice of ""humble pie.""But that is a mistake that I am able to put into an analytic context and I won't make that mistake again. Now moving on to what has happened with Splunk since the last time I wrote about the company.The fundamentals of this company are bullish; according to management, Splunk is on pace to take the largest share of IT wallet. Also, the company remains undervalued. As a consequence of the aforementioned, and because I'm not a nimble trader, I'm going to have to wait for a bearish catalyst to sell short shares of Splunk.Fundamental AnalysisSplunk reported revenue that was up 51 percent compared to last year in the third quarter. Management is looking for Q4 revenues between $88 million and $90 million and full-year revenues in the range of $291 million to $293 million.The company recently released new products including Splunk Enterprise 6, a new app for VMware (NYSE:VMW), and a partnership with Amazon Web Services; these products should be able to help Splunk maintain the pace of revenue growth in 2014.The enterprise's customer base has increased to over 6,000 users. This leads me to think future revenue growth has to come from selling more products to existing customers rather than coming from increased customer count. In other words, I am looking at revenue per customer as a key indicator. But with slightly less than half of the Fortune 500 using Splunk, there is room for customer count growth. Additionally, I will be looking for the international expansion to drive revenue growth.A couple of key points. Splunk is on pace to take one of the largest shares of IT expenditure. Next, customers are using Splunk more than originally estimated; people are buying a fixed amount of data for say 18 months and they are coming back in 7 months and saying that they need more space.In summary, Splunk is driving revenue growth through cross-selling to existing customers, international expansion, and the increased use of the traditional package by existing customers. This seems to be a solid multi-pronged approach to continuing to drive revenue growth.There are a few threats to revenue growth. Splunk faces the threat of having its customers develop their own solutions. Also, traditional enterprise applications vendors have relationships with Splunk's customer base and may be able to offer a better solution than Splunk is able to offer. Simply said, there are competitive forces that should limit Splunk's profitability.One of the tools that I will use to analyze Splunk is the momentum indicator, the rate of change. I will apply it to the revenue growth rate to get a better indication of how the growth rate is changing over time. In this way, I may be able to more accurately forecast when Splunk will report revenue growth that comes in lower than expected.We are seeing a decline in the pace of revenue growth, but I need more data points to increase the accuracy of the forecast.The fundamentals of Splunk are bullish. As much as I would like them to be bearish, that is not the case; Splunk seems to be able to generate mid-double digits revenue growth for at least the next fiscal year. Part of the revenue growth will be driven by the increased indexing of data. Even though Splunk is overvalued, the fundamentals suggest that the market for shares will continue to be bullish.ValuationsAt a price to book of 30, I believe that the market has priced in a significant amount of growth. Using the classical models, the growth rate would be above the required rate of return, which would mean that Splunk has an infinitely high valuation. Clearly, that is not economic reality. Further, book value would have to increase significantly to justify paying the current price.Lastly, relative to the industry, and the S&P 500, Splunk is overvalued.I cannot justify an investment in Splunk at these valuations. I think the best play here is to wait for an economic reason, a catalyst, to get short shares of the overvalued enterprise applications vender.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

855211,29461,2012-09-09T04:55:10-04:00,,"We are bullish on Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), as the company has shown impressive continuous double digit revenue growth in the last 19 quarters. In the latest quarter, the company was able to beat analyst estimates. The 71% rise in revenues came primarily because of the increase in number of customers. The company brought 400 more customers into its fold in the last quarter, causing its license revenue to considerably increase by 61%.Despite the fact that the stock is trading at P/S of 21x, as compared to the industry average of 3.21x, the company's management is expecting positive operating income in the fourth quarter through high revenue growth. We can assume that this inorganic growth will be sustainable, as the recent development of Splunk Storm will further improve the company's profitability.Splunk's core business is to establish software that help businesses collect, analyze, search and index data to bring operational and management efficiency. Its high capability software is designed with a data management facility and machine data engine to facilitate business intelligence and timely insights. The company has more than 4,400 customers in more than 80 countries. The businesses use Splunk's software to mitigate the security risk, enhance its service levels, improve operational efficiencies, create synergies and develop new products and services.The recent development of the company's cloud service, called Splunk Storm, will further enrich its presence among corporate customers. The software is built for enterprises that run and establish applications in the public cloud, just like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s application engine. Splunk Storm will be beneficial for organizations in immediately identifying application problems, observing important business metrics, and getting insides from cloud computing to bring efficiency in its operations.The company had a very successful IPO in April. It is still undergoing a lock up period, and we don't believe that prices are going to fall after this period, primarily because of the company's high growth prospects. The stock is currently trading at $38.3, which is 115% above its IPO issue price of $17. The company has raised $229.5 million in its IPO by issuing 13.6 million shares at $17 per share. It has generated more than its expectations.The company is operating in a highly competitive software industry. Splunk is facing competition from BMC Software (NASDAQ:BMC), International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), EMC Corporation (EMC), Google Inc. , SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Webtrends, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). One of its main competitors, EMC, is diversifying its business into a security software business because of slow growth of the data storage business, in order to retain its high market value. In our view, we foresee that Splunk will be able to maintain the bond with customers, and its data management application software will ensure that the company will maintain its unique advantage. Financial AnalysisThe company's revenue has significantly increased by 71% to $44.5million over the last one year. It brought big names like Allianz Insurance, Orange France, Hughes Network Systems, Monster Worldwide (NYSE:MWW), and many others, into its customer net. The license revenue of $30.2 million was raised by 61% YoY. Splunk's gross margin of 90% is far more than its peers in the industry, as depicted in the table given above. The company registered a net loss of $4.6 million, and out of this, $3.9 million was spent on stock-based compensation. The reason behind this non-cash expense was to increase employees' stake in the company in a bid to motivate them towards organizational priorities. The company's operating cash flows are $3.8 million, while its free cash flows are $2.2 million. By excluding onetime line item expenses, the loss is only of one cent per share. Due to the company's conspicuous research and development spending, and sales strategy, its maintenance revenue increased by 99% in the second quarter.The stock showed an upward spiral of 30% in the last three months. In comparison, its peers have followed the same trend, as is reflected in the above graph. Brocade Communications Systems (NASDAQ:BRCD) posted the same upside of 30% as SPLK, whereas NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), Oracle Corporation and SAP AG registered upsides between 15% and 20%. The stock's 50-day and 200-day moving averages are $29.7 and $30.7, respectively. The stock is currently trading near its 52-week highs, and has substantial potential to show an upward trend.ValuationThe stock is currently trading at P/S of 21.06x, at a significant premium when compared to EMC's 2.63x, NTAP's 2.01x, BRCD's 1.2x, ORCL's 4.1x, and SAP's 4x. According to the estimates of 12 analysts, its earnings will increase by 200% by the end of next quarter.We can forecast that the company can sustain its advantage of growing customer needs of business intelligence and cloud computing. We believe that customer growth will continue, with the rising businesses demand for securitized data management. Existing customers can expand the usage of the company's products to other departments as well. In the long run, we believe that growth will come from new product development, and the company's first mover advantage in data management, which will be sustained. The company has the potential to maintain its strong position through its aggressive product and application development in this space, which is why we are bullish on the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Technology Analyst.

1039171,22148,2012-11-30T20:11:22-05:00,,"With the market typically favoring dividend stocks over growth stocks, Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) remains a conundrum trading at roughly 12x forward revenue estimates. While the company has huge growth potential, analysts only expect 35% growth next year that wouldn't normally warrant such a high valuation.The company provides a leading software platform for real-time operational intelligence. In essence, the company is leading the ""Big Data"" revolution by offering software tools for analyzing the incredible amount of data created on a daily basis.Back in the summer, the valuation didn't support the growth rate. After a sell-off in October, does the stock finally offer a good value?Q3 2013 HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q3 2013:The Q3 numbers beat estimates with revenue of $52M, exceeding estimates by $5M. Unfortunately, the company only slightly beat earnings estimates, even with the huge revenue beat. On top of that, Splunk still had a small loss.GuidanceThe company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2013 fourth quarter (ending January 31, 2013):The company is updating its previous guidance for its 2013 full fiscal year (ending January 31, 2013):A positive operating margin in Q4 is a good start, though the company has a long way to go for huge yearly profits. Expenses are still growing as fast as revenues. The company forecast that quota sales reps would hit 160 at year-end versus the estimate of 140 to 150 -- a huge sign that Splunk will continue growing the Sales & Marketing expense line as fast as revenue.Deferred RevenueAn important way to value this company is based on deferred revenue as Splunk signs up customers for licenses that hit the top line over multiple years, yet it collects the cash up front. Unfortunately though, a lot of companies in this software license model incur a lot of the sales and marketing costs up front to generate these revenues.The deferred revenue jumped to nearly $74M from $52.6M in Q4 last year. The amount has nearly doubled year-over-year, providing for solid revenue growth over the next year.This growth in deferred revenue drives operating cash flow, which was $6.5M in Q3 and $21.9M for the last nine months. Free cash flow hit $4.2M in Q3. Substantially all of the cash flow growth came from the increase in deferred revenue of $6.3M and $21.3M for those periods, respectively.Valuation ComparisonsBack in June, the article, Splunk Gets Splattered On Earnings, focused on the comparative valuations of Splunk to other recent hot tech IPO stocks. While Splunk is leading the ""Big Data"" trend, the other stocks lead exciting growth sectors as well. Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) leads in social media business software, Millennial Media (NYSE:MM) in mobile advertising, and InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) in motion sensing chips.All of these companies still provide great growth opportunities, making it worth reviewing the results nearly six months later. The below table highlights the comparative growth and valuation metrics based on revenues since most of these companies aren't profitable yet:* Data obtained from Yahoo FinanceThe valuation metrics still remain more favorable for the other stocks. Interestingly, Splunk has been the only stock to not encounter a greater than 50% sell-off since the IPO. All of the stocks have been relatively flat over the last six months. In fact, the 12.5% gain by Millennial Media hardly beats the nearly 12% gain by the S&P 500 index.SPLK data by YChartsStock PriceThe stock has spent the last six months with $26 as major support. While that level still sports very high valuations, the market appears content that it provides significant value. Any break of that level would signal potential huge downside. The recent price action suggests the upward guidance will push the stock higher, possibly to retest the highs above $38.8-Month Chart - SplunkConclusionThe other tech stocks listed provide more relative value. Millennial Media has a much stronger forecast growth rate. InvenSense already has strong earnings. Jive Software has similar growth potential with a lower valuation. The market, though, appears fascinated with the ""Big Data"" potential of Splunk.While Splunk provides a slightly better valuation than in the past, the stock still isn't the better option. In fact, the listed valuations exclude nearly 20M shares. The company will officially report 116M shares if it reports a profitable Q4. The 20% higher share total leads to a $3.5B valuation, or 14x forecast revenues. Considering this information, Splunk isn't much of a value, suggesting that the other three tech stocks should be bought instead.Disclosure: I am long INVN.

1263251,24361,2013-03-12T12:28:23-04:00,,"Whenever a new company emerges with a target market that is ill-defined, both the bulls and bears dig in and get to work with their respective promotion machines. That brings us to Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK). Can the company's technology and platform for collecting, processing, and analyzing machine data make it a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of log and config files, or will it just prove to be another not-so-spectacular systems management tool, and one unworthy of a high teens multiple on sales?Surfing A Tsunami Of DataEnterprise IT systems generate an enormous amount of machine data on a day to day basis, largely in the form of log and configuration files. Most enterprises have homemade IT solutions for managing this data, but it is seldom used for much more than diagnostics, app management, and security.The question is whether that can change. At least in theory, this data can contain a great deal of information that would be relevant to companies - including customer behavior, fraud detection, product/inventory tracking, and troubleshooting. The key is in figuring out how to extract the useful information.This is where Splunk comes into the picture. Splunk collects, indexes, stores, and analyzes this unstructured data - not altogether unlike what Google did for the Internet way back in the day. That, in turn, lets the customer actually know what's going on and respond more quickly. Splunk is also looking to take these capabilities in unstructured data in other directions, including stock quotes, Twitter/social media comments, GPS data, RFID scan data and so on.Splunk offers a scalable product, and its Splunkbase currently includes more than 320 apps. Splunk Storm, the company's SaaS offering, is relatively new but seems to be catching on, with more than 150 customers (out of nearly 5,000 total customers).A Market Koan - If You Haven't Analyzed It, How Do You Know It's Valuable?Sell-side analysts are generally highly bullish on Splunk, but that's nothing new. In cases like these, then, I try to be a little more skeptical and think about what could go wrong with the company's model or addressable market. The first question I have is how much anybody can know about the addressable market at this point.It sounds a bit like a koan, but if you have never been able to collect and analyze a certain type of data, how do you know that it contains much useful information? If drawing useful enterprise intelligence from syslogs and applogs were possible, why hasn't a business intelligence/analytics giant like IBM (NYSE:IBM) already been all over this opportunity? I don't question that Splunk's offerings are invaluable for IT management, but will they be useful for enterprise-wide strategic or tactical decision-making?That somewhat rhetorical question aside, I do believe that there could be significant market opportunities here for Splunk. IBM has built a multi-billion dollar business in sifting enterprise data for business intelligence. Perhaps a closer analogy can be drawn to NICE Systems (NASDAQ:NICE). NICE has used its technology in voice and video to extract business intelligence out of phone, video, and email data - allowing clients to better understand customer behavior, prevent fraud, and otherwise fine tune operations to maximize sales and customer service.If Splunk's machine data analysis technology helps companies improve their websites, customer service, product positioning or what have you, the value to the client could be considerable. It's also worth mentioning that that's only part of the potential value that Splunk provides. Much of Splunk's opportunity lies in IT infrastructure management, security, and app management - basically assisting in troubleshooting and making sure that IT networks are operating efficiently, securely, and as intended. That alone is a multibillion dollar annual opportunity for companies like IBM, CA (NASDAQ:CA), and BMC (NASDAQ:BMC).Expensive, But Customers Don't Seem To Mind YetSplunk has logged several quarters of strong revenue growth and customer additions, even though the product is not particularly cheap. While 1GB per day of storage and analysis comes free on Splunk Storm (the cloud-based offering), more than 90% of Splunk's users need more than that. For more than 500GB of capacity (which over 20% of Splunk's customers use) the price starts at around $1,600 per month. In fact, the average annual revenue per customer is north of $35,000.As Splunk has successfully started courting larger and larger customers (like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), VMware (NYSE:VMW), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)), the company has started using enterprise license agreements (ELAs) to better manage the cost of the service. Price competition hasn't yet emerged as a major issue with the likes of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Tibco (NASDAQ:TIBX), even though Sumo Logic prices its cloud-based offerings at about half or less of Splunk's price. Even so, this is worth watching in the future - will customers see enough value in Splunk's services to pay up for them, and will they continue to do so during the inevitable downturns in future IT spending?The Market Seems Large, But Foggy, At This PointGetting precise details on the market opportunities for Splunk's machine data analysis capabilities is more than little like nailing Jello to a tree. Nevertheless, I think there's enough incremental data to suggest real opportunities for the company.About two-thirds of product/technology usage today is for diagnostics, app/IT management, troubleshooting and the like - Salesforce.com, for instance, apparently used it to help troubleshoot its core SFA module before full implementation. Another significant use for the technology today (most of the remainder) is in security and compliance - threat detection, fraudulent activity detection, anomaly detection, and employee behavior monitoring. For example, companies have used this technology to monitor login attempts and restrict employees from particular websites.That market is likely worth about $9 billion to $10 billion today, though I've seen estimates ranging as low as $5 billion and as high as $15 billion. If that's all that Splunk becomes, that's still not a bad market - I suspect that many readers would be surprised to know how many billions of dollars of software revenue are generated each year from products designed solely to monitor networks and IT systems and make sure various other software are behaving correctly. What's more, that market has been growing pretty well given the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of enterprise IT systems.The big question with Splunk is whether its machine data analysis will generate substantial and useful business intelligence that holds value outside of the IT management functions. The stakes would be substantial - an incremental $10 billion to $25 billion in addressable market would come into play if there's real operational intelligence to be garnered from this machine data.At present, Splunk hasn't really run into much substantial competition. While HP, Tibco, SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI), and IBM (to a lesser extent) are direct competitors, it seems like the biggest ""competition"" is simply convincing clients to broaden their usage of Splunk's technology and analyze substantially more of their machine data - commentary from market participants suggests that many enterprises subject less than 10% of their machine data to full analysis.If this market proves real, particularly on the business/operational intelligence side, I would think that competition will ratchet up. Companies like BMC and CA may need to step up their efforts simply to maintain their businesses, and companies like SAS could see it as a logical extension of their capabilities. While price will almost certainly matter at some point, I would expect ease of use and the quality of the analyses to be prime differentiating features - Splunk hasn't always scored so well on the former, but does much better on the latter. Here too, though, I'll be curious to see how clients assess and compare the various rival offerings - most enterprises have only been looking at machine data in quite narrow ways, so how do they compare the performance of rivals when the ultimate outcomes may be unknown?The trouble in modeling the financials for a company like Splunk is that there's so much guesswork involved. I do believe that companies like NICE, VMware, and Tibco do provide some worthwhile context, though, and I believe that Splunk could generate long-term revenue growth in excess of 30% from today's small base. In 10 years' time that would still represent only a small share of the total addressable market (including business/operational intelligence), and clearly there is downside risk that machine data processing doesn't grow beyond an IT analysis tool.Likewise, the company's eventual margin and cash flow structure are pretty speculative at this point, though I believe comparables like Tibco offer some worthwhile parameters. In particular, unless Splunk encounters significant margin leverage issues, I believe the company should ultimately generate free cash flow margins in the 20%'s, and an eye-popping free cash flow growth rate in excess of 50%.That said, at least one note of caution on margins is important - Splunk incentivizes its sales reps to collect maintenance renewals (and renewal rates are north of 90%), but that might become something of a burden in the future. Most companies find that this isn't a good use of its sales force, and should it start to weigh on margins, the company may need to consider hiring a company like ServiceSource (NASDAQ:SREV) to take care of it for them.The Bottom LineIt seems to me that the primary question about Splunk is just how much utility there is in collecting and analyzing machine data. The use in IT management (app performance management, security/compliance, troubleshooting, etc.) seems solid and legitimate, but the real opportunity is in whether it adds value to overall enterprise planning. If so, the long-term value of the company may be moot, as I'd expect a company like IBM or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to scoop it up.Unfortunately, while bulls may think my projections of 30%-plus revenue growth and 50%-plus cash flow growth are absurd, even that level of growth isn't enough today. That sort of growth only leads to a fair value in the mid-$20s, and it requires an assumption of close to 40% compound annual growth and very strong free cash flow conversion just to validate today's price - though keep in mind that there is still a very strong underlying growth rate that will power year-to-year performance in the stock.I can't say that Splunk makes much sense on a value basis, but I'll be the first to acknowledge that value is no particular impediment to outperformance in tech - stocks like Salesforce.com have aggravated the bears for quite a long time on the combination of high valuations and ever-higher stock prices. Splunk could fill a ""roll of the dice"" slot I sometimes keep in my portfolio for risky growth names, but investors should appreciate the above-average risks that go with this valuation and the uncertain real addressable markets. If everything breaks right, this could be a great stock, but there are plenty of pitfalls along the way that could swallow the company and shareholders' money.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

900021,24317,2012-10-02T12:28:58-04:00,,"On Monday, hedge fund manager Zach Buckley of Buckley Capital presented a very bearish report  on Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) at the Value Investors Congress. He said SPLK is a  one-product company and only worth $6-$12 per share based on its free  cash flow valuation. While the stock currently trades at around $35 and  the company is still growing, I believe Buckley's valuation is  especially pessimistic, but possible.What Splunk's sole product  does is accumulate a company's data on the cloud and analyze it for  customers. Unfortunately for Splunk, there are other bigger companies  that are moving into the space. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is one of those companies  that will heavily challenge Splunk. Oracle recently announced that it will jump full force into the cloud space. Its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, and data mining application directly challenges Splunk's service. Just today, Lending Club hired Oracle for its ERP software when it could've hired Splunk.Evidence  suggests the data analytics industry is having slowed growth. One of  Splunk's biggest competitors, Tibco (NASDAQ:TIBX), recently reported 4th quarter guidance as below expectations.""Market  and macroeconomic factors could interfere with this price target, as  could a slowdown in technology spending, increased competition from IBM,  Oracle, SAP (NYSE:SAP) and others, or a reversal in recent focus on  bottom-line results by management,"" Pacific Crest Analyst Jesse Hulsing wrote.If  Splunk reports guidance below expectations on its next earnings report,  it could cause a huge fall of 10-30%. That's after the stock could  experience a pullback leading up to and after its upcoming stock lockup  expiration.On October 15th, 31 million new shares of SPLK will be available for sale by insiders. In my opinion, investors can expect the majority of those shares to be sold. On July 24th,  executives sold approximately 17 million shares of SPLK at $28.26 per  share to investors. That was a planned sale and is evidence that  insiders are looking forward to cashing in their chips. On October 15th,  employees will sell their shares on the open market, which will have a  more detrimental effect on the share price.Reading Splunk reviews  on glassdoor.com, gives some clues about the mentality of Splunk  employees. Although there are only ten reviews, (Splunk has about 460  employees) I believe they are genuine and likely reflect the views of at  least a portion of Splunk's workforce. It might even represent the  views of Splunk's executives. One current employee said on June 25th:When looking at Splunk's  reviews on glassdoor.com as a whole, it seems to be consistent with the  above quote. The oldest few quotes that were pre-IPO describe the  company as ""innovative"", ""a blast"", and ""a great place to work"". The  latest few quotes are more about executives looking to cash out and the  company having low morale.Like I said, this small sample size of  employee reviews could be much different than the company as a whole.  But if it's the true mentality of the employees, then the stock is in  trouble. If the company's executives are just looking to cash out and  move on, then Splunk could go the same route as Zynga. Soon after ZNGA  crashed last quarter with disappointing revenues and profits, many  executives left. Did Zynga's bad performance cause the executives to lose their enthusiasm in the company, or was it the other way around?One Product Companies Are Very RiskyGreen  Mountain (NASDAQ:GMCR), Questcor (QCOR), Research In Motion (RIMM), Pandora  (NYSE:P), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are all examples of companies with  one product that at one point had parabolic valuations as a result of  their amazing revenue growth. However, they all ended up falling 60% or  more once their one product got challenged.The problem with  companies that are very successful off of just one product is the more  profitable the product, the more imitators will enter the field and the  companies' partners want a bigger cut. This decreases margins. Without  constant innovation, the original company can find profits elusive, and  growth strained. Furthermore, if Splunk employees are losing their  enthusiasm and are just looking to cash out, the company's performance  is bound to get worse and investors will become disappointed.Disclosure: I am short SPLK.

845101,24888,2012-09-04T12:56:51-04:00,,"Last Thursday Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported second quarter results, which were met with enthusiasm by analysts and investors, resulting in a 12.79% rise in share price of $34.40 on Friday, after having posted a top of $36.12 earlier on the day.While the results were better than generally expected by the analysts, I would like to throw in a few notes of caution amidst the party.Basically I adhere to this earlier Seeking Alpha article by Stone Fox Capital: Splunk: Huge Growth, But Ultimately Price Matters More. My first note is that Stone Fox Capital picked up a piece of information from the conference call that in my belief was overlooked:These extra 20.5 million shares are reserved for stock based compensations to Splunk employees. So they are not to be counted yet. But with the current valuation, in fact with any valuation above the IPO price of $19, you may take it to the bank that these options are going to be exercised eagerly by the executives that have them. Which means we must take into account a dilution of 20% as soon as quarter 4, which is only 6 months away.I would argue that this more than wipes out all the good news of the earnings report.Let me emphasize that I am not saying that Splunk is not a good company, I am merely saying that Splunk's current valuation has yet to be earned, that it is way ahead of itself and that investors are carried away. I am only pointing out the massive valuation and the risk of entering here.I would even argue that the ""Huge Growth"" as mentioned in Stone Fox's title is a bit over the top. Compared with the year ago quarter (which was very low at 26 M) the revenue growth was 70% indeed. But compared to last quarter (37M) the growth was 20%, and compared to 2 quarters ago (43M), the growth was near zero. Anyone can check these figures here.Let's face it, the company has never turned a profit and is forecasting another loss for this year. Yet it is valued at almost 20 times forward revenues. Even more with the future share count of 116 million shares, which basically dilutes everything by 20%. Mind you, if that share count were applied today, it would raise the market cap with a massive $700 million (4 times annual revenues).The simple version of Splunk's message is this:""We made 4 million more revenue than expected but we will keep losing money over the next 12 months. And by the way, we are going to dilute our share count by 20%, so you will have to share our results with 20% more shareholders, being our Splunk executives. Basically our executives employees are the main competitors for our shareholders.""Overvalued stocks like these fall harder in a market correction. If the market falls 10-20%, this is likely to drop 20-40%.The markets are high from a historic point of view, defying the economic reality. Potential triggers for a sell-off are not hard to find these days. I would say the odds for a severe market correction or even a crash, over the next 12 months are at least 50%.Take also into account that the lockup ends in October, while insiders have already shown their eagerness to sell in a follow-up offering with no proceeds to the company. I don't blame them for selling at these prices (by the way, 20% below the current price), as they are cashing whopping profits.Another red flag is that the company focuses on non-GAAP results, excluding stock based compensations that keep diluting the shareholder. This is the same politics that many Seeking Alpha authors question on Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Some people, including me, say that reporting non-GAAP results in conference calls should be outlawed, as they are by the SEC (for good reasons). Moreover, the company is not specific about its future profitability, they did not even give an estimate on the EPS for this year, only that it will stay negative. I find it remarkable that no analyst asked a question on that. As if profits don't matter anymore for investors.Of course the stock rose on earnings cheered by the analysts, some of whom have a vested direct or indirect interest in the company. But if you put that into perspective, the revenue beat was only 4 million with a promise to remain unprofitable for the year. Yet this added a whopping 400 million to the already lofty market cap! That is more than 2 times annual revenues. Revenues that won't be profitable this year. So a 4 million beat was rewarded with a 400 million valuation rise, a factor of 100. That is simply irrational exuberance, of which you could (and should) question its sustainability.I have not even mentioned the risk of upcoming competitors from big established firms like or IBM and EMC. Or smaller upcoming firms. Three more of the latter category are filing for an IPO, Cloudera, Tableau and Sumo Logic: see Three More Big Data IPO's Following Splunk.It may be prudent for overenthusiastic investors to consider the downward risks.Disclosure: I am short SPLK, CRM.

839401,22148,2012-08-30T18:45:52-04:00,,"After the close, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported earnings that beat estimates, sending the stock soaring more than 12%. The stock results were significantly different than the results following Splunk's first public company report back in June (see Splunk Gets Splattered on Earnings).The company provides the engine for big data. The software collects, indexes and harnesses the machine-generated big data coming from the websites, applications, servers, networks and mobile devices that power business. Splunk software enables organizations to monitor, search, analyze, visualize and act on massive streams of real-time and historical machine data.The big data theme continues to surge, as revenue grew 71%. Splunk is leading the development of software to help enterprises analyze all the data created in the connected world. The key, though, is whether a company forecasting $185M in revenue and no profits for fiscal year 2013 is worth nearly $4B.Q2 2012 HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q2 2012:Deferred revenue hit $54M, and contributed to the company being free cash flow positive. Along with the IPO proceeds, Splunk now has nearly $270M of cash on the balance sheet.Financial OutlookThe company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal third quarter 2013 (ending October 31, 2012):The company is updating its previous guidance for its fiscal year 2013 (ending January 31, 2013):While good to see the company guide revenue and operating margin upwards, it is still disconcerting to see a negative operating margin.Follow On OfferingThe company had a follow-on offering back on July 19, when existing shareholders exited the stock at $28.85. While not surprising that early investors wanted to exit the stock at these valuations, it has to be concerning to existing investors that those investors sold 11,744,064 shares, plus an option to sell another 1,761,609 shares.The total value equals $380M, so the investors weren't just raising a few dollars. Even more interesting was the desire to exit the stock near the lows.After hours, the stock is already trading over $34, suggesting new investors are getting in long after the big guys were willing to dump a significant amount of shares.ValuationThe company mentioned a very interesting fact on the earnings conference call. The fully diluted shares exceed 115M. This amount is considerably above the 95M used for the earnings report, with the company having negative earnings. That last number is also used for calculating the market cap, providing a very different view of reality.The updated share count would value the company at over $3.9B, based on the after hours quotes. Naturally, the share count depends on whether the stock options eventually get executed, but with the stock surging to $34, that seems very likely.As a comparative valuation example, Pandora Media (NYSE:P) has a similar growth path over the next five years, yet the stock trades at half of Splunk's valuation. Yet that company has more than double the revenue, and a clearer path to earnings next year.The major take away is that Splunk could grow revenue at 50% over the next three years, but revenue would still only reach around $400M. The stock could remain virtually flat and still trade at 10x revenue.ConclusionThe company has huge potential that's hardly been tapped yet, but ultimately, the stock price has to matter. Big data is a hot sector, and Splunk is leading the revolution. The market currently values the stock based on fully diluted shares at 16x revenue expectations for next year.With expectations for breakeven earnings in fiscal year 2014 (ends April 2014), it will be virtually impossible to derive a calculation that suggests this stock could surge to a $5-6B valuation. Absent any expectation for the valuation moving to those levels, Splunk doesn't provide a lot of return for taking on the huge risk that any negative report crushes the stock.Disclaimer: Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decision.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Shares fell more than 16% to $27.24First Quarter ResultsOn Thursday the company announced its first quarter results for the period ending on April 30th. First quarter revenue rose 80% to $37.2 million, ahead of analysts consensus of $34 million. License revenues rose 68% to $24.4 million while maintenance and service revenues increased by 110% to $12.8 million. Splunk reported an operating loss of $6.2 million vs. a loss of $1.7 million last year as costs rose across the board.The company reported a GAAP net loss of $20.5 million mostly due to a $14.1 million charge related to preferred stock warrants and $2.7 million in stock-based compensation expenses. The diluted loss per share came in at $0.71""Our first quarter was a strong start to fiscal 2013 and continues the momentum we experienced last year,"" according to CEO Sullivan. ""We added more than 350 new customers and now have over 4,000 customers using Splunk software to achieve operational intelligence from their machine-generated data.""OutlookFor the second quarter of 2012 the company expects to reported total revenues of $38-$40 million vs. analysts expectations of $38 million. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to come in between minus 8 and minus 9% which compares to minus 9.5% in the first quarter.For the full year of 2012 total revenue is expected to come in between $174 and $177 million vs. analysts expectations of $172 million. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to come in between minus 4 and minus 5%.ValuationSplunk ended its first quarter with $266.1 million in cash and equivalents, as it reported $226.5 million in net proceeds from the public offering. The company did not have any meaningful debt outstanding. After Friday's plunge, the market values the firm at $2.52 billion, or $2.25 billion for the operating assets of the firm. This values Splunk at 13 times annual revenues. Currently Splunk does not pay a dividend.Investment ThesisWhile Splunk's shares saw a serious correction on Friday it remains one of the best performing public offerings so far this year. The firm went public on the 20th of April for $17 per share, up from its initial price range of $11-$13. Shares more than doubled on their opening day to $36.20 and have traded in a $30-$36 trading range for most of the month of May.Splunk beat analyst consensus on their revenue headline this quarter, but lack of profitability was a disappointment to investors. Revenue growth, which came in at 80% for the first quarter of 2012, remains very strong. As a result of the high growth, the market values the firm at 13 times its expected revenues for 2012. While an investment in Splunk can hardly be called ""conservative"" from a traditional value investor viewpoint, there is a very real possibility that large tech giants are looking to acquire the promising data technology company.I am not considering an investment in Splunk yet, I would like to see a further correction in the shares to levels in the $20-$25 region before considering an investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Investors were very pleased with the second-quarter earnings report, released after the market close.Second Quarter ResultsSplunk reported second-quarter revenues for its fiscal 2013 of $44.5 million, up 71% on the year. License revenues grew 61% to $30.2 million, while maintenance and service revenues doubled to $14.3 million.The company reported a GAAP net loss of $4.6 million, or $0.05 per share. Excluding stock-based compensation of $3.9 million, the net loss came in at $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share. On average, analysts expected the company to lose $0.04 per share on a non-GAAP basis.CEO and Chairman Godfrey Sullivan commented on the results, ""The momentum that we realized in our first quarter of fiscal 2013 has continued into our second quarter. We added nearly 400 customers and are equally excited about the expanded use of Splunk in our customer base.""During the quarter, the company signed up some big new customers including, Allianz, ING Direct, Monster Worldwide, Pixar Animation Studios and Salesforce.com.OutlookFor the current third quarter, Splunk anticipates revenues between $45-$47 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to come in between minus 4% and 5%. This compares to second-quarter negative operating margins of 10.2%.For the full year of its fiscal year 2013, Splunk anticipates revenues of $183-$186 million. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to come in between minus 2% and 3%. Just three months ago, Splunk guided for annual revenues of $174-$177 million, and negative operating margins of 4%-5%.ValuationSplunk ended the second quarter with $268 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates without debt, for a generous cash position. For the first six months of the year, revenues came in at $81.7 million. Splunk reported operating losses of $10.7 million, or $0.17 per share.Factoring in a 15% jump in after-hours trading, the market values Splunk around $3.3 billion. Excluding the net cash position, operating assets are valued at $3.0 billion. This values Splunk at 16 times annual revenues. For the full year, Splunk is expected to lose money.Most competitors in the ""big data"" analysis industry trade at high valuation multiples. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) trades at almost 9 times trailing annual revenues, NetSuite (NYSE:N) at 16 times. Both companies are expected to lose money as well.Investment ThesisSplunk's performance as a public company has been astonishing. In April of this year, the company went public for $17 per share. The offer price was revised significantly upwards from an initial price range of $11-$13 per share.Shares quickly advanced to the $30 mark, where shares have been trading in recent months. The after-hours print of $35 is approaching the all-time highs of $37.Investors are relieved that Splunk managed to combine its spectacular revenue growth with improved operating margins. Furthermore, the upward revised guidance for the full year implies revenue acceleration and a continued improvement in margins.I have to reiterate my normal investment stance with companies like these. Investments can not be justified from a traditional conservative valuation standpoint. On the other hand, phenomenally high growth brings valuation multiples down quickly. Shorting names like Splunk is too dangerous as large technology companies are still looking to make acquisitions in the hot ""data"" industry.I will stay on the sidelines, being fully aware that I might lose out on even more short term returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

515761,22829,2012-04-22T04:01:02-04:00,,"by Brenon DalyIn a rip-roaring debut, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) soared onto the public market Thursday in an IPO that created more than $3bn of market value for the data analytics vendor. That's a heady, double-digit valuation for a company that's likely to generate only about $200m in sales this year. (Just as we predicted last week, the company has captured the attention of Wall Street.)But Splunk's rich pricing simply reflects the tremendous opportunity that the company has in front of it. If the name 'Splunk' conjures up images of exploring a cave, or 'spelunking,' we might suggest that a more accurate way to view the company is one ready to run - and run quickly - into a wide-open greenfield.The company, which has already garnered 3,700 customers across a broad number of industries, makes the pitch that any company with large amounts of data is a potential customer. Splunk's core offering is a search product that helps users make sense of the ever-increasing volumes of data, much of it machine-generated.After it got going in 2003, Splunk had most of its use cases around IT operations and security. However, the company has expanded its product to also cover application performance management, online customer experience monitoring, marketing and beyond.Originally, Splunk's seven underwriters set a range of $8-10 for each share, but then ended up pricing at double that level at $17 each. In the aftermarket, the stock nearly doubled again, changing hands in the low $30s in mid-Thursday trading on the Nasdaq. A final interesting little market anecdote about the offering: With roughly 100 million shares outstanding, Splunk is starting its life as a public company at almost exactly the same amount ($3.3bn) that Hyperion Solutions finished its life as a public company. Splunk's current CEO Godfrey Sullivan was previously CEO at Hyperion, which sold to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) five years ago."
513851,24394,2012-04-20T11:52:03-04:00,,"A month ago, I told you to add Splunk (SPLK) to your “Hot IPO Watch List.” You’ll recall, the company’s capitalizing on one of the most compelling growth trends in the market. Specifically, the exploding amount of data we create as a society, known as Big Data, to which I alerted you in early December.Well, the day of reckoning is upon us. Shares begin trading today. “Big deal,” you say? It is, in fact.Before long, I expect the company to become a household name and a staple in most investors’ portfolios. And ultimately, its IPO should prove to be the hottest of 2012. Yes, even hotter than Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) IPO. And here’s why.Forget Facebook, 'Friend' This IPO InsteadThere’s no doubt Facebook’s IPO is going to make the company’s geeky founder, Mark Zuckerberg, a billionaire many times over. Almost instantly. But the same guarantee can’t be made for lowly retail investors in Facebook’s IPO. I say that because Facebook doesn’t deliver a meaningful, or even necessary, service. We can all live without it. (Trust me, we can.)And it certainly doesn’t help its users derive any economic benefit. Instead, it tries to derive an economic benefit from its users through advertising. I've got news for you. Advertising has been around for centuries. Sure, Facebook represents a new wrinkle on advertising. But it’s not going to change the world or the way we conduct business.That, my friends, is what makes Splunk different. It is a game changer. Splunk’s software provides companies with real-time business intelligence. And it does so by collecting a company’s data and indexing it on a massive scale, regardless of format or source. Its technology allows companies to search, correlate, analyze, monitor and run reports on this data. All in real time.Simply put, Splunk is the Google (GOOG) for the business world. Just like we can’t live without Google, businesses are learning they can’t live without Splunk, either.Case in point: More than 3,700 customers, including over half of the Fortune 100, are now using Splunk’s software. I know. The same amount of companies (if not more) probably uses Facebook. But that’s only because of peer pressure – “Everyone else is on Facebook, so we should be, too.” To date, though, no company has materially changed its business by simply being on and/or advertising on Facebook. The difference with Splunk is that companies are actually monetarily benefiting from it.Consider:Like I said, Splunk helps companies derive a real economic benefit. And that’s much more valuable than amassing a legion of Facebook friends, who’ll likely never put a single penny in the company’s coffers.Good for Business; Good for Investors, TooThe reason Splunk’s so compelling from an investment standpoint is two-fold…First, it sells a product that sells itself. I mean, what business doesn’t want to use the data it’s already collecting to improve results. Mind you, there are a lot of potential sales out there, too. Remember, Splunk’s software serves a market worth at least $32 billion, according to Gartner.Second, Splunk boasts a unique business model with significant leverage. While most enterprise software is sold via licenses based on the number of servers or users, Splunk charges customers based on the amount of data they index per day. So the more data Splunk’s software processes, the more sales the company books. And like I told you before, nobody is predicting a slowdown in the amount of data being produced by businesses.The good news is a sizable chunk of Splunk’s sales are destined to drop to the bottom line. The company’s gross margins check-in at an unheard of 90.4%. For comparison’s sake, Facebook boasts gross margins of just 47.3%.Only If the Price is RightGiven Splunk’s enviable fundamentals, one critical question remains: How much are shares worth? Underwriters originally planned to price the IPO between $8 and $10 per share. But in a sign of brisk demand, they raised the range to $11 to $13 per share on Monday. When shares begin trading today, I assure you they won’t be that cheap. So how much should we be willing to pay?If we use price-to-sales ratios for other enterprise software companies as a proxy, we arrive at a valuation of up to $12.16 per share. That suggests shares will be fully valued based on the pricing range.If we use recent takeovers in the industry – which is justified since Oracle (ORCL) and Dell (DELL) were both reportedly trying to buy Splunk – we arrive at a valuation range of up to $16 per share. That’s still low. Does that mean we should just pass on Splunk? No!We need to take into consideration that these estimates are based on a snapshot in time. And Splunk’s business is going to look a lot different one quarter and one year from now. Not to mention, Splunk deserves to trade at a premium since it’s increasing sales at a much faster clip than every other company.So let’s assume Splunk grows sales by 50% in 2012. That’s not a stretch since the company’s grown sales at a compound annual rate of 91% since 2008. And let’s assume the price-to-sales multiples remain the same.If we do that, Splunk is worth up to $23.50 per share based on my estimates.Bottom line: We need to leave some room for us to profit, so I’d be a buyer of Splunk up to $20 per share."
444631,24394,2012-03-20T05:36:11-04:00,,"Now that Demandware (NYSE: DWRE) went public – and its IPO rallied out of the gate like I predicted – it’s time find a replacement for the company on our “Hot IPO Watch List.” Thankfully, it didn’t take me long.As you’re well aware, my passion and research focus lies with  up-and-coming technology companies. And I’ve found another compelling  tech IPO to consider.Which really shouldn’t come as a surprise. Tech companies are  dominating the IPO market this year. Counting this week’s expected  activity, 10 out of the 28 IPOs in 2012 have been technology companies.  That works out to 40% of the deal flow – well above the 10-year average  of 23.4%, based on Renaissance Capital data.The good news about the technology company I’ve found is that it’s  capitalizing on one of the most compelling growth trends in the market.  Specifically, the exploding amount of data we create as a society, which  I alerted you to in early December.Recall that the amount of data we create is expected to double every  18 months. Here’s the thing – businesses aren’t just looking for smarter  ways to store it. They’re also looking for smarter ways to analyze it.So much so, that the McKinsey Global Institute pegged big data as  “the next frontier for innovation, competition and productivity.”And that’s where Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) comes in…All the Hallmarks of a Hot IPOIn early January, the San Francisco-based company officially filed  plans to raise up to $125 million in an initial public offering. The  move marks the culmination of a year’s worth of speculation about an  IPO. During which time, Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) and Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) were both reportedly trying to buy the company outright.Clearly, this isn’t just any tech IPO. Splunk’s products are in  high-demand. Both customers and technology heavyweights are looking to  increase their own profitability via acquisitions. And for good reason…Splunk’s software provides companies with real-time business  intelligence. And it does so by collecting a company’s data and indexing  it on a massive scale, regardless of format or source. Its technology  allows companies to search, correlate, analyze, monitor and run reports  on this data. All in real time.As one insider put it, Splunk is the Google (Nasdaq: GOOG)  for the world of machine language. And much like Google’s interface,  you don’t need to be a data geek to use Splunk’s software.As Splunk states in its S-1 filing, “Users can simply download and  install the software, typically in a matter of hours, to connect to  their relevant machine data sources and begin realizing operational  intelligence.”Or as GigaOm’s Barb Darrow says, “A mere mortal – not a data  scientist – can work with Splunk to put that data into an easily  understood visual format.”No wonder most Fortune 100 companies are among the company’s 3,300 customers.But please don’t let an already impressive and expansive client list  mislead you into thinking the company’s best growth is behind it. Far  from it.Consider:Add it all up and Splunk’s definitely capitalizing on a verifiable  growth opportunity – one with serious legs. Which, as you know, is one  of my five hallmarks of a hot IPO.Now let’s evaluate the company based on my other criteria…Before the company finally goes public I expect it to release fiscal  2012 numbers. So we’ll want to make sure the numbers still point to  imminent profitability.The last criterion to consider, of course, is valuation. But we’ll  have to wait until Splunk finalizes its IPO plans before we can  determine whether the price is right."

SPLK software collects and indexes data at massive scale, regardless of format or source, and enables users to quickly and easily search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real-time.For the year ended January 2012 year revenue increased 83% to $121 million. Gross margin was 91%.CONCLUSIONSPLK obviously will go higher, probably much higher from the IPO price, whatever it is. And over time SPLK will most likely always look overpriced.BUSINESSSplunk provides an innovative software platform that enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence (including optimization routines) by harnessing the value of their data. Splunk software collects and indexes data at massive scale, regardless of format or source, and enables users to quickly and easily search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real-time.The software is designed to help users in various roles, including IT and business professionals, quickly analyze machine data and realize real-time visibility into and intelligence about their organization's operations. SPLK currently provides Splunk for Enterprise Security and Splunk for PCI (payment card industry) Compliance and have made available, through a controlled preview, Splunk for VMware (NYSE:VMW).SPLK was incorporated in California in October 2003 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 2006.MARKET International Data Corporation estimates that the volume of digital information created and replicated worldwide will grow approximately 45% annually from 1.8 trillion gigabytes in 2011 to 7.9 trillion gigabytes in 2015.Machine data (SPLK's segment) is one of the fastest growing components of this digital information and comes in an increasing number of formats. The applications, servers, network devices, mobile phones, desktop computers, laptops and various other systems and devices that comprise an organization's IT infrastructure are continuously generating information in a variety of disparate formats relating to application and system performance, user activity, configuration changes, transactions, security alerts, error messages and other time-series information.CUSTOMERS As of January 31, 2012, Splunk had over 3,700 customers, including a majority of the Fortune 100.Some of Splunk's largest customers include Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Etsy, Harvard University, Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA).RECURRING REVENUE MODEL Usage fee: SPLK bases license fees on the estimated daily data indexing capacity customers require.Software fee: SPLK generally recognizes the license fee portion of software upfront.

635411,22148,2012-06-04T11:19:01-04:00,,"Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) reported earnings after the close Thursday that easily beat analyst estimates. The stock though plunged down 16% on Friday. Whether this was due to the weak market or disappointment that the company didn't guide even higher is difficult to determine. Either way it shows the difficulties of owning high valuation IPOs going into the first earnings report.Previously hot IPOs such as Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE), Millennial Media (NYSE:MM) and even InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) plunged after disappointing earnings reports.Clearly investors expected too much out of these stocks as even 80% revenue growth for Splunk wasn't enough to keep the stock higher. All of the previously mentioned stocks have collapsed roughly 50% from post IPO highs, so the downside risk in Splunk could be substantial. A similar drop would be another $9 for the stock.Splunk is leading the 'Big Data' trend and falls into one of the exciting growth sectors as Jive Software with social media business software, Millennial Media with mobile advertising, and InvenSense with motion sensing chips.All of these stocks started hot and have cooled substantially with limited impacts to long term growth trends. The Figure below shows a comparison of the valuations of these stocks after the close on Friday.Figure - Valuation MetricsAfter comparing Splunk to the other recent hot tech companies, it's difficult to get excited at buying the stock at current levels around $27. The company is likely to face more selling pressure similar to the other high fliers. The forward price to sales ratio remains at extreme highs for investors to support this stock.Highlights of Splunk Q113 earnings.The numbers aren't that bad on a relative basis and clearly better than expected. The company is generating solid cash flow. Unfortunately, investors or maybe it's just traders don't seem to understand what they owned. Investors would be wise to follow this stock from a distance until the stock shakes out. The company remains solid regardless of the price action.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions."

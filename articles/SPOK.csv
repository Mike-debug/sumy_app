While paging use is in definite decline thanks to mobile  phones, there are certain niche segments (e.g. in healthcare) where  customers count on its reliability and low costs. As such, USMO  generates free cash flow of over $70 million per year, against a market  cap of just over $300 million. The company is also debt free, with a net  cash position of almost $35 million.One of the reasons Mr. Market hates this company undoubtedly has to do  with the declining use of this old technology. Revenue has fallen by  over 15% per year for the last three years. But give management credit  here, as costs have fallen faster than revenues:(Click to enlarge)This has allowed the company to generate substantial free cash flows of  over $310 million (which is currently the company's market cap) in just  the last four years. If management was just returning all this cash in  the form of buybacks and/or dividends, this might be a no-brainer. But  it's not.Combined, insiders own less than 1% of the company, meaning management  is probably more interested in its employment situation than it is in  delivering shareholder value. A manager's greatest fear might just be  allowing his company to shrink into oblivion, even if that might be  what's best for shareholders. Management's actions in this case support  this theory.A year ago, the company dropped $140+ million on a software company to  help stem the company's decline. Goodwill and intangibles of this  transaction comprised a whopping $173 million (bigger than the purchase  price!). This newly acquired company managed to deliver negative segment  earnings for 2011, and so far has lost half a million dollars through  one quarter in 2012. In addition, this is the case even though it  appears the company recently shifted some revenue from its cash cow  segment into this new segment, perhaps to make it look better. More  recently, some management reshuffling has taken place at the newly acquired company, suggesting things aren't going well.Unfortunately, this is a scary situation for shareholders. While the  company continues to generate cash flow, who's to know what this cash  flow will be used for? Management appears intent on throwing good money  after bad, as sadly, their incentives are totally out of whack with what  they should be.Disclosure: No position"
4232323,24594,2019-01-09T11:38:41-05:00,"Spok is trying to pivot away from its declining pager business to a software offering - which seems like a potentially dangerous strategy.But management has earned the benefit of the doubt in allocating capital - and both businesses actually are performing reasonably well.SPOK hardly looks cheap on an earnings basis, but there's still a case for growth and margin improvements which could drive upside for patient investors.","The bull case for Spok Holdings (SPOK) rests on the idea that the company has hidden potential. At the moment, SPOK does not look cheap by pretty much any metric. At the midpoint of 2018 guidance (and YTD performance seems to suggest SPOK will be in the middle of ranges for both sales and operating expenses), EV/EBITDA is about 21x. EV/revenue is about 1.1x, and GAAP EBIT this year should be right about zero, with EPS likely to come in at just a few pennies, thanks to interest income.Those multiples hardly scream 'value'. Meanwhile, the company's pager business is a) in secular decline by management's own admission (and sheer common sense) and b) still accounts for a majority of revenue. With 50%+ of revenue in decline, and well-above-market profit multiples, SPOK seems like a clear 'avoid', if not a screaming short opportunity.But Spok is using the cash flow from that 'cigar butt' wireless business to support its pivot to software. Of course, to any investor familiar with the small-cap space, that strategy only makes the bull case seem worse. ""We're going to pivot"" often seems like corporate-speak for ""our existing business is dying. So, hopefully, somehow we'll find a new one nobody's thought of"". It's a strategy that, to put it mildly, tends to sound better on conference calls than it works in practice.In this case, however, management has earned the benefit of the doubt, as I argued when I bought shares back in the fall of 2017. And while consolidated results hardly look impressive, and valuation appears stretched at first glance, the story here actually is playing out as planned. Even with a 15% bounce after SPOK hit its lowest levels in almost six years, there's time to buy that story. SPOK requires trust, and patience, but it's headed in the right direction.In his prepared remarks on the Q4 2017 conference call, Spok CEO Vince Kelly laid out the SPOK story for investors. The remarks are worth reading for investors not familiar with the story - and worth going through on an annotated basis, so to speak, to highlight where Spok stands even some ten months later.In 2017, Spok generated EBITDA of $22 million, down from $35.1 million the year before. Pretty much all of the decline came from investments behind the software business, which totaled ~$12 million per management commentary. Guidance reaffirmed in the Q3 report suggests further reduction this year, with the range for revenue and opex excluding D&A suggesting $8.5 million in profits.But as an investor looks at Spok, it's important to remember that the underlying earnings power still remains. Spok can pull back on those investments, and given moderating declines in the wireless business, likely still generate $20-25 million or so in profit - implying an ~8x-9x multiple at the moment.Obviously, there's a risk that management won't do so: again, plenty of small- and mid-cap management teams have thrown good money after bad. And 8x-9x is too expensive for a melting ice cube. Still, the fundamental case here is that if the software efforts don't work, the business still can be profitable and still can generate cash to be returned to shareholders (more on this in a moment).Trust in management, and the strategy here, is paramount. And in that context, it's worth noting that Kelly has been CEO and managed the business during the decade-plus of declining revenue.That's a positive, not a negative. The business is supposed to be declining, as was clear even when Spok (then known as USA Mobility) was formed by the merger of Arch Wireless and Metrocall. It's a pager business. It's a business that has been run by Kelly as a melting ice cube with the purpose of being a melting ice cube.So, the pivot here isn't a case of the oft-occurring risk with declining businesses - which is that managers don't want to manage a declining business. Kelly did so, happily, for over a decade before deciding to turn to software - and he did it well.USA Mobility stock did fall sharply after the merger and through the financial crisis, and recent performance further impacts long-term total return numbers. But under Kelly, SPOK has paid some $21 per share in dividends and provided $25+ per share in total shareholder returns, including buybacks. On a total return basis, Spok - again, a pager company - had outperformed the S&P 500 until the recent divergence (market up, SPOK down). This has been a shareholder-friendly company under Kelly, and one that has proven a focus on shareholder value over growth at any cost. And there's still close to $100 million in cash on the balance sheet coming out of Q3, over one-third of the current market capitalization, with no debt.Spok is wrapping up year three of what was thought to be a five-year plan. It was not a move done without thought - and I'd argue that YTD results show the company is moving in the right direction on the software front.Again, management trust is important. And barring reasonably small repurchase authorizations ($10 million announced on this call), Kelly isn't overreacting to what has been a stagnant share price at best. The plan is the plan, and Spok is going to execute. The market will respond if that plan works.And so far, Spok at least is headed in the right direction. On the wireless side, erosion actually is slowing. Spok is getting to a core base of large healthcare customers, for whom pager technology still has a number of advantages. On the software side, bookings are growing. Performance isn't perfect - the obvious question is whether Spok is getting enough bang for its investment bucks - but there's still reason for optimism looking closely at both sides:SoftwareThe software business is growing. For full-year 2017, revenue was flat but grew nicely in the second half. Bookings rose 5% for the year.YTD results have been choppy, with bookings accelerating and revenue decelerating:Spok Revenue and Booking Growth, Q1-Q3 2018* - excluding impact of ASC 606Source: author from SPOK press releasesIt's possible that seasonality is becoming more of a factor, as management has pointed toward back half strength, and given a ~two month lag (generally) between bookings and revenue. Net/net, the year has been strong, with operations revenue up nearly 10% and total software revenue climbing 6.5%. Maintenance revenue still is over half the total and continues to drive positive growth, with retention over 99% per management commentary.Meanwhile, operations booking was a record in Q3, at $10.8 million, and there are signs of progress on that front. The company drove 22 six-figure deals in the quarter, per the Q3 call, including 11 from new customers. The VA (Veterans Administration) accounted for over $2 million of those bookings and represents a large potential revenue opportunity going forward.Kelly said on the Q2 call that the total addressable market is about $2 billion. And as the company rolls out Spok Care Connect, its integrated platform, it should be able to capture a larger chunk of the market. Competition exists on various aspects of the Spok portfolio, but the company believes none of those rivals offers an end-to-end solution:Source: Spok marketing brochureOn the spend side, investments are starting to abate. R&D spend spiked 31% in 2016, 39% last year, and 36% in the first half, climbing ~$13 million on an annualized basis over that stretch. (That's a big move: about 8% of revenue.) The increase moderated to 19% in Q3, however, and should do so further going forward. Back-office investments this year similarly should be lapped in 2019.So, the company is headed on the right path in software. Margin pressure should start to lessen starting in Q4. The business is growing, even if results have been choppy. Management seems confident, and it likely takes some time to sell a larger product like Care Connect, particularly to traditionally slow-moving hospital customers. (Healthcare represents ~90% of software revenue, per commentary.)That said, there are concerns here. Growth is solid but hardly spectacular. Software revenue is guided to rise $4-12 million this year (and likely will come in modestly below the midpoint of $8 million) - a nice figure, but hardly one that's impressive in the context of close to $20 million ramps in R&D and G&A combined. Q3 numbers look somewhat disappointing (SPOK sold off on the quarter before rebounding quickly), with the Q citing ""a decrease in the number and size of projects in process"". There may be some timing effects at play, given sequential strength in bookings in the quarter, but given the reliance of the SPOK story on software, the performance seems like it could be stronger.Still, progress has been made. And if the company can post a strong Q4, in particular, the growth story here looks stronger just as the investments behind the business start to level out.WirelessThe wireless business unsurprisingly is declining - but on a relative basis, the news has been pretty solid. Unit erosion was 5.6% in 2017, the same as the year before. Revenue erosion was 7.7%, 20 bps better than the year before and notably better than the 10.1% figure in 2015.The news has been better this year. In Q2, for instance, net unit erosion was just 6,000, well less than 1% of a 1 million-plus base. ARPU has held up despite likely pressure from long-increasing reliance on large healthcare customers who can negotiate volume discounts. (Spok no longer breaks out segment-level data after doing so through 2016. Commentary and an increasing percentage of revenue coming from healthcare, per filings, suggest that trend is continuing, however.) YTD, revenue is down just 7.1%.The declines still are pressuring margins, admittedly. Spok doesn't break out costs or profits by segment, but SRM (service, rental, and maintenance expense) is spend on the paging business and is down just 2.7% year-to-date, according to the 10-Q.Still, the declines here are better than expected - and better than in recent years. And the segment remains profitable and enough to support the investments behind the software business. The declines aren't going to reverse by any means, but the wireless segment is holding up reasonably well.In terms of valuation, there's enough slack that SPOK can go up if the story works. The enterprise value at $14 is about $178 million. That's probably in the range of 2x 2019 software revenue, a reasonable multiple if that business starts gaining traction.On the wireless side, the $35 million in 2016 EBITDA suggests segment-level profits of at least $20-25 million, even with revenue down ~14% in 2018 and some level of margin compression. A 4x multiple there suggests a valuation of $80-100 million - or roughly half the current enterprise value.Put another way, SPOK's current valuation is about 1x software revenue plus 4-5x wireless EBITDA. That's probably not compelling on its own - but it's not terrible. It doesn't obviously price in improvement in software and, potentially, wireless trends as the base shrinks toward the stickiest customers.A price target here is tough to pin down, given the lack of public comparables and the poor fit of those peers. (In software, for instance, Spok competes against an offering from Nuance (NUAN), but that's not enough to suggest real comparability between the two stocks.) But even though headline multiples don't look attractive, what is clear is that SPOK stock will rise if the strategy works. If it doesn't, there's still time to pull back, focus on costs and get back to the melting ice cube strategy.The story isn't perfect, and neither is YTD performance. But ahead of what looks like an important Q4 report in late February/early March, there's reason to at least pay close attention. It might not look like it, but SPOK is on the right track - and cheap enough for upside if it continues to execute."
267113,23854,2011-05-02T18:30:29-04:00,,"USA Mobility, Inc. (USMO)  is a provider of wireless communications solutions to the healthcare,  government, large enterprise and emergency response markets.As a single-source  provider, the company’s strategy is to focus on the  business-to-business marketplace and to offer wireless connectivity  solutions. The company operates nationwide networks for both one-way  paging and advanced two-way messaging services. In addition, the company  offers mobile voice and data services through third party providers,  including BlackBerry devices and global positioning system (“GPS”)  location applications.The company’s  product offerings include customized wireless connectivity systems for  healthcare, government and other campus environments. USA Mobility also  offers M2M (“machine to machine”) telemetry solutions for numerous  applications that include asset tracking, utility meter reading and  other remote device monitoring applications on a national scale.BasisFinancial information presented in this report for USA Mobility, Inc., is based on the company’s  most recent SEC Form 10-K filing for the year ending December 31, 2010, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2011.Short-Term InvestmentThe stock closed  recently at $15.45, with first resistance at $15.90, a 3% increase from  the recent close, second resistance at $19.21, a 24% increase from the  recent close, first support at $14.64, a 5% decline from the recent  close, and second support at $12.10, a 22% decline from the recent close.Even though the stock price is trending upward,  there does not appear to be any near term price breakout on the  horizon, making a short-term investment impractical at this time.Long-Term (5 Year Hold) InvestmentIn review of the  company’s latest annual financial information, we note that the Current  Ratio at 4.48, the Quick Ratio at 4.28, and the Cash Ratio at 3.74, were  all what we consider investment quality.In addition, Debt  to EBITDA at 0.01, and a Cash Conversion Cycle of 13 days, were well  within our investment quality parameters. Additional bright spots were  ROIC at 131% and Free Cash Flow at $3.25. Although year over year free  cash flow declined from $3.97, or about 18%, at this time we do not see  the decline as the beginning of trend.We also note that the company ended FY10 with Debt of $0.03 per share, and paid an annual dividend of $1.96 per share.Earnings GrowthWe are value  investors, attempting to determine the value of an entire company based  on its most recent audited financial information. As such, we simply  refuse to pay for earnings growth and make no inclusion of it in our  valuation estimates.However, we  realize that many investors care a great deal about earnings growth and  base their investment decisions on the spread between year-over-year  earnings growth and the current PE.In the case of USA  Mobility, Inc., the company had year-over-year earnings growth of (7%),  ending FY11 with earnings of $4.52 per share. With a current PE of 3,  the spread between earnings growth and the PE is about (2), meaning that  for a value investor considering earnings growth, a fair value for the  stock is about $6.50.ValuationsBased on our review of the company’s latest annual financial information we think a Reasonable Value Estimate for the company is in the $48-$50 range.Assuming all due  diligence was performed prior, we would set a Buy Target in the $29-$30  range, a First Sell Target in the $56-$57 range, and a Close Target in  the $60-$62 range.Based on our  assessment of the company financial information that we reviewed, we  believe a reasonable financial risk multiplier is 78. Accordingly, for  the more risk averse value investor, we would set a Buy Target in the  $22 to $23 range.Considering a  recent close of $15.45, an estimated Merger and Acquisition payback of  2.6 years (assuming EBITDA remains the same), and Free Cash Flow of  $3.25, we think the stock is currently undervalued, and a candidate for additional research for the Wax Ink Portfolio.

4158544,23944,2018-03-23T15:03:49-04:00,"I recently did a conservative Graham-style value analysis of 902 traded stocks, of which, only 11 met my criteria.My criteria were defensive and strict due to my belief of a soon coming economic cycle downturn.I used the Graham number and also weeded out negative NCAV stocks to ensure my targets had assets to withstand a protracted downturn.From these original 11 out of 902, only two of these are somewhat attractive to me.This confirms my earlier analysis that the broad stock market is overpriced and very few true bargains are actually left. Even those have warts.","I recently wrote an article on 11 value stocks left in an aging bull market. Here are the results of my follow-up on those stocks that sifted out during the value screening. Two of them made it into the buy category, seven are put into the hold bucket, and the rest in sell.The reason I decided to run this screen was due to indications the market was overheated, from a historical perspective, as I documented in my article Finding Value In An Overinflated Market.My thought was I was unlikely to find a lot of good values in this market, and my results have thus far supported that hypothesis soundly. From the 11 screened earlier, here are my opinions on buy, wait, and sell.Most of the wait category have companies that are in turnarounds after experiencing difficulties or are implementing new business models after some restructuring. Those could still be values but need to give time to see if business objectives are being met before taking a position in the stock.Kelly Services (KELYA) provides workforce solutions to various industries worldwide.Fourth Quarter YoY results showed an increase in revenue of 9%, gross profits up 15.4%, earning from operations up 43%, but reduced earnings per share of $0.06 down to $0.45 due to charges related to changes in tax law. Sans those changes, EPS were up 57% YoY, so the business is doing well. The following chart shows the revenue mix and growth.Source: Kelly ServicesThe same source shows that year-end debt was up at $10 million due to the Teachers On Call acquisition. Teachers on Call provides substitute teacher staffing services and is complementary to the professional staffing services the company already provides.Capital Cube shows that earnings growth, share and price appreciation exceed peer median, while dividend quality is on par.Source: Capital CubeCapital Cube peer comparison shows that Kelly Services is trading more cheaply to book, earnings, and sales than its peers.Source: Capital CubeKelly's dividend payout is below that of the peer category.Source: Capital CubeThe current ratio is 1.5 but the profit margins are relatively low at 1.33%.The stock price turned up in September 2011 and may be due for a cool-off period. However, the business model is still attractive as more part-time and temporary workers enter the economy.The following chart from the BLS shows that part-time employment continues to increase in the US, and has increased substantially since the 2008 financial crisis. Part-time, project-based, and short-term staffing are a significant portion of the business for Kelly Services.Source: Trading EconomicsI believe that in the event of an economic downturn, demand for Kelly services will also likely increase as companies cut costs by ousting full time, long-term employees and turn to cheaper staffing services to fill the void. I believe the company will remain a solid buy for 2018.---Tech Data (TECD) is a wholesaler and distributor of computer products and software.Recent annual results have Tech Data increasing revenue 49% YoY to $11 billion due primarily to the acquisition of Technology Solutions. Apple products dominate sales with 19% and no other vendor partner over 10%. So if Apple sales dip substantially, then it may affect profits for Tech Data. This relationship will be key to watch.European sales increased 37%. The acquisition of Technology Solution added Asia as a regional segment and sales totaled $338 million. I see this last point as particularly bullish for Tech Data due to emerging market exposure and diversification away from US and European markets who may come under economic volatility pressures in 2018. EPS were up 43% to $3.50.The company is invested heavily in the cloud market, which is their fastest growing, and no offers cloud services in 67 countries. The company is expanding into technology services with the Global Lifecycle Management Services Portfolio, which I see as very bullish as profit margins are likely to be higher in services than in some of the other segments which are more commoditized in nature.Tech Data is trading below peers from a Price / Earnings standpoint.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe company has a very strong balance sheet, with current ratio 1.26 but a relatively low profit margin of 0.32%, which is a key statistic to watch going forward. Still, the cash hoard of almost $1 billion leaves the company plenty of flexibility to maneuver economic downturns. Price to book is 1.07 and Enterprise Value / EBITDA is a modest 6.01. The company is undervalued by traditional measures.Further, I believe that the technology space will grow as emerging economies continue to transition from industrial to information based. And with Tech Data's new exposure to Asia, a key growth market, prospects for increased sales are stronger in 2018 and beyond.However, shares have plunged since March 8th on revised downward quarterly guidance due to increasing competition since last year. I think the fall was a bit dramatic, as tends to be the case on quarterly target adjustments, which provides investors a nice entry position for a longer term hold position.Risks include the handcuff to Apple, the increased industry competition, and the relatively low short-term margins. However, I think the market in the longer term offers room for expansion should the company survive current competitive forces. Likely they will have to cut costs and streamline internal operations to stay competitive, but there is no reason to think this cannot happen. Maybe they should hire Kelly Services to reduce some of their staffing expenses!Looking forward, Q1 results are typically the softest, according to management, with receivables back-loaded into later quarters. Therefore, I would recommend either taking a position now or waiting until the new quarterly numbers are out to take one.This is a somewhat tepid buy recommendation, but I think the sell-off was overdone and hence my recommendation.---Spok Holdings (SPOK) is a wireless communications provider that specializes in messaging and messaging software. The company has declining earnings within the legacy paging service portfolio, which places it in like company with many aging wireline service telecom companies who have similar declining legacy copper-based portfolios.The paging service is declining, but due to attractiveness to emergency responders as the paging service is on a separate network from wireless smartphones, the declines in this market have been slowing. The software business revenues are increasing faster than the decline in paging services, so it appears Spok has executed on half their plan in paging services while continuing to expand the other half on communications software Spok Care Connect, for which growth has been particularly strong in the healthcare sector.This company is going through a transition from traditional telecom to a software provider and I believe the potential growth in software market outweighs the slower 'melt-rate' of the paging business. In the medium term, the company should continue to grow overall revenues as a result.The company has a lot of cash and a healthy balance sheet, having paid off long-term debt and also engaging in share buy-backs of late. The dividend is not high quality but there does not appear to be any near-term threat to it. The key question is how will Spok spend its cash on its next acquisition? Management says prior targets wanted multiples in premium which they are not willing to pay, which is no surprise in this overheated market.There is both risk and value in this company. If the economy goes into recession, the company has the cash to make a well-timed cheaper acquisition, which is what I would do if I were them. If management stays patient, it can navigate the declining pager business, build up the software business revenues, and wait for cheaper, synergistic acquisition targets during the next recession. If they don't stay patient and pay too much for their next deal, then investors would be smart to bail out of this stock.---Celestica (CLS) provides hardware design, manufacturing, platform, and supply chain solutions. The company exited the solar panel business in 2016 and is restructuring through 2018 which has put pressure on margins and reduced net income. The big question is if the company finishes the restructuring and then focuses on building higher revenues. The company has announced share buybacks and this will support the share price around the $9.50 to $10 mark, which has served as a strong support level for the stock.Source: Yahoo FinanceRisk with the company includes reliance on top 10 customers which generated 68% of revenue in 2017 in addition to the double-digit percentage losses in the communications silo. As my readers know from my past articles, telecommunications is experiencing margin compression and the after-effects of billions in mis-allocations of previous capital. Moving forward Celestica will need to diversify its customer base and expand regionally beyond the 70% share of customers in Asia to combat losses from the communications sector declines.Hope comes from the military and aerospace sector as geopolitical risk increases and countries like China, Russia, and the US continue to steadily increase their defense spending budgets YoY. Out of 11 analysts, 9 have it as a hold, 2 as buy and 1 as strong buy which shows there is belief to the upside if the company can execute on the new business plan starting in 2018.Price to book is 1.15 and Enterprise Value / EBITDA is 5.04. The current ratio is 1.94 and book value is $9.58, suggesting a bottom price for the stock this year before the eventual turnaround occurs. That would be my recommended entry point unless management reports better results next quarter, at which point we have likely hit the cycle bottom already.---Signet Jewelers (SIG) engages in retail sale of diamond jewelry, watches, and other products in North America, UK and Ireland, and the Channel Islands. The company's Zale's division runs the mall and outlet retail jewelry business.The profit margin is 8.31% and operating margin is 9.25%. Return on assets is 5.82% and return on equity is 16.71%, which are healthy. The current ratio is 3.32, and Enterprise Value / EBITDA is 3.67 which are both excellent numbers.Revenues, however, are falling steadily. Investors have posed three major criticisms, which are an alleged diamond swapping scandal with customers, sexual harassment story obtained from court documents, and using cheap financing to goose sales that would affect receivable quality, which has been confirmed by their recent non-prime receivable sale at below stated value.The company is having to close stores and may be another victim of Internet business stealing brick and mortar store revenues. The company is buying back shares with cash which while it will support the share price and provide gains for shareholders, don't undress the underlying business weakness issues.The company has plenty of cash but it needs to diversify sales channels and focus on profitable stores while closing down those that don't bring strong profits. Management has laid out a plan to do this and execution will determine whether, at this price, Signet is a true value or a value trap.---Sanmina (SANM) manufactures components and parts for several industries as well as providing repair and logistics services. Q1 2018 performance was disappointing due to customer order push-out at the end of the quarter, particularly in the communications sector as a result of transition from 4G to 5G wireless services. Automotive sector performance was down as well, though the company expects infotainment demand in automotive to continue to grow.The company mentioned that Q2 is seasonally soft, so expect weaker financial performance during this quarter with performance improving in H2 of 2018. The company says the sales pipeline for industrial, medical, and defense sectors is improving. The IHS Markit Score is overall positive for Sanmina, with little bearish sentiment and output in the industrials sector improving.Financially, the company is very solid. Current assets are enough to pay off all long-term debts, which is a true measure of stability in potentially turbulent economic periods. The company has positive cash flow and is using it to buy back stock, which is common in periods where companies expect market downturns. The buybacks strengthen share price and also pay back larger investors for their contributions before any market shocks occur.Revenue is 3x market cap, price to sales is 0.28, price to book is 1.28, Enterprise Value / Revenue is 0.31, and Enterprise Value / EBITDA is 6.49. This is pretty much the definition of a value stock and the company is trading below what it should be. Forward P/E is a modest 10.11.The sector is somewhat boring but stable. If the economy crashes, manufacturing could get hit hard. However, this company is already cheap. Risk is that sales fall in an economic downturn and the company burns cash; however, they should be able to weather the storm. I would wait for the weaker Q2 numbers to be published, let the stock price fall a bit, and take an entry point there waiting on a stronger expected second half if you are interested.---Super Micro Computer (SMCI) develops and provides high performance server solutions.They are currently dealing with a lawsuit regarding failure to properly record revenues, did not maintain proper internal controls over financial reporting, revenues and income were improperly inflated, and issued materially false statements.My recommendation as a former auditor: don't touch this one until the lawsuit is resolved. If the company is found to have materially misstated financials, then they are in trouble as this is a serious charge. There is no reason to buy this stock now until the matter is resolved.Once resolved and the potential impacts are known, the stock might be cheap. It is currently trading at very modest multiples to book and sales, so I recommend waiting.--First Solar (FSLR) provides solar energy solutions with most sales in the US, Europe, and Asia. The company does most of its business in the US, and in the event of economic downturn, could really hit this company hard. First Solar should consider increasing sales in emerging economies to offset expected market declines in some aging Western bull markets before the expected business cycle turn occurs.Losses in 2017 were largely due to tax law changes that will be balanced over the full eight years allowed. Sans those charges, the company earned $2.59 per share in 2017. Price to Book is 1.49, Enterprise Value to /EBITDA is 15.76 and the stock is trading over book value per share of $48.81. The price is too frothy at this level. The company has a good balance sheet and a 5.89 current ratio, so I don't believe there is near-term pressure on the financials.The weakness of the company is the lack of efficiency gains in its solar products, not seeing strong growth in 2017 which is putting it behind the competition. The company may be in transition to the new Series 6 product and 2018 may be the year the company builds base moving forward.Long term, the company has brighter prospects as countries are signalling demand for cleaner energy alternatives, and away from nuclear and coal. While I believe renewable energy projects cannot replace the base load capabilities of nuclear, it is clear that solar energy is here to stay especially as cost per watt continues to fall making it at least a viable, if imperfect, power alternative.First Solar appears to be concentrating on large industrial scale projects which will be accretive to revenues over time, but the company needs to advance R&D and improve their attractiveness compared to their competitors. I expect 2018 to be fairly week for the company but near the end of the year may be a different story.The stock has moved very strongly in the last month and I believe it is too high to enter, therefore I would wait to see what 2018 brings before investing.--Klondex Mines (KLDX) properties were recently acquired by Hecla, with some implication that certain deposits may be spun off. This is a complicated deal and investors should wait to see the resolution. Plus, the shares have already popped on the news, so the proposed value at time of my analysis has already been realized by current stockholders.Source: Yahoo FinanceSeneca Corp.

Studies have shown that use of these foods in American households is declining due to substitution of sides from fruits and vegetables at the dinner table, strong reduction in fruit juices at breakfast time, as well as movement into fresh vegetables and fruits and away from packaged.The company has a very low-profit margin (0.31%) but has reported recent sales increases of 7.1% for nine months ended Dec 31, 2017. The current ratio is over 4 and they are trading under book value, but the declines in product favorability with Americans along with weak profits may haunt them, despite their current favorable balance sheet. I don't see the long-term upside for the company unless they make a strategic acquisition to boost profit margins. The acquisitions to date capture market share but don't have much potential to boost margins and keep the balance sheet strong. This company is not a buy at this time.---Foot Locker (FL) sells athletic shoes and apparel in many markets. This one is suffering from falling sales like many other small apparel companies.Comparable sales and gross margins are down. There appear to be challenges with brand mix, and the company has not developed a strong retailer strategy to offset brick and mortar sales losses. However, one bit of good news is that sales per square foot are up a bit since the store closures. That indicates that the overall retail pie is shrinking slowly (slow ice melt) for which the company has some room to develop new sales channels.Also, the company is facing a lawsuit from disappointed investors claiming the company made false statements, which builds more uncertainty into their future prospects and likely puts more downward pressure on the price.However, this will likely take time and I expect the revenues to continue to drop in 2018. If the economy takes a hit as I expect it too, this company is really going to struggle as it relies a lot on premium brand sales. This is not a buy at this time."
1247241,21863,2013-03-05T10:06:57-05:00,,"Though the market has risen considerably over the last few months, not every stock has been lifted by the tide. Shares of cash-cow USA Mobility (NASDAQ: USMO) have flat-lined. As cash has continued to accrue, the valuation has become more compelling. USA Mobility now appears on the Magic Formula screener, both because it is cheap (P/E of 6), and because it generates strong returns on capital (2011 ROE of 40%).But looking under the hood reveals that there is more to the story than these superficial numbers tell by themselves. First, the company's main business line, from which almost all of the profits come, is in rapid decline. Paging services do have their applications (particularly in health care), but that market is shrinking quickly. To give you an idea of just how fast erosion is taking place, management called its last reporting period a ""fantastic quarter"" with ""significant improvement"", as the annual rate of unit declines hit a record low of *only* 10.2%.But if it's cheap enough, a declining business can still generate returns for shareholders when that cash is put to good use. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A), for example, is littered with dying businesses (including its namesake), but the capital those dying businesses produced was put to productive use.In USA Mobility's case, the company's capital allocation policy appears to be harming shareholders. Rather than return the bulk of the company's cash and cash flow to shareholders, management appears hell-bent on acquisitions that will grow revenues. But the company's last acquisition looks like a giant overpay at this point: two years ago, USA Mobility paid over $160 million (note that this is almost two-thirds of USA Mobility's current market cap!) for a company that is not even breaking even right now.Despite this, USMO CEO Vincent Kelly is unabated. He stated recently that ""[W]e expect to allocate a significant portion of our retained capital to pursue software acquisitions and other related growth opportunities in the software space.""When pressed about his dismal acquisition track record on the company's latest conference call, he betrayed overconfidence and a lack of objectivity. Here's what the caller had to say:CEO Kelly's response was as follows:First of all, it's not clear why Kelly chose to pick some day in 2008 as a starting point from which to measure shareholder return. Because that's when the dividend was changed? Ridiculous. So every time a CEO wants to obliterate his track record, he just has to change the company's dividend policy and ignore everything that happened prior? Kelly has been CEO of USA Mobility since 2004, and over that period, shares are down over 70%. But hey, since some arbitrary date that just happens to coincide with the worst financial meltdown in a generation, USMO is up big. Why aren't shareholders happy?The second point Kelly makes really gets to the heart of the matter. Kelly has no interest in returning cash to shareholders, because he's not a shareholder of any significance. Though he has been CEO since 2004, he has accumulated a whopping $1 million worth of shares. His salary and bonuses, on the other hand, have seen him rake in $7.5 million in compensation in the last three years alone. He has little incentive to allocate capital in a shareholder-friendly manner, and every incentive to plow capital into ""growth"" businesses that secure his position. Clearly, shareholder and management interests are not aligned at this company.Finally, it's worth noting that recent profits are overstated relative to the company's true earnings power. The company has been able to reverse tax valuation allowances that have propped up net income, but this is not sustainable. While operating income last year came in at $60 million, net income was almost $90 million. Be sure to take a reasonable tax rate into account should you choose to value this yourself.USA Mobility appears cheap on every metric. Unfortunately, this company's stewards appear likely to ensure that it is management and not shareholders that benefit from this company's cash cow pager operations. Buyer beware.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

4134829,24594,2018-01-02T11:51:26-05:00,"Spok's consolidated numbers YTD look relatively weak, with revenue and margins both down year over year.But the wireless business remains in predictable, and manageable, decline, while investments behind the software business are showing some early results.This is a multi-year story which requires both patience and trust in Spok management.2017 has been good enough to keep both, and a recent pullback offers another attractive entry point.","Purely from the numbers, 2017 results from Spok Holdings (NASDAQ:SPOK) don't look particularly attractive - or particularly surprising. Anyone would know instantly, and correctly, that the core pager business is in secular decline and a complementary software segment still generates less than 40% of revenue. That business, too, has declined YTD, despite modest growth in Q3. With overall EBITDA down over 40%, from a distance the first three quarters of 2017 look like a disaster for Spok, and a 25% decline in SPOK shares during 2017 seems logical.The news actually is a lot better than it might appear, however. The decline in wireless revenue isn't a surprise, but the rate of decline continues to be manageable. The software business is showing strength in the key healthcare market, with investments in R&D and G&A behind that business showing solid, if admittedly early, returns. In its Q3 release, Spok pointed to the midpoint of revenue guidance for the year, if not modestly higher - and toward the low end of expense guidance, thanks to cost controls in the wireless business.The story, then, actually remains much the same as it was when I highlighted it back in March - only with some progress made. Meanwhile, a year-end pullback puts the valuation back toward a multi-year low. I stepped into a similar pullback in September, and may take the opportunity here to add to my position. From here, 2017 looks like a good year for Spok, even if that's not at all reflected in SPOK shares.Again, the numbers don't look particularly impressive. In Q3, revenue fell almost 4% Y/Y, with 1.1% growth in software more than offset by a 7% decline in wireless. YTD revenue still has declined almost 6%, with wireless down 7.8% and even software off 2.9%. Overall opex has risen, leading YTD GAAP operating margins to compress substantially, to 5.6% from 12.9% a year ago.But none of those figures are necessarily a surprise - again, Spok's results are comfortably on track to hit guidance given in the Q4 2016 release (guidance which hasn't been changed since). And looking at each of the two segments, the news remains positive.WirelessThe pager business is a classic ""melting ice cube"". But Spok management has treated it as such for years - which until this year allowed the stock to actually outperform the S&P 500 on a total return basis for a decade. (SPOK has paid almost $19 per share in dividends over the last twelve years.) And that strategy continues to work.Spok doesn't break out segment-level expense or profits, but figures from the 10-Q suggest the company still is able to keep margins intact in the wireless segment. As noted, revenue is down 7.8% Y/Y through the first nine months. Consolidated cost of revenue is down 8.1%. Service, rental, and maintenance opex declined 3.5%, and selling & marketing (again, consolidated) spend has fallen 11%.Even without a clear picture of segment-level margins, consolidated figures suggest maybe modest compression, with SRM expense not falling as fast as revenue. Combined with a nearly 8% decline on the top line, that's not exactly comforting. But again, this is a business that simply is in decline. Consolidated EBITDA already fell 22% between 2014 and 2016, with margins compressing 260 bps. 2017 figures aren't a noticeable departure from that trend - but they weren't supposed to be. At the least, 2017 performance appears, from the numbers, and from commentary on conference calls, to be perhaps a bit better on that front.And from a revenue standpoint, that seems the case as well. Wireless sales fell 10% in 2015 and 8% the year before. The figure YTD is an improvement, and a 2% Q/Q decline in Q3 was the best performance of the year so far. The business increasingly is reliant on large (72% of units are in accounts with over 1,000 units, up from 70% a year ago) healthcare (77% of wireless revenue, versus 74% in the first nine months of 2016) providers. That's relatively good news, as those customers are stickier, which is why erosion rates are improving. The one drawback, admittedly, is a lower ARPU, which declined 2% Y/Y.Admittedly, none of the above constitutes great news for Spok. And again, there's no bottom coming from the business - it will be defunct at some point, as even management has admitted in the past. But that itself is not news of any kind: that was widely known in 2016, when the stock cleared $20, and in 2014, and probably in 2008 for anyone paying close attention. So far this year, however, the wireless business has been a bit above expectations, and at the least the risk of an outright collapse continues to be rather slim. Without question, 2017 has been good enough in the pager business - at least.SoftwareWhere it gets interesting is on the software side. The company decided to invest in the business this year, trying to tie up a portfolio of single-solution communications offerings into a platform called Spok Care Connect. Those investments have led R&D to spike 41% and G&A to rise 13%; the Y/Y increases alone have driven over 70% of the EBITDA compression seen so far this year.Here, too, it looks like 2017 is a disappointment. Revenue is down so far this year. Bookings grew a whopping 31% in the first quarter; growth decelerated to just 3% in Q2 and then, concerningly, declined 2% in Q3.Here, too, however, the news probably is better than the overall numbers suggest. First, it wasn't necessarily the case, nor the projection, that the increased investments would pay off this year. But bookings still are up nearly 9% YTD. And while Q3 might look disappointing, the Q cited timing of renewals as the driver of an 8.5% decline in maintenance and renewals bookings in Q3. Operations and new maintenance bookings actually grew 6%, and have risen 17% YTD. In addition, backlog rose 8% Y/Y, hitting a new record according to the Q3 conference call.And looking at industry figures from the 10-Q, the news looks even more promising. Care Connect is targeted to the hospital industry; software healthcare revenue in Q3 rose 31% Y/Y. It's up 12.3% YTD. There's notable erosion in the ""Other"" category (hospitality, resort, and other areas) and weakness in government and large enterprise as well. But healthcare now accounts for 75% of software revenue so far this year - and in that category, Spok is growing nicely.All that said, the story here isn't over, and it's not as if Spok has had some torrid 2017 for which the market isn't giving it credit. Still, there's little reason to suggest a pullback from the high-teen levels earlier in the year, or the recent sharp decline that's moved SPOK not far from the multi-year low at which I bought the stock in September:(Source: Finviz)The risks here aren't immaterial, either. Even with essentially raised EBITDA guidance post Q3, SPOK still trades at nearly 13x EBITDA. EV/FCF at the midpoint of capex is ~34x. There's still $110 million in cash on the balance sheet, over one-third of the market capitalization. But CEO Vince Kelly said on the Q3 call that the company still was considering another acquisition, which raises the risk that value might be destroyed by M&A - something that is all too often the case.Still, EV/EBITDA is being inflated by the investments; true earnings power is much higher. Even just taking off the $5 million-plus each in added G&A and R&D this year suggests EBITDA closer to $27 million and an EV/EBITDA multiple below 8x. Capex is somewhat elevated this year; a return to historical levels in the $6-7 million alone would narrow the EV/FCF multiple next year, all else equal, to a more reasonable ~21x.An investor in SPOK does have to trust management - but that, too, isn't a difference ten months ago. Kelly has been CEO since 2004 and has aggressively returned capital to shareholders. Spok has been looking at acquisitions literally for years, with Kelly saying on the Q3 2016 conference call that the company hadn't made a deal because targets wanted ""multiples of revenue"" - a price Spok wasn't willing to pay.Nothing so far this year has changed my opinion of management. An acquisition would make some sense - but clearly, Spok isn't making a purchase just to make a purchase (or to hit its targets). Shareholder returns will continue: CFO Mike Wallace said on the Q3 conference call that Spok planned to maintain a $0.50 dividend ""for the foreseeable future"". The company also has repurchased almost $10 million of stock YTD, and paid a $0.25 special dividend in January.This looked like a value trap in March, but it's not - and nothing YTD changes that. It looks like a declining business in January, but it's not - at least not on the software side. I do think the opportunity on the software side is compelling - there really isn't a similar competitor in what admittedly is a somewhat narrow market - and valuation isn't stretched if Spok has some degree of success on that front. Even valuing the pager business at zero, EV/software revenue is in the 3x range. That's not a prohibitive multiple if the company can get to consistent double-digit growth next year.Again, there are risks here, and this is a multi-year story, as management emphasized in both the Q3 release and on the Q3 call. It's going to take some patience. But below $16, investors still are paying a single-digit P/FCF multiple to true earnings power. And the goals that management laid out for 2017 are being met. SPOK shares simply haven't reflected the progress made. With the stock back below $16, that creates an opportunity ahead of what hopefully will be an even better 2018."
4106450,24594,2017-09-14T10:04:21-04:00,"SPOK trades near its lowest levels after what looks like the sell-off of a reasonably large position over the past few sessions.Ramped-up investments this year are hurting margins, and reported negative revenue growth hides the potential value here.But the story is playing out roughly as Spok foresaw it, and the needed growth in the software business is starting to materialize.The bull case requires a substantial amount of trust in management - but CEO Vince Kelly has earned that trust.All told, SPOK looks attractive at $15.","The story at Spok Holdings (SPOK) has played out like I thought it might back in March. Spok's legacy wireless pager business is in decline, and has been for years. But it still throws off a solid amount of free cash flow, and a software business, the core of which was acquired in 2011, has been stable, if unspectacular. Spok might have looked like a value trap, but on a total return basis, it had (at least through March) beaten the S&P 500 over the past decade, and even a 2016 short case on the stock admitted it had been ""a case study of how to run a dying business"".With the stock at $18 in March, I thought there was an interesting bull case based on a ramp in investments in the software business. Those efforts - including a large spike in R&D spend - would pressure EBITDA and margins in 2017. But either that spend would work, jumpstarting growth in the software business, or SPOK could pull back and return to maximizing cash flow. Obviously, it wasn't a no risk plan, but with $100 million-plus in cash on the balance sheet, and management having proven its focus on not throwing good money after bad, it seemed a risk worth taking.But I also worried about entering a position in March, ahead of what was set to be a challenging year. Coming out of Q4, revenue was guided down ~6% at the midpoint, and EBITDA was expected to compress to $13 million from $35.1 million in 2016. And so I argued:After the first half of 2017, it looks like both sides of the story have played out:Source: finviz.comThe fall in the sessions heading into Tuesday looks like it may be a large position selling out, as volume was well above normal over that time. But even that decline aside, SPOK has weakened steadily throughout 2017; the accelerated sell-off to Monday's close of $14.50 left the stock at its lowest level in almost three years. A rebound Tuesday looks like value investors stepping in (myself included), but overall it still looks like investors have abandoned the story here.Yet that same story is playing out roughly the way Spok itself projected. After both Q1 and Q2, CEO Vince Kelly has said results were in line with internal expectations. Full-year guidance has been maintained, and there has been some pieces of early good news in the software business.The first half hasn't been perfect, but the software business had a strong Q1 and the wireless business even showed some signs of life in Q2. Overall, if an investor trusts Spok management - and Kelly's 13 years at the helm, in my opinion, have earned that trust - then there's more than enough reason to step into the decline here.The catch with SPOK is that it looks like a value trap, down to the ""using cash to move into an adjacent business"" aspect. And first half results seem to support that perception.Overall revenue declined almost 7% in the first half, including a 5.2% drop in the first half. EPS fell from $0.33 in the first six months of 2016 to $0.11 this year. And segment results don't look much better - but might be better than appearances.In the wireless business, revenue fell 8% year over year in the first half. But there are some signs of improvement, particularly in Q2. Quarterly unit erosion was just 0.4%; the annual rate declined to 5.1%. Both figures were records, per the Q2 conference call. In the core healthcare category, revenue dropped just 5% in H1, and the number of units in 1,000+ unit accounts actually increased sequentially in Q2, per the 10-Q.The wireless business is going to keep declining - but it continues to appear that the declines may be manageable. The core large healthcare customer is remaining relatively sticky. Pressure elsewhere remains severe, with non-healthcare segments seeing a 17% decline and sub-1,000 unit accounts declining double digits year over year. But with the large accounts holding strong, healthcare driving 73%+ of first half revenue, and ARPU holding reasonably stable (-2.5% Y/Y), the business at least is avoiding another leg down, at least for now.Spok doesn't break out segment-level profit, but it does seem like margins in the wireless business are holding up. Per the 10-Q, service, rental and maintenance spend has come down 3% year over year in the first half, thanks to lower site rent (-1.4%) and telecommunications (-11.7%) spend. Selling and marketing spend came down 13%, with headcount down 24%, and those reductions almost certainly confined to the wireless business.The ""melting ice cube"" argument in the wireless business seems intact coming out of Q2 - and that argument is a big part of the bull case here. It's not as if there's no risk, or no cost, to ramping up the software business. But as long as SPOK's wireless business remains ""a case study of how to run a dying business,"" and as long as margins hold up, as appears to be the case, there should be enough cash flow to keep SPOK reasonably stable, particularly after a 27%+ decline YTD.As far as the software business goes, the first half doesn't look particularly impressive, with revenue down 5.1% through the first six months. But bookings numbers are much better, rising 31% in Q1 (including 68% in operations and new maintenance bookings) before decelerating to 3% in Q2.Spok is paying for those bookings, with R&D for the new, comprehensive Spok Care Connect portfolio - an integration of previous offerings - up a whopping 43% year over year in the first half. G&A has spiked 13% as well, with the two line items combined adding $5.3 million in opex year over year. That's about two-thirds of the year-over-year decline in EBITDA in the first half.So the ""heads I win, tails I don't lose much"" type of case seen back in March still seems to hold. If the investments don't work, Spok still has time to pull the throttle back and return to maximizing cash flow. That likely entails some downside for the stock, even from current levels, but with $100 million-plus ($5.26/share) in cash on the balance sheet and a decent NOL carryforward balance, that downside seems somewhat limited given the cash flow capabilities of the wireless business, even as it declines.But the 'heads' option seems more likely after the first half, not less. Management seemed reasonably pleased on the Q2 conference call with year-to-date results. 22% bookings growth suggests some return on the initial R&D investments. Sales cycles have been lengthened by the efforts to sell the more comprehensive Spok Care Connect (as opposed to individual products), as CEO Kelly pointed out in the Q&A of the Q1 call. But there have been some nice wins on that front already, and progress is being made.Admittedly, the numbers don't necessarily show much progress, particularly in terms of revenue. But increased deferred revenue is a factor, and even on the revenue front Spok is making progress in the core healthcare end market. Healthcare software revenue is up 2.7% year over year, including 9%+ growth in the second quarter. Meanwhile, backlog increased 7.2% Q/Q in the second quarter, per the Q2 call.The broad point here is that the plan laid out by Spok in the second half of 2016 is working, at least so far in 2017. That's not a guarantee of future success, by any means. But the sell-off in SPOK really isn't supported by the results in Q1 and Q2. Rather, it looks more like existing investors (including what appears to be a large position over the last week) exiting as the story changes, and new investors likely turned off by what looks like an excessive valuation for a declining business.Those investors haven't been proven wrong - yet. And this is a stock that will require some patience, because even success in the software business won't be reflected in reported numbers until 2018, at the earliest. But at least so far, Spok's plan is working. And the results don't support a 27% decline in the stock over the past eight-plus months.All told, it looks like a solid first half - but the work isn't done. And, admittedly, this is a stock that requires a significant amount of trust in a management team pitching a story that investors like myself have heard way too many times before. I've made the point multiple times that the core problem with the ""declining business is too cheap"" argument is that managers don't want to manage declining businesses. That inevitably leads to a major acquisition in an 'adjacent' space which winds up destroying much, if not all, of the asset base that defined the ""too cheap"" bull case to begin with.That's a risk here as well, with Kelly saying on the Q1 call that the company still was considering an acquisition (or multiple acquisitions) to add to the functionality of the Care Connect platform. The investments this year already represent a departure from the previous strategy (which, again, has been a success, at least since the financial crisis). M&A could further deplete the cash balance and change the value case as well.But Spok has been looking for an acquisition for a long time, with Kelly on the Q3 2016 call saying the company hadn't ""pulled the trigger"" due to scale and valuation problems. This is a company that has done a fine job of protecting shareholder value, and going forward I still believe Spok will do the same.Admittedly, SPOK doesn't look all that cheap at the moment, with the stock trading at ~15x EV/EBITDA based on the midpoint of 2017 guidance, and ~65x normalized free cash flow net of cash on the books. But there's room for margin expansion next year if the software business grows and laps this year's opex investments, and if the wireless business can continue to see its erosion rate moderate. Backing out this year's investments ($7M run rate in R&D, $5M in G&A), the EV/EBITDA multiple falls to ~8x, and EV/EBITDA to ~13x. And those investments haven't really improved the revenue numbers all that much - at least not yet.SPOK is a bet on management, and a bet on the software business. But with the software business growing bookings, sporting a 99%+ retention rate, and building a roster of stable, sticky clients, it has real potential. And management has proven its ability to run this kind of business, and execute this kind of strategy - and wisely so. It's a story not apparent at first glance - and I think that's why the opportunity exists. Investors are selling SPOK because of the numbers - but I think many of them are missing its true potential.Thank you for reading this Seeking Alpha PRO article.

4054875,24594,2017-03-15T09:16:05-04:00,"SPOK is ramping up investments in its software business, using cash from its declining legacy wireless segment.That seems a lot like a classic management-led value trap - but there's a logic to the strategy here, and a management team that has earned its credibility.Near-term trading may be volatile, and there are entry point concerns. But I like the long-term play here.","Every value investor has heard some version of this story before. A company has a solid business - maybe it's even an industry leader. Secular challenges, however, are applying pressure; over the long term, the business clearly is going to decline, if it's not doing so already.Still on paper, the fundamentals work, particularly from a value investor's standpoint. Whether it's a ""melting ice cube"" or a ""cigar butt"", the business still should throw off more than enough cash to justify its share price. The question, however, is what management plans to do with that cash. Not being content to manage a business to zero, it acquires an ""adjacent"" business (in cash, not stock, of course) with the strategy being to use the cash flow from the declining legacy business to build out a new growth segment.That strategy almost never works. To varying degrees, that story has played out poorly at GameStop (NYSE:GME), magicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL), Trans World Entertainment (TWMC), Perion Network (NASDAQ:PERI), and others I'm sure I'm either forgetting or have missed.But at Spok Holdings (NASDAQ:SPOK), it looks like it is working. The ice cube is melting slowly, and a new software business is holding its own. And a 20% decline since highs just after the New Year, before a 4% pop on Monday, makes the valuation attractive.There are some risks, particularly in the near term, with Spok putting more cash into the software business in 2017 and 2018. Near-term earnings and cash flow multiples will have to inflate in response, and that may not happen for a small-cap stock with a declining core business. But Spok management has earned investor trust, and I think there are enough rewards to take on the risk and enough management credibility to minimize downside if the plan fails.Seriously, A Pager Business?SPOK Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsSpok used to be known as USA Mobility, which itself stemmed from the 2004 merger of pager companies Arch Wireless and Metrocall. Unsurprisingly, the business has declined steadily: text messaging has left pagers largely a relic, and the use case has narrowed for the most part toward hospitals and a few industrial applications.As bad as the revenue declines look, however, the stock actually has performed reasonably well:SPOK Total Return Price data by YChartsSPOK has paid out over $18 per share in dividends alone since 2005. Management, to its credit, has recognized for some time that it was managing a melting ice cube, and consistently adjusted opex accordingly. CEO Vince Kelly has been at the helm since the 2004 merger and, for the most part, has done what value investors usually think should be done in these cases: manage the business for cash flow and then aggressively return that cash to shareholders.That's an important point that needs to be emphasized in the context of the investment case for SPOK. Again, this story usually plays out very differently. Spok did make a major acquisition in 2011 (more on that in a moment), and has spent the last few quarters looking for another with the ~$120 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of Q4 (net of $5 million-plus in dividends paid in January). But on the Q3 conference call, Kelly seemed to capitulate on that effort, saying that valuations including ""multiples of revenue' simply didn't make sense.Between longer-term capital allocation policies and the retreat from M&A in the near term, Kelly and Spok management have earned credibility in terms of focusing on shareholder value first and foremost. That's particularly key at the moment, since, in 2017, Spok is doubling down on the software strategy.The Wireless BusinessThe wireless business remains the profit drivers even as declines continue. Segment revenue fell 5.3% in each of the last two years, continuing the long-term decline seen above.Earnings are declining as well despite cost cutting efforts. Opex declined a bit over 4% in each of the last two years; but 2016 figures include a ~$4 million jump in R&D focused on the software business. Spok doesn't break out segment-level opex or EBITDA, but overall EBITDA declined 13% in 2015 and 10% in 2016. But backing out the $4 million increase in R&D, EBITDA was ~flat in 2016, suggesting a relatively modest decline in wireless profit. Spok has been able both to consistently lower headcount and manage down rent expense by consolidating tower usage, allowing it to come close to matching sales decreases with lower spend.Meanwhile, on the top line, the rate of decline is slowing. Net unit erosion has declined from 8.7% in 2014 to 6.6% in 2015 and then just 5.3%. Healthcare remains about 80% of the paging subscriber base, per the Q2 call, and Spok has a solid base there. As Kelly explained on the Q4 call, cellular technology runs the risk of overload in critical situations, and many doctors still prefer pagers to smartphone or tablet communications. Some hospitals have even had to reverse field on removing pager systems, upon pushback from physicians.That core base seems to be holding up reasonably well. Per the 10-K, accounts over 1,000 units had a net erosion rate of just 3.3% in 2015, and just 2.3% in 2016. In contrast, sub-100 unit contracts have a three-year erosion stack of 40%. That divergence suggests more moderate declines going forward, given an increasing proportion of large contracts (71% of the total subscriber base in 2016). The one issue there is lower ARPU, which fell 2% in 2016, as the larger customers generally negotiate more favorable rates.From a long-term standpoint, the paging business still is going to zero. But the rate of decline might be slower than some investors would expect, and there's still some time for the business to continue to throw off free cash flow. Spok management itself sees the business coming to an end, eventually. But the core base of healthcare clients, in particular, should stay reasonably solid for some time to come. And with working capital help and minimal cash taxes (thanks to NOL carryforwards) boosting free cash flow, its contribution shouldn't be ignored. Overall free cash flow was $31.2 million in 2016, $36.3 million in 2015, and $34 million in 2014. Spok's enterprise value at the moment is just $250 million, implying a trailing ~8x P/FCF multiple.The Software BusinessOf course, 8x essentially untaxed free cash flow isn't exactly a thrilling multiple for a declining business. The $71 million in NOLs should be exhausted within 4-5 years at the current rate. The ability to match revenue declines with opex cuts will slow at some point, particularly as network rationalization benefits moderate.Spok, even at $18 and a single-digit FCF multiple, needs growth from the software business to drive upside from current levels. And the company is making a bet on that front. R&D moved from $10 million in 2015 to $14 million in 2016; it's guided up roughly 50% year over year in 2017. The increase is coming from a nearly 45% increase in R&D staff for the software business, and further additions are guided for 2018.That's a substantial amount of spend given Spok's size. Consolidated EBITDA was barely $35 million in 2016; the R&D increase is taking 20% off that figure this year. The strategy is to take the multiple, largely disparate, parts of Spok's software business and combine them into an offering called Spok Care Connect. That will take time and cash.The business now has a series of offerings. Spok offers a console for incoming call operators, call recording and accounting software, and Spok Speech, an automated operator. There are scheduling and notification tools, and a Spok Messenger to distribute alerts to various devices (whether pagers, smartphones, or tablets). Spok also offers services for E-911 operators.The software offering, for the most part, has been sold on a standalone basis, but in response to both customer requests and the difficulty in managing the disparate products, Spok decided to unify the offerings into the single Care Connect platform.It's a relatively big bet for Spok. Financially, the investments are narrowing 2017 profitability significantly. 2016 EBITDA was $35 million; the midpoint of 2017 guidance suggests a decline to just $13 million. The investments are pressuring opex, which is guided up nearly $12 million, which includes likely sales and marketing additions and the top line as well. Revenue recognition in the software segment will have a modest impact, and lengthening sales cycles from the larger, more expensive unified offerings should push bookings out as well.Indeed, Spok Care Connect changes the very nature of the investment case, at least in the near term. SPOK largely has been an argument over valuation and the pace of declines in the wireless business. But with FCF guided to maybe $5 million in 2017, given capex expectations of $8-12 million, that figure up from software investments as well, the near-term valuation profile looks very, very different.Valuation And The Bull CaseFrom a long-term standpoint, I'm more than happy to give Spok management the benefit of the doubt. The company has cited a billion-dollar addressable market, and in the 10-K, writes that there is no competitor with a breadth of offerings available. It's worth pointing out that the current enterprise value suggests a 3.5x EV/revenue multiple for the software business alone. While even a successful Spok isn't quite Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) or Medidata Solutions (NASDAQ:MDSO), some level of success in the Care Connect plan could lead the stock to re-rate.There are two key concerns. The first is that the software business hasn't exactly been a torrid grower so far. When Amcom, the core of the current business, was purchased in early 2011, USA Mobility said 2010 revenue was $51 million. 2016 bookings were $74 million, a 6% CAGR over the six years. Recent performance has been rather poor: bookings declined 5.7% in 2015 and 0.2% in 2016.That leads to the second concern: what exactly happens to SPOK over the next few quarters. The company is guiding for total revenue to decline 6% in 2017; Kelly has made it clear on recent calls that any revenue acceleration in software likely is not a near-term eventuality. New investors may not particularly like the story here, which at first glance looks an awful lot like those of a lot of value traps (including the stocks mentioned at the beginning of the article). Existing investors, meanwhile, may decide that a multi-year plan, and what looks a lot more like a growth stock than a value play, isn't exactly what they signed up for. Even with the stock off from levels seen around the New Year, it's not hard to imagine that a better entry point will come along in 2017.The latter concern is a major one; SPOK would seem a decent candidate for put-selling from that standpoint, but liquidity is limited and premiums aren't great, regardless. But from a longer-term standpoint, there's still a case to start building a position at current levels. There is an opportunity for Care Connect. Management has earned enough credibility to believe in its decision-making relative to the current investments. More importantly, Spok has proven that if the investments don't work, it is not simply going to buy another business to camouflage those revenue declines or continue throwing good after bad.And there are some bright spots in the software business. New license revenue sales have been weak. But the company reorganized its salesforce in late 2015, with the express intent of removing low performers. 2016 and 2017 results are suffering somewhat from longer sales cycles and the lingering impacts of those changes. But maintenance revenue, the high-margin, sticky revenue that drives so many software valuations of late, is growing nicely, up 7.7% in 2016 and 11.8% in 2015. The renewal rate is over 99%, which means that when Spok does close a deal, it keeps those customers. That's the base of a potentially lucrative business if Spok can accelerate new license sales.That's an 'if' to be sure, but again it's not as if Spok is betting its entire future on the software business. Looking at 2017 guidance as a run rate for Spok as a whole is too conservative; if the investments don't work, spend can, and likely will, be pulled back. And it doesn't take much of success in those investments to drive upside from current levels. The stock is trading at almost 20x 2017 EBITDA on an enterprise basis; but that EBITDA includes likely $13-15 million in elevated expense. Either those investments work, in which case EBITDA rises (and likely quickly, given incremental margins) and the multiple expands to accommodate software growth, or they don't, in which case Spok can pull back.That's not to say it's as simple as ""tails I win, heads I win,"" but management should be trusted to execute. Assuming those investments hadn't been made, SPOK probably would look reasonably valued at ~$18 based on 2017 guidance. If they don't work, a possible loss of $50-60 million in capital over the next few years isn't immaterial. But nor does it imply a collapse in the stock. Both businesses are profitable as is; paging's decline appears to be moderating. The single solution sales efforts likely have been somewhat disappointing (Amcom was acquired for $163 million), but not an outright failure.Overall, the bull case here sounds awfully similar to those made in other ""value play or value trap?"" type of stocks. The difference, again, is faith in management. There's been perhaps more insider selling than I'd like, but Kelly still owns ~1.7% of the company as of earlier this month, and the strategy so far has worked. That's not a guarantee the new plan will work, but it should give investors some confidence.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

He then says USA Mobility is under-earning its cost of capital as the return on capital and free cash flows continue to fall off.

15538,20130,2005-08-24T18:20:30-04:00,,"I purchased stock in USA Mobility (USMO/NASDAQ) yesterday. The shares closed at $26.34.
USA Mobility is a paging company formed in the merger of Arch Wireless and Metrocall in 2004. The stock hit a high of $39.75 last March, but sank as low as 24.02 in May. It has a market cap of $726 million and there are less than 30 million shares outstanding. It trades at 1.24 times book and at 1.16 times sales.
The company is not popular on Wall Street because the use of pagers has plunged due to the increasing use of cell phones. Still, there is a market for pagers because they are superior to cell phones in an important way -- they penetrate deep into buildings. They're also cheaper. The main users of pagers today are medical professionals, fire departments, the military and U.S. government agencies.
In Barron's midyear roundtable, Meryl Witmer of Eagle Capital pointed out a growth potential for the underused paging network. For example, a pager-type device could be installed on electric meters and send monthly messages to a utility company, eliminating the need for highly-paid union workers going from house to house in neighborhoods to read meters. She notes the use of such devices is just beginning.
USA Mobility's management is committed to returning cash to shareholders. The company paid off the remaining portion of its $140 million bank debt on Monday -- only 9 months after being created by the merger. In early August, the company announced it will pay a special one-time dividend near the end of the year. That's all it has said officially, but I am betting the company will pay out all (or nearly all) of its free cash for the next several years.
What could go wrong with this pick? Basically, that pager use declines faster than anticipated and revenue declines are so massive the balance sheet gets trashed. I don't think that will happen. When the company announced results for the second quarter of 2005, it reported significant improvement in subscriber losses and revenue declines. It had an impressive $5.15 in free cash flow per share as of 6/30/05.
But that's just one quarter. I could still always be wrong over the course of time. So, as always, do your own due diligence before buying.
PLEASE NOTE: Remember that USA Mobility has less than 30 million shares outstanding. So be sure to use a price limit if you place an order."

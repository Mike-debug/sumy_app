The world's leading music streaming company is currently trading at a ~20% discount from recent peaks after the company reported fiscal third-quarter results, interrupting a massive year-to-date rally that at one point had Spotify up nearly 2x for the year.Data by YChartsWhile it is true that Spotify's headlining third-quarter results missed expectations, I don't see any fundamentals at risk. Important to note is that the entirety of Spotify's misses were driven by unfavorable FX movements. The same headwind has dragged down all major European tech companies, including and especially SAP (SAP) - with the fall of the dollar against the Euro hurting reported revenues. Spotify's core metrics, however, including MAUs and premium subscribers, all trended smoothly.In my view, there's still a robust bullish thesis for Spotify, backed primarily by:In my view, Spotify is still sitting in the early stages of a very greenfield marketing opportunity - both in terms of content expansions as well as geographical territory expansions - that make it a worthwhile bet to buy on sharp dips. Take advantage of the post-earnings slide to initiate or build up a long position in this fantastic name.Let's now cover Spotify's most recent results in greater detail and pull apart the factors that caused (in my view, unnecessarily) the stock to plummet post-Q3. Take a look at the earnings highlights in the snapshot below:Figure 1. Spotify Q3 highlightsSource: Spotify Q3 earnings releaseSpotify's revenue grew 14% y/y to €1.98 billion. The good news is that this revenue accelerated ever so slightly from Q1's growth rate of 13% y/y; the bad news is that Wall Street had expected a slightly better result at €2.00 billion, or +15% y/y.Broadly speaking, there were three high-level themes that drove the business this quarter:Given that the first two tailwinds to the business were true fundamental drivers, and the latter is more of a macro driver over which Spotify has no control, I'm inclined to view Spotify's third-quarter results in a very positive light.Some more details that are helpful to flesh out in the results. Spotify noted that both Total MAUs and premium users exceeded the company's internal forecasts. In particular, Spotify benefited from North American user growth accelerating by 400bps, while developing markets also saw tremendous user growth - Latin America and Rest of World segments grew 30% y/y and 51% y/y, respectively. The latter was supported by very successful promotional activity in India (which, as most know, is the world's second-most populous country, only slightly behind China), which represents a huge market opportunity for Spotify as the middle class and access to popular technology continues to explode. Another big highlight for Spotify in the quarter: the company recently launched its services in July in Russia (the world's eight-largest country) to strong customer reception.Another possible future revenue driver for Spotify: alongside strong user growth, Spotify has recently tested a potential price increase. Streaming and entertainment companies have taken advantage of strong COVID-era demand to pass on some of the rising content costs to consumers; just last month, Netflix (NFLX) also raised the price of its standard plans. While Spotify hasn't solidified any price increases yet, the company believes its customer base could easily absorb one. Per CEO Daniel Ek's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:Another big highlight for Spotify this quarter is cash flow. Spotify continues to dramatically expand its cash flow, with FCF rising more than 2x this quarter to €103 million, reversing weakness earlier this year stemming from the decline in advertising rates. This is on top of a rock-solid balance sheet with €3.71 billion in cash and no debt - giving Spotify plenty of firepower to continue investing in content and podcasting to pull in more users.Spotify remains a strong growth play with several upside catalysts ahead: including launches in new markets, content expansion including podcasts, tertiary revenue opportunities in creating a marketplace business, and possible price increases for Premium. The recent ~20% dip from peaks represents a fantastic, well-timed entry point - investors should take advantage of the fall to buy."

But then, as competition entered the market, it precipitously lost and was acquired in 2019 below its original IPO price. Today, the music streaming business is even more competitive, and the current streaming music market leader could face a similar fate.With this cautionary tale in mind, fiduciaries should avoid the high risk of owning Spotify Technology (SPOT), this week’s Sell Idea.We first warned about Spotify in April 2018 and again in August 2018. Since our first report, the stock is up 63% while the S&P 500 is up just 28%. As the stock price rises, momentum investors may believe there is opportunity left in this stock. However, fiduciaries should beware of the risks in owning this stock:Spotify generates revenue from advertisements and subscriptions. Premium subscribers (or paid users of the service) generated 93% of Spotify’s revenue in 2Q20. Per Figure 1, the year-over-year (YoY) growth rate in premium subscribers has fallen sharply from 73% in 1Q17 to just 28% in 2Q20.Figure 1: Spotify’s YoY Change in Premium Subscribers Since 1Q16Spotify has seen a corresponding decline in its YoY revenue growth rate as its YoY premium subscriber growth rate has fallen. Compounded with slowing premium subscriber growth, Spotify’s average revenue per premium user (ARPU) has steadily declined from EUR 5.32 in 2017 to just EUR 4.41 in 2Q20. Spotify’s 2Q20 ARPU represents a 9% YoY decline.The combination of a slowing premium growth rate and falling ARPU has driven Spotify’s YoY revenue growth rate down from 57% in 2017 to 33% TTM. Per Figure 2, consensus estimates for Spotify’s revenue growth expect the decline to continue to just 18% YoY revenue growth in 2022.Figure 2: Spotify’s YoY Revenue Growth Since 2017*Consensus estimatesFirms such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), YouTube (owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL)), and more have recognized the large opportunity in audio streaming platforms. Competitors’ entrance into the market, along with their vast resources and marketing capabilities, coincide with Spotify losing market share. Per Figure 3, Spotify’s market share of the global streaming music subscription market fell from 36% in the first half of 2018 to 32% in 1Q20. Over the same time, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, and Tencent Music have all gained market share.Figure 3: Spotify and Peers’ Global Music Subscription Market ShareMidia ResearchWhen we look just at the U.S., Apple Music provides a perfect case study in how quickly competition can upend the music streaming market. Apple Music launched in 2015, and by 2018 overtook Spotify as the largest on-demand music streaming subscription platform in the U.S. While Spotify may have more users than Apple Music globally, Apple’s quick success in the U.S. market proves the competitive moat of Spotify’s business is not as strong as many believe.Our previous report noted how difficult it is for Spotify to grow its margins long term due to its dependency on just a few music labels known as the Big Three for much of its content. Anytime the labels think Spotify is earning too much money with their content, they can simply raise their royalty prices, which compresses Spotify’s margins.Case in point: in 2019, Spotify’s revenue increased 26% YoY while royalty payments increased by 30%. The YoY increase in royalty payments is up from the 20% YoY increase in 2018.Aside from margin pressure, there's another problem with not owning its content. Spotify is unable to differentiate itself from competitors who offer the exact same content. For example, Spotify offers more than 50 million songs in its catalog while Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music each offer 60 million songs. All of these services are heavily dependent on the Big Three labels for their content.In order to differentiate itself and take back some of its lost market share, Spotify is following in the footsteps of Netflix by offering exclusive content, an increasingly costly strategy that we’ve covered in the past. Spotify needs a critical mass or exclusive content to lure customers from competing platforms and pay premium prices.However, exclusive content deals risk eliminating one of Spotify’s advantages: The low amount the firm pays per stream. Spotify pays artists just $0.0032 per stream compared to Apple Music at $0.0056 and Amazon Music Unlimited at $0.012. As Spotify moves toward more exclusive content, it will have to pay more per stream or sign large capital intensive up-front deals, with no promise of future subscription growth.The firm already has spent more than $700 million to enter the podcast market by purchasing podcast networks such as The Ringer and signing the likes of Joe Rogan, DC Comics, Kim Kardashian, and the Obamas to exclusive podcast deals. In 1Q20 alone, Spotify launched 78 Originals and Exclusives podcasts to bring its podcast catalog to over one million, or about $700 per podcast.While proprietary podcast content may help the firm retain and attract more podcast listeners, it does not help with the remaining 79% of monthly active users (MAUs) that do not listen to podcasts.Making this strategy even riskier, exclusive content is no guarantee to grow market share. Ampere Analysis estimates Netflix’s share of the other-the-top subscription market, despite its massive investment in original content, has fallen from 52% in 2014 to 19% in 2019, and an estimated 18% in 2020.As the music streaming competition heats up, many other services also are focused on providing their users with exclusive content.Apple offers exclusive album releases from artists such as U2, Drake, Chance the Rapper, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry to draw users to its service. Apple Music also features Beats One radio, which offers exclusive shows hosted by popular artists.Apple also easily integrates Apple Music with iTunes libraries.The popular French streaming service, Deezer, has access to plenty of exclusive content as well. Deezer is owned by Access Industries which owns Warner Music Group, one of the Big Three music labels. Deezer Originals offers users special extended play records, podcasts, and videos.Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), which owns several streaming music services in China, offers original music and original video production. Tencent also is a partner in a music label with Sony Music Entertainment.Given the competitive forces detailed above, it may not surprise you that Spotify’s profits are trending in the wrong direction, despite revenue growing 34% compounded annually from 2016 to 2019. Spotify’s core earnings[1] fell from -$8 million in 2018 to -$292 million over the TTM. Spotify has generated a cumulative -$246 million in free cash flow (FCF) over the past three years.Figure 4: Spotify’s Revenue and Core Earnings Since 2016Spotify’s peer group includes other firms that provide subscription-based content services such as Apple, Alphabet, Tencent, Netflix, Amazon, and Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI).Spotify’s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) margin of -3% is worst among its peer group and is well below the market-cap-weighted peer group average NOPAT margin of 15%.The firm earns a bottom-quintile return on invested capital (ROIC) because it earns negative NOPAT and has negative invested capital.Figure 5: Spotify and Peers’ NOPAT Margin, Invested Capital Turns and ROICDespite facing significant competition, declining ARPU, and a costly exclusive content strategy, Spotify is priced as if it will quickly improve profitability while increasing its revenue beyond what even Netflix generated over the TTM.To justify its price at time of writing, Spotify must:See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario. In this scenario, Spotify’s revenue in 2026 would reach $27.2 billion, or 3.5 times greater than exclusive satellite radio provider Sirius XM’s 2019 revenue.In this scenario, Spotify’s implied revenue in 2026 equals 60% of MIDIA’s 2026 global streaming music revenue forecast of $45.3 billion and is actually 1.2 times greater than the $22.6 billion of revenue Netflix generated over the TTM. Achieving a 60% share of the global streaming music market is a very large expectation especially considering that the firm must do so in direct competition with large, established companies such as Apple, Google, and Amazon.Figure 6: Current Valuation Implies Huge Market Share GrowthMIDIA researchTo further illustrate the extraordinarily high growth expectations embedded in Spotify’s stock price, we compare Spotify’s implied premium subscribers to the paying subscribers of its competitors. By dividing the implied revenue in 2026 of $27.1 billion by the firm’s 2Q20 ARPU of ~$59, we arrive at ~459 million implied paying users in 2026.In other words, SPOT’s current valuation implies the company will grow its paying user base to more than 11 times Sirius XM’s, 7.5 times Apple Music’s, and two times Netflix’s.Figure 7: Spotify’s Implied 2026 Premium Subscribers vs. CompetitorsSpotify’s current economic book value, or no growth value, is -$13/share. But let’s see what the price looks like if we give the firm credit for being able to grow into a profitable enterprise.If we assume more realistic revenue and profit growth, SPOT still has significant downside.In this scenario, we assume Spotify will:See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario. In this scenario, Spotify grows NOPAT from -$50 million in 2019 to $1 billion in 2026, and the stock is worth just $93/share – a 62% downside.Figure 8 compares the firm’s implied future revenue in this scenario to its historical NOPAT.Figure 8: SPOT Has Large Downside Risk: DCF Valuation ScenarioEach of the above scenarios also assumes Spotify is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are.Often the largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk,” which means an acquirer comes in and buys Spotify at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. Given our analysis above, the only plausible justification for SPOT trading at such a high price is the expectation that another firm will buy it. Given the stock’s extremely high valuation, we think potential acquirers would be better off leaving Spotify alone, but stranger things have happened than firms being acquired at unnecessarily high premiums to their intrinsic value.Below, we quantify the high acquisition hopes that are priced into the stock.First, investors need to know that Spotify has large liabilities that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers would initially suggest.After adjusting for all liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. For this analysis, we chose The Walt Disney Company (DIS) as a potential acquirer of Spotify given Disney’s experience with creating exclusive content, history of acquisitions, and opportunity to bundle Spotify’s service with Disney+ and Hulu to create a one-stop streaming platform. While we chose Disney, analysts can use just about any company to do the same analysis. The key variables are the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and ROIC for assessing different hurdle rates for a deal to create value.Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, Spotify is worth less than its current share price.Figures 9 and 10 show what we think Disney should pay for Spotify to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. There are limits on how much Disney should pay for Spotify to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ""goal ROIC"" assuming different levels of revenue growth. In the first scenario, we use 25% revenue growth in year one, 22% in year two, and 18% in years three through five (equal to consensus estimates of 25% in 2020, 22% in 2021, and 18% in 2022). In the second scenario, we use a revenue growth rate of 25% in years one through five. We use the higher growth rate in scenario two to illustrate a best-case scenario where we assume Spotify could grow revenue faster while being integrated within Disney’s existing business.We optimistically assume that Disney can grow Spotify’s revenue and NOPAT without spending any working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also optimistically assume Spotify achieves a 9% NOPAT margin, which is above Spotify’s TTM margin of -3% and equal to Disney’s TTM margin of 9%.Figure 9: Implied Acquisition Prices for Value-Neutral DealFigure 9 shows the implied values for SPOT assuming Disney wants to achieve an ROIC on the acquisition that equals its WACC of 5%. This scenario represents the minimum level of performance required not to destroy value. Even if Spotify can grow revenue by 20% compounded annually for five years and achieve a 9% NOPAT margin, the firm is worth less than $242/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 5% ROIC would not be accretive, as the return on the deal would equal Disney’s WACC.Figure 10: Implied Acquisition Prices to Create ValueFigure 10 shows the implied values for SPOT assuming Disney wants to achieve an ROIC on the acquisition that equals 7% and is greater than its WACC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be accretive to Disney’s shareholders. Even in this best-case growth scenario, the implied value is far below Spotify’s current price. Without significant increases in the margin or revenue growth assumed in this scenario, an acquisition of SPOT at its current price destroys significant shareholder value.Spotify has missed earnings in four of the past 10 quarters. Should the firm have another earnings miss, shares could go lower.With faster growing competition, Spotify is in a difficult position to maintain its market leadership position. Should Spotify’s competitors such as Apple Music and YouTube Music take more of Spotify’s market share in the near future, investors may realize the tough road ahead for the firm and take their money elsewhere.With Apple’s recent announcement of its Apple One bundle, the streaming service market share may shift sooner than anticipated. While no specific date has been released, Apple will bundle its existing services, such as Apple Music, Apple TV, and iCloud at a cheaper rate than purchasing all three alone. The bundle could draw existing users of one of Apple’s services further into its ecosystem and away from Spotify if users determine the savings are worth the switch.These days, fewer investors pay attention to fundamentals and the red flags buried in financial filings. Instead, due to the proliferation of noise traders, the focus tends toward technical trading trends while high-quality fundamental research is overlooked. Here’s a quick summary for noise traders when analyzing SPOT:In addition to base salaries, each of Spotify’s executives have earned long-term equity incentive compensation. These long-term incentive awards are provided upon hire as well as during employment at the firm’s discretion.In 2019, Spotify established a new incentive mix program that allows its executives the ability to choose between a mix of cash, restricted share units (RSUs), and stock options. Each type of long-term incentive vests over a four-year period. All executives opted for either options or RSUs, thereby tying future compensation with the firm’s stock price.According to Spotify, its long-term incentive awards are designed to align a portion of its executives’ compensation to the interests of its shareholders. However, these awards have done little to create shareholder value. Spotify has generated negative economic earnings in each of the past four years.Instead of incentivizing executives to focus on the stock price, Spotify should link executive compensation with improving ROIC, which is directly correlated with creating shareholder value, so shareholders’ interests are properly aligned with executives’ interests.Insider trading information is not available for Spotify.There are currently 3 million shares sold short, which equates to 2% of shares outstanding and just over one day to cover. The number of shares sold short has decreased by 3% since last month.As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings as shown in the Harvard Business School and MIT Sloan paper,”Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence.”Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Spotify’s 6-Ks and 20-F:Income Statement: We made $803 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $159 million in non-operating expenses (2% of revenue). You can see all the adjustments made to Spotify’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $4.3 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $2.3 billion. One of the most notable adjustments was $300 million in asset write-downs. This adjustment represented 10% of reported net assets. You can see all the adjustments made to Spotify’s balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $5.8 billion of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by $1.3 billion.

4364252,103480,2020-08-04T14:08:09-04:00,"Shares of Spotify have sputtered after the company offered up a mixed Q2 earnings release.User growth remained strong, but revenue and cash flows slipped as expected as the deterioration of ad pricing weighed on Spotify's non-Premium business.Still, Spotify's momentum in the wake of the coronavirus has been strong, and the company has called out recovery in June.As the global leader in streaming and still valued at <4x forward revenues, Spotify still has plenty of room to run higher.","Spotify (SPOT), the global leader in music streaming, got its first major break this year in the markets as an entertainment-starved world gobbled up streaming services like Spotify in the wake of the coronavirus. Shares have risen ~70% this year, making up for years of flat performance since the 2018 direct listing (Spotify was one of the first major unicorns to go public in a so-called direct listing, which doesn't raise any capital or incur tremendous investment banking fees) - but recently the gains have stalled, especially after Spotify's mixed bag of Q2 results.The question for investors now is: does Spotify have room to run higher?Data by YChartsHeading into the current quarter, investors were keenly watching three things:In my view, we got positive answers in all three areas in Spotify's Q2 results, and even though Q2 itself was weighed down by ad weakness, the company has given us a line of sight to recovery by commenting that trends exiting Q2 in June were far stronger.Stepping back into the broader picture - I believe the temporary dip in shares is a good opportunity to buy into this incredible category leader that is both driving admirable user growth plus making steps toward profitability. I continue to view Spotify's purest-play comp as Netflix (NFLX), and despite the latter's slightly stronger gross margin profile (after accounting for Netflix's huge content costs, its gross margins sit somewhere in the ~30s, versus the mid 20s for Spotify), Spotify's current valuation at roughly half of Netflix's revenue multiple continues to be attractive.Data by YChartsStay long here and use any near-term pullback to expand your position.Let's now dive into Spotify's second-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings highlights are shown below:Figure 1. Spotify Q2 highlightsSource: Spotify Q2 earnings release Let's now address each of the key watch items in turn.On user trends: as can be seen above, Spotify continued to see tremendous growth in its users, despite its already-dominant position as the largest music streamer in the world. Spotify's total MAUs grew 29% y/y to 299 million in Q4, adding 13 million net-new users barely decelerating from Q1's 31% y/y growth and net-new 15 million adds. In addition, Spotify managed to add 8 million new Premium subscribers, up 27% y/y (more than 6 million net-new adds in Q4).Some investors worried that Q1's user growth strength was partially due to the early onset impacts of the coronavirus. But now as we've seen in the second quarter, Spotify continues to add users at a steady pace.Spotify's guidance (which historically tends toward the conservative side) also tells a story of continued strength. For Q3, the company is forecasting up to 6 million net-new Premium adds and for Q4, up to 9 million more (I'm using the upper end of each of Spotify's subscriber guidance ranges because historically, Spotify has always landed either at the top end or above it. In Q2, for example, Spotify had guided to 133-138 million net adds and actualized at 138 million).Figure 2. Spotify guidance updateSource: Spotify Q2 earnings releaseEqually important is the fact that Spotify didn't make any commentary about Q1/Q2's strength being due to a pull-in of future user growth - unlike Netflix, which in its most recent earnings release guided to way below-market expectations for Q3 subscriber adds of 2.5 million because much of its Q1/Q2 strength represented demand pulled in from future quarters.Now moving onto advertising trends. There's not much of a positive spin on this story for Q2, although much of this weakness was expected. Globally, most internet advertising companies have suffered from a 15-20% decline in ad pricing. Spotify was no different, and ad-supported revenues fell -21% y/y in Q2 (versus 17% y/y growth in Q1), bringing down Spotify's total revenue growth to 13% y/y (nine points weaker than Q1's 22% y/y growth).The bright side, however, lies in Spotify's commentary around recovery. It has been helpful when management comments on monthly linearity trends throughout the coronavirus, and Spotify's CFO Paul Vogel noted on the Q&A portion of the earnings call that June ad revenues showed a massive improvement to early Q2. Per his remarks:This gives us hope that by Q4, we might see normalization in the ad business. The company is also rolling out ""Streaming Ad Insertion"" technology to U.S.-based advertisers this summer that should help to stimulate marketer demand.Finally, on tertiary revenue opportunities. I already highlighted in a prior article that Spotify's podcasting arm had signed a deal with Omnicom to place up to $20 million in ads in the second half of 2020. Spotify also highlighted increased podcast engagement within its install base (leading to further monetization potential for this segment), with 21% of its MAUs now active on podcasts versus 19% in Q1. Spotify is also continuing to add highly anticipated and brand-name content - in addition to the high profile Joe Rogan show that will debut in September, the company has launched a ""Harry Potter At Home"", a sort of audiobook reading done by famous actors including Daniel Radcliffe, interlaced with other interactive content. And on the marketplace side, Spotify noted that since Q1, the number of content creators using Spotify For Artists and Sponsored Recommendations grew 37% y/y, giving Spotify additional access to monetization opportunities outside of subscription fees and advertising revenues.Of course, Q2 was hardly a perfect quarter for Spotify - especially considering the hit to ad revenues, the sharp deceleration in revenue growth (coupled with stronger FX headwinds), and the associated decline in cash flows. However, I'd encourage investors to still judge Spotify based on the strength of its user growth - and with Spotify adding 8 million new Premium users in this quarter alone ($960 million in annual revenues, assuming the standard $10/month pricing) and with plans to add up to 15 million more through year-end, I'm still incredibly bullish on Spotify's future. Stay long here."

Despite the bull run, it is still a great stock to hold. I highlight three reasons why Spotify has yet to achieve its full potential.SourceConsidering an investment in this uncertain environment is not an easy task. The economy and the stock market have rebounded quickly, but they are still standing up on shaky legs. The main reason of worry for both bull and bears is obviously the coronavirus. A second wave could be soon underway, and fear will start building up again as soon as the common cold and flu symptoms begin in the fall. In this environment, the best stocks to hold are the ones that can easily withstand lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, and grow even faster thanks to them. During the past few months, Spotify has proven to be one of them. In Q1 the pandemic had minimal impact on Spotify. The biggest detrimental effect of Covid-19 was on Ad-Supported revenues, which still grew by 17% YoY. Revenue maintained solid growth of +22% YoY to €1.85 billion. Before the pandemic outbreak and related advertising cuts, revenues were on track to outperform the company's forecast. As the economy slowly reopens and companies' advertising budgets return, I expect the Ad-revenue segment to pick up where it left before the crisis.In the long term, Spotify is well-positioned to benefit from the revived spending trends. In the short term, the decline in ad-revenue is not significant, as the company relies only marginally (9%) on advertising revenue.Spotify had a massive user base at the end of Q1, amounting to 130 million users. Spotify users growth historical rate is an average of 7% per quarter over the last 4 quarters. Growth is expected to continue if not accelerate in Q2, as early data following the stay-at-home have shown that consumption of Spotify’s product increases significantly in such a scenario. In the last earnings call, Spotify could show off an impressive 50% increase in listening rates across various segments (e.g. smart TVs, Speakers, Gaming Consoles).A big catalyst for growth is the new podcasts acquisitions of Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian and DC Comics. The timescale of these deals will mean an accelerated trend in user growth, which will start picking up pace by the end of this year and reach its peak at the beginning of 2021. At the beginning of the new year, the Joe Rogan podcast will become exclusive to Spotify. Kim Kardashian and the DC Comics podcast series starting dates were not officially disclosed, but should probably air by early 2021. These podcasts can count on a loyal follower base that will migrate to the Spotify platform, and will likely stick with it according to Spotify's low active cancellations.Think about where the world is headed, the future is digital and subscription-based. Radio is slowly dying, and forecasts predict it will cease existence in around 10 years' time. Digital services are changing the way people listen to music, and Spotify is at the forefront of this historical shift. Spotify is the business with the highest number of paying subscribers only after Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which counts about 180+ million subscribers, while the third place is occupied by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, with 112+ million subscribers. Spotify is practically unchallenged in Europe, while its biggest competitor in America is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which struggles to expand its services to non-iOS users. At this stage, its large user base and the lack of tangible competition for a global music platform suggest that Spotify will maintain its leadership at least for the next 5 years, also considering that the user base and the business are still growing fast going into 2021.Now that the business is shifting its focus to podcasts, their exponential growth could go hand-in-hand with Spotify consumption rates and revenues. In fact, podcast consumption grew by triple-digits during the quarter compared to last year. Moreover, podcasts represent an opportunity to expand Spotify’s video platform, which could include a mix between exclusive and non-exclusive podcast video (and in the future probably more) from which users can search, navigate and discover new content just like Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube.Once its video platform takes form, it will become serious competition for a slice of YouTube's market. This has already started with the JRE podcast, with which Spotify took from the competitor about 3 million daily views.Those screaming at Spotify’s high valuation see the company as a digital aggregator of record labels. This causes them to focus on the Music segment’s margins and scalability. However, some fail to realise how Spotify is transforming by expanding into original Podcasts and Video. Spotify’s well-established music business gives the company stability and a strong user base, which can, in turn, be exploited to expand its business and revenue in these more profitable segments.Spotify will generate positive free cash flow during the rest of the year, it has no debt and €1.8 billion in cash at the end of Q1. The company is in a very healthy financial position, and the growth it is achieving is building on a strong financial base. A P/S of 6.2 is very low compared to similar subscriber-based businesses such as Netflix, which has almost double the ratio at 11.5 P/S.SourceA solid business, financially healthy and with significant upside potential. Looking at where consumer behaviour is going, I’m quite confident Spotify will be a big part in the future of our society. It is a great stock to own for the next 5 years, and the recent run-up could be just the beginning.If you found this article of value, please follow (near the title) and/or press ""Like this article"" just below."

The recent strike of deals has increased Spotify’s market cap of more than $10 billion, but the potential for the company remains bigger than ever.(Source)As expected, the recent $100 million deal with Joe Rogan for his JRE podcast was only one of a long list that is set to develop. Following the JRE deal, Spotify has continued to acquire more artists and popular personalities. Top of the list is Kim Kardashian, who will join Spotify exclusive podcast list with a podcast covering current national topics of interest, including the Innocence Project. Kim Kardashian has a strong following on all major social media platforms. She is ranked 7th on Instagram with 176 million followers, and her overall follower on all social media exceed 250 million. Not bad numbers, considering that Spotify's total subscription numbers are in the 130-150 million range. Another significant partnership was struck with Warner Bros. (T) and DC Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. DC Entertainment houses franchises like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and more. If you recognize these characters’ names you would certainly realize the big potential of this deal to attract one of the largest and most loyal fan bases of the entertainment business.Spotify has inked a multi-year deal to produce and distribute an original slate of scripted podcasts, both dramatic and comedic, centred on the DC universe.Investors seem to have started to realize this stock’s potential, and shares have gone up 30% after the announcement. Joe Rogan and his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE), accumulated over 2.8 billion views over its 11-year existence, with the majority of it coming in more recent years. Kim Kardashian brings in ever more potential, having a much larger fan base. Kim Kardashian counts 176 million followers on Instagram alone, and 65 million on Twitter, making her the 12th most-followed Twitter account. DC comics can count on 6+ million followers on its main Facebook page, and many more followers can be found on the pages of the individual characters in the DC universe.According to the previous methodology, the JRE could generate ~$20 million a year in profits from ads only, while potentially bringing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to Spotify’s platform. Similar numbers could be achieved by Kim Kardashian and DC. Kim Kardashian has the biggest potential in term of ad revenues due to the larger fan base, while DC will bring long-term subscribers to the Spotify platform due to the expected high frequency of episodes and a new type of podcast storytelling.Looking at the three deals, you can see the big picture that the company is trying to paint. The portfolio includes three very different podcasts that attract three different customer segments. Joe Rogan’s podcast attracts mostly men due to its ties with the UFC, a mixed martial arts organization. Kim Kardashian will offer a diverse, female-centric audience. Lastly, DC superheroes will appeal to a more family-friendly type of audience. Therefore, Spotify seems to have established a strong presence in all market segments, and it is now attracting customers to its platform from all fronts.Looking at the option-implied price, a short-term decline seems to be expected, while a 3-month price of $280 could be achieved with moderate probability. The stock has risen exponentially, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it test the $210s level again. The low $200s could be a good entry point for investors new to the stock, while I consider it a Strong Buy below $200.(Source: OptionsSay)Spotify has just started on its road to success.

That said, I can't buy the stock for two reasons:I'm an avid Spotify user. It provides, by far, the best user experience of all audio entertainment options.I love Sirius XM (SIRI), but its app, across platforms, remains one of the worst. I'm not quite sure what happened at Pandora. Even before Sirius XM acquired it, the quality of its algorithm was degrading. When you compare it to Spotify and the Pandora of a few years ago, Pandora is almost unlistenable. Meantime, Spotify appears to be doing everything right. Source: Florian KoppeAs I explained in a recent Seeking Alpha article, I consider Spotify a service, platform, and ecosystem all in one: In other words, you rarely need to leave Spotify. If I didn't enjoy a handful of channels on Sirius XM so much, I would use Spotify exclusively for music and infotainment. For a solid quantitative assessment of the company, see Gary Alexander's recent Seeking Alpha article, Spotify: Still A Long Runway Ahead. It's a clear and to-the-point analysis focused on user growth and advertising. At the moment, the former is strong, the latter weak. But that's to be expected amid a global pandemic. Spotify is doing everything right to build an ecosystem that:I wrote about the last point on Medium in Musicians Are Mad At Spotify. Not everything about that issue applies to the investment case, but much of it does, particularly the brilliance of Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. In the shell of a nut, Ek recently made the argument that some musicians who were successful under the bygone album sales model will not be successful now and into the future if they don't adapt to change. This includes not merely working harder, but working smarter by releasing new music more often and better engaging with fans. As expected, the usual suspects lashed out at Ek. Here's some of what I said about that:We have been having the same argument since these very same musicians routinely targeted Pandora co-founder Tim Westergren. It's instructive to look back to the landscape I wrote about nearly six years ago on Seeking Alpha:Streaming services have tried every approach - from kind and gentle to borderline arrogant and abrasive - to get artists, particularly the small, independent ones who need the most help, on board. Nothing has worked.And I think I know why.Most musicians lack business savvy. They want to sit back, practice their art, and get paid for it. They can't be bothered or don't know how to take innovative approaches to be heard, see success, and have a shot at making money. And there's also the question of being good in enough people's eyes to develop a large enough audience to generate monetary rewards. That's just the cold, hard reality. Many musicians don't want to hear it. It's not in their DNA to acknowledge, accept, and aggressively adapt to this new reality. They don't understand the story, but, increasingly, it appears investors do. Spotify has created an ecosystem with space for everyone - the listener, the advertiser, the mega superstar, and the unknown independent artist with the talent, drive, and creative/intellectual capacity to build a following. That's an all-encompassing story, which is why I compare Spotify to Amazon.com and Google. I don't think the comparisons require explanation. You can come to the obvious conclusions on your own. It took me a while, but I finally figured it out. I can be an emotional investor. I think a lot. And I also make bold predictions. When you make bold predictions, you're wrong a lot. See my history on Netflix (NFLX). I won't even link to it! As a result, I have learned to section off my writing and investing.A vast majority of both now focus on dividend growth investing.It's so much more fun, satisfying, and useful to see convivial and informative comments sections follow articles than the adversarial ones that tend to follow combative, bold prediction articles.From an investing perspective, focusing on dividend stocks and dividend reinvestment has done wonders for my portfolio and psychological health. I'm simply not calm when I'm in high-flying, often-volatile, battleground stocks. I'll sacrifice potential gains there for the relative piece of mind of buying more AT&T (T) every month. That's one core reason why I can't buy Spotify. There's a decent chance I'm wrong about the company's future. And, even if I'm right about the company's future, the stock price might not follow. Investors have to be able to, like they did to a lesser extent with Amazon, follow the story and strategy while shrugging off losses and viewing massive investments as positive. We like to think that party will go on forever, but there are no guarantees. To that end, Spotify doesn't pay a dividend. Obviously.I have set a rule for myself: Don't buy a stock unless it pays a (relatively stable and reliable) dividend. That's not because dividend stocks are inherently safer. That's not the case. You can get in as much trouble chasing yield as you can a high flyer. By setting this rule for myself and sticking to it I effectively resist the urge of jumping into stocks I'm not emotionally cut out to own. I'd much rather get paid to own a stock and watch the raw power of incremental buys and dividend reinvestment than wonder what I should do after a double-digit drop in stock price."
4353118,105400,2020-06-10T14:14:01-04:00,"Spotify has steady revenue growth going into the year due to its strong platform and personalized recommendations for customers.The company's data engine has been powering a flywheel effect for its music platform, with more customers leading to more data and better music recommendations.Potential investors would have to pay a 4.36x price-to-sales multiple for the company, which appears to be fairly cheap compared to the highs of its trading range in the past.","Spotify (SPOT) has steady revenue growth going into the year due to its strong platform and personalized recommendations for customers. The company's data engine has been powering a flywheel effect for its music platform, with more customers leading to more data and better recommendations. Potential investors would have to pay a 4.36x price-to-sales multiple for the company, which appears to be fairly cheap compared to the highs of its trading range in the past 5 years. Despite some risks navigating through the current uncertainty, Spotify has a strong financial position to withstand any revenue shocks.Spotify is the world's leading music streaming service provider. The company has transformed the music industry by allowing users to move from buying and owning music to allowing users to stream music on demand. Their business model currently involves both premium and ad-supported services.But music distribution is generally a commoditized business. Any player with a large amount of resources can enter the space, build a large library of music, and offer the same music streaming service to customers. What sets Spotify apart is its music discovery service. Customers around the world trust Spotify to recommend them music that they would not have discovered on their own.With more people listening to music, Spotify can enhance its recommendation algorithms and provide customers with a music selection that closely meets their preferences. This generates a flywheel effect, as the improved algorithms lead to better customer retention. Furthermore, better service for existing customers will likely lead to more new customers from referrals. Spotify has also been expanding its music library, which attracts users to its platform. The large user base will attract more artists to publish their music on Spotify's platform.Spotify's financials have also been strong, with monthly active users and premium subscribers increasing 31% year-on-year. The company's total revenue also grew 22% from 1.5B euros to 1.8B euros.Spotify has been investing aggressively in podcasts, which has been paying off. 19% of the company's total monthly active users with podcast content, up from 16% in Q4 2019, and consumption continues to grow at triple-digit rates year-on-year. There are now more than 1 million podcasts available on Spotify's platform and they launched 78 Originals & Exclusives podcasts globally in the first quarter.The investment in Podcasts is likely to play out well in the long term once the company becomes the market leader. If Spotify becomes the dominant platform for podcast listeners, content creators have very little incentive to shift their podcasts elsewhere. This would increase the quantity of high-quality podcasts on Spotify, which increases the engagement of Spotify customers to its platform. The company is still in the early stages of this development, but the potential for monetization is huge.We expect Spotify will achieve sales growth of roughly 20% over the next 10 years, driven by customer retention, new user growth, and increased ad-inventory. With a larger portion of sales driven by future podcast ads, Spotify should experience an expansion of gross margins from 25% to roughly 35%. The company has not been profitable, but we expect Spotify to drive efficiencies across its business as execution improves. As such, the company's operating margins should expand to roughly 15% over the next 10 years.The largest risk for Spotify would be competition, as companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) may become more aggressive to grow its listeners. These larger companies do not rely on music to drive profitability and monetize users via other services. This increases the competitive pressure against Spotify for it to innovate beyond streaming music.The music industry also faced multiple disruptions over the years, with shifts from cassettes to CDs to downloads. Spotify might be the current leader in music distribution but a technological innovation might render the company obsolete. Spotify has been addressing this risk by diversifying its content to podcasts, which we believe provides stronger long-term prospects.Joe Rogan recently signed a blockbuster $100M deal to move his podcast exclusively to Spotify. Besides this deal, Spotify has been investing aggressively in building out its original podcast content. The good news is that the company has $1B in cash with no debt. Spotify also expects its free cash flow to be positive for the year. Hence, the company has enough funds to sustain its current operations and invest in its podcasts business.(Source: Q1 Investor Letter)(Source: Annual Report)With the more than 60% run-up since March, Spotify's price might appear to be overvalued to some. But based on its past 5 years' trading range of 2.78 to 6 price-to-sales ratio, the current price-to-sales ratio of 4.36 appears to be a good price for investors looking to build up a position in this company.(Source: Seeking Alpha)Spotify has built a personalization music brand with a strong algorithm engine that appeals to customers' listening preferences. The company has also been investing in its podcasts business to diversify away from the volatile music industry. Despite risks from the competition, Spotify should be able to carve out a decent chunk of the market for itself due to multiple network and flywheel effects."

Since it came out, I have been a consistent subscriber and loved every minute I have spent discovering new artists, listening to podcasts, or just cruising around accompanied by the various playlists I have created over the years. Even as I am writing this article, my friend's playlist filled with synth waves and electronic beats is keeping me good company. Overall, I feel like the platform has become too integrated into my life, as it's hard to remember when the last day was that I didn't listen to at least a couple of my favorite albums.Image by Fredrik Solli WandemIf you have been reading articles here on Seeking Alpha, you may have heard the common advice to invest in businesses that you understand and, even better, whose products/services you use and are familiar with. Investing in businesses whose operations you cannot understand well, and, therefore, not track their performance adequately could lead to thoughtless investing decisions.Following this guideline myself (admittedly not always), I have been investing in multiple businesses I am a user/customer of, such as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Visa (V) & MasterCard (MA), and several others, of course.When Spotify IPO'd back in 2018, though, I could not get excited enough to allocate any money on its shares. The company was not profitable, and I felt there was little to no margin of safety. Today, the stock has more than doubled from last year's lows, as management seems to be doing all the right things, rapidly growing the company and acquiring content. Apparently, I was wrong avoiding the stock. At the same time, the more shares rally, the least I seem to be able to justify their valuation.In this article, let's go over Spotify's growth and prospects while taking into account its current valuation, to assess whether shares are currently investable.Spotify's success in the music streaming industry was apparent from early on, as the company had all the right ingredients. Being available and promoted towards all platforms, Spotify didn't limit itself in terms of its user base, which has been a massive growth catalyst. I am an iPhone user myself, but I enjoy Spotify's smoother compatibility with my other devices, such as my desktop and smartTV, so Apple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL) won't do it for me. Further, Spotify's offering of ad-supported streaming has helped it increase its popularity by not setting a must-have subscription barrier to check out and let users familiarise themselves with the platform.As a result, Spotify's Monthly Active Users have been rapidly growing on a quarterly basis, with the last five years showcasing an MAU CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of around 31%. Apple Music has been gaining increasingly more subscribers too. However, I believe that users of both services are highly unlikely to migrate, as they adapt themselves with their respective service, having created playlists, shared music with friends, etc. In the long run, both services can co-exist, though Spotify's initiatives, like Group Sessions, should give it an advantage, as it appropriates the network effects of its massive, cross-platform user base.Further, according to the company's guidance, MAU growth should show no signs of a slowdown, growing at around 5% QoQ in Q3 and Q4, which indicates substantial growth ahead.Source: Earnings releaseHowever, growth in users doesn't necessarily mean an equal outlook for the company's bottom line. When it comes to Spotify's business model, it's important to remember that the company operates a platform and that all of the content (besides Spotify's acquired one) is owned by somebody else, who is getting paid their royalties constantly.As a result of its cost of revenues, primarily being royalties, the company's gross margins have been stuck at around 25%, which is unlikely to change. Margins are unlikely to increase with economies of scale (more subscribers), as growing users directly means equally more streams, and hence royalties paid out.It's notable to note that premium users' gross margin is around 28%. However, this figure is dragged down by the ad-supported users' gross margin, which was (11.9)% in Q2, down from (6.6)% in Q1. Spotify's freemium side is a great way to popularise the service, utilize its network effects, and potentially turn these users into subscribers. In the meantime, though, ad revenues are not enough to cover for Spotify's corresponding expenses (e.g., royalties), hence losing money on every ad-supported user.Considering that music labels have no reason to negotiate against themselves, it is highly doubtful that Spotify's cost of revenues will decrease any time soon. Even with improved ad revenues, which could potentially break even, Spotify's gross margins are not to breach the 30% threshold at any point in the future.Gross margins are not necessarily low at these levels. However, Spotify's additional operating expenses, as well as growing content acquisition costs, should leave no room for positive net income margins in the medium term. But, it's all about the growth, right? So, let's examine the company's future potential revenues and try to assess whether its projected figures somewhat justify its current price.Since the company's pricing is to remain constant, close to its competitors, and its user growth follows a constant trend, Spotify's future revenues are relatively easy to estimate. As a result, analyst estimates' low and high turnover range points are quite narrow. Considering that Q2's MAU growth YoY was around 28%, a prudent revenue growth estimate (and hence user growth estimate) of around 20%, on average, in the medium term, is quite reasonable, as it assumes decent deceleration over time.Source: Seeking AlphaAssuming 2025's midrange revenue guidance of ~$21B, at a modest net income margin of, say 12%, the company would earn $2.52B. At its current valuation of $44.1B ($224.9/share), the stock is currently trading at 17.5 times its potential 2025 earnings, assuming it manages to achieve such margins.Is the valuation absurd? Not fundamentally. Amazon earned around $2.3B in 2016. Similarly, in its 2011's capitalization of ~80B, the company was priced at 34 times its 2026 earnings. Did Amazon end up being a bad investment during these years? Of course, not. I believe that the market is pricing Spotify the same way. Although the two companies are not quite comparable, it goes to show that a current, seemingly high valuation, may be able to justify its future earnings expectations. At the same time, I can't get convinced enough to buy shares due to their lack of margin of safety. In other words, in line with analysts, if Spotify achieved an FY2025 EPS of $4.56, based on the stock's current price, here are the potential investor returns under various valuation scenarios:Essentially, for investors to see any meaningful annualized returns, it would have to be that Spotify's 2025 P/E ratio remains sky-high at a figure of 80+. Should the market price shares to a more reasonable multiple of, say 50, investors buying at the stock's current price are unlikely to see any returns.Source: AuthorI am confident that Spotify can achieve its financial metrics expectations, as its revenue growth can be quite predictable. However, I am not comfortable buying stock in hopes that future investors are willing to pay a sky-high multiple for my shares, for me to see a noteworthy return. Finally, the company's margins will always be subject to an equally increasing amount of royalty expenses, which means that exponential profitability growth due to scaling, through more users, is highly unlikely. This is important since, with that in mind, a future valuation multiple around 50 is more reasonable than one of 80+. But in that case, current investors are looking towards little to no returns.Maybe I am wrong, and about to lose further potential gains, similarly to losing some during the stock's prolonged rally. Still, Spotify's risk/reward ratio doesn't seem right, in my view. Hence, I will pass on its shares for now."
4351884,38961,2020-06-04T03:39:11-04:00,"Spotify is the dominant leader in audio streaming from an engagement standpoint.The Freemium offering is a subsidy program that offsets the costs of acquiring new premium subscribers.Having older cohorts with lower churn rates, Spotify is advantaged over the competition.","My thesis is that Spotify (SPOT) has a bright future as the leader in streaming music. Having 130 million premium subscribers and 286 million monthly active users (MAUs), per the 1Q20 shareholder letter, it are by far the biggest streaming music company and is still expanding rapidly. At the March 2018 Investor Day, CEO Daniel Ek said the freemium offering, ubiquity across platforms and personalization are three key strengths fundamental to growth. These strengths remain important today as the company continues expanding. In the 1Q18 earnings call, CEO Ek said the company is concentrating on growth as opposed to margins right now:Spotify reports its financials in euros, and the exchange rate is pretty close to the U.S. dollar such that the euro is slightly more valuable. At the time of this article submission, $1 equals €0.90.The Platform and Marketplace Video from the March 2018 Investor Day shows that Spotify had a 42% share of global streaming music in 2016. The February 2020 S-1 for Warner Music Group (WMG) shows that Spotify represented 14% of its total revenues for the 2018 and 2019 periods. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) represented 15% for the 2018 period and 13% for the 2019 period. The Warner S-1 goes on to say that revenues from streaming services were $1,733 million and $2,129 million for 2018 and 2019, respectively, while overall revenues were $4,005 million and $4,475 million, respectively. Therefore, Spotify was 32% of streaming revenues in 2018 [1] and 29% in 2019 [2]. Apple was 35% in 2018 [3] and 27% in 2019 [4].[1] (0.14*$4,005 million)/$1,733 million = 32% of 2018 streaming for Spotify.[2] (0.14*$4,475 million)/$2,129 million = 29% of 2019 streaming for Spotify.[3] (0.15*$4,005 million)/$1,733 million = 35% of 2018 streaming for Apple.[4] (0.13*$4,475 million)/$2,129 million = 27% of 2019 streaming for Apple.These percentages of streaming revenues are much more meaningful than the percentages of overall revenues because streaming is the future. The percentages for Spotify at this particular label are down from the overall 2016 percentage, but the streaming market is vastly larger now and Spotify is growing rapidly.Counterpoint market research shows that Spotify led the global music paid subscription market in 2019 with 35% brand share:Image Source: Counterpoint market researchThe 2019 figure of 350 million global market paid subs from Counterpoint is large given the February 2020 Warner Music S-1 figures of 176 million and 255 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively, which it cites from IFPI. Again, Spotify had 130 million paid subscriptions at the end of 1Q20. An April AppleInsider article states that Apple Services Chief Eddy Cue said the company passed 60 million subscribers back in June 2019. In January, Amazon (AMZN) announced it had over 55 million music customers. Looking at the number of users alone doesn’t tell us everything about Spotify’s dominant position. The company is even further ahead of the competition when we look at the full picture by considering engagement. CFO Paul Vogel explains at the November 2019 RBC Capital Markets Global Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications [TIMT] Conference:At the March 2018 Investor Day, then CFO McCarthy showed that once a company like Spotify has a lead with paid subscribers, it is very difficult for competitors to catch up. This is further explained in the valuation part of this article.The world is slowly changing, and artists are thinking twice about signing away lifetime rights. MIDiA Research says artists without record labels were responsible for $873 million, or 4.1% of the $21.5 billion global recorded music market in 2019. This is the fastest-growing segment of the market, as it was just 1.7% in 2015. Led by Vivendi’s (VIVEF) Universal Music, the “big three” labels accounted for 67.5% of the 2019 market. In my view, the most tenuous part of Spotify’s relationship with the labels was in the past. The labels are still very powerful, but time is on Spotify’s side, as much of the catalogs are aging and the labels depend on Spotify to reach younger listeners. 72% of Spotify’s MAUs are younger than age thirty-five, and the December 2019 New York Times interview with Jimmy Iovine shows that recent music is in high demand when Iovine says an artist like Drake or Billie Eilish streams more than the entire decade of the 1980s.Spotify is by far the most important music channel, so it follows that the big labels have positive things to say about streaming in general and Spotify in particular. Spotify relies on Vivendi’s Universal Music Group [UMG], Sony Music (SNE) and Warner Music for most of its music, and it is in everyone’s best interest to continue working together rationally with win-win relationships, seeing as both the labels and Spotify serve artists. Piracy hit the music industry hard years ago, and the Vivendi 2019 Annual Report says that after over a decade of decline, the music sector began to recover in 2015 due to streaming platforms like Spotify. They state that music consumption has shifted from an ownership model to a streaming access model that includes subscription and ad-supported plans. Sony Music Holdings CEO Rob Stringer talks about Spotify’s importance at the November 2019 Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference, specifically mentioning support for Spotify going into India. The February 2020 Warner S-1 says the rapid growth of streaming has transformed the music industry, and it reveals we’re still in the early stages. Spotify started in Sweden, and the Warner S-1 reveals that many geographies still lag Nordic countries in streaming.The February 2020 S-1 for Warner Music shows how global streaming revenue has been key for the music industry from 2015 to 2018, as it helps take the place of the vestigial physical revenue. The 2019 IFPI Global Music Report notes that streaming revenue for the global recorded music industry continued growing, from $9.2 billion in 2018 to $11.4 billion in 2019:Image Source: Warner Music February 2020 S-1Chief Premium Business Officer Alex Norström talks about the free experience being the biggest growth driver at the 1:32:00 mark of the March 2018 Investor Day. The freemium offering acts as a funnel into premium, and more than 60% of premium users were free users first. At the time of the presentation, he noted that none of the company's major competitors had a free product like Spotify. He explains the freemium flywheel at the 1:37:30 mark of the presentation:The visual at the 1:38:05 mark of the Investor Day sums up the freemium cycle described above:Image Source: March 2018 Investor DayAt the 1:54:00 point of the March 2018 Investor Day, then CFO McCarthy revealed it wasn’t until he had an operating role that he realized the impact of the freemium model. It is a subsidy program that offsets the subscriber acquisition cost (SAC):Image Source: March 2018 Investor DayThe 1Q18 earnings call talks about the fact that the freemium model brings in younger demographics and the February 2018 F-1 shows 86% of the monthly active users (MAUs) are under 45 years old:Image Source: Spotify February 2018 F-1Spotify is a software company with a clear focus on streaming audio, and it wants to be everywhere! Focusing on the hardware within its ecosystem, Apple has to work vigorously to acquire Android (GOOG, GOOGL) users. Amazon is focused on retailing, and its presence in some markets is limited. For example, MercadoLibre (MELI) is the dominant online marketplace in Latin America, and Amazon doesn’t have the same presence there that it does in the U.S. Ubiquity across all platforms is stressed by Chief Research & Development Officer Gustav Söderström at the March 2018 Investor Day, and this is realistic for Spotify given the company's engineering expertise and its clear focus on streaming audio:Personalization builds deeper engagement and brings about demand creation. In October 2016, then Chief Economist Will Page gave testimony to the US Copyright Royalty Board explaining the ways in which Spotify is changing the future of music with personalized discovery capabilities:Given the way in which Spotify brings about discovery capabilities and demand, an argument can be made that in the future the company shouldn’t have to pay such high for royalties compared to streaming radio and terrestrial radio:Image Source: October 2016 Testimony from Spotify’s Former Director of Economics, Will PagePushing out new content, terrestrial radio plays low royalties. But the world is changing such that discovery is now coming from Spotify’s personalized playlists. After giving the testimony above, former Chief Economist Page went on to explain the success of Discover Weekly, noting that about 40% of MAUs had used it, and of that 40%, more than half of the group listened to ten or more of the weekly suggested tracks and saved at least one. Former Chief Economist Page goes on to make powerful statements implying that royalties from promotional playlists should be lower than royalties from user-chosen songs on demand:Chief Research & Development Officer Gustav Söderström made a key point just before the 35-minute mark of the March 2018 Investor Day saying Spotify is in the game of discovery, while others seem to be in the game of access.CEO Daniel Elk talks about discovery just after the 1-hour mark of the March 2018 Investor Day saying over 30% of consumption comes from music that Spotify suggests:Image Source: March 2018 Investor DayCFO Paul Vogel explains Wrapped at the March 2020 Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference. It is a year-end summary for each user. As we said earlier, Spotify has much more engagement than competitors and much more data. They use world-class engineering resources to make use of this data advantage and further the product. Each user gets a customized summary at the end of the year based on his or her listening, showing top songs, artists and more.We can’t realistically value Spotify without understanding its long-term approach outlined at the March 2018 Investor Day by then CFO McCarthy. Noting that growth investments have pressured operating margins, he says this will continue because investing in growth increases the enterprise value. He points out that scale can enable margin expansion, especially if accompanied by a better user interface, a better content experience and demand creation. It wasn’t until former CFO McCarthy had an operating role that he realized the ad-supported freemium service is a subsidy program that offsets the costs of acquiring new subs. As far as growth investments go, former CFO McCarthy says a better user experience produces the most viral effect over geographic expansion and marketing spending. Tech and dev investments improve the user experience and increase engagement. Over time, the improved user experience has increased engagement. And engagement is key, as it drives conversion from free consumption to paid subscription. This Investor Day slide shown by then CFO McCarthy shows that engagement has increased:Image Source: March 2018 Investment DayThe 2018 20-F shows that there were 26 content hours per MAU per month for 4Q18, which was a 5% increase from the 25 hours during 4Q17 in the slide above. The 20-F also notes that premium subscribers have historically streamed more than three times the amount of ad-supported users and that half of MAUs become premium subscribers within 3 years. I haven’t found much regarding content hours per MAU in the 2019 20-F, but it does say that 73 billion hours of content were consumed for the year, which was an increase of 34% over 2018. This compares to the number of MAUs, which increased 31% from 207 million in 2018 to 271 million in 2019.Former CFO McCarthy stresses that the faster Spotify grows new subscribers, the more money the company loses when the new subscribers first join the service. And the longer subscribers stay, the more profitable those subscribers become. R&D funds customer satisfaction, which is the main driver of churn, which, in turn, is the main driver of lifetime value. As the subscriber base grows larger, there is more operating leverage when the slope of the churn curve is improved. We see in the slide below that the churn curve is improving three years in a row. It also shows that churn declines over the life of a subscriber, which means that the average churn rate falls as the age of the subscriber base increases:Image Source: March 2018 Investor DayConsistent with the above yearly churn slide, the Business Model video from the March 2018 Investor Day talks about the way the lower-priced student and family plans have increased engagement, which means higher retention rates and lower overall premium monthly churn:Image Source: Business Model Video from the March 2018 Investor DayIn the 1Q19 earnings call, CEO Ek talks about the fact that the practical churn rate is lower than the reported churn rate, saying 42% of the gross additions in the quarter were previous users. In other words, some users re-upped a prepaid debit card, so they didn’t really churn out such that the true churn where people leave forever is lower than what we see in these curves. The 2Q19 earnings call shows that churn has gone the right way since this Investor Day presentation, coming down to 5% in 2Q18 and lower still to 4.6% in 2Q19.Again, older cohorts lower the overall average churn rate. So, an older subscription company like Spotify is hard to catch, as it can spend less on marketing relative to competitors. This quote from then CFO McCarthy is one of the key takeaways from the March 2018 Investor Day:Former CFO McCarthy repeats what Chief Premium Business Officer Norström said about the LTV-to-SAC ratio being 2.7-to-1 in 4Q17. Assuming this ratio remains positive, enterprise value is increased each time a new subscriber is added. But the economics shown in the income statement can be counterintuitive, because Spotify loses money on a P&L basis when new subscribers first join. Since the Investor Day presentation, it has been said that the LTV-to- SAC ratio has hovered around 3 pretty consistently.If we think about each premium subscriber as a potential form of organic marketing, then it follows that as the market leader, Spotify is advantaged because it has more free organic growth, which lowers SAC. This powerful concept was explained nicely by then CFO McCarthy:A closing slide is shown by former CFO McCarthy showing long-term operating goals, including revenue growth and gross margins:Image Source: March 2018 Investor DayFormer CFO McCarthy finishes by saying that if investments continue to improve the user experience and if the two-sided marketplace makes Spotify own discovery and demand creation, then the long-term margins from the above slide should be reached. He then says these long-term operating goals can be reached if they are successful with a virtuous cycle: Investments → More Customer Satisfaction & Engagement → Lower Churn [& SAC] → Higher LTV → More Money for Investments.The above approach from March 2018 by then CFO McCarthy took place after the 4Q17 period, when there were 160 million MAUs and 71 million premium subscribers. Since that time, both MAUs and premium subscribers have increased prodigiously. These increases validate many of the things then CFO McCarthy was saying, and the growth rate for MAUs has accelerated in the last 4 periods despite larger base numbers:Spreadsheet Source: Quarterly FilingsThe 2019 20-F shows that the sustained free cash flow (FCF) outlined by former CFO McCarthy in his last slide is underway. Note that I treat stock-based compensation as a cash expense, so my version of adjusted FCF for 2019 is 318 million euros, or 440 million euros - 122 million euros:Image Source: 2019 20-FPodcasting is the elephant in the room on the valuation side. Any discussion about the above long-term operating goals, including revenue growth, gross margin and tech/dev spend, is incomplete without considering podcasts. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss all the details regarding podcasts, but they should become a bigger part of valuation over time and we need to look at them in general terms. A Wall Street Journal article updated May 19th reported that Spotify is paying more than $100 million to be the exclusive home of Joe Rogan’s podcasts. The economics on the podcasting side, where content can be exclusive and ads are served to both free and paid subs, are distinctly different from the economics on the streaming music side. The prices of these podcasts are fixed, and they will continue to make more sense as the subscriber base grows. Spotify can use targeting to dramatically improve the efficiency of podcast ads. Mentioning the podcast additions of Gimlet and Anchor, CEO Ek made a blog post in February 2019 saying podcasting is a massive opportunity for the next phase of audio growth:At the November 2019 RBC Capital Markets Global TIMT Conference, analyst Mark Mahaney talked about the 30-35% gross margin target range and asked about the biggest factors for the low and high end. Then, CFO McCarthy answered by saying that margin eventually flows to whomever owns demand creation. The key point is that politics and news will increasingly be streamed on demand and that exclusive podcast content is a fixed cost that will eventually increase operating leverage. At the same conference, current CFO Paul Vogel talked about innovating podcasting advertising. Currently, everyone gets the same ad regardless of individual tastes and preferences, so Spotify believes tremendous improvements can come with personalization and attribution.The 2019 20-F shows that revenue has grown immensely over the last five years, but the growth is falling towards the low end of the 25-35% range mentioned at the March 2018 Investor Day. The growth was 29% from 2017 to 2018 and again from 2018 to 2019:Image Source: 2019 20-FThe latest quarterly filing shows that revenue increased 22.3%, from €1,511 million in 1Q19 to €1,848 million in 1Q20. Full-year revenue guidance has been reduced to €7.65-8.05 billion from €8.08-8.48 billion. The midpoint of this range, €7.85 billion, implies a 2020 growth rate of 16% from 2019. The 1Q20 release says the biggest factors in the reduction are changes in foreign exchange rates, followed by advertising expectations related to COVID-19.The 1Q20 gross margin was 25.5%. Operating leverage is one reason as to why margins will improve. The costs to the big 3 labels are variable, but many of the other costs are fixed, such that margins will improve with size.At the November 2019 RBC Capital Markets Global TIMT Conference, former CFO McCarthy was asked why folks should buy shares of Spotify. One takeaway from the answer is that linear will fade and on-demand will win in audio. Another takeaway is that scale and relative market share drive a sustainable competitive advantage. A third takeaway is the importance of the leader. Netflix (NFLX) is lucky to have Reed Hastings and Spotify is lucky to have Daniel Ek.I’m optimistic that revenue can continually grow in the teens near a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% or so such that revenue doubles twice in the next ten years. Hopefully by that point, the gross margin will be up to 30%. If growth investments from income statement lines like R&D, sales/marketing and G&A lessen and other considerations discussed in this article regarding operating leverage hold true, then I think earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) can be around 15%. So, in this rosy scenario, €6.8 billion times 4 is €27.2 billion in revenue, and EBIT of 15% is €4 billion. If Spotify is valued at 20x EBIT at that time, then it could be worth around €80 billion. If that future valuation is worth about €40 billion today, then it would imply a CAGR of over 7% from here.€30,841 million market cap [1]€624 million lease liabilities€(733) million short term equivalents€(951) million cash and equivalents--------------------€29,781 million [2][1] The 187,492,667 share count from the 1Q20 6-K filing times the June 1, 2020 share price of $182.77 implies a market cap of $34,268 million. Multiplying by an exchange rate of 0.9 gives us €30,841 million.[2] There is an argument for this to be lower if we deduct the long-term investments related to Tencent Music Entertainment (OTCPK:TCEHY)My valuation of €40 billion is more than the enterprise value, and I believe the stock is reasonably priced.The future for audio is streaming, and Spotify is the biggest company in this space. Like CEO Jeff Bezos at Amazon, CEO Ek has a penchant for increasing enterprise value, while keeping cash flow positive and not over-emphasizing GAAP earnings. Like former CFO McCarthy says, profit margin is a managed outcome. In time we’ll see better profit margins, but currently, this is the era for growth investments."
4351297,105406,2020-06-01T12:02:17-04:00,"Spotify (SPOT) recently announced a deal with the podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience”.Despite the stock run-up, the deal has been received with scepticism by some, especially for its rumoured cost of around $100 million.I ran the numbers on the deal and found out that the future is not so gloomy for Spotify.Moreover, the deal could have much bigger implications than the mere ad revenue increase.","Spotify (SPOT) recently announced a deal with the podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience”. As a response the stock skyrocketed almost 20% to $195, testing new highs before coming back to $180. Despite the stock run-up, the deal has been received with scepticism by some, especially for its rumoured cost of around $100 million. I ran the numbers on the deal and found out that the future is not so gloomy for Spotify.SourceFirst, if you are wondering why Spotify is venturing so aggressively in the podcast industry, a few statistics could help put the move into perspective.The podcast industry is rapidly growing. First, over the past 5 years, the number of Americans listening to podcasts each week skyrocketed 225% going from 19 million to 62 million. Second, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and PwC, podcasting ad revenue is expected to reach over $1 billion by 2021, up 50% from this 2019 revenue. And third, most video-podcasts and relative clips are currently hosted on YouTube and other video platforms, paving the way to additional revenue streams.Joe Rogan’s full library, dating back 11 years, is to hit Spotify in September and become exclusive to Spotify before the end of the year. The deal is believed to cost Spotify as much as $100 million in a multi-year contract. The price tag is so high that it shocked many, but the deal also probably represents a bigger opportunity than many realise.Spotify did not just acquire a successful podcast. Spotify acquired THE most successful podcast to date. The ""Joe Rogan Experience"" (JRE) has been the number 1 podcast for many years and accumulated over $2.8 billion views to date. The YouTube channel counts more than 8.5 million subscribers, generating around 3.7 million views per day.YouTube’s monetized views range from 40% - 80% of the total views, meaning the video platform does not generate revenue from every ad displayed. We know that YouTube ads have an average cost-per-view of $0.01 – $0.03, but also that services like Youtube Select allow marketers to reach top-tiers channels (top 5%) for an even higher ad rate.Based on these numbers, and assuming a revenue model similar to YouTube, we can estimate the total future revenue coming from the deal for Spotify. Being a highly successful channel, we can safely assume the ad cost for advertisers to land on the higher end of the average rates, at $0.03 per view, if not even more. Maintaining an average of 60% monetization rate, and the channel 3.7 million views, running the numbers leads to $67 thousand ad revenue per day, or $6 million a quarter, $24 million a year. Considering the deal is rumoured to cost Spotify $100 million in a multi-year contract, $24 million a year should be enough to break even. However, I believe this scenario can be considered a conservative estimate. Below you can find a table of possible monetization scenarios (Figure 1). I highlighted (bordered) what I see as the most likely scenario.Figure 1 - Source: Table created by the Author - Authors CalculationsDespite users being “very loyal” to the podcasts they follow, a 20% decline in view could be estimated due to the platform switch. Some users may not care enough to tune in on another platform, or some users may just become viewers due to the automatic YouTube recommendations. With almost 9 million subscribers on the YouTube podcast channel, I believe the base of loyal followers will remain millions large. Moreover, this loyal user base will justify a higher advertising cost than the regular YouTube video. Spotify will be able to collect deeper data about their audiences and, in turn, feed it to advertisers, which will be willing to pay higher rates to be able to reach their target audience accurately. Hence my main projection that sees fewer views at a higher margin, which could bring Spotify as much as $43 million per year.But of course, it would be limited to think that Spotify would make a deal of such proportions just for the advertising revenue. This deal could, in fact, be the start of a strategic plan of much bigger proportions.The number of subscribers Joe Rogan will bring to the Spotify platform is in the millions magnitude. The YouTube figures I mentioned earlier are impressive, but the same content is also being consumed is on other audio platforms as well. Spotify could benefit from many of those viewers and listeners switching to their service. We don’t know how many already have a Spotify account or subscription, but even maintaining a conservative estimate (10%), new users of the platform could amount to at least 1 to 2 million users.With premium subscribers now standing at 130 million, this number won’t likely move the needle. However, the podcast regularly features individuals from different fields and backgrounds, which in turn have their own following and user base. A quick scroll through the last videos of the channel show hosts such as comedian Kevin Hart, world-famous skateboarder Tony Hawk, and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, the latter alone collecting 14 million views in only three weeks. For Spotify, the increased traffic is therefore set to accelerate the subscriber growth speed, which was already very high at 31% YoY at the end of Q1.Besides pure subscriber numbers, bringing hundreds of million views to the Spotify platform will significantly increase the company brand awareness, and become more attractive for original podcast creators.The deal has a deeper aspect to it, which may be well-know to Youtubers or JRE podcast followers. In fact, I believe the switch to Spotify from YouTube was not moved by money only, but arguably also from the frustration for YouTube policies. On his podcast, Joe Rogan has expressed this frustration several times, complaining about YouTube trying to “control the way people communicate” so that is feasible for them to make a profit. Another issue he discusses is a censorship problem, which several other public personalities have also critiqued. Acquiring one of the biggest and most visible stars of Youtube’s podcasts, Spotify has likely set itself to acquiring the interest of many others content creators willing to shift away from the Google (GOOG) platform.Spotify has a strong competitor in Apple (AAPL), which is currently trying to expand its original content offer. However, Apple’s recent moves are small, and cannot compare to Spotify aggressive deal. It is safe to say that Apple has fallen behind in the podcast race. Needless to say, Apple could start spending more than Spotify to gain traction again. This easier said than done, however, for the same reason that buying Cristiano Ronaldo or Lebron James guarantees more revenue than buying a bunch of lower-tier players. Popularity and audience matters, and Spotify has so far made the most successful move.In the years to come, Rogan’s move to Spotify could be seen as the landmark moment that started the shift from the market-dominant YouTube to the rest of the platforms. And YouTube’s market is very large. In the US market alone, YouTube is expected to make $5.5 billion in advertising revenue, and the online advertising market is growing at 7.7% compound annual growth rate. Moreover, YouTube is watched by the vast majority of younger people, reaching 81% of US people aged 15-25 and 71% aged 26-35. Capturing a slice of the younger generation audience should set Spotify up for a bright future.The $100 million price tag could be shocking to many, but an in-depth look at the deal shows that it is indeed a winning move for Spotify. Advertising revenue, subscribers growth, market share and future original content are all important factors of the deal. Should Spotify execute the plan as expected, and maintain the lead over the competition in this space, the future of the company should be brighter than ever.If you found this article of value, please follow (near the title) and/or press ""Like this article"" just below."
4350811,105498,2020-05-29T09:32:13-04:00,The ad-supported segment of the company lost money in Q1.Podcast usage is lagging all other media while streaming surges from stay-at-home orders.User growth is strong but misleading.Technical setup implies downside potential.,"Despite a noticeable pullback in share price this week, Spotify's (NYSE:SPOT) stock has been ripping lately. The majority of the gains in May have come from reaction to the streaming service landing an exclusivity agreement for the Joe Rogan Experience. Though the stock has already given a large chunk of those gains back, as of writing, it is still more than 10% above where it was before the Rogan news broke. And while I'm sure the Rogan Rally was an enjoyable elevator ride for bulls, taking profit at this juncture is the wise move at least for the near term.My personal view of Spotify is that it's an interesting name for a variety of reasons. The core function of the business to this point has been as a music streaming provider. Unsurprisingly, there is a tremendous amount of competition in this space. Much of that competition coming from much bigger companies with diversified revenue buckets. Like other music providers, for the rights to stream music to end users, Spotify pays the owner/artist of the music on a per play basis. As I've stated in other articles, in a direct-to-consumer environment, the owners of the content figure to come out on top. Until recently, the problem for Spotify has been that the core business, striped down, is essentially a middleman in a DTC world. As a streamer, if you don't own the content, you better make a lot of money selling ads. To this point, Spotify does not do that. Just 10% of Spotify's revenue historically comes from the ad-supported segment.Source: Company filingMaybe of even more interest is the cost of revenue breakout in the company's latest quarterly report. The cost of revenue for the ad-supported segment was actually higher than the revenue for the ad-supported segment. Simply put, ad-supported streamers weren't a profitable customer base in Q1. Figures in millions:Source: Company filingThe increases in the cost of revenue from the same time period last year were attributed to higher-than-estimate royalty costs and unexpected changes in foreign exchange rates. Spotify's volatility in ad revenue and dependency on licensed content are likely key reasons why the company has taken such large strides to inject podcasting into the business. Before Rogan, Spotify spent just under $200 million to buy The Ringer and nearly $400 million combined to buy a handful of other podcasting entities. The point is the pivot to podcasting is very clearly of significant importance to Spotify's future plans.Media consumption has taken off as more people have been sheltering in their homes to avoid COVID-19. The good news for Spotify is music streaming has seen one of the largest jumps in usage at 30%.Though music streaming is a big winner here, despite certainly being a part of that consumption surge, podcasting growth has lagged just about every other medium with just a 13% bump. A lag in podcast usage is something the company seemed to corroborate recently as commuter listening has been disrupted by the remote work movement.Despite podcasting lagging music growth, the good news is the April study from Global Web Index projects both music streaming and podcasting to hang onto more than half of their consumption boosts following the pandemic. Music streaming specifically is projected to hold 74% of the COVID-19 lift.Podcasting isn't too far behind that with 62% planning to continue consumption. This intention information is important insight into what we can expect when things return to normal. While intention and actual behavior are not synonymous, it's the best we have to go off when trying to make guesses about where the consumer intends to continue spending time. Furthermore, it's a half decent look at how much staying power user growth may have beyond late-first and early-second quarter numbers.While many streaming services may tout reach or active users, Spotify uses ""Monthly Active Users,"" or MAUs, as a key performance indicator. A quick glance at Spotify's most recent reported quarter shows massive 31% growth in total MAUs over the same quarter from 2019.Source: BusinesswireSpotify's MAU number is a combination of the 130 million premium subscribers and the remaining free, ad-supported users who have ""consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated."" Zero milliseconds being the barometer leaves a bit of ambiguity as to just how engaged the ad-supported users actually are. Because of this, I view premium subscribers as the more important number. But even there I'm a little cautious about how I view some of the figures based on how they're defined by Spotify.This is important because of the pricing of the plans. A family plan subscription will set a household back $15 per month while the individual option is just $10. It only takes three users on a family plan to throw off potential revenue projections for analysts. Three ""subscribers"" on one family account provide half the monthly revenue of three subscribers on individual accounts. This isn't a problem as long as the growth in the platform is coming from more individual subscribers. According to the company, that isn't the case.The free trials are also of some importance as the current offer is now three months of the service on the house. This is a fresh offer that lasts through the end of June.Source: SpotifyGiven that family plans and free trials were a significant portion of user growth, it's no wonder that average revenue per user declined 6% in the latest quarter over the previous year. I don't think investors can reasonably expect a significant move back up in ARPU as true churn numbers from this latest offer likely won't be known until the company reports its third-quarter results later this year. Put simply, you have to take all of the subscriber numbers with a huge grain of salt going forward.I'm not a day trader and my technical analysis is intermediate at best. Having said that, I see a stock that rose too high too fast.I see a stock that trades inverse to the traditional rules of the 50- and 200-day moving average crosses. Having just made another golden cross, the top could be in for the time being. I also see a stock that was more overbought on a daily RSI-14 seven days ago than it has been at any other point in its trading history. I could certainly be wrong and I have missed many trades in the past by waiting for a better entry, but on this one, I see a test of sub-$160 per share coming and potentially within the next few sessions.I'm not against Spotify as a long-term investment by any means. I actually think the transition to podcasting makes a lot of sense for the company. It's a gamble, but it's one that I tend to lean could pay off down the line. From a consumer perspective, I like the idea of streaming all of my podcasts and favorite albums in the same app. There are numerous other articles on Seeking Alpha that focus on the potential for podcasting revenue growth in the years ahead and I'd recommend looking into those if you want to get an idea of what the market is for that part of the business. Beyond that, subscriber churn figures will be key to determining if I am to take a position later this year. Until then, the stock is due for a pullback."
4357676,103480,2020-07-09T10:15:01-04:00,"Shares of Spotify have risen nearly 80% in the year-to-date, powered by the growing popularity of streaming services in the midst of the pandemic.
        The stock has rallied even further recently on optimism over the company's recent podcast deals. Omnicom, a huge media advisory, has just planned $20 million of ads on Spotify podcasts.
        Additional tertiary revenue opportunities lie in Spotify's nascent two-sided marketplace business, which was a huge marketing tool for The Weeknd's latest album.
        From a valuation perspective, Spotify still has a gap against Netflix, leaving room to rise.","Spotify (SPOT) has been one of the unexpected success stories of the year. After going public in a direct listing more than two years ago at the ~$150 range, shares of Spotify failed to find direction even as the broader market - and especially technology stocks - soared. That all changed this year, when the pandemic brought new listeners to Spotify's doorstep in droves and the stock has enjoyed one of the biggest rallies of the year.I last wrote on Spotify in late April when the stock was still bouncing around in the $150 range. Now, +80% later, it's usually a good time to re-assess the bullish thesis in the stock to see if Spotify has outrun its potential. But in my view, that's not the case.The primary reason is in Spotify's tertiary revenue opportunities - that is, in the growth of its business outside of its core Premium/ads streaming business. We're already heavily familiar with how strongly Spotify's core streaming has performed this year.Here's the recap in a nutshell: Premium Subscriber growth in Q1, as more and more people turned to Spotify for entertainment amid the coronavirus lockdowns. But even more importantly, Spotify's total MAUs (premium plus ad-supported) grew, as did overall engagement. Because the majority of Spotify Premium subscribers started out as free ad-supported users, the company has done a good job at growing what it calls ""the top of the funnel."" With the overall base of listeners growing, Spotify Premium has a shot at continuing to see accelerating subscriber growth numbers throughout the year, not just in Q1.But it's really in podcasts and the music marketplace that Spotify can really differentiate itself, as we'll discuss in greater depth this article. In becoming a holistic audio entertainment platform spanning music and podcasts, plus acting as a marketplace service for content creators, Spotify has the potential to grow far beyond its original TAM. And despite the strong market performance this year, when we look at Spotify on a valuation basis next to its closest (though not perfect) comp in fellow streaming company Netflix (NFLX), we still see additional upside opportunity. Stay long here and keep riding the upward momentum.Let's start first with the latest news on the podcast side: Omnicom Group (OMC), one of the world's largest advertising agencies, has committed to spending $20 million of its clients' budgets on Spotify podcast ads through the second half of 2020. Podcast advertising is shaping up to be very similar to ads sold in TVs, where advertisers commit to placements in ""upfront"" deals that are signed ahead of the content airing, unlike the majority of Spotify's streaming ads which are sold over the programmatic marketplaces. Up to this point, though the market has shown an excited reaction of Spotify's opportunity in podcasting, investors have had precious little context on the dollar impact of podcasts. In fact, many Spotify bears have called out limited revenue potential in podcasts as one of the key reasons why the stock may currently be running too hot. But a $20 million ad-buy for the second half of 2020 (annualized to $40 million) represents a significant chunk for a single customer (though admittedly this customer represents many larger brands). For some context, Spotify has guided to just under €8 billion in revenue for the current year, so an annualized $40 million revenue stream from one customer (representing about 0.5% of overall revenues) isn't just a small chunk of change.This type of revenue opportunity also helps to justify the investments that Spotify has poured into podcasts over the past year. Most recently, Spotify invested heavily to sign an exclusive podcast series from Joe Rogan, who the New York Times referred to as ""the king of all podcasting."" In praising the deal and Rogan's widespread influence, the NYT further wrote:And though the financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed, the Wall Street Journal estimated that it was worth north of $100 million. The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE), on Spotify for a ""multi-year exclusive licensing deal"", will launch on September of this year and offer regular content. For sizing purposes, note also that Spotify in February spent just under $200 million to buy Bill Simmons' podcasting company, The Ringer. Spotify has ~€3.0 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of the end of its most recent quarter, but these multi-million dollar investments aren't insignificant. However, when we begin to get a sense of the revenue opportunity that podcasts bring in, we get more comfort around Spotify's strategy. A report from the International Advertising Bureau and PwC estimates that podcast advertising will amount to $863 million this year and jump 21% y/y to $1.05 billion by next year. Spotify's indication of interest from Omnicom already gives it a sizable head start and chunk in this market. The other ancillary revenue opportunity that we should touch on is Spotify's two-sided marketplace. Spotify analysts often ignore the potential of this business given the exciting growth on the subscriber front, but there's a lot that Spotify can do with this type of marketplace: including helping artists promote their content, find producers, and source ""gig-based"" talent.In a note included alongside Spotify's Q1 earnings release, the company noted that its marketplace services were key to promoting The Weeknd's latest album, and also that marketplace revenues will grow by more than 50% y/y this year.Figure 1. Spotify Marketplace performance commentarySource: Spotify Q1 earnings releaseIn spite of the dramatic increase in Spotify's share prices since the beginning of the year, we find that the company's valuation multiple still has opportunity when we compare it against Netflix (NFLX), the other major streaming leader. Given that revenues are growing at a similar mid-20% y/y clip for both companies (and I'd argue that with investments into podcasting and marketplace services, Spotify's longer-term growth trajectory is more favorable than Netflix's), I think Netflix provides a fair compare. In my view, Spotify's rally still has plenty of steam left. Investors should continue to ride the upward momentum and bank of Spotify's tremendous potential for growth across multiple areas, including streaming, podcasting, and marketplace."

As much as I hate to admit this, I stopped using iTunes shortly before Apple (AAPL) shut it down because I was tired of paying for music.Apple had already blown up the record industry's model of forcing consumers to buy entire albums. Even still, it didn't make financial sense to drop a buck (or slightly more) per song when I could pay a nominal fee each month for unlimited listening. That's when I became an avid Spotify (SPOT) user.Now, I split my listening between Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) and Spotify. Though, I probably use Spotify 65 to 75 percent of the time. But the amount of time I'm spending with Spotify continues to increase. This increase started because nobody executes the music component of streaming as well as Spotify. Spotify offers superior on-demand listening, curated playlists, and radio-like experiences. It has cultivated an environment (or an ecosystem?) that makes Pandora (sad as it is for me to say) and terrestrial radio (also sad) look weak.As Spotify evolved over the last few years, it added other elements that continue to contribute to my increased time spent listening.First, Spotify started putting news in front of me, via NPR. I took the bait and started listening regularly. Then Spotify began sneaking NPR News into the mostly music playlists it curates for me. Second, Spotify increasingly populated my home screen with podcasts. Now, I listen to more podcasts than I ever have. And, unlike other services, Spotify doesn't simply optimize my mobile experience. It does just as fantastic a job on my other primary listening platform, Roku (ROKU). That says a lot compared to the sad state of so many other apps on Roku, relative to their mobile brothers.Attract users to your service. Increase the time they spend with you. Make your service something bigger. Turn it into what starts to feel like its own platform or ecosystem. Build a wall (in the wholly positive sense of the word). Make it sticky:That's an excerpt from a 2014 ZDNet article. I liked the article so much at the time I saved it. It remains relevant today. However, great services such as Spotify have not only blurred the lines between, but redefined terms such as service, platform, and ecosystem.In the above-linked article, the author, Simon Bisson, goes on to distinguish between BlackBerry's (NYSE:BB) failure to unbundle its messaging service, BBM, from its BlackBerry platform and Microsoft's (MSFT) success in offering its service, the suite of Office products, on a platform other than its own, Apple's iOS.Let's - no pun intended - unbundle the meaning of service, platform, and ecosystem. The services are BBM, Office, and Spotify. The platforms are BlackBerry and Microsoft. The ecosystems encompass the entire walled off world of, say, all the BlackBerry services working in concert with all BlackBerry platforms and hardware devices. However, thinking in the present day, Spotify blows up any distinctions between those words.You can call Spotify a service itself, but it's more like a collection of complementary services (e.g., music, news, podcasts). While you can access it from any number of independent platforms, Spotify has become a platform itself. I don't differentiate the source that delivers Spotify to me, whether it's my Android phone (Google Pixel), Android Auto (which I guess is a service or platform inside the Android ecosystem), or Roku. Similar to how Google is a verb, Spotify has emerged as its own audio entertainment ecosystem. All it lacks is its own hardware. But does it really need its own hardware?Admittedly, I once loved them. But, these days, I dislike <insert company name here> should buy <insert company name here> articles. My philosophy on these types of articles is the same as it is on anything I or anyone else, for that matter, writes. They have to:I think the notion of Apple buying Spotify, even if the respective companies would be hard-pressed to even discuss it, qualifies on all three counts. Because you can make a strong case that each company could benefit from combining or, at the very least, partnering. Sounds crazy to discuss two seemingly fierce competitors ""partnering,"" but if the COVID-19 pandemic has taught me anything, it's to not discount any eventuality.Let's consider what we know about Spotify and Apple Music's subscriber numbers.Source: Spotify Q1 2020 shareholder letterGrowing by leaps and bounds, Spotify now has roughly 286 million monthly active users and 130 million paid subscribers worldwide. We know less about Apple Music because Apple refuses to tell us as much as Spotify does. But here's what we do know, courtesy of 9to5Mac:While Apple Music might be closer to Spotify than it appears, it's not growing nearly as fast. If Apple hits 70 million subscribers today, it took 11 months to grow that base by 16.7 percent. That's not a knock on Apple Music. After all, it certainly contributes to Apple's sick (in the wholly positive sense of the word) service revenue of $13.3 billion, as of FYQ2 2020.In terms of revenue, a massive opportunity to generate more from streaming still exists, according to Spotify Founder and CEO Daniel Ek (via Rolling Stone):And another thought from Ek excerpted in the same article:That last sentence from Ek is so important. It was, to the letter, Pandora's mantra before its founding members and other original executives exited and things, sadly, went south for the company. To go after the terrestrial radio advertising market. Pandora wasn't wrong about this. It did a formidable job going after this market. It simply wasn't able to finish the job for a whole host of reasons. (And I know Pandora still exists. I like it under the Sirius XM umbrella. I just don't see it competing effectively with Apple or Spotify going forward).By signing massive deals for content, as it just did with podcaster Joe Rogan, Spotify continues to take significant steps towards capturing more of the radio advertising market. Even if the Rogan deal doesn't directly generate ad revenue (we don't know enough about the details of the contract to say for sure), it contributes to the objective. Rogan helps make Spotify's ecosystem stickier, opening the door to further subscription growth and an easier sale for Spotify's ad team.Apple does the same or similar. Imagine if Apple and Spotify did it together, backed by, in my opinion, Spotify's superior service or platform (whatever you want to call it) and Apple's second-to-none (though I love my Pixel!) hardware meets services ecosystem. It's a deal ripe for a Presidential Twitter (TWTR) rant.But I don't think the competition an Apple acquisition of Spotify (or some sort of partnership) would wipe out would hurt innovation at either company.Apple and Spotify could help one another in so many ways. It's no different than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) buying Instagram. You can leave Apple Music and Spotify separate (like Facebook and Instagram), or you could combine the two services (calling it Spotify by Apple). In either scenario, you give the combined Apple and Spotify sales teams the ability to package the two streaming services together in what would be the most powerful and endlessly creative sales pitches the advertising world has ever seen.And, of course, Spotify could become one of the top features on Apple devices, side-by-by with or without Apple Music. Again, it doesn't matter.Remember, in the early days of iPhone, Pandora and Apple, for all intents and purposes, partnered. If you recall, Steve Jobs welcomed Pandora co-founder Tim Westergren to the stage at a 2010 iPhone event to show how Pandora functions on the device and talk up the success of the partnership.Competition might appear to suffer on the surface, but innovation certainly would not. It would flourish. And that's a good deal for everyone, particularly listeners. If nothing else, the ability these services have and will continue to develop to target and tailor advertising and promotions to subsets of users would be mind-blowing in scope, scale, and effectiveness.Together or apart, Apple Music and Spotify also benefit the music industry. They do that today. And they'll continue to going forward. If the music industry was smart, it would have abandoned the royalty fight long ago in favor of an approach that leaves that money on the table in exchange for aggressive partnership and promotion.Together, Apple Music and Spotify could not only command better royalty deals, but they could provide even more value to smaller and independent musicians than they already do. This in addition to what the combination could accomplish for the larger music industrial complex.Ever since the days when I was covering and bullish Pandora, small and independent artist objections to streaming made me laugh. Indie artists have always had a weak argument.In the old days of record sales and radio airplay, most were as poor as they are today and never received spins on broadcast radio. Thanks to Pandora initially and now, more so, Apple Music and Spotify, the opportunity indies stand to seize has never been greater. They act like they once took in a whole bunch of money and streaming took that away. Not the case. They were always poor.Streaming gives them the exposure they never had. It's as tough of a racket as it has ever been, but at least, streaming affords independent acts the opportunity to actually be heard. Your chance at success if you make music your career has always been slim. Streaming didn't make that the case. Rather, streaming gives the dreamers a fighting chance. It gives the truly talented and/or savvy a viable platform from which they can attempt to use as a springboard for success.That said, as part of their efforts to steal ad dollars from local radio markets across the globe (particularly in the U.S.), Apple Music and Spotify should do everything in their power to take local bands along for the ride. Pandora started doing exactly this before it hit obstacles it could not overcome. Pandora's acquisition of Ticketfly (which I predicted) was supposed to aid this process. It never materialized. But it can now.In addition to advertising, Apple Music and Spotify have the ability (and I would argue a moral obligation) to wrestle the business of promotion and ticketing away from the major players. Tech companies can do more for artists - big, small, and everywhere in between - than old school bureaucracies such as Ticketmaster (LYV) ever would. It's not in the latter's culture. It is Apple Music and Spotify's culture.Bottom line - opportunity abounds in myriad directions. I'm excited to watch Apple Music and Spotify battle over it. I would be even more excited to watch the two crush the opportunity together.Today, I would buy Apple stock on the future potential of its Services segment alone. I would buy Spotify because, over the next year or two, it could make its current clip of 30-plus percent year-over-year subscriber growth seem small.While it's never a good idea to buy a stock solely on its attractiveness as an M&A target, Spotify absolutely is one of those attractive targets. Apple doesn't make massive acquisitions all that often. However, Tim Cook would likely rue the day he let a competitor buy Spotify. It would be a shame because the best synergies exist in a marriage between Apple and Spotify."

Despite the grim economic outlook, the company is maintaining strong growth and a solid balance sheet. The consolidation of several catalysts could mean an even stronger performance on the way out of the COVID-19 crisis. SourceIn the last quarter, Spotify maintained impressive user growth. Total Monthly Active Users are up 31% YoY, in line with Q4 31% growth. Premium subscribers have even seen a slight acceleration and are now standing at 130 million, up 31% YoY (vs 29% YoY in Q4).Source: Spotify Financials - Figure created by AuthorDespite the COVID-19 challenges, churn rates and retention rates have continued to trend positively in Q1. There was no meaningful increase in churn rates during the quarter, and active cancellations remained low. Moreover, towards the end of Q1, the company experienced an increase in new users for Spotify's free tier and a higher rate of returning costumers.Spotify's product showed strong resiliency and flexibility despite the change in users behavior. With more people staying at home, listening was down, unsurprisingly, across Car, Web and Wearables channels. However, smart TVs and Speakers, as well as Gaming Consoles channels saw an increase of more than 50%. This trend indicates that many people are discovering new devices to consume content and, should a part of them stick to these new habits post-pandemic, we could see an increase in listening rates across various channels.Currently, the Spotify app remains within the top 20 most downloaded free apps in many major countries (i.e. US, Canada, UK, Italy, Germany, Spain, Australia etc.). These numbers give confidence that user growth will stay high towards the end of the year and beyond.The growth story repeats on revenue, even though to a lesser extent. Spotify reported Q1 revenue of €1.85B, +22% YoY, with Premium revenue growing 23% YoY to €1.7 million. Despite the COVID-19 detrimental impact in the last three weeks of the quarter, Ad-Supported revenues grew 17% YoY.Before the pandemic outbreak and related Advertising cuts, revenues were on track to outperform the company's forecast. As the economy slowly reopens and companies advertising budgets return, I expect the Ad-revenue segment to pick up where it left before the crisis. As businesses start to reopen and make their way out from the pandemic panic, CMOs will have to allocate more budget to put their company's name in the mix and gain market share.In the long term, Spotify is well-positioned to benefit from the revived spending trends. In the short term, the decline in ad-revenue is not significant, as the company relies only marginally (9%) on advertising revenue.Source: Spotify Financials - Figure created by AuthorSpotify's business has shown to be resilient in times of economic uncertainty. As expected, the ad-segment has taken a hit due to its sensitivity to economic cycles, while the subscription segment held surprisingly well and has shown to be capable to weather the economic storm.One negative note for the quarter was the negative operating cash flow. Last quarter, management warned about the timing of some of the payments that got pushed from Q4 into Q1. As expected, Q1 cash flow was negative €21 million. However, negative cash flow was less than anticipated, and the first operating cash outflow in two years. Spotify will generate positive free cash flow during the rest of the year.Considering that the company has no debt and €1.8 billion in cash at the end of Q1, it is safe to state that the company is in a very healthy financial position.Spotify has proved to have established a successful business model. It attracts users with a free tier plan, which many competitors lack. 60% of its paid subscribers come from the free tier. With many people currently suffering financial distress, this could boost paid subscription over the competition when the economic situation improves.Spotify maintains one of the cleanest and easiest user experience, and it keeps increasing availability of third-party integrations. Even on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store, Spotify ranks number #1 in Music with a 4.8 rating. On the other hand, the main competitor Apple music still struggles to achieve the same level of user experience for Android users, with Play store app rating of 3.6 versus Spotify's 4.6.Spotify is also continuing to invest in content, especially in the podcast space, where it's gaining an edge over the competition. Its podcast library it's growing fast, and now contains over 1 million titles (vs 700k in Q4), with 78 exclusive podcasts launched only in the last quarter.Spotify remains the only company on a global scale focused only on audio. Its user base is growing fast, and the billions of users that are listening to linear radio still present an opportunity for market growth in the years ahead.Spotify business model has shown to be able to maintain both users and revenue growth despite the significant economic challenges.

It was stable in areas badly affected by COVID-19, and subscribers are keeping their premium subs.Ad revenues are minor at Spotify. Even if the firm lost all ad-revenue, it would still meet Q2 guidance.Analysts mean price target is a little shy of $170, and I am right there with them on a revenues multiple basis.","Image: Spotify at the NYSEA few months ago, I wrote an article on Spotify (SPOT), where I considered myself ""Neutral"" on the stock, but that opinion has now changed.Data by YChartsChart: Spotify 1Yr PriceSince writing that article, Spotify's price per share has been on a wild ride. I don't think we're done yet, but I am averaging myself into this music giant for the long-haul, let me explain why.In February, before global lockdowns and collapsing economies, I wrote the above. While Spotify has not gone through transformational changes, my thinking on the company and its prospects has. Spotify is truly on a path to becoming and sustaining a position as the world's largest audio platform.Turning first to podcasts. During its Q1 earnings call, the company mentioned that podcast consumption on the platform had grown triple digits. Granted, podcasts are still relatively new to the platform, but it's promising to see that they are being consumed there. Podcast listening keeps users in-app and doesn't result in royalties being paid.70% of the podcasts on Spotify are created by the company's wholly-owned Anchor. That's a promising step towards dynamic ad-insertion that we all know will revolutionize podcasting. Anchor offers podcasters unlimited free hosting and easier distribution to aggregators. It also helps podcasters monetize their product.These kinds of numbers, in the macro-environment we have, are very promising. While I still think that Spotify has a way to go in its audio domination path, the firm is undoubtedly starting to shift the audio landscape and put its spin on things.If you have time to listen to (or read) the full opening statement from Daniel Ek on the Q1 earnings call, I'd recommend it. I picked the above quote out because it follows the same line of thinking from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who said: ""We have seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months."" For most of us, it no doubt feels like we've lived two-years over the last few months too.The trend Ek mentioned above is, in less eloquent words, what I was trying to convey with my ""changing the audio landscape"" comments in my previous Spotify article. I had no idea that the world would do it for them just a few weeks later.That changing landscape resulted in Spotify growing monthly active users (MAUs) by 31% year-over-year. Total monthly listeners now sit at 286M. Paid subscribers also saw an increase of 31% year-over-year to 130M.Spotify owes the increase, at least in part, to being available anywhere. It is a platform-agnostic application that you can run on iOS, your TV, your car, and I'm sure your fridge (if it's running Android). In the earnings call, Ek specifically mentioned that more than 300 devices run Spotify, made by over 80 brands.As alluded to in my title, the one aspect of the Spotify call that stood out to me was the 2020 guidance. While companies are pulling guidance pretty much across the board, Spotify reiterated its guidance, lowering expectations at a time when it is excelling.I believe that the firm will beat its guidance, thus over-delivering on expectations.Image: Spotify's Quarterly Revenues in DollarsFor Q2, the firm expects €1.75-1.95B in revenue. This would come from a slight bump in MAUs (289-299 MAU) and a boost in premium subscribers (133-138M). What eagle-eyed readers may note right off the bat is that €1.75B would be a reduction over Q1's €1.85B.On the Q1 call, Ek said hard-hit areas like Italy saw a DAU drop but rebounded ""in a big way."" Unless that statement is materially different for countries later on the curve, it is challenging to foresee Spotify revenues declining by some €100M in Q2 (in terms of ARPU, that'd be 7.5M users canceling).Image: Spotify Revenue Makeup by SegmentCould it be advertising? We know that there have been substantial cuts to advertising budgets in other mediums, and one could expect Spotify to be the same. Spotify, however, only generates 8% of its revenues from ads.Image: Spotify 10-Q Segment BreakdownDigging deeper in, briefly, Spotify gave guidance of 133M premium subscribers at the low end. At the company's premium ARPU of €4.42, revenues would be €1.76B with not a single ad served. I feel pretty confident that Spotify, given this guidance, will more than meet expectations for Q2.Spotify analysts are a somewhat mixed bag, which is expected for a tech company that rarely posts a profitable quarter.The median price target across 30 analysts is $169.54. We have a $120 target on the low end and reach as high as $210 on the top end. Over the last month, five analysts have updated or reiterated price targets:Spotify, being a money-losing tech firm, is a little hard to price. The best approach, at least today, is a revenues multiple comparison across the media landscape.Selecting comparable firms is a little bit tricky, given that Spotify is a very narrowly focused firm, and players in the music space tend to offer an awful lot more (Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) as examples).While not genuinely comparable because of the linear nature of its offerings, I have picked Sirius (SIRI). Alongside that, I also think that Netflix (NFLX), a narrowly-focused firm on the video side of things is also a peer (narrow focus, on-demand entertainment). Both of these firms, along with many others that I cannot justify, were listed by Spotify as peers when the company went public.Here are the three firms on a P/S basis:I don't think I need to argue that Spotify's future is brighter than Sirius', so I'll move on to Netflix.Netflix has captured the hearts and minds of people around the world during the pandemic, and its price accurately reflects that. Spotify does not appear to be getting a similar treatment, though, despite capturing the audio front.Granted, people spend more time with video, and Netflix has many more users, but Spotify has a much healthier balance sheet, and I love healthy balance sheets. With $1.65B in cash & investments on the balance sheet and zero debt, Spotify is well-capitalized to handle any kind of revenue loss from a reduction in ad-sales. The firm also has some buying power to continue wrapping up the audio market in its grasps.I believe this, over the longer term, warrants a P/S ratio closer to Netflix's, or even those of the broader tech space. A P/S of 4 would be more than fair, while significantly less than that of Netflix, Amazon (5.59), and Apple (5.12).A P/S of 4 would work out to a price target of ~$170.Spotify has relatively decent Hideaway Scores. The firm has a ""B"" rating in Quality, Momentum, and Composite scores, with the Price score dragging it down a bit.High-Quality Hideaway is my new Seeking Alpha marketplace launching June 1st. As a subscriber, you will receive unfettered access to the Hideaway Scores for more than 4,000 actively traded companies. Highly rated Hideaway firms beat the market as a whole and help you rest easy at night, knowing your investments are well-positioned.Also, you'll get a more in-depth analysis of quality firms and access to more quantitative measures than you can shake a stick at (Piotroski, Altman, Ohlson, Beneish and more as I add them).If you'd like to learn more about the Hideaway Score, see this blog post.I am now a buyer of Spotify. Before, I was skeptical, but like many, my opinions on almost everything have changed over the last few months.Spotify is relatively unaffected by COVID-19, and related lockdowns. It has many catalysts for future growth and is a dominant player in a market that other big tech firms are ignoring (to focus on video).My price target for the firm is $170, in line with most analysts, and representing a 12% increase over the price at the time of writing."
4326151,104809,2020-02-21T11:10:21-05:00,Huge runway for the Advertising in Podcasts business especially vis-a-vis traditional media such as TV and Radio.Recent developments announced by Spotify demonstrate both its podcasting strategy of acquiring exclusive content and its monetization strategy for Podcasts.Spotify released its Streaming Ad Insertion which would make its platform more attractive to advertisers by promising more targeted ads which have higher ROI and more opportunities to sell ads.Spotify also released metrics demonstrating the huge demand for podcasts. 16% of total MAUs (about 44 million) have engaged in podcasts on Spotify and consumption hours grew 200% YoY.,"I previously wrote about Spotify (SPOT) in a two-part series including a section on Valuation and Future Plans. In it, I focused on Spotify's plan and strategy to become an all-encompassing audio platform which I felt was necessary in order to compete with localized streaming apps as well as the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ecosystem. However, at that time, due to the lack of clarity on Spotify's podcasting monetization strategy, I wrote ""In my opinion, the benefits of entering the podcasting business are strictly limited to how it enhances Spotify as the all-encompassing audio platform. I believe that any top-line contribution would be immaterial due to the fact that it can really only monetize from exclusive content and the still nascent state of the podcast advertising industry means that any contribution would be small.""However, since then, recent updates and color provided by management have provided some insights into how Spotify plans to monetize its podcasts and it is better than what I initially thought.According to a report by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, advertisers only spent around $314 million in advertisements in US podcasts in 2017.This pales in comparison to other forms of digital advertising. According to Recode, $68.5 billion was spent on TV ads, $22.8 billion for internet search ads and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) alone did $39.9 billion in 2017. The best comparable is Radio and advertisers spent $17.6 billion on radio advertising in 2017. Hence the gulf between podcast advertising and other forms of advertising is getting industry experts excited over the potential of podcast advertising revenues.Edison Research estimates that roughly 67 million Americans listened to podcasts at least once a month in 2017, hence the $314 million in revenue would suggest that average advertising revenue per monthly podcast listener for 2017 was $4.68. Contrast this to what advertisers are paying for radio listeners. Nielsen estimates that there were around 243 million AM/FM radio listeners in the US in 2017. Thus the $17.6 billion in advertising revenue suggests that the average advertising revenue per monthly radio listener was $72.45. The wide disparity between average advertising revenue per listener for radio and podcast suggests that there is a huge runway of growth for podcast companies and creators.Nielsen is particularly bullish on podcast advertising (see below quote) due to what it believes is higher Return Of Investment (ROI) as compared to other forms of advertising. TechCrunch also reported that podcast listeners are a well sought-out group as its audience trend towards educated early adopters with high consumption power.This should allow podcast advertising revenue to continue to enjoy substantial growth with the Interactive Advertising Bureau suggesting that it will hit $1 billion by 2021.As mentioned earlier, my initial pessimism on the short-term monetization potential of podcasts was due to the fact that current advertisements on podcasts are read out by the podcast hosts hence Spotify will really only manage to benefit (revenue wise) from podcasts that they exclusively own. However, it recently announced its new podcast ad tool, Streaming Ad Insertion, which will allow Spotify to implement targeted ads in its podcasts.According to a recent Verge article which explained Spotify's new podcast ad tech.More importantly, this will be a great tool to attract advertising money since it will have a higher Return on Investment and have more information on how well their ads are received and have their ads reach their intended audience. While, this represents great progress for driving monetization in Spotify's podcast strategy, podcast ad tech is clearly still in its early stages. For example, another possible advancement would be for these Ad Insertions to be personalized to the podcast by being presented by the podcast hosts.I think that we can look at Spotify's ad-supported revenue and try to deduce Spotify's possible revenue from Podcast in the short to medium term. For 2019, Spotify's ad-supported revenue was $678 million with 153 million ad-supported users. Interestingly, in its 2019 annual report, Spotify announced that its ad-supported revenue saw ""an increase in revenue from podcasts of €19 million."" Spotify's ad-supported revenue saw a 25% YoY increase. Management also indicated that 16% of total MAUs (amounting to around 44 million MAUs) currently engage in podcasts.Given that overall ad-supported revenue saw a re-acceleration in the recent quarter, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect higher revenue growth for podcast ad-supported revenue. I don't think that this is an unreasonable amount to expect given Spotify's recent aggressiveness in acquiring exclusive podcast content. It recently announced a more than $200 million acquisition of The Ringer, a sports, media and culture collection of podcasts and website. This report by Nieman Lab in early 2019 on The Ringer is pretty fascinating. According to the report, the Ringer's podcast ad sales topped $15 million in 2018 and its podcast network brings in around 35 million downloads across 28 shows. Using the $19 million of Spotify's own ad-supported podcast revenue with the Ringer's $15 million and assuming a 50% CAGR, this would result in a 2025 revenue of around $260 million.However, these are just my estimates and I think what is more important to takeaway is that the podcast ad revenue business is certainly in its infancy. I believe that runway for it is massive especially vis-a-vis other traditional media forms such as radio and I believe that the recent developments have shown that Spotify is the leader in this nascent industry."

In the last month, the stock has rallied nearly 58% from its March lows and is now close to its all-time high. I wanted to see if there is an investment opportunity here.Spotify is a pioneer and one of the dominant players in the online music streaming industry. In Q1 the company had 130 million paid subscribers which was an increase of 31% from the last reported quarter. A bulk of the increase was attributed to the pandemic and the stay at home orders that followed.In terms of market share in the US, Spotify is holding on to its dominant position at a 36% market share. The music subscription market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% from $16.6 billion in 2019 to $20.8 billion in 2021. Given the massive opportunity, the company is focused on growing its subscriber count in order to capture that market.Spotify MAU vs. paid subscribers, data from company financialsSpotify's focus on growth isn't just a strategic decision by the company but a matter of survival. Music streaming services are a ""winner-take-all"" market. This is because while most people can or will have multiple video streaming services, most will only have one streaming music service provider. Most songs tend to be on multiple platforms. Listening to music is also something folks do on the background like when commuting or in the gym, lessening the need for having multiple providers. Unlike Apple (AAPL) or Amazon (AMZN) who view music streaming as just one facet of their entire ecosystem, Spotify relies exclusively on music streaming for their income.Top music apps capture almost entirety of total minutes for all music appsDespite being a 13 year old company, Spotify is barely profitable. The company achieved profitability for the first time in Q4 2018 but still ended the year with a net loss. The company ended 2019 with a loss as well. Things may not be improving much on the profitability side in 2020. Spotify's ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) fell by 7% in Q1 2020. In other words, the growth in premium subscribers was offset by the lower revenue per user. The company cited two potential reasons for this; 1) subscriber growth came from developing countries that have a lower ARPU which accounted for 4% of the ARPU decline and 2) longer free trials which was 3% of the ARPU decline. Note that I believe competition within the industry is forcing Spotify to give out overly generous promotions.Apart from competitive dynamics in the industry driving down profits, Spotify's business model itself has little economies of scale. This is because a large portion of the company's revenue is paid out as royalties to artists and record labels.Despite this fact, Spotify has gotten bad press in the past because of how little it pays its artist. The most high profile spat being the 2014 spat against pop star Taylor Swift. Spotify pays much less in terms of dollar per stream compared to its closest competitors Apple Music (an estimated $0.00348 for Spotify vs. $0.00675 per stream for Apple Music). The reason why Spotify pays so little is due to the way corporate royalties are structured. The amount paid per stream is divided among record labels, producers, and artists. However, despite Spotify actually paying out a huge portion of its revenue, the fact that artists get so little is bad for the company's public image.So why doesn't Spotify just raise prices to pay artists more and get more profit? Spotify could even become profitable if it does so. The reason why Spotify can't just raise prices is it will lose market share if it increases prices while its competitors do not. Apple, Amazon, and YouTube (GOOG) are able to hold prices down because music streaming is just a supplement to their core business.In 2019, Spotify announced its foray into podcasting with its purchase of podcast companies Gimlet, Parcast, and Anchor spending $400 million in the process. Podcasting is a growing industry with advertising revenues expected to surpass $1 billion by 2021. Understanding the industry's competitive dynamics is important in assessing Spotify's odds of success in its foray into podcasting.US Podcast Ad RevenuesThe main player in the podcast industry is Apple with its podcast app. In terms of advertising technology, the podcast app hasn't seen any improvements in the last 10 years. Due to the lack of innovation in the space, podcast advertising is largely archaic usually with the hosts giving a shout out to their sponsors directly within the audio itself. This means that only the largest podcasts are able to monetize their audiences to a sufficient degree. Spotify aims to change all that by introducing dynamic advertising via Streaming Ad Insertion.Streaming Ad Insertion announcementSo given that Spotify has developed this new technology and already has an established user base, is it planning to be the next Netflix (NFLX) or the next YouTube of podcasting? Both strategies have their pitfalls and advantages. In the Netflix model, Spotify would need to continuously put out capital in order to secure exclusive podcast content. Recently, the company inked a deal with popular podcaster Joe Rogan worth reportedly $100 million.For those keeping count that's now roughly $500 million Spotify has spent on ""original content"". Putting in large amounts of capital to fund content is the same issue that Netflix finds itself in. Podcasts may be cheaper to produce and record. However, you need to pay big money for stars. Spotify would need to pay for ""big names"" in podcasts if the company wishes to have any exclusive content worth having. Spotify definitely has enough cash to pay for this content. Based on its latest financials, the company has roughly $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents. So around 15-30 more podcast brands assuming Joe Rogan is the upper bound and that $56 million paid for Parcast is the lower-bound. With Apple about to increase their podcasting exclusives, a bidding war for shows may ensure. Take a guess which of the two has deeper pockets.The other business model Spotify can emulate is the YouTube model. They can open the platform to everyone and similar to YouTube pay podcasters a percentage of ad revenue. The issue with this approach though is that Spotify would only attract podcasters who are either 1) Starting out or 2) low to mid-tier. Given how much Spotify pays its artists, I doubt podcasters would be getting much.For context, a podcaster with a decent-sized audience can nab $25-$40 per 1000 downloads. For reference, an artist gets $3,300 -$3,500 for every one million plays a song gets. At a million downloads, a podcaster can earn $25,000 on the low end (I'm sure more popular podcasters can make more). I know listening frequencies of songs and podcasts are different but if Spotify is known to underpay artists why would podcasts be any different.I believe that established podcasts with large audiences are less likely to move to Spotify's advertising model without a Joe Rogan-esque payday. If they do move to their content to Spotify, they would probably do so on a non-exclusive basis. Under these terms, they would still do advertising for their sponsors within the video. If that happens, customers may be in a situation where they would be subjected to twice the amount of ads (1 from Spotify and 1 from the actual podcast).I believe that podcasting will just end up as an additional add on to the service and not the game-changer that Spotify needs it to be. Spotify is in a rough spot strategically having to face off against a much larger company in Apple. I can't think of any strategic advantage that Spotify may have over its bigger rival. Given that its main business hasn't been profitable in more than 10 years, the company seems to be being squeezed from all angles.I believe Spotify is extremely overvalued at its current price of $192.74. At this price, the company has a market cap of $35 billion. The entire podcast industry's ad revenue is estimated to be only $1 billion by 2021. So Spotify is trading at 35x the podcast industry's total revenue.The counterargument to my thesis is that Amazon spent years being unprofitable while gaining market share. There is a big difference though as the internet was still brand new at the time and Amazon had a technological advantage over its incumbents. Spotify is facing intense competition from Apple, one of the biggest tech companies in the world, and audio streaming as a technology is already more than a decade old. Due to poor business economics, intense competition, lack of profitability, and overvaluation, Spotify is a sell for me."
4341448,103480,2020-04-30T09:06:46-04:00,"Spotify shares surged more than 10% after the company reported Q1 results.Revenues grew 22% y/y even amid a slowdown in its ad-supported business.Spotify managed to accelerate growth in Premium subscribers, which account for nearly 90% of the company's revenue, while also improving churn.The company also remains highly liquid with no debt and strong expectations for cash flow.","Many investors have touted Netflix (NFLX) and TV streaming services as some of the biggest winners from the global shelter-in-place orders, but with the unveiling of Spotify's (SPOT) first-quarter results, we can see that music streaming is a big winner as well. Shares of Spotify are up more than 10% after the company reported earnings, capping off a strong earnings season for major tech stocks so far:Data by YChartsAs expected, we saw Spotify's Premium subscribers accelerate growth, while Spotify also said that former subscribers are tending to come back to Spotify after short absences, improving its net churn rates. While the company called out some softness on the advertising front, Spotify's ad-supported business makes up only about a tenth of its overall business - more than offset by the strength in Premium.Q1 also saw Spotify's gross margins improve - and alongside with a renewed focus on execution and a plan to slow down headcount growth this year, Spotify is well-positioned to convert its revenue growth into bottom-line expansion. Already flush with a history of strong cash flows, Spotify carries the additional benefit of being cash-rich and highly liquid with no debt.Stay long here and buy Spotify in its upside momentum.Let's dive into Spotify's first-quarter results. The company's key metrics are shown in the table below:Figure 1. Spotify key Q1 metricsSource: Spotify Q1 shareholder letterRevenues grew 22% y/y to €1.85 billion in the quarter, decelerating two points from last quarter's 24% y/y growth - due to a combination of both lowered ad pricing and FX headwinds. Underlying user trends, however, are exceptional. We note that Premium Subscribers accelerated to 31% y/y growth in Q1, up two points from 29% y/y exiting Q4. Spotify also grew Premium users by 5% y/y sequentially from Q4 - and considering that Spotify ran a very aggressive free 3-month promo in November, the sequential acceleration is a substantial feat.Spotify also notes that the company has made remarkable progress on churn rates. Churn improved 70bps y/y in Q1, which again is impressive considering Q4's three-month promos expired by the end of March. The company has also said that 70% of Spotify users who end their subscriptions tend to come back within 45 days, highlighting the staying power of its brand.Spotify also offered interesting commentary on how the coronavirus has impacted user trends and listener engagement, particularly in how daily usage has recently soared, in its shareholder letter:Of course, the other major impact of the coronavirus is the hit to ad pricing, which has impacted internet companies across the board from Alphabet (GOOG) to Facebook (FB). What we find reassuring, however, is that the large majority fo Spotify's revenue comes from its Premium subscription fees - 92% in Q1, and 89% in Q4. Though ad revenues fell -4% y/y on the basis of weaker pricing this quarter, the overall impact to Spotify's top line was only marginal. As long as Spotify continues to perform well in Premium adds and maintains low churn rates, the company should have no problem maintaining mid-20s revenue growth.Another key highlight in Q1 was Spotify's gross margin expansion in the Premium business, up 220bps y/y to 28.3%. Spotify has long contended that as it grows its listener scale, it would gain economies of scale with respect to its largest expense - royalties. While weaker ad pricing did drag down Spotify's overall gross margins of 25.5% (up only 80bps y/y), we expect the weaker ad environment to be more of a temporary situation while structural margin gains in Premium can be sustained. Spotify noted that margins in Q1 ""exceeded our expectations and finished at the high end of our guidance range.""Alongside its first-quarter earnings update, Spotify also took the rare step of re-affirming its full-year guidance (something many companies have withdrawn), with the exception of revenues. Spotify has slashed its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of €8.08-€8.45 billion (+19-25% y/y growth) to a new range of €7.65-€8.05 billion (+13%-19% y/y):Figure 2. Spotify guidance updateSource: Spotify Q1 shareholder letterThis represents a €415 million reduction in revenue (six points of year-over-year growth) at the midpoint. Now, Spotify chalks up half of the revenue cut to FX rates, which is understandable. But we don't think the remaining ~€200 million impact due to advertising revenues is reasonable. In FY19, Spotify generated only €678 million of ad-supported revenue (roughly 10% of overall revenues). Spotify's guidance cut implies that ad revenues will decline by nearly a third year-over-year. We think this is unreasonable based on three fronts:In my view, Spotify has set a low bar for itself to cross, giving investors the opportunity to benefit from a ""beat and raise"" cadence this year.Amid strength in Premium and rising margins, we also note that Spotify remains highly liquid - something investors prize perhaps more than anything else in the current market environment. Spotify maintains a hefty €3.0 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and the company has no debt. It also generated €440 million in FCF last year at a ~6% FCF margin - though Q1 FCF was down due to the timing of licensing payments between Q4/Q1, Spotify expects to maintain positive free cash flow this year.All in all, I continue to see Spotify as an attractive growth stock in the internet space, one that is both expanding its user base and delivering profit-line expansion. Stay long here."
4324773,105055,2020-02-17T15:21:56-05:00,"Spotify and Apple have ""won"" the music game, but squeezed margins mean Spotify needs a way out.Spotify is turning to podcasts to reduce royalties paid, but keep customers coming to its app for audio.Spotify's future path is treacherous, but should they come out the other-side, they will own audio.Given the risks, I am still waiting for a significant pullback before initiating a position.","If Spotify (SPOT) is to succeed, it will have to change the audio landscape dramatically. Today, it looks like a long shot. In several years, will we look back on this company as having done the unimaginable, or will they falter along the way?I believe Spotify has a good chance of changing audio forever. The question is, are they a worthy investment at these levels, or do the risks outweigh any potential benefits?With new video streaming services popping up seemingly daily, audio has taken a bit of a backseat. Audio is, however, growing too, and it's growing fast. Research from Ark Investment Management shows that audio streaming, a ~$15B market today, could soar to more than $50B by 2024. That's 32% CAGR!Image: Ark Investment's Big Ideas 2020I should add a caveat here; I consider some research from Ark Investment to be a bit of a stretch. In this case, however, I think there are several encouraging signs to back up that growth. In the RIAA's 2018 report on the music industry, they outlined how music streaming revenues continue to grow, and how the music market is also growing. The RIAA also released a similar report covering the first half of 2019, growth didn't show any signs of stopping.Then, there's podcasting. Podcasting, a simple means of delivering an audio feed, is seeing staggering growth as of late. According to data from Statista, 35% of the U.S. population could be considered monthly active listeners of podcasts in 2019. It's a far cry from, say, watching TV, but that share continues to grow year-over-year.Readers that follow Spotify might have noticed that the company has started to dabble quite a bit in the podcasting space. The company has made several significant (for the podcasting space) acquisitions over the last year, including Gimlet (2019), Anchor (2019), and The Ringer (2020).Why would Spotify be so interested in podcasting? Well, quite simply, the writing is on the wall for Spotify. While they (and Apple (AAPL)) may have won the music streaming game, there are limits to growth and profits in that industry.After product costs have been subtracted out (primarily fees to music providers per its annual report), Spotify is left with a gross profit margin of 25%. This is a far cry from most tech companies and leaves Spotify with little R&D / SG&A wiggle room if they wish to become a profitable company.That's where podcasts come in. Podcasts don't charge royalties per play. They also have ad spots (of which Spotify now owns some of the most lucrative in Gimlet and The Ringer). Ad spots increase revenue and getting people to listen to podcasts, to begin with, takes away listening hours from music. If Spotify can get customers away from music and into podcasts they:It's a wise game for Spotify to be playing at this point. They're still growing their user count, they're still the market leader, and they have to make something work. It also makes things easier for them that competitors are primarily focused on video, leaving Spotify to wrangle up the audio market before others offer their full attention.There are some hefty headwinds that Spotify will face. These headwinds, in my opinion, make any investment in Spotify a purely speculative play. Overcoming them all will be quite the task. If they can pull it off, the payoff for patient investors will be great.The largest of those challenges is complacent competition. No, not a poor choice of words, competition in the streaming music space is complacent, that is, for now. The truth is that neither Amazon (AMZN), Apple, nor Alphabet (GOOG) really cares about their music plays, but should they begin too, Spotify could be in real trouble.Spotify is a ~$26B company. Competitors offering similar apps (Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet) all have more cash than Spotify's market cap. They also occasionally have intraday trading swings bigger than Spotify. All this to say that they have the market power to erode any advantage Spotify currently holds in the music market, almost at a whim.A move that is likely coming that won't bode well for Spotify's iOS contingent is Apple's bundling. A music / TV+ / Arcade / News bundle costing $20/month will have users switching in droves, especially so if family bundling occurs at a similar price point. Even at $30/month, such a bundle would give Spotify troubles. This right here is probably my biggest fear for Spotify in the near-term.Apple's quick success in the music space also gave Spotify some pricing troubles with the record labels. It used to be thought that the many millions of subscribers in Spotify's back pocket could be used to sway music rights holders to cheapen royalties. Not anymore, Spotify is even more vulnerable to rights pricing, and if even one of the big three record labels stepped away, the company is as good as done.We know that Spotify is trying to branch out into podcasts, but is that enough? I don't think so. While it will give a slight boost to margins, the company will still need to hire staff and content producers to get those podcasts out there.Spotify will also need to continue to lead the market in terms of content quality. With more than 850,000 podcasts out there, users have a lot to choose from should Gimlet and The Ringer begin to slip. Producing top-quality content using top-quality talent does not come cheap.So, where else could they go? I have three areas:Hardware is an obvious play, and it's something we know that Spotify has been dabbling around with. The company has been testing products for the car, but that might not be enough, especially as Alexa for the car seems more feature-rich. The company should be looking to build out speakers and possibly even challenge Apple's booming headphone market with a top-tier device.Hardware, however, is expensive. Spotify's current margins don't really allow much room for R&D into this type of venture, and there's no telling if the market would opt for Spotify made headphones over a new set of AirPods. The hardware market, while it could be a lucrative addition to the flywheel, might be too risky for Spotify.How about social? Since launching in the United States, Spotify has had a social presence. The company launched its service with a Facebook integration allowing users to share listening habits with friends. To increase user buy-in, I think they have to up this social game over the long term.New services from Spotify, such as Tastebuds and Influencer Stories are steps in the right direction. For me to truly be a buyer of the stock who's able to sleep at night, I'd like to see a more significant presence in these spaces.Finally, there's fringe audio. Spotify is now the place to go for your music and podcasts, but what if it was also the place museums sent you for their audio programs? There are also a variety of apps that offer walking tours around cities, which Spotify could tap into to truly become the place you go for audio.I love the service. I love its prospects. I don't love the current price, and I don't love the risks that come along with it.If Apple were not already so deeply entrenched in the music game, I think I'd buy Spotify at these levels. Given Apple's current position and its ability to build an entertainment bundle, I would not buy Spotify at these levels. If there were a significant pull-back to the $110 range, bringing them closer to a $20B market cap, then I'd seriously consider loading up for the long-haul.I can only be neutral on Spotify at this time. Spotify is not a stock for those that want to rest easy at night. For those with a tendency towards risk, however, I can see many reasons to want to own this stock. Several more years of making correct decisions could change the audio game forever, leaving Spotify at the helm."

And it's happening now. Publicly traded ways to play this are limited, but the purest way at the moment is Virgin Galactic.","Editors' note: This is a transcript version of the episode of Alpha Trader that we published earlier this week. We hope you enjoy.Aaron Task: Welcome to Seeking Alpha Alpha Trader podcast. It has been a great couple of weeks to start the year, at least if you're long stocks. The market just keeps on keeping on the big gains we saw in the last year continuing, the Dow surpassing 29,000, the S&P surpassing 3300. And it seems like there's nothing that could stop this market from going higher, which of course, is probably the time that it turns around, but we shall see how that plays out. And we're going to talk more about that with our guest today, Cody Willard. He is the publisher of Trading with Cody, now available on Seeking Alpha. He's also a Hedge Fund Manager, a regular on business news, television, and a longtime friend and colleague of mine. Cody, welcome to Alpha Trader.Cody Willard: Hey, thanks for having me, Aaron, or as we used to call you, Taskmaster, don't they call you Taskmaster anymore.AT: A few people who still remember those days do, yes,Stephen Alpher: I'm about to start calling him that.CW: Yes, pretty good, right.AT: From now on, we are calling me taskmaster, yes. All right, so staying on task I'm being taskmaster now.CW: Well, done.AT: I'm excited to have you on Cody for many reasons, but one is because you are a stock picker and I know you're willing to talk about specific stocks. And we've had a lot of macro discussions on this podcast. And I want to hear about your big picture view of things. But I also want to talk specific stocks with you. A couple come to mind right off the bat, one being Tesla. I know you're a bull on Tesla, you were -- made a bullish call on it this past spring, when it was trading below $200. And it has been parabolic, the move that's happened the last couple of months. So is there anything that's fundamentally changed since October that you've seen that would explain why Tesla has gone from $250 and change to now $500 plus.CW: Oh boy, you know, yes, a little bit, but let me just back up and say that I actually started buying and it was around $250, I think and I bought it all the way down to $200 and did not buy it at the very bottom at $180. But yes, I've been a long time bear. I never shorted the stock but I have been a Tesla bear for many years.Heck, going back to 2008, if I may for a moment, on my show on Fox Business we actually were going to have Elon Musk as one of our guests one night and we closed down Central Park. He had just rolled out the Tesla Roadster and I drove the original Tesla Roadster through Central Park at, I don't know, 80, 90, 100 miles an hour. Just you know that zero to 100 thing. And it was incredible. And then I went on Twitter and tweeted that Elon and my followers, I maybe had 16 followers back in 2008, but I said, hey, Elon Musk is going to be on my show tonight. His company wants another $500 million welfare loan, like all of the bailout banks, and blah, blah, blah. He ended up canceling the show.And I'm not a big fan of companies that at that point really did need a lot of taxpayer largesse, just to stay alive. But fast forward to 2019. And you know, the Model 3 had come out. And that was, I know I'm trying to -- I'm very -- giving too much background, but the reason I turned bullish in spring, that the Model 3 was coming out, full self-driving was looking like it was progressing. And some of that stuff is going to be rolling out at very high margin. And so I started buying stock. I bought the car actually. I bought a Model 3 and drove it around, couldn't believe it. And then I bought the stock and made it my largest position, wrote about it a lot on Trading with Cody, which as you mentioned, you can get on Seeking Alpha.What changed since October is, among other things, they delivered the number of cars that they were supposed to deliver and the demand was there for those cars. And it doesn't look like there's a -- you know, the demand cliff that the bears have been promising forever did not come yet again. And then the Cyberttruck and the Cybertruck is revolutionary beyond what the Model 3 is. I bought more stock, the day it fell after the Cybertruck was rolled out. And I still -- I mean, I think the cyber truck is going to change transportation.AT: That's interesting because I haven't heard much about the Cybertruck since the launch. And obviously they had the silliness with the unbreakable glass shattering. And there was obviously a lot of talk about the Cybertruck. So what is it about the truck itself that you think is so revolutionary?CW: By the way, they did that glass break on purpose, just to get everybody to talk about it, which they did?AT: Which they did, yeah. That's great publicity.CW: It was an amazing amount of extra publicity for the Cybertruck. So look, the number one, that exoskeleton and using what the same materials they're using on the spaceships at SpaceX, and the fact that you literally can drive over trees, in -- around your ranch and it's not going to scratch your truck. And like the utility factor in that truck is beyond any vehicle that's ever been designed because of its durability. Beyond that, also it's faster and better. And you know, got so much of the full self-driving computer and all of that stuff too. But I think that you're going to see every car on the planet over the next five or 10 years going to be a variation of this new exoskeleton design. People think it's ugly right now, but it's been growing on people, frankly, and it's beautiful. It's pure function. There is no -- no element of that vehicle is designed for beauty. And therefore it's the most beautiful vehicle you've ever seen, it's pure function.AT: Interesting, and I'll point out that Cody grew up and lives in New Mexico where people actually you know, use their trucks to go off road and drive over trees and around ranches and stuff like that, not to go to the shopping center.CW: And by the way I have numerous friends here in New Mexico from plumbers to construction company owners who have ordered, to real estate guys, you know, brokers who have ordered their Cybertrucks. They put their deposits down and they can't wait.AT: So you know and I know Steven wants to jump in here. You've laid out basically the bullish case for Tesla is its transformational in terms of how we get around. And it's growing rapidly in terms of orders, and people who drive the cars love it. But I'm sure I don't have to tell you the bearish on, from any short case on it is just they're not making any money. And they're still relying on debt financing. So why does that not concern you?CW: Because they're here. And by the way, it does concern me Look, Tesla's not out of the woods yet, like they have to continue making great cars, getting factories built and having demand for those cars. If none of those three things work out over the next year or two, this stock can crash but I fully expect because the vehicles are so much better than any vehicle you've ever been in, if you haven't been in a Tesla, just try to test drive one, ask a friend, if they know someone who's got one. It will blow your mind how much better that car is than any other car you've been in. Even the cheap Model 3, their lowest version.There's plenty of bear cases, and arguments to be made. I mean, some of the numbers that Tesla's put out over the years can be a little bit questionable. But look, if the demand is here, then the bear case is pointless. As long as the cars keep selling, they're fine.SA: We're obviously in the middle of a nice bull run. There's a big bull run in a lot of the stocks that you're holding. You've said if you had your druthers you prefer to buy stock when it's hated. Are you seeing anything that's hated out there right now, that you like?CW: I was asked in my Trading with Cody chat the other morning if I would list my top three to five stocks. And they know that my phrase, feet to fire because I don't like to just throw out stock picks. But if you put my feet to fire, five of my favorite names, none of which are really hated, to answer your question, would be Disney, Space, SBCA, Virgin Galactic, Spotify, Qualcomm and Cisco. And that was written three days ago when my gosh, I mean, yeah, I mean, four days ago and space alone is up like another 25% or something since then.So look things are not hated right now and if they are they're probably might be hated for a reason. Twitter might be the most hated stock I own right now and even it's rallied 15%, 20% off its recent button.AT: Right, so Spotify is certainly not hated but there's a general sense out there that basically their competition with Apple or competitors, Apple and Amazon have unlimited pockets and they're going to face continued margin pressure, and how they are ever going to become profitable and it's just --they're just in a very tough business against these humongous competitors. So why are you bullish on Spotify?CW: Remember one [ph] by the way for that very same bearish argument, I was short and with -- my Trading with Cody subscribers would recall this, five or six years ago we shorted Pandora stock symbol at the time was P. It was over $20 a share and it fell all the way to the mid-single digits and we covered, I don't know $7 or $8 when Sirius agreed to buy it.AT: [indiscernible] Pandora's fate.CW: So exactly. So why is Spotify different? So the reason why, number one, they've got the critical mass, that Pandora never had. Spotify has so many subscribers and has penetrated the market to a point where that's 30 40% of the market they own, people are paying them. And beyond that, I think there's this virtuous cycle that's happening where if you ride a peloton, it offers you, hey, do you want to sign into your Spotify account? You drive a Tesla, it offers you hey, do you want to enter your Spotify account? Listen to your podcast, listen to your music. It doesn't ask that about Stitcher, Apple Music, Google, you know, anybody else out there.Spotify has won both on the critical mass side of applications and enterprises and other companies trying to use their ecosystem and tap into it. And on the consumer side that everybody knows Spotify, you get all the music there, the artists are all almost, pretty much 99.999% of any artist you're going to listen to is on Spotify. And they're making moves into the original content with podcasts. And that's something that Pandora did not have. And then the other thing is also this, that legacy music is not nearly as important as new music in coming years. And I just think the library and new music that keeps coming out, build that critical mass further for Spotify. And that's it.AT: Like when old guys like me and Steven, you know, we're still listening to Springsteen and David Bowie, the kids are on Spotify, listening to stuff that we've never heard of.CW: Yeah, and by the way, I would throw out a couple of cool names, but I'm not cool enough to know the cool names either.AT: And I was trying to think of some cool names, but I'm not going to know, I can look at my daughter's Spotify account and tell you.CW: Like I was listening to Jojo Siwa, Boomerang this morning with my six year old, getting her out of bed.AT: I have grown kids, I know Jojo Siwa, I don't think that's what the cool kids are listening to.CW: I don't know, well, are you saying my six year old daughter is not cool.AT: For a six year old, she's extremely cool.CW: You know that, yes, correct. We're going to Jojo Siwa in March.SA: Yeah. The new Eminem album just dropped today, didn't it.CW: Oh, boy, that was totally not cool, man. Stephen, Stephen, Eminem. I mean, I love Eminem. Don't get me wrong, but I don't think he is considered all that cool anymore.AT: All right, Task, I am being a taskmaster again, getting us back on track to talk stocks. Okay, so Stephen saw your note about the feet to fire stocks you would buy now, and I just looked at, did a quick look and all of them have had a parabolic or semi parabolic move off their September-October lows with the exception of Cisco, right. So is it about to happen or is there something different, Cisco's a much bigger market cap than Spotify for sure. But what is your take on Cisco here? Why do you like it? Why would you be buying more feet to fire?CW: Look, 5G and satellite internet is coming over the next year, two, three years. And the amount of bandwidth that, that is going to create, and the demand for routers, I mean, it's like that classic internet play from 1999, the infrastructure demands for Internet Protocol routers, it's going to be through the roof for the next 2, 3,4 years. Beyond that, I also like Cisco just because things are parabolic, right? And I'm not chasing stuff. I own stuff. And I'm trimming mostly and I buy a little bit here and there, some names that might, I think are like, you know, like Spotify I just started buying a couple weeks ago. But Cisco's, I think feels you know, I hate to use this term because nothing's ever safe, but it feels relatively safe. So I just sort of feel like you've got the 5G demand, you've got a dividend, and it feels relatively safe compared to Google, Apple or Tesla, which I all three own.AT: Right, and just to be clear, right now you're more in the mode of trimming around positions, as opposed to adding positions or selling or saying you know what, this has gone too far and I'm getting out of here.CW: That is exactly correct. I think it's a mistake to chase and try to capture the last 5%, 10% or whatever this last market moves going to be, or even if it's here right now, but I also think it'd be a mistake to just oh, things are overvalued, sell everything and we got to go home, because look, I don't see a crash coming right now, the economy, we can talk about the markets and economy. Do we need to do a commercial or anything?AT: We do, actually, thank you for reminding me, yes.CW: Taskmaster.AT: Right, so taskmaster, thank you for keeping me on task. All right. We're talking with Cody Willard of tradingwithcody.com, who says ""sitting tight and not trading is often the right move."" We'll be right back with more.We are back with Cody Willard of tradingwithcody.com, available on Seeking Alpha now. Cody's also a hedge fund manager. And we've been talking about some of his positions and some positions from the long side. I'm curious, Cody, we didn't ask direct, is anything you're shorting right now?CW: Yeah, I am shorting a little bit. I prefer to stay away from talking about specific names. I'm shorting other than indexes, I've been adding, I don't know for the last month slowly but surely, I'll short some of the QQQ, the SMH, the IWM, the IGV, these are all various -- SMH is a semiconductor index, your listeners are familiar with some or most of them.AT: Yes. And you're doing that as a hedge.CW: Yeah, exactly. That's nothing more than a hedge. I just, you know, I'm a hedge fund manager. Now if it was my personal portfolio, I probably wouldn't be doing much of that even. I didn't for the last seven or eight years. I have been generally bullish since 2010 my subscribers and all the viewers on Fox, remember when I turned bullish and I've just sort of -- it continues to sort of feel like that. So I think it's-- again, like things are parabolic and I think it's smart to put on some hedges but I'm not exactly like bearish and I've got some specific names that I short here and there. I will give you one At&T in its mega cap.So I'll talk about some mega cap shorts, I've got. Warner Brothers content is crap. And the idea that they can compete against Disney is silly, and they're going to try to charge 15 or 20 bucks for their streaming service and peacocks rolling out for free. Like, if that feels like Pandora, Time Warner and slash AT&T because they own it. And they have so much debt and AT&T's cell phone -- they're distracted. They've got to try to roll out 5G against all these other competitors. You've got Satellite Internet about to come compete against 5G and cell phone service. And I just think there's sort of a perfect storm brewing against AT&T here and you short it and yeah, look, it runs to 40.41 there's going to be some pain and I might end up covering, just taking the loss or something. But I don't know that, that stock can -- I'm going to walk in here one day and it's up 20% or 30%. And that's -- that's really your biggest fear with most of the short.SA: Now are you shorting T as a hedge against your long at Disney or just downright think it's in trouble?CW: No, I don't know that I would be shorting T if not for having, you know, being bullish in Disney. And I just started buying Disney, by the way, right before, what was it, maybe two months ago, you know, in the 130s right before they rolled out Disney Plus officially. And it just looked like the numbers that they were promising, which seemed way too low. And so yeah, I think Disney is a must own for the next three years. I think Disney will be a trillion dollar market cap in the next three to five years, up from $250 billion right now.AT: Well, so that's a huge move, obviously. But I'm glad you mentioned the trillion dollar market cap as this past week we had Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple all at various points hitting the trillion dollar market cap and I saw statistics that they are now representing 17% of the S&P 500, which is kind of similar to what the biggest stocks were of the S&P 500, back in 1999, which was Microsoft, Intel, Dell, Qualcomm. I think GE was the fifth, was another one. But so there are people out there and I'm sure you've heard this Cody saying, like, oh, this is crazy, silliness. It's just like 1999, 2000 kind of mania. And you were trading back then too, do you see any parallels? Does any -- do those numbers bother you at all?CW: Not that pure percentage, you know, 18% I don't know if there's some magic ratio or something that, that bothers me. It could go up to 20% or 25% simply because these companies really are so powerful and generating so much -- earning so much cash. I just Googled Cody Willard trillion dollar market cap, because I know it was back probably 2010 and I did find it, eight years ago, there was an article in the LA TIMES even quoting me saying that I was four years ahead of anyone predicting that Apple would become the first trillion dollar market cap company. And then the year since I predicted that Amazon, Google, Facebook would all become trillion dollar market caps. I'm not surprised by this. I think they're going to be multi trillion dollar market caps in the next three to five years unless the economy crashes and the economy tanks and stock market crashes, which at this very moment, I fully expect that will happen at some point in the next five to ten years. I don't know what's going to happen in the next two to three.AT: Right? And so you mentioned Facebook, and I recall several years ago, you did a segment with our mutual friend, Simon Constable when he was at the Wall Street Journal, when you were buying Facebook, when everyone else hated it. Now Facebook's hated for other reasons. Are you still long that stock?CW: Yes, I bought Facebook with even -- and Constable, the one you're talking about, I was quoted as I think I was talking about why I'm the only idiot buying Facebook at $21 a share, right? That was after it crashed after its IPO and I've made it my third largest position. And I still own it. I've trimmed it over the years, but still own the vast majority of those shares, and I own it in the hedge fund and yeah, I hate Facebook. You hate Facebook. I mean, it's -- like it sucks. But I don't use Facebook, but I'm still on it. I mean, I still have a page. I do not update or anything but my wife uses it and you're probably on Instagram. I'm not on Instagram or Facebook. That's how much I hate the company. But I still own the stock.Doesn't matter how much I hate the company, doesn't matter everybody on the planet hates Facebook and Instagram and what they do with your privacy and the Cambridge Analytic, you had, yeah and Russian bought you and blah, blah, blah, but you're still on it.SA: Continuing with Facebook. I don't know how much technical analysis you do. But I read somewhere the other day that Facebook has put in what some people call a massive double top, hit about to 2.10, 2.20 range from roughly two years ago or so mid-2018 going on a big run of late, but it hasn't taken out that high that it made two years ago. Does that concern you at all? Do you follow that sort of technical analysis at all?CW: Only to be excited that you actually were saying that the chart is bad, because I typically love the worst looking chart in the world. I typically like -- if I believe in the fundamentals, I want that chart. I want everybody hating that chart. You know, I want everybody shorting the stock I want people bashing it on TV, bring on the bears, bring on the contrarian, all the time. Like you mentioned earlier, the quote about I like to buy hated stocks, well hated stocks usually have the worst looking chart. And I would love for a Facebook to turn here for another week or two and really dip down 2.10 and get all the traders out of the stock and people and reversing for the long the short and thinking it's going back to 190 or something and then we could rip to the new highs finally or something.AT: So that's very interesting. The few minutes we have left let's talk, you know, more philosophically, because what you just described, it sounds to me like, you know, you're looking for value in the most growth-oriented areas, because you're very much, as you talk about them, looking for revolutionary companies that are going to transform industries, if not society. So is that, you know, how do you describe, your definition…?CW: 100%, my gosh, I wish I'm actually going to take that and use it in some of my hedge fund documentation and on my Trading with Cody landing page, because that's exactly why they're -- like I mean, that is what I'm trying to do. I want to find the most revolutionary growth industries, the best companies that are creating that industry, and then be able to buy them when valuations aren't ridiculous. So by the way -- I leave you guys with this, and I've written about it on Seeking Alpha, I think it was my first article on there, I don't know 3, 6, 4 months ago, and it was called the space revolution will be the biggest industry in the history of the planet.AT: And I believe that now.CW: So I think space is undervalued right now. I think you've got to be looking at space. I know space Virgin Galactic when I wrote that article was at like $7, $7.50. The day I wrote that article on Seeking Alpha, if I recall, and, the stock's now hitting $15 something, and I still own it. I've been buying more. I just you know, if people are going, and it's not about the next year, right, it's not about the $250,000 deposits that they're getting for people that want to go and be one of the first people to be blasted up and become sort of an almost astronaut by going into almost outer space with the first ships. It's about what that technology is creating and the ability to send new satellites up cheaply and the ship packages around the world faster and all of the things that you can do if you've got the capabilities to change how we travel, not just to space but around the world through space. And that's happening. The tectonic plates of society and the economy and the world have all put us in a position that in 2020, that is a real private market phenomenon that we can invest in. I have invested in SpaceX and the private market. I've invested in Virgin Galactic. I own AJRD, which is a rocket company that's been around for 50 years but still sells into this industry. I own a little bit of Boeing. I am trying to find all kinds of space related investment plays and ideas because it is the next, can't miss, greatest, biggest growth industry that will create trillion dollar economies that we're sitting in front of right now.If you thought 2008 and 2009, and again, my viewers on TV, watch me every day pound the table about the app revolution, the smartphone revolution is going to change the world. Trillions of interactions a day will be done. on smartphones, and you've got to just buy anything related to smartphones. That's where we are with space right now. But the order of magnitude of the upside is bigger.AT: Wow. I agree with you from just a pure, you know, looking at the economics of it. I'm glad you mentioned all this. Because I do think it's a very exciting place for investors to be looking at. And I just want to be clear about Virgin Galactic because I have heard some people say, they're investing in Virgin Galactic because it's the only pure play right now. But you seem to fundamentally like that company and what they offer to you. It's not just, well, there's no really other way to do it, kind of in that.CW: They -- look man, they're moving their headquarters to New Mexico down the 120 miles from where I live. And beyond that, I mean, I don't really -- I don't invest in the company because of that, but like it's happening, like there is a spaceport in New Mexico, that the government has spent 200 something -- a quarter billion dollars so that people can start sending stuff and blasting rockets, these private companies can start doing that stuff into space. And Virgin Galactic is yes. I'm fundamentally bullish about Virgin Galactic. I don't care that it's just the only one that you can really -- that's a pure play in the public markets. Man, I think Virgin Galactic at $2 billion or $3 billion is a terrific risk reward scenario. You have 100% downside. And if their vision works out of all over 5 or 10, 15 years, that stock could be up 100 fold from here.AT: All right, on that note, we will leave it here. Our guest has been Cody Willard of Trading with Cody. Cody, thanks so much for being with us today.CW: Hey, thank you guys. Fantastic interview, that was fun. Thank you.AT: It was fun. We ought to do it again. Thanks a lot, Cody.CW: Thanks Taskmaster, thank you, Stephen."

This turned him bullish on the company last year alongside the introduction of the Model 3, and had him adding to his position after the unveiling of the cybertruck.Turning to other ideas, Willard prefers buying names when they're hated, and that sort of thing is hard in today's red-hot market. Of his five favorite stocks - Disney, Virgin Galactic, Spotify, Qualcomm, and Cisco, only Cisco qualifies as not having gone a pretty nice bull run of late.Getting back to investing in truly transformational ideas, Willard says space exploration is going to be the most revolutionary industry in the history of the plant ... And it's happening now. Publicly traded ways to play this are limited, but the purest way at the moment is Virgin Galactic.","Hedge fund manager and editor of Trading With Cody, Cody Willard joins Alpha Trader hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher for this week's podcast.The episode begins with a discussion of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Willard - who was a longtime bear on the company (but never short) - began buying close to last year's lows alongside the introduction of the Model 3. Making him even more bullish was the unveiling of the cybertruck. Willard believes every car on the planet over the next five-to-ten years is going to be using some version of the cybertruck's exoskeleton.It's hard to find hated names in today's one-way stock market, so Willard - strongly bullish long-term - has been doing some trimming around a few long-held positions. ""Feet to fire"" though, Willard's favorite five stocks are Disney (NYSE:DIS), Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Willard spends some time explaining why he's a fan of the companies. Task notes that Cisco kind of deserves the hated name moniker - after all it's down nearly 20% from since mid-summer 2019.It's the truly revolutionary ideas and industries where we can find future 100- or even 1,000-baggers, says Willard, and space exploration has the potential to be the largest such revolution ever. People are spending too much time worrying about what demand might be for Virgin Galactic's $250K space flights, and not nearly enough time appreciating the technologies that will arise from such activity. Publicly-traded pure plays for space are tough to find beyond SPCE, but Willard is also an owner Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) on the space idea. He's also an investor in privately-help SpaceX (SPACE).Listen to or subscribe to Alpha Trader on these podcast platforms:"
4299595,103480,2019-10-28T11:55:00-04:00,"Shares of Spotify surged more than 10% after the company reported strong Q3 results that beat Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom line.Most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that MAU growth exceeded expectations and accelerated over last quarter.Spotify has been under pressure over the past quarter after missing expectations for Premium subscribers in Q2.The company also managed to turn a strong profit in Q3, a relieving sign amid a market environment that is wearying of loss-leading startups.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.Music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) has just quelled investors' fears of decelerating subscriber growth in its Q3 print. Spotify's third-quarter print exceeded expectations with flying colors across all key metrics: revenue, earnings, and most importantly, subscriber growth. Shares are up more than 10% on the news:Data by YChartsI've been long on Spotify since the stock began falling last quarter, and continue to believe that the company has a long recovery ahead. I'm a huge fan of the fact that Spotify is available both as a premium paid subscription and as a free, ad-supported version; Spotify's dual revenue stream from both member subscriptions and advertising has allowed it to growth with a wide set of customers. Looking forward to the future and beyond its core business, Spotify has two additional growth drivers under its belt:With so many opportunities for growth and with a robust core business, I'm encouraged by the company's third-quarter print and in my view, investors should revisit the bullish case for this stock with the company's latest wins.The number-one metric that all investors should be watching with Spotify is its count of total MAUs and premium subscribers; similar to Netflix (NFLX), which I continue to believe is Spotify's closest comp, Spotify's ability to retain and grow its listener base is the single best indicator of its business health.Luckily for Spotify bulls, Q3 results soared past expectations. Total MAUs grew 30% y/y to 248 million, accelerating one point over last quarter's 29% y/y growth; while Premium Subscribers grew 31% y/y to 113 million. Wall Street, on the other hand, had only expected the company to end the quarter with 111.2 million Premium subscribers, or +29% y/y growth.Figure 1. Spotify key metricsSource: Spotify Q3 earnings releaseSpotify's subscriber overachievement also drove tremendous growth in revenues, up 28% y/y to €1.73 billion, surpassing Wall Street's mark of €1.72 billion. In addition to strong subscriber growth, Spotify noted that churn improved by 19 basis points year-over-year and 7 points sequentially, indicating that the service is growing stickier over time. Spotify points to several drivers behind the recent growth trend. The company recently launched Spotify Duo (a discounted package for two users living at the same address) and expanded the offering more broadly into Latin America; while in the U.S., the company struck a deal with AT&T (T) to offer Spotify as a bundled offering alongside many wireless plans. In addition, in the company's third-quarter shareholder letter, Spotify wrote that ""We continue to feel very good about our competitive position in the market.""The company's strong top-line metrics also drove a surprise upside on the bottom line - which, in a market that has grown increasingly skeptical of technology companies that show strong revenue growth alongside ballooning losses, is a huge signal of strength. Spotify's margins rose 20bps year-over-year to 25.5%, illustrating that the company's unit economics become more attractive over time as the company scales. Spotify also notched a positive operating margin of 3.1%, 360bps better than -0.5% in the year-ago quarter. The company pointed to lower-than-expected spending for artist promotion and advertising (despite seemingly no impact to Premium growth rates) as the key driver behind the lowered costs.As a result, Spotify notched €76 million of EBITDA in the third quarter, up from essentially flat in the year-ago quarter; while year-to-date, Spotify's €67 million of EBITDA far surpasses a loss of €113 million in the year-ago period. Equally important to note is that Spotify generated 46% y/y growth in free cash flow to €48 million this quarter, while YTD cash flows are up more than 2x over the prior year. Figure 2. Spotify EBITDASource: Spotify Q3 earnings releaseMeanwhile, Spotify's EPS of €0.36 also far exceeded Wall Street's consensus expectations of a loss of -€0.29. Along with strong Q3 results, Spotify also released positive guidance for the remainder of FY19:Figure 3. Spotify guidance updateSource: Spotify Q3 earnings releaseThe company is guiding to Total MAUs of 255-270 million, much higher at the midpoint relative to Wall Street consensus of 259 million. Meanwhile, the company's revenue outlook of €1.74-€1.94 billion brackets consensus of €1.89 billion.But perhaps the most interesting tidbit that Spotify offered up alongside its guidance was a rare commentary on its own share price - something that few companies ever do. Figure 4. Spotify stock price commentarySource: Spotify Q3 earnings releaseEssentially, the company is grousing over the fact that Wall Street price targets averaged $181 at the time of Spotify's direct listing, despite the fact that Spotify's 2019 actuals are so far coming in far better than its then-guidance for FY19 results. The company wrote: ""The business is outperforming and the stock price is down 33% vs. the consensus. Sometimes the stock price reflects the performance of the business and sometimes it doesn’t. But eventually, it always does.""Spotify's commentary offers a good reminder to investors that despite the recent pessimism around Spotify's competitive environment and its short-lived slide in Premium subscribers last quarter, the business has still grown phenomenally since last year and we still have plenty of future growth drivers, particularly in Marketplace, to look forward to. All in all, Spotify delivered fantastic growth in Premium and total subscribers, exceeded Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, while also offering bullish guidance and an impassioned defense of the company's value relative to its current share price. The company continues to trade at far lower multiples than Netflix (which I've noted previously is partially a function of Netflix's higher gross margins in the ~30s; though Spotify's improvement in gross margins may eventually close some of that gap):Data by YChartsIn my view, investors should stay long on Spotify while its share price is still down from 2019 levels, despite stronger fundamental performance. Keep an eye out for an entry point in this name."
4300442,105372,2019-10-30T14:11:31-04:00,"Spotify continues to exhibit high growth and improving profitability.Early data indicates Spotify’s podcast strategy is working, increasing user engagement with the platform and increasing the conversion of ad-supported users to premium users.In the Q3 earnings release Spotify emphasized they believe the stock is undervalued and have conducted significant share repurchases over the past year in support of this belief.","Spotify’s (SPOT) Q3 results should not have come as a surprise to investors following the progress of Spotify’s business and the large share price reaction to the results is indicative of how negative sentiment toward Spotify had become. I believe Spotify still offers significant upside as growth is likely to remain strong and Spotify’s podcast and marketplace strategies are likely to begin having an impact on the bottom line in coming quarters.I have previously written about how Spotify’s podcast strategy has the potential to create differentiation for the platform and lower costs. Spotify indicated in this quarter’s results that podcasts are increasing overall engagement and the conversion of free users to paid users. Podcast hours streamed were up 39% quarter over quarter and podcast adoption has reached almost 14% of total monthly active users. Spotify is still viewing podcasts as a way to drive user engagement and is yet to really try and monetize the service, so the financial performance is unlikely to be impacted until at least next year.Even though Spotify believes podcasts are increasing the conversion of free users to paid users, the percentage of total users who are premium users dropped considerably. This number has plateaued in recent periods and is a number investors should watch closely. Premium users generate significantly higher revenues and margins meaning the conversion of users to premium subscriptions is crucial to Spotify's success.Figure 1: Spotify Premium Users as % Total Users(source: Created by author using data from Spotify)Spotify continues to rapidly grow monthly active user numbers, with growth particularly strong in developing markets. Latin America, South East Asia and India were all highlighted in the Q3 results due to their strong performance. Growth in developing markets may put downward pressure on margins in the short term as average revenue per user is lower, but Spotify’s strong position across a range of markets positions the company for success in the long run. Spotify Lite was mentioned on the earnings call as a contributor to growth in developing markets where data costs are an important consideration.Figure 2: Music Streaming Service Users(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Based on the Spotify’s past performance and the strategy of the company I believe Spotify is on track to obtain over 800 million monthly active users in the long term. Spotify’s strong growth in monthly active users may even be making my estimates look overly conservative.Figure 3: Spotify Monthly Active Users and Forecast Growth(source: Created by author)Spotify’s marketplace strategy aims to harness Spotify’s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans and enable artists to generate income. As part of this strategy Spotify offers artists analytics, identity management, and promotion tools and now has more than 465,000 monthly active artists, up from the 100,000 in March. These monthly active artists account for approximately 80% of the streams on Spotify. In September Spotify acquired SoundBetter, a leading global audio production and collaboration marketplace which helps creators worldwide connect and hire top audio professionals.Spotify’s marketplace strategy has the potential to differentiate the platform and make it the audio streaming service of choice for both users and artists. I believe innovations like this are important to strengthening Spotify’s bargaining position with record labels and limiting content costs. These services for artists also have the potential to be an additional high margin source of revenue, an example of this is Spotify’s sponsored listings where labels can pay to have new releases promoted to users.The primary criticism of Spotify amongst investors is that it lacks bargaining power with record labels, limiting potential profitability. In addition, variable costs are believed to make up a large proportion of Spotify’s costs, limiting increases in profitability with size. While it is true that Spotify has limited bargaining power with record labels and this will likely result in relatively low gross profit margins for the foreseeable future, I believe investors have overestimated the impact of this. By comparing Netflix (NFLX) and Spotify it can see that Spotify’s profit margins are broadly inline with Netflix’s at a similar size and Spotify appears to be improving profit margins with scale more than Netflix.Figure 4: Profitability of Spotify and Netflix(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Spotify’s gross profit margin has been relatively flat in recent periods, but I believe it can be increased substantially if Spotify can increase the number of premium users, more effectively monetize ad-supported users and increase the percentage of time users spend listening to podcasts.Figure 5: Spotify Segment Gross Profit Margins(source: Created by author using data from Spotify)Spotify’s improvement in profitability is primarily a result of operating costs decreasing relative to revenue. Spotify is disciplined with spending and its superior platform allows it to attract and retain new users with relatively low sales and marketing expenses.Figure 6: Spotify Operating Expenses(source: Created by author using data from Spotify)Spotify has demonstrated a consistent ability to generate free cash flow despite its relatively high growth rate.Figure 7: Spotify and Netflix Free Cash Flow(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Spotify recently entered a partnership with AT&T (T) to offer Spotify Premium as an add-on to select wireless plans, and to offer a 6-month free trial to certain eligible bundle subscribers. This partnership may help to drive user adoption in the US, where Spotify is less dominant than internationally.Although Spotify competes against a number of strong companies, I believe they will be the leading music streaming service globally by a wide margin. As a pure play audio streaming service, Spotify is very focused on improving their platform for users and artists which is leading to higher growth in users, lower churn and increased engagement in the platform relative to competitors. Publicly available data shows that Spotify are adding approximately twice as many subscribers per month as Apple (AAPL) and more users than Amazon (AMZN) on an absolute basis. Additionally, Amazon’s user base is skewed heavily toward ad-supported users. Spotify also believe that their monthly engagement is twice as high as Apple and three times higher than Amazon.Spotify appears to believe the company is significantly undervalued at current prices and has taken the opportunity to repurchase shares. They announced a share repurchase program in November 2018 and through September 2019 Spotify has repurchased 4,210,251 shares at an average cost of $131.71 per share with the total cost approximately equal to the cumulative free cash flow generated since the start of 2018.Spotify reiterated previous guidance for Q4 with the exception of monthly active users which has been adjusted higher.Table 1: Spotify Q4 Guidance(source: Spotify)Spotify appears to be growing frustrated with share price declines despite the business outperforming or performing in line with expectations. This was highlighted by Spotify in their quarterly results where they discussed analyst forecasts for FY 2019 from when the company listed in 2018. Spotify’s actual performance and guidance for Q4 are better than the analyst consensus forecasts and yet the company’s stock price remains far below the $181 target.Table 2: Spotify 2019 Guidance and Analyst Forecast at Listing(source: Spotify)I believe Spotify is significantly undervalued at current prices and this could be recognized by investors in coming quarters as Spotify continues to achieve rapid growth and its podcast and two-sided marketplace strategies begin to have an impact on the bottom line. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis I estimate the intrinsic value of Spotify to be approximately $190 per share."
4293384,20149,2019-09-25T01:41:26-04:00,"The leading global music streamer is among those tech stocks growing 30% annually and making limited profits.Unlike cloud-based software stocks, SPOT's public market valuation seems attractive after a material sell-off.For those looking for leading tech brands that are investing in growth, but also aren't wildly overpriced, SPOT is worth a look.","I have spent most of the last year or so cautioning investors that the likelihood of earning superior returns over the long term by paying 10 or 20 times annual revenue for money-losing companies is probably a lot lower than momentum-based investors believe. For some reason, it is big news that WeWork can't match their $47-billion equity valuation in the public markets, even though nobody in their right mind would ever pay 15 times sales for a money-losing office landlord that doesn't even own most of the buildings they lease to customers. Valuations have gotten crazy, which has made finding attractively priced investments in the tech space quite difficult.At first blush, leading music and podcast streaming company Spotify (SPOT) would seem to fit the bill of overpriced, high-growth, low margin business. After all, revenue has grown north of 30% for the first two quarters of 2019 and the company has meager profit margins as they try to become the global leader in streaming audio. With Netflix-like (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscriber numbers (about 110 million paid subscribers worldwide, growing 30%+ as well), Wall Street should be drooling over the shares. And yet, the stock has been falling precipitously lately, nearing all-time lows:Data by YChartsSo why is the stock in the doghouse? Well, there are certainly negatives. As a licensor of other people's content (music), SPOT is left as a mere middleman subject to regular negotiations around the value of the music they stream. As a result, the company's gross margins are only around 25%. That fact will limit their normalized margins and price-to-sales ratio.There are also large players taking aim at their business, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). But that competition is not new and SPOT has been able to grow in the face of it with a strong global service offering that customers love.The positives, however, seem to me to outweigh the negatives. Spotify is using their pristine balance sheet (nearly $4 billion of cash and investments and no debt) to expand into podcasting in a big way. Through multiple M&A transactions, they appear to be moving to become the leading podcast producer globally, which means they will own the content and garner much higher margins on that business segment, by keeping advertising dollars and avoiding licensing fees.The company has also managed the business to be profitable throughout their growth phase, which means they will not have to sell more stock or issue debt to fund their growth ambitions. Free cash flow has surpassed $100 million annually in both 2017 and 2018, with my firm's internal forecast being north of $250 million for 2019.Another bright spot is that SPOT is not abusing stock-based compensation (to artificially boost free cash flow and adjust their earnings figure to ""non-GAAP metrics that ignore stock comp) like many tech companies. Stock-based compensation for the first six months of 2019 amounted to about $75 million, or just 2% of revenue. That compares with numbers 10-20x higher for many software companies.Finally, despite growing the business 30% per year, SPOT actually has excess free cash flow that it is wise spending on stock buybacks. To date, the company has repurchased more than 3 million shares at prices in the $130s, which is well below the prior highs.Based on 2020 revenue projections, Spotify's stock trades for less than 2x enterprise value to revenue. While profit margins are meager today, they are able to grow the business quickly and simultaneously buy back stock without needing to raise additional capital. When I look across the tech investing landscape, there are not many leading franchises that are growing quickly, making a profit, and trading for less than 2x annual revenue. For long-term value-oriented tech investors, SPOT stock looks like an excellent opportunity."
4322178,103480,2020-02-07T09:15:00-05:00,"Shares of Spotify slid modestly after the company reported fourth-quarter results and issued FY20 guidance.User metrics remain incredibly strong: Total MAUs and premium subscribers rose 31% y/y and 29% y/y respectively in Q4.These metrics represent virtually no deceleration from Q3.Spotify has also acquired a company called The Ringer to extend its presence in podcasts, which is expected to be a huge revenue driver going forward.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. This article was highlighted under our Tech vertical. Find out how you can get access to the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Spotify (SPOT), the well-known music streaming brand, continues to prove itself as one of the stickiest and most popular internet companies of the modern age. The Sweden-based tech giant just reported fourth-quarter results - and unlike last quarter, when investors cheered the company's user growth, reactions to Q4 were rather muted, with shares of Spotify slipping modestly on the news:Data by YChartsInvestors zoomed in on two potential pitfalls arising out of Spotify's fourth quarter:In my view, however, Spotify remains a solid long-term investment. On the first issue, I believe Spotify's ~30% y/y growth in MAUs is the single most important metric to focus on, and whether or not some of Spotify's free tier users are monetized now is less important than building a deeper, global listener base. On the second, I think Spotify's expansion into podcasts is an incredibly shrewd growth strategy into a category that is perhaps growing faster than any other in the streaming world. There's no doubt that the podcast industry is still nascent, and by purchasing well-heeled names in the space like The Ringer, Spotify has a chance to accelerate its market share growth.Stay long on Spotify and buy any near-term dips.Let's highlight Spotify's most recent acquisition first. At its core, The Ringer is a media company with a large web presence centered around sports news, starting with a website (screenshot below):Figure 1. The Ringer websiteSource: theringer.comThe company was previously owned by Bill Simmons, a well-known former ESPN sports analyst and writer. Aside from web content, however, The Ringer is well-known for its library of podcasts, with thirty-plus titles. Terms of the deal, which is expected to close in Q1, were not disclosed.We know that Spotify has had its sights set on the podcasting world since last year. It spent just shy of $200 million in 2019 to buy Gimlet, a podcast production company, as well as two other podcast companies. Data supports Spotify's decision. Spotify reported that in Q4, the number of listener-hours on podcasts grew a stunning 200% y/y. The company has also indicated that putting podcasts on Spotify has also shown strong synergies with its core music platform. Per commentary from Spotify's earnings press release:In other words, think of podcasts as a classic ""cross-selling"" opportunity. With roughly €2.5 billion of cash on its books, I prefer to see Spotify investing in developing its platform and growing its universe of listeners.Let's now dive deeper into Spotify's fourth-quarter results. Take a look at the company's earnings summary below:Figure 2. Spotify Q4 resultsSource: Spotify Q4 earnings releaseRevenues grew 24% y/y to €1.86 billion; which, as previously mentioned, represented deceleration of four points over last quarter's 28% y/y growth rate. It also fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations for €1.89 billion revenues (+26% y/y).However, I believe this revenue slowdown is offset by two mitigating factors. First, user growth showed absolutely no deceleration to last quarter. Total MAUs grew 31% y/y (actually one point stronger than 30% y/y growth last quarter). The mix of that growth, however, varied slightly - while premium subscriber growth decelerated slightly to 29% y/y growth (vs. 31% y/y last quarter), ad-supported users, which generate less revenue than premium, grew 32% y/y (vs. 29% y/y last quarter):Figure 3. Spotify user trendsSource: Spotify Q4 earnings releaseWhile ad-supported MAUs make up more than half of Spotify's total user base, they generate less than 15% of its revenue, as shown in the table above. However, I'm not worried about the short-term mix of Spotify's users - as long as Spotify is building its overall user base, it has a great opportunity to convert and monetize these users over time. We've also seen from the company that additional products like podcasts tend to have positive impacts on premium conversions. Daniel Ek, Spotify's CEO, sounded off positive notes on the Q4 earnings call regarding user growth:Secondly, Spotify also offered upbeat guidance for the coming year. For FY20, the company is guiding to €8.08-€8.48 billion in revenues, representing +19-25% y/y growth. The midpoint of that range (22% y/y growth) suggests that Spotify won't see any more significant deceleration in 2020. The company's MAU forecast also suggests that the company is expecting both total and premium user growth to continue in the mid-20s. Figure 4. Spotify 2020 guidance updateSource: Spotify Q4 earnings releaseWe note as well that Spotify has been incredibly strong on the free cash flow front, raising the stock's ""investability"" in a market that has become increasingly concerned for tech companies' bottom lines. Fortunately, Spotify's free cash flow for the full year FY19 has more than doubled over the prior year,Figure 5. Spotify FCFSource: Spotify Q4 earnings releaseSpotify is a powerful brand that has captured the loyalty of hundreds of millions of music streamers, and its foray into podcasts is a natural extension of that brand. We've seen Spotify continue to grow users at a rapid ~30% y/y clip while delivering strong free cash flow growth. Hold onto this company for the long haul."
4291780,103480,2019-09-16T11:20:44-04:00,"Shares of Spotify hav been on tenterhooks over the past several months, as investors parsed through slowing revenue growth and a miss in subscribers.
        Spotify's problems mirror Netflix's subscriber deceleration in the U.S., though Spotify is trading at a more compelling valuation.
        Spotify's free cash flow has also improved dramatically in the first half of 2019. Compared to other content giants, Spotify isn't engaged in costly content wars.
        The company remains a strong international brand with a fiercely loyal subscriber base.","Digital media companies have been feeling the heat over the past several months over rising competition. Netflix (NFLX) has been squeezed as slowing subscriber growth (including its worst-ever performance in the U.S.) failed to justify its ever-spiraling content costs. Spotify (SPOT), too, has seen its share of subscriber worries, especially after reporting Q2 results that missed Wall Street's subscriber mark by about half a million. Though shares of Spotify are up modestly since the start of the year, the stock's ~15% gains trail the S&P 500's massive 20% recovery, and the stock has given up most of its gains for the year:In my view, however, Spotify is not stuck in a consistent downtrend. What I see is a strong growth stock trading at attractive prices, and a hugely valuable global brand that has an entrenched listener base. It's a good time to review the bullish case for this stock.To say that Spotify is no longer growing would be false. In the company's most recent quarter, revenues grew 31% y/y to €1.667 billion, still squarely putting Spotify in the ""high-growth"" category:Figure 1. Spotify 2Q19 resultsSource: Spotify 2Q19 earnings releaseThat revenue growth rate is also two points ahead of Wall Street's consensus of €1.637 billion, or +29% y/y.Yes, it's true that Spotify Premium subscribers of 108.0 million as of the end of Q2 missed Wall Street's mark of 108.6 million - but even so, this metric is up 31% y/y, indicating quite compelling adoption rates for a product that has been available for more than ten years (Spotify Premium launched in 2008). Spotify also reported in its earnings release that ""monthly churn declined both sequentially and Y/Y to a record low 4.6%."" That's incredibly important because Spotify, like many other consumer brands, adopts a free trial model that typically drives high turnover. In mid-May, Spotify also launched a generous promotion ($0.99 for the first three months) that was expected to produce cutters - but Spotify's low churn rates indicate that its Premium service has staying power. In other words, we shouldn't read too much into one quarter's subscriber miss, especially if churn rates are staying low.Barry McCarthy, Spotify's CFO, expects low churn rates to persist. In answer to an analyst question on churn during the Q2 earnings call, McCarthy commented as follows:What is equally compelling about Spotify is the fact that it has two revenue streams - its flagship Premium business as well as its ad-supported free version, which distinguishes it from the subscription-only Netflix, which is often investors' closest pure-play comp for Spotify.Though Spotify's Premium subscriber base missed both internal expectations and Wall Street consensus, overall MAUs (Premium plus free users together) rose 29% y/y to 232 million, versus a guidance range of 222-228 million. So perhaps Spotify isn't converting as many paid users as it would have liked, but it's still bringing them into the Spotify ecosystem and generating ad revenues from them.Ad-supported revenues grew a stunning 34% y/y to €165 million, accelerating from Spotify's first quarter and handily beating Wall Street's expectations of €156.6 million (+27% y/y). Yes, ad-supported users have much lower ARPU than Premium users (€0.44 versus €4.86 for Premium), but these are still revenue-generating customers that can be converted to Premium users down the road. Spotify also expected to add up to 33 million more MAUs through the end of the year, ending FY19 at a high end of 265 million total MAUs:Figure 2. Spotify guidanceSource: Spotify 2Q19 earnings releaseSpotify's free service was also made much more compelling with the launch of Spotify Lite, launched in the U.S. in July and joining about 35 other countries worldwide with the service. Spotify Lite is a no-frills, 10MB version of the Spotify app that runs better on older devices and operating systems, more broadly expanding Spotify's reach to a wider universe of customers (and potentially those who are more unlikely to sign up for Premium). It's worth noting as well that Spotify acquired SoundBetter in September, which opens up Spotify's opportunity for marketplace services between content creators and service providers within the ecosystem, such as sound producers and gig musicians. This further illustrates that while Spotify is a content powerhouse like Netflix, its revenue streams aren't reliant exclusively on subscription fees. Its longer-term growth rests on faster-growing ads and marketplace services.Another major differentiator between Spotify and Netflix, as well as other cash-burning digital media companies, is that Spotify manages to keep its operating expenses in line. In Q2, the company managed to improve gross margins by 50bps to 26.0%, driven by better streaming delivery efficiencies.We note also that Spotify notched a breakeven IFRS-based operating margin this quarter, 710bps better than -7.1% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the one-time costs of Spotify's direct listing in 2Q18, the company improved operating margins by 450bps. Spotify, unlike many other content-driven companies, isn't heavily ratcheting up content spending and sacrificing profitability (and even without it, Spotify is still achieving notable >30% y/y growth in both Premium subscriptions and total MAUs).Figure 3. Spotify FCFSource: Spotify 2Q19 earnings releaseSpotify's growth in free cash flow is also quite notable. Through the first six months of FY19, Spotify has more than doubled FCF to €223 million, representing a respectable 7% FCF margin (versus just 3.8% in the year-ago quarter.In spite of Spotify's obvious strengths, the company is still trading at quite a stark discount to its closest peer. At current share prices around $130, Spotify trades at a market cap of $23.48 billion, well below the $30 billion valuation at which the company opened for trading in its direct listing. At today's conversion rates of $0.90 to the euro, Spotify's market cap translates to €21.13 billion in euros.After netting out the €3.38 billion in cash on Spotify's balance sheet, we are left with an enterprise value of €17.75 billion. Over the past twelve months, Spotify has generated €6.02 billion in revenues. If we estimate a 25% y/y forward growth rate (conservative given the fact that Spotify's growth rates have hovered in the ~30% range over the past several quarters), we arrive at a forward revenue estimate of €7.53 billion.This puts Spotify's current valuation at just 2.4x EV/forward estimated revenues. If we also apply Spotify's current 7% FCF margin to its forward revenue estimate, we also arrive at a FCF-based valuation multiple of 33x EV/forward FCF. Both multiples, in light of a >30% current y/y growth rate in revenues and a >100% y/y growth rate in FCF, are incredibly modest.Spotify's revenue-based valuation multiple is quite lower than Netflix's ~7x forward revenue multiple (which is only partially counterbalanced by Netflix's higher gross margins in the high 30s). On a free cash flow basis, this comparison isn't possible - Netflix's heavy content investments have sunk the company to FCF losses of greater than $1 billion in just the first half of FY19.When it comes to great growth at a reasonable price, Spotify is the clear winner. I'd use the recent dip in Spotify shares as an entry point into the stock. Look to the company's growth drivers - continued MAU growth as well as its latest entry into music marketplace services - to lift the stock higher."
4290416,105372,2019-09-08T21:07:41-04:00,"Spotify has struggled to achieve profitability due to the poor economics inherent in the music streaming business model.I believe Spotify is on a path to becoming the dominant audio streaming platform globally, but scale will provide limited improvements in profitability.Spotify’s foray into podcasts has the potential to lower costs, increase user loyalty and increase Spotify’s pricing power with suppliers and users.","Spotify’s (SPOT) current share price assumes that profitability will be limited as a result of an extremely concentrated supplier group. I believe Spotify can increase operating leverage and user loyalty by integrating backward through the industry value chain. This will be a difficult transition to manage without alienating record labels but if successful will greatly increase the value of Spotify.In a simplified form the pre-internet music industry value chain can be broken into content creation, content discovery and promotion, content distribution and consumption. Record labels were able to capture much of the industry’s value as they performed the essential functions of discovering quality artists and took the risk of financing the production and promotion of content. For many artists revenue would not cover costs but a handful of hit artists would more than compensate for this.Figure 1: Pre-Internet Music Industry Value Chain(source: Created by author)In the internet era consumers became dissatisfied with the music industry as there was a lack of convenience and flexibility in how content was accessed. This led to consumers illegally streaming music, not so much because it was free but because it provided a virtually unlimited amount of content on demand and unbundled. Ultimately, I believe streaming is the best model for consumers and the industry as bundling content can increase revenue for the industry and surplus for consumers. I believe there is also consumer reluctance to purchase digital goods as they are not receiving anything tangible and there is no benefit to owning the good. In this scenario paying for use of the digital good through a service business model makes sense and I believe this is driving x-as-a-service business models.The internet has changed dynamics in the music industry as record labels no longer have a monopoly on content discovery and the costs of content production and promotion have declined considerably. The digital era music industry value chain remains remarkably similar to the pre-internet value chain though due to record labels having control of back catalogues and relationships with musicians. Record labels have artificially maintained a position in distribution through their ownership of content rights but besides performing some content discovery and financing production, now add little value to the industry.Figure 2: Digital Era Music Industry Value Chain(source: Created by author)Digital distribution has changed the dynamics of all media value chains and where profits accrue. In some industries this has resulted in dramatic changes in market power, like News, and in other industries change is accelerating, like TV and movies. This shift has been slow to occur in the music industry as it is extremely concentrated and a souring of the relationship with even one major label would effectively sound the death knell for a streaming service. This has led to streaming services avoiding direct relationships with musicians and being forced into royalty deals which are virtually impossible to profit from.Figure 3: Global Music Revenue Share for Major and Independent Labels(source: digitalmusicnews)Despite driving a seismic shift in how music is accessed and consumed and single handedly rejuvenating the industry, streaming services have no market power.Figure 4: Global Recorded Music Industry Revenue(source: musicbusinessworldwide)I believe a change in the music industry is beginning as the value creating functions of record labels have largely been replaced by streaming services and streaming services are reaching a size where they can begin to wield market power. Record labels will continue to play an important part due to their ownership of content rights and relationships with musicians but going forward I believe new artists will increasingly work directly with streaming services to monetize their content. For most artists this will lead to streaming services capturing much of the value as they will have limited bargaining power, but for extremely popular artists with differentiated content there will be a large opportunity.Figure 5: Potential Music and Podcast Industry Value Chains After Backward Integration by Streaming Services(source: Created by author)Musicians are in many ways in the same situation as newspapers, low content creation costs and zero marginal distribution costs have led to an oversupply of commoditized content and producers of this content should not expect to profit. Value will accrue to those who drive discovery and promotion of content, such as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG) in news and increasingly streaming services in music. Creators of differentiated content, such as The New York Times (NYT), HBO and Taylor Swift are not reliant on content discovery and promotion and hence will continue to capture large amounts of value. This is evident in Spotify's streaming data where streaming numbers follow a power law distribution and a handful of songs receive the vast majority of attention. Streaming services play an extremely important function in promoting content from the long tail through curation.Figure 6: Streams per Week for Spotify's 200 Most Popular Songs(source: Spotify)The value of content discovery relative to publishing in the internet era is exemplified by the complaints of European newpapers against Google.I believe a similar dynamic will play out between streaming services and record labels and while I don’t believe streaming services are quite at the point yet where their control of the customer relationship and content discovery allows them to make or break an artist, this will not be the case indefinitely. As consumers increasingly get their music online, content discovery through traditional channels like radio will decline, eroding the little remaining value record labels provide.This shift in the industry value chain will be aided by streaming services integrating back into content creation through podcasts, which has the potential to create differentiation amongst services and increase user loyalty. Although podcasts have existed for a long time the industry is still nascent due to a lack of financial resources, distribution infrastructure and pathways to monetization. Streaming services have the ability to alleviate these problems by providing a user-friendly platform to create and distribute content to a large audience. Content discovery has also historically been a problem for podcasts which can easily be solved by large streaming services.A large audience on a centralized platform is crucial to monetizing through advertising and is one of the main reasons podcasting has yet to attract significant advertising dollars relative to its rising popularity. To give context, podcast advertising revenues in 2013 were $45 million compared to $40.2 billion for the radio ad sales market.Figure 7: Podcasting Advertising Revenue(source: consulting)In the long run I believe streaming services with music and podcasts will replace radio in the same way video on demand is replacing television. Streaming allows wider distribution and temporal flexibility that radio does not, making it a superior option. While about 26% of Americans listen to podcasts monthly, radio still reaches about 92% of Americans every week, meaning podcasts still have a lot of room to grow. The proliferation of voice devices, wider availability of podcasts on streaming services and natively integrated podcast applications in cars are likely to drive growth in coming years.Spotify is rapidly cementing its position as the dominant audio streaming service globally and although it is yet to achieve consistent profitability, I believe it has a bright future. Unlike most software or online businesses, Spotify has high marginal costs driven by royalty payments which have prevented it from achieving profitability as it has scaled. Spotify’s traditional focus on operational excellence and efficient customer acquisition has put it on a path to low but positive profitability which is ultimately capped by market structure.Spotify is in the process of renegotiating its contracts with record labels which will impact profitability. At this stage it is unclear whether the terms of the new agreement will be better or worse, although a Guggenheim analyst believes costs as a percentage of revenue could be lowered by 2%.Figure 8: Spotify Gross Profit Margin(source: Created by author using data from Spotify)Spotify’s ability to increase average revenue per user (ARPU) appears limited as the ARPU for premium and ad supported users has been flat in recent periods, as has the percentage of users who are premium subscribers.Figure 9: Spotify Average Revenue Per User(source: Created by author using data from Spotify)Figure 10: Spotify Premium Subscribers as a Percentage of Total Users(source: Created by author using data from Spotify)Spotify’s ARPU is lower for both subscribers and advertising supported users than comparable platforms, which I believe gives them some scope to increase ARPU. But given the limitations of an audio streaming platform I do not believe subscription ARPU will approach the level of Netflix (NFLX) or ad supported ARPU will approach the level of Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook.Table 1: Platform ARPU(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Spotify’s recent strategic moves have the potential to change the music industry’s structure and allow a step change in profitability. This strategy is hinted at in Spotify’s prospectus where they discuss their two-sided marketplace and improving the experience for users and artists.Spotify’s expansion into podcasting is being enabled by the recent acquisitions of Gimlet and Anchor.Spotify acquired Gimlet Media for $200 million, a rich valuation given the lack of revenue from the podcasting industry, but it is indicative of the strategic value Spotify is placing on the segment. Gimlet is one of the leading players in premium podcasts and gives Spotify a strong foothold in content creation. Anchor is a service for easily making and distributing podcasts, with a nascent advertising service for monetization that claims to be powering around 40% of new podcasts. Anchor provides Spotify access to a large supply of low-cost content; users record, edit and host content, all Spotify has to do is index it.Podcasts should significantly lower Spotify’s marginal costs over time, as content ownership through Gimlet will create operating leverage and users creating content through Anchor will have low bargaining power. Spotify’s CEO believes that based on radio industry data, more than 20% of all Spotify listening will be non-music content, which I believe could result in a 5-10% improvement in gross profit margin. Owning content also creates the potential for monetization through other avenues, such as licensing and merchandise.Podcasts are not just a way to reduce costs though, they have the potential to create an ecosystem where content creators are dependent on Spotify for the viability of their business and user loyalty is increased through access to differentiated exclusive content.By building direct relationships with artists (both musicians and podcasters) and providing them with tools to succeed they are empowering small artists. Although I don’t expect Spotify to attempt to monetize access to these tools, I do believe it will be a source of differentiation which will enable them to attract and retain content at a relatively low cost.Spotify has established itself has the dominant global streaming platform and I do not believe it has any genuine competitors. Other players in the music streaming market are only an important consideration in so far as they provide alternative distribution platforms for record labels, thereby limiting Spotify’s bargaining power.Figure 11: Music Streaming Subscriber Market Share(source: Created by author using data from musicindustryblog)Figure 12: Music Streaming Service User Numbers(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) appear to be the biggest competitors to Spotify but given Apple’s user base is limited to Apple product owners and Amazon primarily uses music streaming as a tool to increase the attractiveness of their Prime subscription I do not believe either are a major threat globally. Spotify's lead in music streaming is clear from net promoter score data which shows users clearly prefer the Spotify platform.Figure 13: Music Streaming Service Net Promoter Scores(source: businessofapps)Spotify is currently suing Apple for what it views as anti-competitive behavior regarding commission in the app store, although I do not believe the outcome is material to Spotify's future. Apparently, Apple does not see the irony of accusing Spotify of profiting off the work of others while taking a 30% cut of Spotify’s revenue.It appears as though Spotify has little to gain financially from the lawsuit as Apple claims they only receive a 15% commission on 0.5% of Spotify’s subscribers. I believe Spotify can benefit from being given equal treatment to Apple Music in the app store though.Although I believe there are structural changes occurring in the music industry which will allow Spotify to become more profitable, I do not expect these changes to become apparent in Spotify’s financial performance in the short-term. Over time though I believe Spotify will continue to gain more favorable deals with record labels, increase pricing power with consumers through differentiation and lower costs through podcasts, which will drive improvements in profit margins. It appears markets are yet to recognize the significance of Spotify’s strategy and as a result I believe Spotify is significantly undervalued. Based on a discounted cash flow model I believe Spotify’s intrinsic value is approximately $190 per share, assuming they continue to add users and successfully execute their podcast strategy. Continued negative sentiment regarding Spotify's prospects presents a buying oppportunity for investors willing to bear short term volatility for longer term gains."
4296121,104952,2019-10-11T12:43:25-04:00,"Spotify's ARPU has declined by 1% YoY in Q2 2019. From FY 2016 until FY 2018, ARPU has decreased by ~29% overall.Spotify's share price dropped by 4.5% post its Q2 earnings call, reflecting concerns about declining ARPU and subscribers' miss.Average revenue per user (""ARPU"") decline has been expected due to growth of Family Plan and emerging market expansions in recent times, including its India expansion in Q2.","Following the 4.5% drop in Spotify’s (SPOT) share price after its Q2 earnings call, some pointed to the declining average revenue per user (""ARPU"") and subscribers’ miss as the culprits. While we agree with that assessment, we disagree with the insinuation that ARPU decline is a problem. In Q2 2019, we saw how Spotify’s ARPU declined by 1% from €4.9 to €4.86. Spotify’s push for more global expansion into highly-populated emerging countries means that we should expect that ARPU will also further decline accordingly. Recently, Spotify expanded its services to India to tap into the country’s 400 million internet user base. Given India’s population of 1.3 billion people, there is a huge financial upside for Spotify to enter the market. Furthermore, we also believe that there is a potential strategic value that Spotify can discover through this particular India expansion. As a result, we tend to side with the idea that ARPU declines represent neither fundamental issues nor weak business decisions.Being a global player, Spotify has a presence in 79 countries with over 232 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs) and 108 million paying users as of Q2 2019. Since FY 2016, ARPU has gradually declined by ~29% as of 2018 as a result of the growth of Spotify’s Family Plan.(source: Spotify 20-F)The Family Plan simply allows a user to share one premium Spotify account with up to 5 people for $15 per month. However, Spotify is well known to apply price discrimination, where it offers its services at different price points based on where the users are from. For instance, the same Family Plan that costs $15 per month in the US costs merely $2.52 or Rs. 179 in India.Contrary to the major criticism of Spotify’s pricing strategy, we feel that Spotify has been doing it for the right reason. Given its expansion to emerging countries where digital music piracy is rampant, there will be a future payoff due to three reasons: 1) Given low opportunity cost, users ending up paying for Spotify in emerging market means they stay because of the user experience, not because of the price, 2) Given the early-stage of streaming subscription service in the emerging markets, Spotify needs to quickly acquire market share before any competitor, such as Google (GOOG) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, enters, 3) The growth of users' adoption due to growing mobile and internet penetration in the market will eventually accrue to higher ARPU. Ultimately, on the way to receiving such payoff, the number of paying subscribers and retention would become bigger deals than ARPU. Providing different pricing plans across different markets has been proven to enhance both:(source: Spotify’s 20-F)Having already been in Latin America where 22% of its MAUs are based in and 35% portion of MAUs YoY growth has come from as of FY 2018, we see Spotify’s expansion into India as a more than just growth-driven expansion plan. With India’s reputation as a low-cost global R&D hub, Spotify’s footprint in the country already means it can potentially turn the expansion into a margin-enhancing move soon.Spotify’s business model is that of freemium, where it monetizes its free and paid services through both advertising and subscriptions consecutively. Going forward, we expect Spotify’s active geographical expansions to drive continual improvements in its revenue, MAUs, and subscribers. On the other hand, Spotify's recent move into podcast and audio service businesses is expected to gradually improve its overall profitability.Likely driven by its recent expansions into MENA, we saw how “Rest of the World” MAUs segment has increased by 50% YoY in FY 2018. At the same time, YoY growth in Q2 has been encouraging:Taking India's expansion dynamics into consideration, we believe that Spotify should be able to beat both Q3 and Q4 subscribers and MAUs guidance. For the full year, Spotify expects to reach 120 million - 125 million subscribers and 250 million - 265 million MAUs.(source: Spotify’s 20-F)What Spotify can improve further is its profitability. As a music streaming platform, Spotify is required to pay royalty fees to record labels for the rights to use their artists’ work in its platform. As it stands, this dependency risk is the only major risk plaguing Spotify. Though we have seen a 12 PPS improvement in its gross margin since 2016, the fact that Spotify needs to pay ~74% of what it makes to the record label means the company would benefit a lot from other sources of revenue. We see how Spotify’s recent acquisition of SoundBetter in September 2019 and its move into non-music streaming audio services such as podcast publishing can potentially drive margin expansions in the future.Considering a successful India expansion and revenue from SoundBetter, there is a clear line of sight to Spotify’s expected FY 2019 revenue of $7.45 billion, which represents a ~23% YoY growth. Given an EV (Enterprise Value) of 19.71 billion as of September 2019, Spotify trades at ~2.64 EV/forward revenue. Given ~30% YoY growth in FY 2018, we believe that the expectation of ~23% forward growth for FY 2019 is reasonable.Another approach we feel is relevant to assess Spotify's valuation would be through using its gross profit as a proxy to its overall ""top-line"" revenue. Given Spotify's ongoing dependency to record labels at least in the medium term, where the company expects to consistently pay over 70% of its annual revenue for royalties, then Spotify's gross profit is a more relevant measure of its ""top-line"" revenue. In a way, the assessment here is quite similar to how we should not treat a marketplace platform's GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) as its ""top-line"" revenue. Using the company's last-known FY 2018 Cost of Revenue of 74% (or gross margin of ~26%), Spotify's forward Gross Profit would be $1.93 billion. Further, the adjustment would put Spotify's EV/forward ""top-line"" revenue at ~10.2. Ultimately, we feel that Spotify is highly undervalued when we assess it using EV/revenue, while the EV/""top-line"" revenue approach seems to put the stock at the higher range of the valuation spectrum. Either way, we think that the increasing gross margin and the direction Spotify takes to diversify its revenue stream should provide enough margin of safety for investors.For context, Sirius XM (SIRI), which provides satellite and online radio broadcasting services, is trading at TTM 5.36 EV/Sales despite its slightly lower YoY growth than Spotify. Sirius XM acquired Pandora, which is an on-demand music streaming service that competes with Spotify. Going into Q3 and Q4, we expect Spotify’s ARPU to slightly decline further as the company starts acquiring subscribers in India. The fundamentals of the business remain strong, however, and a lot of the financial and strategic business decisions made by the management have so far been in line with our expectation of a founder-led technology company."
4278146,102101,2019-07-26T13:16:18-04:00,Spotify remains sensitive to the demands and negotiation whims of music right owners.The Street is still overlooking the lack of profitability in favor of the strong MAU (monthly active users) growth narrative.Spotify has a bumpy ride ahead in its quest for market dominance and profitability.I will be initiating a hold rating with a price target of $103.,"Spotify (SPOT) is a function of a sustainable growth story in which the company will need to expand its margins in order to actualize the future cash flow that is embedded in its valuation. On the contrary, I project weaknesses in negotiating power going forward coupled with a mix-shift towards its ad-supported music offering. Therefore, I believe the stock is ahead of itself, though the company needs all the equity dollar it can get to ward off competition as it explores alternative growth opportunities.Spotify is a leading music streaming subscription service which launched in 2008 when the music industry was battling with a consistent yearly decline in global revenue as artists struggled to monetize their songs due to piracy. The launch of its streaming service has helped buck the trend in revenue decline. However, Spotify’s sustainability relies on its ability to negotiate with creators, record labels, and artists who own the rights to the songs that are streamed on the Spotify music catalog.Spotify is going to require more than a sustainable MAU growth to drive both revenue and margins. While margins can be overlooked as the company is still in the growth phase where market share is prioritized over margins, it won't be long before investors shift their gaze below the gross margin line. This happens when the MAU growth narrative is no longer impressive. Netflix's (NFLX) recent selloff is a perfect case study in market impatience.Source: Author (Assumptions)I'll be presenting my valuation in which I expect revenue to keep growing in the double-digit range into 2023. This will be driven by Spotify's rapid expansion into emerging markets coupled with the great user experience of its mobile app which will drive rapid app install and user retention. However, while the user experience and personalization technology will drive app install, this won't necessarily translate into paid subscribers. Most users in emerging markets already have low purchasing power. This explains the slow improvement in gross margin as more reinvestment will be required to keep existing customers while also acquiring new users.Source: Author (Growth Forecast)I expect SG&A & R&D cost to remain on the high end. I don't forecast Spotify will be profitable in the near term. Rather I expect a gradual shift into more ad-supported MAUs. In this scenario, Spotify's success will depend on its ability to provide a strong measurement API for its advertisers.Source: AuthorI will be applying a 10% discount rate to my 5-year DCF model. This is the average weighted average cost of capital for software (entertainment) companies in the U.S. I forecast revenue growth will approach the single-digit range faster than expected. Regardless, I'll be applying a growth till perpetuity of 3% to give a terminal value of $13.6 billion. Shares outstanding will grow by 2% and I'll be including Spotify's holding in Tencent into by cash estimate which is currently worth $2.6 billion.Source: Author (Sensitivity Analysis)The sensitivity table above shows the range of share price at different WACC & growth till perpetuity. I prefer a more conservative WACC of 10% and growth till perpetuity of 3% as this perfectly balances the risk inherent in holding this stock versus the gains that could be derived if users continue to adopt its paid streaming service. Risk-loving investors can explore a lower WACC & higher growth rate combination. In that scenario, Spotify could be potentially worth $199.Based on my valuation, Spotify remains a risky bet in the near-term. While the Street will continue to overlook the lack of profitability in the near term, management has to continue to deliver on the projected MAU growth expectation. I will be initiating a hold rating with a price target of $103."

I will also be discussing Spotify's financials in terms of estimating future revenue (in 2023) based on assumptions about premium subscriber growth, monthly ARPU changes as well as the overall total addressable market for the global music streaming industry. I will argue that despite increasing competition and declining ARPU, Spotify can (with conservative estimates) still manage to double its annual revenue within 5 years through continued overseas expansion. As mentioned in Part I of my Spotify series, despite increasing competition in the streaming space (particularly in the US), Spotify is the undisputed global leader and it continues to expand. For example, Spotify recently launched its services in one of the few large countries that it is still absent from - India. In under a week, it managed to get 1 million paid and free subscribers. While many were quick to point out the many obstacles and difficulties Spotify faced (which are also indicative of the same risks it faces in other parts of the world), I remain optimistic that expanding Spotify's global reach is necessary. I will first discuss the risks and obstacles it encountered in India as well as the rest of the world.Spotify is not content to just be the app for users to stream music but is instead trying to create a comprehensive eco-system for all audio needs. This is in line with its goal of creating a Spotify where 20% of content streamed is non-music. I believe that this is important in order to compete with localised apps as well as the eco-system created by YouTube, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Source: Edison Research Spotify's newfound focus on podcasts can be seen in its recent update to the mobile app where 'Your Library' now has two main sections - Music and PodcastsI will now discuss Spotify's strategy regarding podcasts and how it fits in its overall plans as well as how it can compete with other podcast platforms such as Apple. Source: EngadgetSource: Anchor Source: Information from Spotify's Annual ReportsAs seen in the above graph, Spotify has actually seen drastic improvements in its gross margins over the last 3 years. The improvement in its financials allowed it to hit operating profits for the first time in Feb 2019. “[F]or the first time in company history, Operating Income, Net Income, and Free Cash Flow were all positive,” the company made an operating profit of €94 million, or about $107 million. Total Addressable Market (worldwide). In 2018, Ark Investment suggests that the streaming music Total Addressable Market (TAM) could be around $50 billion by 2023 under the assumption that ARPU could be $6 with streaming penetration of around 14% of the approximately 5 billion smartphones that are expected to be around by then, which would lead to around 692 million paid streaming subscribers. Valuation. As seen below, Spotify currently trades at a P/S ratio of around 4.2 which is lower than what it has generally traded at, in its short time as a public company. It is also at a significant discount to Tencent Music. I believe that this discount exists due to the uncertainty regarding the new licensing deals that have to be negotiated with the big 3 as well as the uncertain path to profitability. I hesitate to use other forms of valuation such as the more traditional DCF model or even other comparative metrics such as EV/EBITDA or P/E ratio simply due to the uncertainty of future costs of revenue as well as operating expenses. I believe that there are simply too many uncertainties to be worth it to model for costs of revenue, operating expenses or free cash flow. Data by YChartsSource: MediumI am confident that Spotify as the global leader in music streaming possesses a growing economic moat. While its moat may not be in exclusive content (such as Netflix), I believe that its advantage comes from its platform that focuses on constant innovation and a very successful discovery strategy. Its continued overseas expansion and focus on podcasts as part of its ever-growing audio eco-system also puts it a step beyond its American competitors (Apple, Amazon, YouTube) as well as its international competitors. However, in the coming months, it'll become important to watch the licensing deals made with the Big 3 companies and how it'll impact costs of revenue and hence gross margins. While the Big 3 have sold their stakes in Spotify and have shown to be quite aggressive and antagonistic towards Spotify in recent months, Music Industry Blog has laid out a rather interesting argument. It argues that all 3 are stuck in a sort of Prisoner's Dilemma where none of them can individually not do a deal with Spotify or risk losing out relative to the others. Furthermore, with streaming revenue making up such a major component of the Big 3's revenue stream, it is also in the Big 3's interest to strike a new reasonable deal with Spotify. In the next few quarters and years, it is necessary to keep track of Spotify's important metrics, particularly premium subscription growth, ARPU as well as to track its performance overseas (particularly in the emerging markets). This is necessary to determine if its overseas expansion strategy will follow the successful route of Latin America or the more problematic route of India.What would make the story even more interesting would be an acquisition by Spotify of a major label. Sony/ATV's CEO said in Jan 2019 that the industry is ripe for consolidation and further acquisition with over 10 new companies that have invested money into purchasing assets in recent years. However, more realistic would be the consolidation of the ever-expanding streaming industry as Spotify seeks to acquire streaming services in overseas markets that already have licensing deals in place and are well acquainted with local tastes. It would appear that Spotify is currently trading at a range from 110-120 to around 150. I would thus be interested in going long SPOT at around 110-115 at this point in time."

Our thesis on SPOT was discussed in the 2018 annual letter.In summary, our thesis is rooted in the future monetization of SPOT's non-US market share where its first-mover status still dominates in many of the 79 countries it now operates in. Last quarter SPOT launched in India and added 1 million users in the first week alone.Our perception is that for the majority of non-North American high-school kids with a mobile phone, Spotify is the primary app they have ever used to access music and podcasts. This is the most undervalued component to the long-term Spotify growth story.The typical US-centric investor is accustomed to the story of expanding to “rest of the world” once the local market is penetrated. As a Swedish company, SPOT did the opposite. Now in the final stretch of spreading their seed, SPOT appears to be in knife fight with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the US for subscribers.Our counterview to the consensus is that outside the US, there is a low probability that Amazon’s new free online music catalogue and Apple’s steaming product (exclusively for Apple devices) is a material threat to Spotify’s two-way marketplace. The US market is important, we get it. But the US market is also plenty big enough for Apple, Amazon and Spotify to co-exist and take share from radio.SPOT’s enterprise value today implies a rough value of $220 per premium subscriber (vs. $1,400 for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)). This is too cheap considering the lifetime value of customers that are in the very early stages of being monetized. Spotify is profitable, has plenty of cash, has huge insider ownership, and business decisions are being made for the very long term.SPOT also owns 9% of Tencent Music through a partnership in the early days of playing out. This is a strategic advantage with significant hidden optionality given their combined leverage as the record label industry consolidates and Apple/Amazon spend more to compete in music streaming. SPOT’s publicly listed stake in Tencent Music is worth about $2.3 billion today and probably much more over time."

A sign of the times?","By Daniel ShvartsmanThe first half of 2019 saw a lot of green in the markets, as broader indices recovered from the brief bear market in the second half of 2018 and returned to new heights. Despite that, the wall of worry continued to grow, even if the specific concerns changed. Instead of a rising rate environment, expectations have shifted to a possible rate cut even with good job numbers. Geopolitical flashpoints have (re-)emerged in Venezuela, Iran, and in the ongoing China-US trade conflict. European economic growth appears to be slowing, and nobody's quite sure where we are in the US cycle. Oh, and another presidential election cycle is beginning.So, what to make of this all? We decided to take the temperature of the markets with a midyear Marketplace Roundtable. We asked our Seeking Alpha Marketplace contributors - authors who run investing services and provide ideas and guidance to members about how to think about the markets or at least certain parts of it - to share their views on the current climate and how they're positioning as a result.Over 55 authors participated in our survey. We've grouped their responses into several categories, ranging from tech to commodities, biotech to dividends and income investing. We're going to share their responses in those grouped categories over the coming week or so. Each discussion will have two common questions about the market as a whole, two sector-specific questions, and a round of current favorite ideas. We hope you enjoy the discussion, and welcome you to join with comments on these issues or on any key points that didn't come up, or follow-up questions.Today's discussion focuses on small-caps. As an asset class, these stocks have lagged their larger peers, even though the Russell 2000 as an index sports a high valuation. And even as we ask about small-caps, we find a few of our panelists looking at bigger companies. We have the following panel to weigh in on the situation:Please check the end of article for disclosures - authors disclosed positions based on stocks they respectively discussed.J Mintzmyer: It seems clear that the market heavily overshot on its fears, but it's also interesting to note that certain sectors - energy and shipping come to mind - are still valued at near all-time record low valuations. These lower valuations extend to other areas of the stock market, including industrials and retail. The market ""doubt"" is certainly not resolved yet in shipping, but rates in all segments we cover are higher over the past 12 months than in the year previous. I see significant value opportunities in this market despite the broad indices at or near record levels.Safety In Value: The market always has something to worry about, which is where the old expression ""climbing a wall of worry"" comes from. While I don't predict the general market direction, I do note that expanding the investment universe to include small companies statistically has improved returns. It also gives the stock picker an edge, because there are more options to pick from. There are definitely pockets of value in small stocks even at current market levels.Joshua Hall: The only thing the market is confident about is the direction of the Fed. However, I think it is ahead of itself. A resolution to the trade war could throw a wrench in the outlook for rate cuts and do damage to the long bond, long conservative high-income stocks trade that is popular right now. Many market participants have been wrong about the end of the economic cycle for years now. I think many are missing the fact that China is now such a large piece of the global economy that there really are two cycles at play for investors: a purely domestic U.S.-focused credit cycle and a global industrial economy. There is some overlap, but the ""end of the cycle"" mindset of the past no longer works the way it used to.Long Hill Road Capital: The market is always going to be concerned about one thing or another, to one extent or another. I don't find it useful to get caught up in these topics. My focus is to own a concentrated portfolio of high-quality businesses that are trading at prices that reflect very modest long-term expectations. These businesses are so well-positioned with such strong advantages that it feels almost inevitable that they will be far bigger and more profitable 10 years from now. The younger Long Hill Road used to assume these sorts of businesses couldn't possibly be cheap, but I now appreciate that some can be perennially undervalued. Amazon's (AMZN) never ""looked cheap"" before, yet it has been a 1,032-bagger since its IPO. That is perennial undervaluation.J Mintzmyer: Although we've done quite well YTD (as I write this, our Speculative portfolio is up 32% YTD and our Risk/Reward portfolio is up 20% YTD), the majority of the shipping sector still sits near all-time low valuations. We're finding a few companies with surging cash flows who are still caught up in the ""trade war"" misnomers, leading us to significant dislocation trades.Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: Old companies versus new companies (is a key theme). For example, practically any brick-and-mortar retailer trades extremely cheaply. One specific example being Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY). BBBY trades for less than 5x FY 2020 EPS. BBBY has a rock-solid balance sheet, with plenty of cash, it is highly free cash flow-generative, with shareholder activists agitating the Board for change, and a strong share repurchase program to boot. Compare this sort of investment with the likes of Wayfair (W), which is burning cash and trades at a soaring valuation. There is simply no comparison in valuation. Joshua Hall: Outside of iron ore and rare earths, it has really just been more of the same in industrial & technology metals. An interesting commonality that I am now seeing in the charts of many miners is a longer-term funnel pattern pointing to an inflection point perhaps later this year. By this I mean that the share prices of many miners are bottoming against lower trend line resistance going back to January 2016 and poised to break out of the downtrend that they have been in since early 2018. I see similar patterns in U.S. banks.Long Hill Road Capital: I try to always to be learning about businesses that are a very small fraction of their future size, looking out 10 years or longer. That includes studying the filings and conference call transcripts, but also talking with their customers, suppliers, competitors, former executives, or other industry participants. My objective is to understand as many of these businesses as possible so I can be prepared to invest if one of them is suddenly trading at fantastically low price. Given the nature of stock markets, it is usually only a matter of time before that happens. A few companies I've looked at lately are Burford Capital (OTCPK:BRFRF, OTC:BRFRY), Upwork (UPWK), and Chewy (CHWY).J Mintzmyer: I'm particularly excited (and generally bullish) about the pending IMO 2020 low-sulfur fuel regulations for shipping companies. I expect we'll see significant profit improvements for the firms with modern tonnage and engine exhaust scrubbers. I've made a few specific allocations to maximize the play here.Safety In Value: One thing I'm looking at in the back half of 2019 is bubbles. It seems possible to me that there is a bubble in certain venture capital/IPO firms. My next big piece for subscribers which should come out in the next week or so is symptomatic of my philosophy on bubbles. It makes sense to take as much of the money out of a bubble as possible while positioning for it to burst. This piece focuses on a real estate firm that is taking transient business in a bubble area but is valued based on its long-term business, so downside if the bubble breaks is minimal. Joshua Hall: At the beginning of 2019, I told subscribers that I thought lithium was going to be a 2nd-half 2019 story after some more pain. I have a feeling that there is some sort of headline catalyst coming that will change investor sentiment. Perhaps it is a major acquisition, especially from outside the industry, like from a Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A). Perhaps it is finally the realization that a 10-fold increase in lithium supply over a decade will not come as easy as many think. There are now too many major commitments to electric vehicles, and the pressure of the supply chain need is building. Something is going to break. I just sense that one major news headline could do it.Long Hill Road Capital: I'm close to fully invested in nine great businesses. My top four holdings are about two-thirds of the portfolio. I don't have specific expectations for what their stock prices will do in the second-half of this year or next year. However, even assuming fairly modest long-term expectations, I expect them to compound at some double-digit average annual rate for quite a long time.J Mintzmyer: I see substantial value opportunities in shipping and energy. I primarily ""stay in my lane,"" and I focus on providing the world's best shipping equity research for Value Investor's Edge.Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: There seems to be a large divergence between companies which are posting slower growth but are highly free cash flow-generative, compared with newer, faster-growing companies with no profitability in sight. This is trend is evident across all ranges of companies; examples come from media companies like Discovery (DISCK) to basic material companies such as L.B. Foster (FSTR), which are extremely cheaply priced, particularly when compared with companies which are posting extremely rapid growth, with no profitability (once you account for stock-based compensation), but are selling the dream to investors.Safety In Value: I think the small and microcap space is an exceptional place to be looking for ideas right now. As noted, valuations of small companies have lagged the broader market recently, but small firms have outperformed over time. This sets the market up for a great reversion to the mean rally in small firms. Additionally, most of the ""known unknowns"" that seem likely to affect the market are trade-related, and small firms are usually more domestic-oriented. That means they are less likely to be harmed by trade issues, but benefit from stimulus (like lower interest rates) that targets the trade-based economy.Joshua Hall: Many of the small-caps that I follow outside of mining are just way overvalued. From my perch, the small-caps are lagging because of this and may continue to do so.Long Hill Road Capital: I don't have a top-down view about this. There are certainly far fewer institutional investors looking closely at small-cap and micro-cap companies, so there is plenty of room for mispricing. That said, even widely followed mega-cap companies can be significantly mispriced. Of my partnership's 9 holdings, 7 happen to be mid-cap or large-cap, while 2 are small-cap. That's not by design. I just try to invest in companies where the future growth feels most inevitable to me and their stock prices reflect very modest expectations.J Mintzmyer: Current momentum favorite is Dorian LPG (LPG). They trade around a 40% discount to net asset value, which is where you'd expect a distressed situation to be; however, this company is actually drowning in cash flow in the current market. Although we don't expect the current rates to last, at levels of $60-70k/day for their ships, Dorian trades about 1.5x current cash flows. The balance sheet is great, liquidity is strong, the NAV discount is large, forward supply/demand is good. I've seen a lot in shipping, but I've never seen something quite like this...Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: Liberty Global (LBTYK) has a huge spin-off looking to get the green light from the European Commission (EC) at the end of July 2019. This spin-off has recently been rumored in a Reuters article to be given the go-ahead by the EC. If Liberty Global does divest of this asset to Vodafone Group (VOD), it will receive $12.7 billion in cash and $10 billion of debt will come off Liberty Global's balance sheet. Given that the stock only trades for $20 billion, this John Malone company (29% shareholder), with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) as a 6.2% shareholder, which is led by outstanding management, will be trading extremely cheaply. Management will most likely make a huge buyback. Safety In Value: Bluegreen (BXG) is a timeshare developer. Their parent company made a takeover offer at $16, but backed out because of a big lawsuit from a major supplier. The lawsuit was settled for $0.56 per share, but shares are still under $12, and are cheap compared to the other firms in the industry. The shares have been recovering after arbitrage buyers bailed out, but still offer excellent value. I wrote this up fully here.Joshua Hall: Plain and simple, Rio Tinto (RIO). Iron ore is over $110 per tonne, and the stock is priced for $65 per tonne iron ore. The forward-looking dividend yield is likely going to be in the 7% range. The company is raking in cash, and a new share repurchase plan or acquisition could be coming soon to provide another catalyst. No one seems to believe the iron ore rally can be sustained. If it dies tomorrow, you have a big margin of safety with the current valuation. If it runs longer and hotter than expected, then Rio Tinto will have even more cash to reward shareholders.Long Hill Road Capital: It feels inevitable to me that Spotify (SPOT) will be far bigger and more profitable in 5, 10, and 15 years. Many investors, even those who look for mispriced growth, seem to dismiss the idea of investing in Spotify because they think the major labels, who control the majority of music rights, will never allow it to capture greater economics. The idea that Spotify is the next Netflix (of audio) is quickly dismissed because they assume the concentrated supply of music rights and the variable cost structure will never allow the company to show meaningful operating leverage. Here's my view. Spotify is already critically important to the labels. Streaming music is already the majority of recorded music revenue for the labels, it's the only form that's growing, and Spotify is the largest contributor. At the same time, Spotify is expanding into all forms of audio, notably podcasting, but also meditation, audiobooks, and perhaps news, weather, sports, and entertainment one day. As a result, over time, the labels should become increasingly reliant on Spotify, while Spotify becomes decreasingly reliant on the labels. So, I expect margin expansion to come from a greater mix of higher-margin content (i.e., podcasting, etc.), better economics with the labels due to lower royalty rates and monetizing its data-driven insights (the ""marketplace"" strategy), optimizing the ad-supported business with greater self-serve/programmatic, and fixed cost leverage. I also think management's long-term guidance for R&D of 12-15% of revenue is quite high. At some point, given the revenue growth outlook, that would become a very large chunk of R&D spending in dollar terms. I'm not sure it will be quite that high. A final point is that Spotify's ad-supported business is underappreciated. One day, every car on the road will have an embedded modem, and drivers will seamlessly access Spotify (paid or ad-supported) and other streamers from the dash. Given streaming is a demonstrably better user experience than terrestrial radio (due to interactivity, personalization, discovery, playlisting, etc.), I consider it inevitable that streaming will replace AM/FM radio over the long term. ""Everything linear dies,"" Barry McCarthy (Spotify's CFO) likes to say. The labels and artists would also applaud this shift, because in the U.S. terrestrial radio is not required to pay performers and copyright owners, only songwriters. Globally, terrestrial radio is a $40 billion market. There are other players, but I view Spotify as best-positioned to capitalize over the long term. As for valuation, I maintain four different 20-year scenarios for Spotify. I can't predict the future, but my guess is the future will fall somewhere within these four scenarios. When I discount the cash flows for each scenario, I conclude that today's stock price seems somewhere between fairly priced in a disappointing future to staggeringly cheap in a bright future.***Thanks to our panel for participating!

Netflix is not a good comparable.Despite being a high-quality business, there is not significant upside that warrants owning Spotify.","Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is a high quality business in a tough industry. Despite intense competition, Spotify's moat is underestimated. Spotify was the first streaming service that has taken the recorded music listening experience to the edge. Music streaming enables users to listen to any song, anytime, anywhere. Streaming has spurred growth in the industry and provided listeners with a far better experience than previous services.Despite the benefits from a consumer's perspective, Spotify will have a tough go making money. The music industry as a whole is quite small. Spotify will eventually reach a point where its growth is constrained by the industry.Spotify is far too risky to warrant owning. That being said, it is a high quality business that listeners love. While the economics aren't great, expect Spotify to be able to fend off competitive threats.Music is ingrained in our culture and provides people with a great deal of joy. Music variety is far and wide, but most people have certain genres and songs that speak to them. Spotify and other streaming services cater to every type of music preference.With that in mind, it's not surprising that largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) use music as a means of building out their ecosystems. If large corporations can entrench themselves in the music industry, they can infiltrate other aspects of consumer habits.Competing in the music industry is a drop in the bucket for the tech giants. Apple's $60 billion in net income for fiscal 2018 was higher than the entire $51.5 billion market size of the music industry globally. It's no surprise Apple has had wild success with adoption of its streaming service. Apple's iPod was a precursor to the iPhone. The synergies of entering streaming were natural for Apple following previous success. Music streaming services like Spotify rendered Apple's iPod and iTunes obsolete.Source: StatistaInvestors must consider the obvious competition of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube. While YouTube is an outlet for music listening, it's much clunkier than true streaming platforms. Spotify's service really competes directly against YouTube Music. YouTube Music is a much smaller competitor, it has not gained nearly the traction as others such as Apple.Source: MIDiA/Music Industry BlogWhile Apple will certainly be able to win users over due to its far bigger ecosystem, Spotify has not been phased based on subscriber growth or total market share.Source: The Wall Street JournalSpotify's aggressive growth has continued. Although Apple has recently surpassed Spotify in terms of paid users in the United States, Spotify has commanding global lead.Spotify's free service is a key advantage over Apple. Users of Spotify's free service may be more inclined to pay up after seeing the ad-free benefits. Apple has countered by offering their service free for limited time. Apple is also at a disadvantage amongst Android users. Apple Music's Android app is reportedly inferior to its iOS counterpart.Spotify is not the Netflix (NFLX) of music despite the comparison. Spotify has key advantages that make it more attractive than Netflix. This will enable Spotify to withstand the challenge from intense competition. Netflix is a capital intensive business with a weak moat. Netflix is forced to spend copious amounts of money on content to stay relevant. What is not dissimilar is the competition from tech behemoths. I expect Spotify will charge on while the tech giants eat Netflix's lunch. Understanding these differences will help investors grapple with Spotify's real challenge.Pieces of entertainment lose relevance over time. Today, it's Avengers Endgame and Game of Thrones. Tomorrow, it will be something else. Now that Game of Thrones is over, AT&T's (T) WarnerMedia will have to go back to work for the next blockbuster. Content businesses mirror the pharmaceutical industry, there's a shelf life for profiting from individual ventures. AbbVie (ABBV), maker of the number one selling drug in the world, trades at less than 10 times forward earnings. The concern is revenue eroding from generic competition. The content business is no different. Companies must continue to go above and beyond to produce something people will watch.Investors never want to see a passive management team. But, at the same time, the ability for a business to become passive is the definition of competitive advantage. Netflix will always be under pressure for the next hit movie or drama. Netflix funds its search with debt.Spotify's primary business is streaming content owned by labels. It will not face the same pressures as Netflix. The nature of Spotify's business will enable it to produce original content such as podcasts without the extreme capital expenses that Netflix incurs. Spotify is more like SiriusXM (SIRI) in this regard. SiriusXM was able to renew Howard Stern's contract for 80 million dollars a year. When Stern initially signed with Sirius in 2004, the satellite radio giant was struggling. The company has been quite the turnaround story since. Spotify's large acquisition of Gimlet Media represents the company's podcast ambitions. Original content is a huge positive for Spotify as long as it can keep costs down.Podcast production is much less capital-intensive than movies or TV shows. While Netflix is losing billions under operations, Spotify generated 344 million of operating cash flow in its last fiscal year. Spotify has a clear structural advantage.Spotify's margins are far from spectacular. Gross margins have increased slightly to 26% over the past several years. Gross margins will never be spectacular because of royalty fees. SiriusXM is able to boast almost 80% margins after royalties. Spotify will always be reliant on the big record labels. It won't be able to drastically improve margins. It should be able to reduce operating costs when scaling takes effect and users are locked into their service. Margins could improve if streaming services can leverage their size in royalty negotiations.Spotify promotional offerings such as family discounts and student discounts have pressured ARPU. Spotify has used cheap offerings to garner users. Spotify will have some pricing power once users are locked into the ecosystem, but raising prices above competitors such as Apple Music would be a mistake at the present time.With the stated competitive advantages, it's hard to imagine a future without Spotify. It is quite easy to question whether or not Spotify will generate profits that create shareholder value.Spotify's premise for existence is helping to prevent piracy in the music industry. The Guardian reports that a staggering 38% of listeners still illegally download music. Most of the illegal downloads come from YouTube. Also included in the article is the shocking difference between revenue per user between Spotify and YouTube. While Spotify generates $20 per user, YouTube generates less than $1. The IFPI, which represents the record industry, has complained that YouTube is not contributing enough to the industry.Increased pressure on outlets of potential piracy such as YouTube could improve Spotify's business. Spotify is already offering a high quality service at a low price. Further disruption of pirated content could be Spotify's gain.Spotify is a valued-added service to the music industry. The days of spending $1 per song on the iTunes Store are over. There have been many complaints from various artists, including Taylor Swift over Spotify's fees. But Spotify has indeed solved a problem. Artists receive nothing from pirated music. Artists should direct their efforts towards enhancing security against music obtained illegally.User retention is the ace in the hole for Spotify. Spotify has not disclosed specific retention numbers, but it does state in its form 20-F that,The quality of services is outstanding. Spotify has truly taking listening to music to nearly the edge of capabilities. Listening to any song at any time is about as good as it gets. There will be room for improving algorithms that help users discover new artists and finding synergies in offering listeners new experiences. As the streaming market matures, Spotify's enormous user base will shield it from competition. Spotify's base provides a strong moat. Listeners who develop playlists and large libraries of songs will be reluctant to switch to other services of similar quality.Source: IFPIUnfortunately, for artists, the music industry has difficult economics. While anti-Spotify sentiment has become subdued to a degree, streaming is responsible for increasing revenue for the recorded music industry. Besides the handful of music superstars, music production is a labor of love. Artists should not expect to earn a living from streaming. It's the nature of the business. There is a large supply of quality artists, and easy ways to listen for cheap. Spotify is not taking revenue away from the industry, it is bringing revenue in that otherwise would not be coming in. The digital revolution that made cheap listening easy is not going to revert.The music industry as a whole is quite small, with just $51.5 billion in revenue in 2018. With a market cap of $23 billion, Spotify trades at 0.45 times industry sales. Spotify took about 10% of that $51.5 billion in 2018. Running into size constraints could be a real problem for Spotify.The industry as a whole has returned to growth after years of decline. There is difficulty in seeing the industry as a whole grow significantly. Music has been around since the dawn of humanity. It is not an emerging trend in technology in which we can forecast high compounded annual growth rates. It does appear that streaming has been a major boost to the industry, but that boost can only go so far.That being said, music streaming services will gain more leverage over record labels as time goes on. Streaming will continue to eat away at outdated methods of listening to music. Spotify's $23 billion valuation is slightly below the $26 billion of SiriusXM. Spotify should easily surpass SiriusXM in terms of sales. Spotify's reliance on others' content will make it harder to capture revenue to the bottom line. With losses expected into the future, it is too difficult to conclude that Spotify is undervalued. To generate a 100% return, owning Spotify at these levels would mean the company would trade equal to one year's sales of the entire music industry. This doesn't seem likely.Spotify is worth owning if merely taking quality into consideration. Unfortunately, owning quality at the wrong time for the wrong price will not deliver alpha. Analysts do not expect Spotify to turn a profit for the next several years.When searching for value amongst growth names, it's difficult to take a chance on a money-loser. Modeling the scale of companies with slim profits is much easier than a company struggling to turn a profit. Shorting a quality business like Spotify would be a mistake, but so would owning shares in a business limited by the poor economics of the music industry."
4255726,101969,2019-04-22T12:50:12-04:00,"I've been an Amazon shareholder for years, and have tremendous respect for the company's abilities and pioneering culture.Amazon's new ad-supported streaming music offering will incrementally help grow Amazon's advertising business, but it is unlikely to have an noticeable impact on Spotify.Amazon's real motivation for this is to position itself with a free streaming alternative to terrestrial radio for the future when all cars have embedded modems.","Last week, Amazon (AMZN) launched an ad-supported free streaming music service. When the news first broke last Monday, Spotify's (SPOT) stock was down over 5% at one point that day before closing down 4.4%. Clearly, the market got spooked that Amazon's entry into the free ad-supported streaming music business would have a negative impact on Spotify, which offers both a paid Premium ad-free tier and a free ad-supported tier.I've been an Amazon shareholder for years, but I'm skeptical that this service will have any material negative impact on Spotify. Why?First, Spotify had 207 million monthly active users (""MAUs""), including 96 million Premium subscribers and 116 million ad-supported MAUs, at the end of 2018. Those figures are certainly higher today (Spotify reports its first-quarter results in early May). There is good reason for Spotify's resounding success and industry leading position--it has the best product in the streaming music business. Spotify is better at discovery, personalization, and custom playlisting than any of its peers. Typically, technologies can be copied but the ability to excel at discovery and personalization is dependent on a company's data around user preferences. Spotify has been getting this user feedback from more users, more engaged users, and for far longer than any of its competitors. And the company with the most data is able to offer the most compelling personalized music and discovery.Second, I have doubts there is a large number of people who crave free ad-supported streaming music who aren't already getting it from Spotify or Pandora. Spotify has about 30 million ad-supported MAUs in the U.S. (in addition to 20+ million Premium subscribers) while Pandora had about 60 million in the U.S. as of last Fall. Spotify's MAUs have been growing, while Pandora's have been declining, but more importantly, both offerings have been around for many years.It seems that Amazon sees an opportunity to offer its free ad-supported streaming service on Echo devices. Amazon only lets Echo users stream Premium (paid) Spotify, not free ad-supported, (although it oddly lets people stream free Pandora) so it could be that some Echo users who use ad-supported Spotify on other devices would like to stream it on Echo devices as well. That is clearly Amazon's near-term play since its new ad-supported service is only available on Echo devices, at least for now. However, count me a skeptic that a groundswell of free ad-supported Spotify users will use Amazon's service on Echo devices.Why? First, once a streaming music service, especially Spotify, gets to know you and your preferences, and has your custom playlists, the idea of using another service that you don't know as well, and doesn't know you as well, is less than appealing. I'm a free ad-supported Spotify user, and love the service. I also have several Echo devices around my house. Frankly, I would rather play Spotify on my phone than another streaming service through my Echo devices.Third, Amazon already offers free music to Prime members. That service is called Amazon Music, and anyone can stream it on any device, including Echo. And at least 60% of Amazon Prime members own at least one Echo device. Given there are about 100 million Prime members in the U.S. alone, that's probably 60 million plus Prime/Echo households in the U.S. who already have free music from Amazon. And it's ad-free to boot. I think this further limits the addressable market that Amazon could be reasonably targeting here.It seems to me that Amazon needs to thread the needle to capture users with this new service. The cross section of people who this appears to be thoseTo me, that seems like a somewhat limited market opportunity. Still, it is probably worthwhile for Amazon's advertising business. But I would be surprised to see any noticeable impact on Spotify's user metrics.It seems like Amazon's real motivation with this new service is to position itself with an ad-supported streaming offering for the future connected car. Eventually, all cars will have embedded modems and it will be seamless to access any service directly from the dashboard infotainment system.This is a big opportunity because over 90% of Americans still listen to terrestrial radio at least weekly. In the U.S., the terrestrial radio advertising market was $18 billion last year, and that's a low estimate of what streaming companies could get because those ads aren't even targeted.As Spotify's Barry McCarthy says, ""Everything linear dies,"" because it's a demonstrably worse consumer experience. It isn't personalized to your preferences, the user has no control over the songs played and can't skip songs. Like one teen recently put it, ""Why would I listen to a song I don't want to listen to?""Additionally, this market share shift is in the music industry's best interests. While terrestrial radio pays royalties to songwriters, it is oddly not required to pay royalties to the artists who perform the songs. Given this dynamic, artists, labels, and streamers will all be collectively pushing to accelerate and maximize this market share shift over time.It is clear to me that free ad-supported streaming will eventually replace terrestrial radio. Certainly, it will take a long time, but any company who wants to compete effectively in this market needs to prepare now. Or better yet, yesterday. Spotify and SiriusXM/Pandora (SIRI) have been positioning themselves to compete in the future connected car, and we can now add Amazon to that list. But Amazon's offering represents no threat to Spotify today for the reasons I mentioned. Nor does it present a threat over the long-term because there is plenty of market share for all the streamers to win at the expense of terrestrial radio."
4271598,104809,2019-06-22T05:35:00-04:00,"This will be the first part of my two-part series on Spotify. The first article can be broken down into 4 parts, in order to better understand Spotify's story.Firstly, there is a need to understand the music and streaming industry where growth has actually plateaued and is declining.Secondly, I will be taking a deep dive into understanding Spotify's current business model - in terms of revenue, MAUs and ARPUs as well as margins.Thirdly, I will also be exploring Spotify's competitors and hence Spotify's position in the music streaming industry.Finally, I will conclude with a discussion of what I believe to be Spotify's unique advantages that allow it to develop a sort of moat despite the influx of competitors and headwinds.","My interest in Spotify (SPOT) started as a satisfied long-time user of Spotify and as Spotify's stock hovered around the $120-$130 range. While I can confidently say that Spotify's music streaming service is the best, I was and am interested in understanding its current and future place in the music streaming industry as a business. The current discussion on Spotify appears to be deeply split into two distinct camps - on one side there are those that believe Spotify has a wide moat and even potentially future pricing power while there is another camp that sees numerous obstacles in Spotify's future, including increasing competition, contracting margins and an unclear path to profitability.In this article, I try to explore which view on Spotify is closer to the truth, that it is a wide-moat company enjoying a market leading position in a fast growing industry or simply a company that is facing too many headwinds and hence too much uncertainty. I have split the article into two due to its length. The first part will be focused on:The second part of my article will be focused on:Contrary to popular belief, global streaming revenue growth had actually plateaued in 2017. According to research by MIDIA, streaming growth will continue to fall from 29% in 2018 to 7% in 2026.However, while growth has plateaued, streaming revenue growth is the only positive aspect of the music industry. In 2017, the IFPI reported that global music revenue grew by 8.1%, driven by a 41.1% growth in streaming revenue while being offset by a 20.5% fall in download revenue and a 5.4% fall in physical revenue. The 8.1% growth achieved in 2017 was the third consecutive year of growth after 15 years of consecutive decline in the music industry. Hence, it is very clear that the streaming trend (started and led by Spotify) has been a huge boon to the music industry as streaming now accounts for 38% of global music revenue (the largest segment).Source: IFPI 2017 reportOne of the biggest positive impacts of Spotify and the music industry's transition to streaming has been the reversal of piracy, which was previously an existential threat to the industry. Warner Music's Rees says:As of the first half of 2018, Spotify held a commanding lead on global streaming music subscribers, with 36% of the global market share, almost double that of its second place rival, Apple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL). At the end of 2018, Spotify had 207 million MAUs (29% YoY) with 96 million paid subscribers (36% YoY) as compared to Apple Music's 50 million paid subscribers. Hence, Spotify is not only maintaining its global lead on Apple Music but also its other competitors including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google Music (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tencent Music (NYSE:TME).Source: StatistaNow that we better understand the industry that Spotify helped create, I will turn my attention to its business model. What most of us have heard about Spotify's business model is that it is ""shaky"" at best (as per CNBC) due to the fact that ""it has yet to turn a profit, and with mounting music rights costs, a saturation of streaming services, and lack original content.""However, before we decide to accept such a conclusion, it is necessary to understand Spotify's current business model and its viability.Source: Spotify's quarterly reportsSource: Spotify's quarterly reportsSource: Information from Spotify's Annual ReportsWhile Spotify has managed to maintain its global lead in streaming, its competitors have been stepping up efforts in order to eat at Spotify's market share, particularly in the US. The main strategy of its competitors (particularly Apple, Google and Amazon) is to bundle its music streaming app along with its other apps in order to create a more attractive ecosystem in which users have access to more content and services. (Global competitors - ex US, will be discussed in Part II)Despite the influx of new competitors - both in the US and in the rest of the world - I still remain confident that Spotify has its own advantages that has allowed it to develop somewhat of moat against new entrants. I believe that Spotify's advantages can be generally broken down into three categories:One of the hallmarks of Spotify's unique advantages is its personalisation strategy where it utilises users' listening data through machine learning techniques to help users discover new music that they will potentially like. This is a unique strength of Spotify as it allows it to effectively use data to forge a genuine human and social connection with not only its users but also the artists who put their music on its platform.A Spotify user sharing his favourite artist - Celine DionArtists were also able to share information about how their music was received on SpotifyOut of all the other music streaming companies, Spotify has been consistently the most innovative. Its innovation over the years as demonstrated in the below chart is directly correlated to the increase in its MAUs, paid subscribers as well as monthly content hours per MAU. Another of Spotify's strength lies in its global reach. While Amazon and Apple Music count American users as the bulk of its users, Spotify's subscribers are far more global (as seen in the below chart).Source: SpotifyHence, while there are some near-term challenges and uncertainty to Spotify's business model, namely the aggressiveness of the music labels in re-negotiating their licensing deals, overall slowing growth of the streaming industry and increasing competition. I believe that Spotify has some inherent advantages that should be considered a moat. In the second article that will soon follow, I will also be discussing Spotify's future plans to cement its market leading position as well as a reasonable and fair valuation of Spotify."
4271450,101848,2019-06-21T08:20:21-04:00,"A legal remedy to big data continues to flummox regulators across the developed world.  In the meantime, revenue from digital advertising continues to swell Google's and Facebook's bottom line.In the interim, Spotify is on the ground floor of explosive growth from the capture of just such data on a prime demographic group.Spotify has the potential to top $175/share by the end of the year with its digital ad revenue exceeding $150 million over the same period.","Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) both share the mantra of big data and derive an uber-share of their respective revenue through targeted, digital advertising. Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) also depend heavily on big data harvesting but are less dependent on advertising as a mainstay of total revenue. From that common thread spins an operating platform upon which each builds a rent-seeking colossus of unprecedented market breadth and scope. Google owns 62.7% of browser market share worldwide. Facebook owns 69.5% of the social media space. Amazon owns 49.1% of online sales. Netflix's user penetration of the US streaming market is an astounding 64.5%. Norway ranks second at 62% with Canada, Denmark, and Sweden at 56.3%, 54.9%, and 50.2%, respectively, making up the top five in a current global ranking. In 2005, there were an estimated 100 million people with paid TV accounts. That number is estimated to decline to about 95 million by 2020, providing a literal cornucopia of future growth for Netflix and wannabe Netflixs for years to come.Advertisers simply salivate. Google advertising revenue came to $31 billion through the end of March, a 15% increase YOY. Advertising revenue comprised a full 85% of total revenue for the company during the period. Facebook advertising revenue is similarly outsized at $14.9 billion, an increase of 26% YOY through the end of March. Advertising comprised a whopping 99% of the company's total revenues for the period. While Amazon does not yet break out advertising revenue as a line item in its SEC filings, the company's ""other"" category lists $2.7 billion, primarily comprised of advertising sales in an accompanying footnote. Advertising sales through the end of March comprised about 5% of the quarter's total sales. That category grew 34% through the end of March YOY. To date, Netflix continues to list advertising as a marketing expense used primarily for promotional purposes.The background provides a potent segue to Spotify (SPOT), originally Stockholm-based, now decidedly international in reach. The company is registered in Luxembourg with operational offices in Stockholm. Regional offices span the globe - from New York to San Francisco and from Boston to Seattle to Washington DC. Internationally, Spotify leases office space in Australia, Hong Kong, 13 EU countries, and the United Arab Emirates. Spotify has over 12,000 servers distributed across four data centers located in Stockholm, London, Ashburn, Virginia, and San Jose. Its server network has the capacity of pushing more than 700,000 user events half the distance of the globe per second.The company made its US market debut on 3 April of last year with a first-day closing price just over $147. Already the world's leading music streaming service, given its brief public life, SPOT put up an important milestone in its 1st quarter earnings report. The company broke through the 100 million paid subscription threshold for the quarter, up 32% YOY. Overall, the company claims 217 million subscribers, up 26% QOQ. Total subscriptions for the quarter just missed the midpoint of its 215-222 million 4th quarter projection. Apple (AAPL) Music does not disclose its subscription figures, but industry estimates put the company's total at about 50 million paid subscribers. Spotify's premium (paid) subscriptions continue to be its primary growth metric, comprising 92% of total revenue through the end of March. At €1.385 billion, subscriptions were up 34% YOY. Advertising revenue for the period came in at €126 million, up 24% YOY. The company's advertising revenue is now at 8% of total revenue. Given the market example of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, Spotify's advertising revenue clearly has the potential to grow geometrically moving forward. I see SPOT above $175/share by year's end. SPOT's advertising revenue should cross $150 million over the same period, up from $119 million through the end of March.Last year was rough for SPOT. After its April market debut, SPOT soared to $196 (green line), outperforming Google (blue line) and largely kept neck-to-neck with a resurgent Facebook (purple line) through late July. All three positions outpaced the Nasdaq Composite (orange area). Facebook took a sharp market dive in late July as did Google, while SPOT continued to outpace the Nasdaq Composite through August before skidding below the benchmark for the remainder of the year. The backdraft whipsawed the company deep into bear territory, down just under 46% by Christmas week from its late July peak. By the end of the year, SPOT had managed to claw its way back by almost half, closing the year with a 23% deficit. By way of comparison, the Nasdaq Composite finished the year down just over 13%. Google finished the year down just over 5%, while Facebook, pummeled by negative news over much of year, finished down just over 25%.Figure 1: Spotify Technology, Google, and Facebook against the Nasdaq CompositeThis year, Spotify has been blessed with better market fortune, up just over 33% through the last week in February before largely see-sawing sideways through the second week of May. The company shed just over 8% in the third week in May. While SPOT has bounced back just under 24% from the 23rd of May and within $2.00 of setting a high for the year, its share price is still down almost 23% from its July 2018 all-time high of $196/share. The Nasdaq Composite (orange area) is up just under 18% through today's (17 June) market close and up just under 7% from the first week in June (see Figure 1, above).Global economic uncertainty is more likely to increase than recede in the months ahead. The Trump administration appears more than willing to both raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and to expose an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports to a 25% tariffs regime by summer or early fall-upending international supply chains while impacting a substantially wider array of intermediate and final goods, further pressuring the cost of importing these goods into the US market. The US-China relationship is clearly barreling down an uncharted path, forcing a much wider breadth of companies large and small into a panicked scramble. Meanwhile, hundreds of US businesses are currently testifying in the US Trade Representative's open comment period on just how the administration's tariff plans will impact their businesses - not to mention the purchasing power of the US buying public. In the Middle East, there is a greater realization that the administration's efforts at applying maximum pressure on Iran to squeeze a better deal on the country's nuclear ambitions have instead pushed the two countries closer to direct military conflict that both sides insist they don't want. The probability of unintentional missteps by both countries pursuing their mutually exclusive interests run high in a narrow choke-point of waterway a mere 21 nautical miles in width, through which about a third of the world's oil traverses. Daily freight rates for oil supertankers are up as much as 50% with last week's attacks. The speed of unfolding events pressures thoughtful analysis lending credence to a repeat of the casus belli that led to the 2003 Iraq war. And, waiting it out in hopes of an electoral change of direction in January 2021, given the current state of Iran's economic slide may no longer be politically viable. Tensions are bound to rise as a result.Defensive market plays like utilities and real estate investment trusts make increasing investment sense. After all, W. P. Carey (WPC) and Extra Space Storage (EXR) are up 34% and 24%, respectively, through today's (17 June) market close. Further, WPC carries a yield of 4.82%, while EXR's yield weighs in at 3.31%. Black Hills (BKH), a South Dakota-based diversified utility company recently reported strong 1st quarter results. The company is up the better part of 27% on the year and carries a 2.59% yield. Hannon Armstrong (HASI), a finance company that funds renewable energy projects, is up 36% on the year with a yield of 4.98%. Solid dividend yield, coupled with outsized appreciation - pretty strong bets, given the level of market uncertainty lurking on the horizon. Yet, for the brazen few, Spotify is an outsized bet on growth, and here is why.The Spotify platform is quite unique when compared with, say, that of Facebook or Google. Spotify's platform is both emerging and more nuanced. The company's initial draw is the distribution of copyrighted music. About 85% of that content is licensed under agreements with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group. The three both own shares in Spotify and collect royalties from the company for the content used in its streaming operations. The platform offers two distinct venues - a free, ad-supported venue, with about 117 million active users and a premium subscription (paid) venue with about 100 million users. By design, the ad-supported venue feeds the premium subscription. Currently, about 92% of the company's revenue is subscription-based.Podcasts have recently added to the platform mix with the launch of Spotify for Podcasters in beta this past October. Since then, about 250,000 podcast files are now available on the platform.To date, Spotify's advertising revenue is tiny, about $119 million, or 8% of $1.5 billion in total revenue through the end of March. While Spotify is nominally about streaming music and subscriptions, targeted advertising is a more explosive growth engine moving forward. With a projected growth factor of about 25% per annum, Spotify's advertising revenue could just about double to about $233 million in three years' time. Ad revenue will drive total revenues for years to come.The company's mantra is to soundtrack a user's life - whatever the user is doing or feeling, Spotify has music to enhance that moment. User listening behaviors are then captured, sorted by musical genre, age, gender and location which is then turned into what the company calls taste profiles - compilations of favored artists, musical genres with attached affinity scores quantified by user demand. These taste profiles are then mapped against cultural, geographic particulars and prevailing musical styles, then compared and contrasted with other taste profiles generating similar listening patterns. Curated playlists come from this collective intelligence. The ease of delivering a user-focused musical offering for whatever taste, mood or occasion is limited largely by the imagination. In essence, these digital musical formats have become musical commodities that, unsurprisingly, are equally amenable to algorithmic manipulation - sets of data patterns that compare and categorize users across regions and national borders around the world. The result is what is called dynamic behavioral data, all of which produces highly desirable data for marketing purposes due precisely to its predictive value in the marketplace for the sale of goods and services. Spotify's business model is based on technology and ever-growing sophisticated informational exchanges with targeted advertising market makers. The headline lure of music becomes mere background by comparison.Spotify's podcasts play, unlike its musical streaming model, is vertically integrated. Where Spotify's musical endeavor is at the mercy of licensing and royalty requirements, podcasts and their distribution are seen as the company's long-term profitability model. Owning its own podcast studios allows the company to avoid licensing fees and royalty payments so intimately involved with streaming copyrighted music content. In October 2018, the company launched its own Spotify for Podcasters in beta, a platform that brought into play the breadth of its big data reach, offering podcasters the demographic tools to tap diverse network audiences worldwide. By the end of the 1st quarter, about 20,000 podcast teams were up and running on the platform, a number that doubled over the six-month rollout period. More than 50,000 podcast offerings had been submitted for publication. More than 250,000 podcast titles are now listed on the Spotify platform. In February, Spotify paid about $340 million for New York-based podcast studios Gimlet Media and Ancor Media. In March, the company added the premier story-telling podcast studio Parcast, spending about $56 million in the shopping spree. Spotify projects spending another $500 million over the intermediate term, further augmenting its growing footprint in the podcast space.Historically, Apple was the company of record in the podcast space. The Apple platform has no ""free"" venue segueing to a subscription-based format. Nor has Apple ever augmented its podcasts with targeted or any other form of advertisement. The absence of a free platform and the lack of advertising attached to its podcast segment allows Spotify relatively free rein in podcast advertising, opening up a potentially lucrative income stream in the process. Podcasting is all about finding an audience. While an uninspiring observation at first glance, technological reach and algorithmic patterning truly make the world a stage irrespective of how niche the production might be. Similarly, traditional TV advertising provides a broad medium for name recognition over a particular geographic footprint. Efficiency comes when marketers can target, for example, households with children under a certain age or people shopping for particular goods or services or even send different messaging to different households streaming the same podcast.In 2019, worldwide digital ad spending will rise by 17.6% to $333.25 billion, accounting for about half of the global advertising market. That podcasting is ripe for algorithmic patterning which paves the way for sophisticated targeted advertising is certainly not lost on the company's forward margin projections.What about the surge in privacy regulation around the world restricting the collection and use of consumer data? Last year, the European Union launched its own privacy rules bundled into the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which places limits on just how much personal data companies can collect, store, and use for commercial purposes. Companies found violating the terms of GDPR face fines up to €20 million or 4% of their global revenue, whichever is higher. The early impact has been mixed. At the national level, regulators are still hashing out just how the regulation will be implemented with a unified standard across the EU still years in the future. The rules have had a curious impact thus far, making it harder for smaller, third party companies to collect coveted locational data critical for targeted advertising. Ironically, scale has benefited firms like Google and Facebook over European-based digital advertisers as they already possess the necessary relationships and data on consumers that actively use their platforms. Accordingly, Google and Facebook have gained market share in Europe with revenue increasing 20% and 40%, respectively, in 2018 YOY, effectively raising the bar for entry into the EU digital advertising space. Anecdotally, Europe's digital advertisement space increased by about 14% for the period.Here in the US, California will launch its own Consumer Privacy Act (2018) that gives state residents the right to know what personal data companies operating in the state collect, store, and use and the ability to delete such information on request. The act goes live in 2020. New York and other states are also considering privacy laws.Last month, the Justice Department announced it is exploring the possibility of opening a case against Google for potential antitrust - rather than privacy - violations, revisiting a 2013 Federal Trade Commission case that looked into how the company prioritizes internet searches. Yet traditional antitrust theory gravitates around the notion of harm rendered to consumers, in the form of rising prices for the goods and/or services under question. Google and Facebook offer their main services for free, which means regulatory angst toward big technology gravitates quickly toward theory rather than the financial. In his 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox, the legal theorist Robert Bork set forth his ""consumer welfare standard"" that has since been used widely by courts across the country, including the US Supreme Court. What matters is the impact of business practices on the consumer's wallet. Without demonstrating harm being done to the consumer, traditional antitrust cases fall flat.A more recent antitrust tact comes from a panel discussion recently sponsored by the University of Chicago and a study commissioned by the UK government. Consumers pay for their Google searches or posts on Facebook not with cash, but by providing these hosts with information about their web behavior, age, gender, shopping habits and other personal data gleaned during the course of their zero-price internet excursions. That information is turned into digital profiles that are coveted by marketers for targeted advertising who in turn pay handsomely for such digital footprints. The consumer harm, then, comes not from financial considerations but from the consequence of the exchange between consumers and such free business models provided by digital platforms like Google and Facebook.Regulators will have to focus narrowly on behavior that is readily identifiable and be presented to a court in such a way that is winnable. Easy to articulate, extremely difficult to assemble, making for a high legal bar to hurdle. Remedies must rectify the harm being done to consumers (the Bork standard) which must stem from anti-competitive behavior, rather than a single act - all without an untoward increase in compliance costs. The remedy could be far too costly - which gravitates toward doing nothing.The last time Congress passed antitrust legislation was back in 1976. The government's case against IBM that started in 1969 at a time when the company dominated the mainframe business. The case was finally dropped in 1982. The case against AT&T (NYSE:T) lasted a decade until the company was broken into seven baby bells. The government chased Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for 12 years before a settlement was approved by an appeals court.A legal and/or legislative remedy to the question of consumer privacy remains years in the future. Over the years, Spotify has assembled - and continues to assemble - a wealth of highly coveted data on an equally coveted age group with ever-expanding purchasing power. SPOT is a ground-floor market move until such time when regulators across the developed world come together with a viable remedy for the collection and dissemination of consumer data."
4235930,21798,2019-01-28T08:05:11-05:00,Spotify is achieving strong double-digit revenue growth even with heavy competition.Gross margin is increasing due to operating leverage.The stock has plenty of room to move higher as it trades near the IPO price.,"I view Spotify (SPOT) as a stock with strong growth potential in 2019. The company growing revenue at 27% per year (expected for 2018 and 2019). This growth is being achieved in the face of competition from multiple companies. That demonstrates Spotify's ability to resonate with users to get them to pay for their premium service.My thesis is that Spotify's stock will increase about 30% in 2019. The stock is already recovering after a 48% drop from the 52-week high to the 52-week low. I expect further upside this year as the stock is driven by strong revenue growth from a reasonable valuation level. Spotify earns its revenue through two methods:1. Premium subscription revenue (90% of total revenue)2. Ad supported revenue (10% of total revenue)Premium revenue has a higher gross margin of 26% as compared to ad supported gross margin of 18%. Spotify's overall gross margin is about 25%. Spotify's gross margin is increasing as a result of operating leverage. As the company grows larger, they are able to pay less in royalties to music labels. This allowed gross margin to increase from 16% in 2014 to about 25% currently. The upward trend for gross margin is likely to continue as Spotify negotiates royalties with music labels. Spotify has a goal of increasing gross margins to 30% to 35%. That will help get the company to profitability within the next few years. Spotify increased premium subscribers by 40% to 87 million in Q3 2018. The company's monthly active users [MAUs] increased 28% to 191 million during the same period. The MAUs indicate how many users are engaged with the app. Many of the MAUs are free users, but some of them could be converted to premium paying customers to avoid ads and to get higher quality audio.The features that users are attracted to include: Spotify's competitive advantage from users' perspective is the company's algorithms. The algorithms store users' data based on attributes such as acousticness, energy, danceability, instrumentalness, tempo, liveness, speechiness, and valence. These can be chosen based on a sliding scale to provide users with playlists that are catered to their listening preferences. source: theverge.com  The algorithm creates music discovery and personalized curation for listeners which sets Spotify apart from the competition according to user reviews. The discovery feature helps introduce songs that fit users' interests, but are likely to be songs that the listener hasn't heard before. In a nutshell, Spotify's algorithm helps differentiate the company from the other music services on the market. That is the likely driver of Spotify's strong revenue growth. Since Spotify is not yet profitable, the price to sales ratio is the best valuation metric to use in my opinion. The company has strong revenue growth, so it is best to evaluate the valuation based on revenue. Here is how Spotify compares to other subscription-based services:  source: finance.yahoo.comI used the forward price/sales ratio which is based on consensus expected revenue growth for 2019. Although Pandora is valued below Spotify, Pandora's revenue growth is less than half of Spotify's. Sirius XM is valued higher with even lower revenue growth. I included Netflix in the mix because it is a subscription-based streaming service with similar revenue growth. Although Spotify and Netflix have similar expected revenue growth, Netflix has a much higher valuation. Spotify could be the Netflix of music. Netflix stood out from the competition over the years as a good value for customers with original content as a differentiator. Spotify is doing something similar with their algorithm as a differentiator. The average price/sales for these four companies is 3.99. Spotify is trading below this level. I see this as a reasonable valuation for a company growing revenue at about 27%. The stock is now trading near the IPO price of $132, but below the closing price of $149 on the first day of trading.The largest risk for Spotify is the wide variety of competition. Large companies with a lot of resources such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG) have music streaming services. These companies could cut into Spotify's market share. There are also multiple smaller companies that offer music streaming services. Despite all of this competition, Spotify remains in the lead with 36% market share. That says something about the features of the service. Investors should keep an eye on the competitors to see how the market share changes going forward. If Spotify loses significant market share, the investment should be re-evaluated. Spotify has achieved strong revenue growth in the face of high competition. So, the company's music streaming platform must resonate with customers. Spotify's algorithm is a likely factor for this, giving users an enjoyable personalized experience.The gross margin is likely to increase further as Spotify grows and is able to negotiate more with music labels. As a result, Spotify will be able to achieve profitability within approximately a year or two. There are a few opportunities for Spotify to further differentiate their business. The company could consider offering live streaming services for concerts. Spotify could also consider offering original content by becoming a music label. Those efforts could keep the company even further ahead of the competition. Even if Spotify doesn't act on those opportunities, the company still looks strong in 2019. I expect the stock to gain about 30% in 2019 for a price target of $175. The stock will be driven by 27% revenue growth along with some expansion of the price to sales ratio. The $175 price target would take the price/sales ratio up to about 4.2 based on expected revenue of $7.59 billion for 2019."
4232635,101969,2019-01-10T11:56:31-05:00,"SPOT has declined almost 40% from its highs last summer. By definition, the expectations implied by the stock are much more reasonable now.On a long-term basis, Spotify's total addressable market could be around 4.5-5.0 billion people. Today, paid subs and total MAUs are 1.8% and 4% of that, respectively.Spotify has aggressive competition and will only capture a portion of its global TAM, but it clearly has a long growth runway ahead of it.","Spotify (SPOT) is the world's largest subscription streaming music business, but it appears to be just getting started.Management lays out the company's total addressable market this way: there are an estimated 1.3 billion ""payment-enabled"" smartphones in territories where Spotify is currently active today. Spotify's 191 million monthly active users (""MAUs""), as of September 30, 2018, represent about 15% of them. That 1.3 billion should grow to 1.7 billion by 2021 as smartphone penetration increases. And there are another 1.3 billion in territories where Spotify plans to launch. So the total opportunity is about 3 billion potential users, which is about 16x today's user base and 34x today's paid subscriber base. Said another way, Spotify has 6% of its total addressable market in MAUs and 3% of its total addressable market in paid subscribers.But there are two trends that should further expand Spotify's TAM. First, population growth. The world's population is growing at about 1.1% per year. Second, smartphone penetration will only increase over time. If I isolate population growth, Spotify's 3 billion TAM would grow to about 3.7 billion over 20 years. And smartphone penetration would be additive to that.The absolute ceiling is the world's population, although I exclude China because Spotify doesn't compete there directly (although it does own a stake in Tencent Music). The global population ex-China is about 6.3 billion people. Over 20 years, that could be closer to 7.8 billion people.So Spotify's long-term TAM should be somewhere between 3.7 billion and 7.8 billion. But the future is always uncertain and it is prudent to be conservative, so let's chop off the top half of that range and call it 3.7 billion to 5.8 billion. The mid-point of that range is about 4.75 billion. So on that basis, Spotify's 87 million paid subs and 191 million MAUs would be only 1.8% and 4.0% of its long-term addressable market opportunity, respectively.Of course, Spotify is not going to capture the whole market. Certainly, many people will not pay for streaming music, and some may not even listen to the free version. Spotify has competition from Apple Music, Amazon Music, Pandora, Google Play Music, SiriusXM, Soundcloud, Tidal, and YouTube, and others, including local competitors in international markets.I also think it is instructive to look at total recorded music sales over time by channel. Here is a graphic of consumer spending on recorded music in the U.S. by channel.As you can see, at the peak of the CD market, U.S. consumer spending on recorded music was around $21 billion or so (in 2017 dollars). As of 2017, it was only about $8 billion, a 63% drop. Importantly, the majority of is now made up of streaming and the aggregate number is growing again.If U.S. consumers were willing to spend $21 billion on CDs, each of which has 10-12 songs, what would they be willing to spend on streaming music? Like I wrote earlier, U.S. consumers were paying $25 for one CD in inflation-adjusted dollars and are now being offered access to almost every song ever created for $9.99 per month. As more people discover streaming music and realize its value proposition, I think streaming has plenty of room to grow in the U.S., notwithstanding the rest of the world. The younger, more technology savvy generation will drive this as 72% of Spotify's MAUs are under 35 years old and 43% of them are under 24 years old. As the next generation becomes teenagers and the population mix becomes increasingly comfortable with technologies like streaming music, that is only a big tailwind to adoption.According to The Polaris Nordic Digital Music Survey 2018, 90% of people in the Nordic countries listen to streaming music and 43% pay for it. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have 51%, 50%, 46%, and 26% paid streaming penetration rates, respectively. Spotify launched in Sweden first, which probably explains why these countries have such high penetration rates, and suggests more recently launched countries could approach these rates with more time in the market.If I apply 43% to the U.S.'s 328 million population, that suggests 141 million Americans might pay for streaming music one day. At maybe $7.99 per month in the U.S., considering the mix of subscriber types, that is $13.5 billion of annual revenue. But the population will continue to grow, and there will probably be price increases eventually. If the U.S. population continues to grow at 0.7% per year, and the average monthly rate in the U.S. is $12.99 10 years from now, the U.S. paid streaming market alone would be worth $23.6 billion. Free ad-supported revenue, and other new revenue streams, would be additional. For perspective, there were an estimated 51 million paid streaming music subscribers in the U.S. as of September of last year. Given recent growth trends, I would expect the figure is closer to 60 million today. That is about 18% of the U.S. population. So if the adoption rates in the Nordic countries are indicative of where the U.S. adoption rate could drift over time, there is quite a bit of runway left in the U.S.How much of any of this market could Spotify have? Well, Spotify is the leading player globally with 87 million paid subscribers, which is about double the number of paid subs that Apple Music has. However, in the U.S., Apple Music just passed Spotify in paid subs. This is because Apple Music tends to be relatively stronger in markets were iOS is relatively stronger, and the iPhone is relatively strong in the U.S. Different sources have different estimates, but it seems like iOS's market share in the U.S. is probably not too far from 45% of smartphones.It is a vastly different story globally, however. Android phones have an estimated 76% market share around the world. This, and Spotify's head start, explains Spotify's global strength.I believe the U.S. market will primarily come down to Apple Music and Spotify in the long run, and Spotify should have at least 40% market share. So in 10 years, Spotify could have $9 or $10 billion of paid streaming revenue in the U.S. alone. For perspective, the whole company-- paid tier, free tier, and globally-- should report about $5.3 billion of revenue for 2018. So there should be a lot of growth to come.Spotify does objectively seem to have the superior product relative to Apple Music, but Apple's big advantage is having its app be native on iOS devices. Apple Music has immaterial market share on Android devices, which means Spotify completely dominates when the two are on a level playing field.ConclusionGiven SPOT's ~40% nose dive since its highs last summer, the expectations for the long-term number of paid and free-tier users that is baked into the current stock price are far more modest than they once were.I maintain at least four different scenarios for Spotify's business over the next 20 years. I think at $195 per share, with my set of assumptions, SPOT may have been pricing in something like 450-500 million paid subscribers in 20 years. While that's possible, it's also a significant amount of growth. At $120 per share, it could be pricing in somewhere closer to 250-300 million paid subs. That is much more reasonable, and I have a lot more confidence that Spotify can reach or surpass that range than 450-500 million.The enormous caveat is that valuation is driven by multiple moving pieces, not just the number of paid subs. There are key assumptions around how average revenue per user (""ARPU"") changes over time, how gross margins change over time, how operating expenses look over time, how big the free ad-supported tier is, how well the business monetizes the ad-supported tier, how capital intensive the business is, tax rates, and discount rates. It will be fascinating to watch how Spotify's business evolves over time.Reader FeedbackWhat do you think of Spotify, Apple Music, or any other streaming music business? Which is the best and why? Do you use them? How often? Are you a paying or free-tier user? Post in the comments."
4242451,102646,2019-02-20T11:56:14-05:00,"Spotify is present in 76 countries, which leaves a big potential for growth.
        There are risks to the company's spending on podcast acquisitions.
        SPOT is a risky company but is dangerous to short at the current valuation.","In 2018, investors cheered when Spotify (SPOT) went public that they pushed its stock price to an all-time high of $196. The enthusiasm faded and the stock priced declined to an all-time low of $106. This year, the stock has gained by more than 30% despite weak Q4 earnings. The company remains one of the biggest music streaming companies with more than 207 million monthly active users. Of these, 96 million are paying customers, who spend about €4.5 a month. This is a higher number than Apple Music, which has more than 56 million subscribers worldwide.Spotify faces a number of opportunities and challenges ahead. The biggest opportunity is that of international expansion. Unlike other services like Apple Music and Deezer that are available in hundreds of countries, SPOT is only available in 78 countries. As a big brand, this presents an opportunity for the company to continue adding more premium and free subscribers.The company’s challenges exceed the opportunities that lie ahead. First, it faces the challenge on how to deal with competition. A number of companies with more money than SPOT such as Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have all come up with competing products. These companies don’t necessarily want to profit from the industry but instead want to improve the stickiness of their ecosystems. For example, Amazon Music offers a 20% discount to all prime subscribers. There are more than 100 million prime subscribers. Therefore, while Spotify has a better platform than its peers, it might have a challenge of raising prices. It will also continue to see its market share decline as it competes with other bigger companies.Second, the company continues to face the challenge of the record labels. Spotify pays 72% to 80% of the revenue generated by each stream or play to the labels. The labels then pay the artists a loyalty, which is typically 15%. This arrangement means that Spotify’s margins are very thin. In 2018, its gross margins were about 25% but the operating margins were -0.9%. As mentioned above, since the company will have a challenge of increasing prices, it’s margins will continue being tiny. To deal with this problem, SPOT has started licensing music directly from independent artists. However, as evidenced by the decline of SoundCloud, dealing with independent artists will not lead to a major improvement in margins.To diversify its revenue streams, SPOT is doing a number of things. A few years ago, the company followed the footsteps of Netflix (NFLX) and started launching its own originals. The originals that have been created include Life in Short, Singles, and Landmark. By producing original content, SPOT could take all the income they generate. In this, I believe the challenge is that most people don’t use SPOT for its original content. Instead, they use it for its music and the curated playlists.To increase the investments in original content, the company paid $314 million for podcasting company, Gimlet Media. It also announced that it will spend about $500 million on podcast-related acquisitions. The acquisition helped solidify the thesis that Spotify wants to be a Netflix for audio.While the Gimlet media purchase was relatively tiny, there are reasons to question whether it was a good strategy for SPOT. For starters, Gimlet Media is one of the biggest podcasting group in the world. Before its purchase, the company had raised more than $27 million from VCs. The company has produced 25 podcasts, which are shown below.Source: Gimlet MediaBy buying Gimlet, Spotify believes that it is acquiring the Warner Bros, Paramount, and Universal Pictures of audio. However, there are reasons to question this acquisition. First, the podcasting industry is so competitive, with new podcasts being launched every day. A good number of popular podcasts like Swindled, Unresolved, and Trace Evidence are usually a one-man operation. The barriers to entry in podcasting are usually very low because all you need is a good story, a microphone and a mixer. Because of the competitive nature of the industry, Gimlet Media’s podcasts did not rank well in 2018 in Stitcher, iTunes, and Podbay. In fact, there was no Gimlet Media show in Apple’s rankings of the best podcasts for 2018.Another concern about the deal is the statements from the Gimlet Media founders shortly after the deal was announced. In an interview with Recode, they questioned whether the company would have continued to grow as an independent company. They also questioned whether the company would have continued to grow up to a point where it became public. Consider the statement below by Mark Lieber:Another concern is on the global scale of the podcasting industry. Without a question, the industry has seen increasing growth and popularity over the years. This growth has happened because more people have smartphones and that more devices now accept podcasts. These include Alexa, Google Home, and other smart speakers. The number of shows has also continued to increase. In fact, the number of shows has grown to more than 600K. However, the revenue in the industry is still relatively low. In 2018, it was estimated that the total podcasting spend was about $658 million. The revenue is estimated to reach $1.6 billion in 2022. Therefore, by spending $314 million on Gimlet, Spotify was buying a 19% of the total podcasting industry by 2022.Source: PWCFinal ThoughtsSpotify is a great company that revolutionized the music industry. Because of its excellent apps and personalized playlists, the company has continued to increase the number of subscribers. This growth will continue to grow as the company enters the new markets. However, the company continues to face more challenges as highlighted above. Even with these challenges, I believe that it is dangerous to short the company at the current valuation of more than $26 billion. This is because SPOT is a story stock whose price will be influenced by metrics like ARPU and MAU."
4263521,105217,2019-05-13T12:29:08-04:00,"In March, Spotify announced that it has filed a complaint against Apple.The Commission could impose a fine of billions on Apple over this complaint.As I may have some better understanding of the legal background, I want to provide you some input which is not that easy to extract from the publicly available sources.The article is about a first overview of the facts and the introduction to the essential legal framework.Three legal parameters (criterions) have to be considered: The relevant market, a dominant position, and the abuse of this position.","In March, Spotify (SPOT) announced that it has filed a complaint against Apple (AAPL) with the European Commission. Simultaneously, Spotify launched a 'time to play fair call'. Spotify claims that Apple harms consumers and other companies because it uses power to gain an unfair advantage. Thus, Spotify joins in a series of other complaints or attacks against Apple:I can not evaluate if the complaint is well founded or not, and I can not foresee what the Commission will decide in the end. As I may have some better understanding of the legal background, I want to provide you some input which is not that easy to extract from the publicly available sources of information.This is therefore not an article that deals primarily with the question of whether one should invest in one of the companies or not. The complaint, however, attacks a part of the future business of Apple. Accordingly, this service business has a high priority for Apple, as it is intended to compensate for the declining sales of iPhones. In addition, billions in fines can be imminent. Investors are therefore well advised to find out what criteria the Commission uses to decide.As stated above, Spotify claims that Apple uses his power to give himself an unfair advantage. While Spotify files the complaint for five reasons, an interesting economic problem should not be overlooked:1. Spotify files his complaint on five grounds:So basically, Spotify is claiming an abuse of power by Apple. In my opinion, number 1. is the most crucial issue to Spotify: All purchases (apps and digital content) within apps on iOS must be made through Apple Pay, and are subject to a 30% fee. Spotify claims that the rules are not applied evenly across the board because Uber and Deliveroo, which do not compete with Apple, do not pay a fee when using Apple Pay. 2. The economic issue behind in shortBehind this complaint is the following (interesting) issue I want to share before I will go deeper into the legal parameters. The problem is based on a mutual dependence of Apple to Spotify and vice versa.By developing OSs, for which third parties can develop software solutions and apps, Apple is an important provider of such platforms like the App Store, where third parties can offer their software solutions.For numerous apps, no realistic alternatives to the App Store exist. There is only the Google Play Store which could be an alternative. Hence, basically, there is a duopoly. So to reach the costumers, Spotify needs Apple. In theory, this gives Apple the opportunity to set unfair conditions.But nothing is as easy as it looks like, because Apple has an interest in offering many different apps from app developers in his app store too. Hence, there could be an incentive for Apple to not set unfair conditions.On the other hand, as it comes to Apple Music, Apple is also an app provider and Apple Music compete with Spotify. So, under this special circumstances, an incentive for unfair conditions may appear 'reasonable'.Given that little introduction, let's dig deeper into the real legal framework.To evaluate whether Apple abuses its power or not, it is important to define the relevant legal parameter. As I stated above, I do not know how the Commission will decide this case, but I think it may be helpful or at least interesting for investors to understand how the Commission will approach the complaint.Hence, here comes the essential and for the complaint decisive article of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Keep the highlighted words in mind while reading.Let me give you a few explanations to understand Article 102:So first of all, you have to understand, that you cannot abuse something, if you don't have something to abuse. Hence, to abuse power, you need power. Article 102 describes this power as a dominant position. So the evaluation of a dominant position is one big thing, the Commission has to consider. The abuse of this position is another.But that's not enough because dominance is not universal, but limited to certain areas. To fall within the scope of Article 102, a company has to abuse its dominant position in a certain market. Hence, it is important to define the relevant product and geographic market.In the following, I will go deeper into the legal definitions of these criterions in the following order: 1. Criterion: Relevant market.2. Criterion: Dominant position.3. Criterion: Abuse of the dominant position.In competition law, a relevant market is a market in which a particular product or service is sold. Since the geographic market is not problematic here, I will not go into it any further. According to the Commission, the relevant product market comprises all those products and services which are regarded as interchangeable or substitutable, by reason of the products' characteristics, their prices and their intended use.According to recent decisions, you should consider the following markets:a) Digital music distribution servicesAccording to the Apple/Shazam (Case COMP/M.8788) decision, the Commission has analyzed the market for digital music distribution and has found evidence that the boundaries between streaming and downloading services were becoming blurred. The Commission considers that the narrowest relevant product market is the one for digital music streaming services for smart mobile devices, excluding video streaming services.b) Software solutions platformsSoftware solutions platforms means the development of OSs for smart mobile devices (tablets and smartphones), PCs, smart watches and smart TVs, for which third parties can develop software solutions and apps.The Commissions left the exact scope of the relevant product market for software solutions and/or apps platforms open, but indicates that in defining the relevant product market for software solutions and/or apps platforms, it would not be appropriate to depart from its previous practice in relation to the definition of the relevant product market for OSs for PCs and OSs for smart mobile devices. First of all, I will explain how the criterion 'dominant position' is defined. After that, I will give you some informations about how the Commission could evaluate the structure in the relevant markets.a) DefinitionAccording to the Commission (see for example CASE AT.39740 - Google Search, page 56) and European Case Law, a dominant position relates to a position of economic strength which enables a company to prevent effective competition being maintained on the relevant market by affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, its customers and ultimately of its consumers.As I stated above, it is not easy to evaluate whether a company has a dominant position or not. The Commission emphasizes that the existence of a dominant position derives in general from a combination of several factors. Taken these factors separately, is not necessarily determinative.Nevertheless, a few factors are more or less important for the evaluation of a dominant position:As it may be the most important factor, let's go deeper into the factor of 'market share':Firstly, if a company has a market share of less than 40%, it is unlikely to be dominant. Secondly, the Commission handles a market share of between 70% and 80%, in itself, as a clear indication of the existence of a dominant position.Between these percentages, the Commission uses the following definition:Overall, it is very difficult to evaluate a dominant position, only by hard factors. Hence, the Commission has some investigation power to get more informations. I intend to write another article on the investigation powers and possible next steps of the commission.b) Who has a dominant position in the Spotify v Apple dispute?As we now know, to evaluate a dominant position, the Commission will review the relevant markets, using the factors that favor or against a dominant position.I am pretty sure that the Commission will use some of the information it already knows in the current dispute. Hence, I will give you some information on that.aa) Digital music distribution servicesBy collecting confidential data on the total number of subscribers, premium subscribers, revenues and revenues from subscription of digital music streaming apps in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Commission had already conducted a market reconstruction in the Apple/Shazam decision.According to that, Spotify seems to be the leading digital music streaming service in the EEA with quite an impressive market share.(Source: Cleary Gottlieb – UK Competition Law Newsletter - March 2019)bb) Software solutions platformsApple develops OSs for different types of devices, that is macOS for PCs, iOS for the smartphones “iPhone” and the tablets “iPad”, tvOS for Apple TV and watchOS for Apple Watch. Spotify does not compete with Apple on this market. Hence, Spotify has no market shares.In the Apple/Shazam (Case COMP/M.8788) decision, the Commission considers Apple's share of shipments for each type of device to be the best proxy for calculating Apple's position as a software solutions platform in the EEA and worldwide.According to this approach, Apple has the following market shares:The Commissions left the exact scope of the relevant product market for software solutions and/or apps platforms open (see above). So the question of a dominant market position could depend on the exact market definition.But remember, that even a market share of 80% is not necessarily determinative for a dominant position.a) The TheoryAs stated above, a dominant position in itself does not raise competition concerns. EU competition law only prohibits the abuse of this position. Therefore, Apple as a possible dominant company is entitled to compete on the merits as any other company.The purpose behind Art. 102 TFEU is that, however, a dominant undertaking has a special responsibility not to allow its behavior to impair genuine, undistorted competition on the internal market. The European Court emphasis that the scope of the special responsibility of the dominant undertaking has to be considered in light of the specific circumstances of the case.Hence, the concept of abuse has to be understand as an objective concept, relating to the behavior of a company in a dominant position. The Commission evaluates, if a company behave differently than it could in a market with normal competition or if the behavior of the company hinders the maintenance of the degree of competition still existing in the market or the growth of that competition (see for more details CASE AT.39740 Google Search Shopping, page 73).Article 102 TFEU  already gives some examples of the rule (keep the marked words in mind):b) The claimsLet's compare this to the claims which Spotify filed with the Commission:As you can see, the claims Spotify filed seems to fit quite good on the examples given in Article 102 TFEU already. Furthermore, there are some similarities to a former decision of the Commission:c) The Google Search Shopping DecisionIn the Google Shopping decision, the Commission decided that Google had abused its dominant position by featuring its own shopping service more prominently on the search results page compared with other comparison services.The Commission took into account, among others, the following factors:According to a presentation by the law firm Cleary Gottlieb (which defended Google) the Commission could pursue in the Spotify v Apple dispute a line similar to the former Google Search Shopping decision. According to the claim, the Commission could held that Apple abuses its position by favoring its own Music Service, for example by rejecting and delaying upgrades for the Spotify App. So, if the Commission comes to the conclusion that Apple holds a dominant position, then the abuse allegation could actually take effect here.According to former decisions of the Commission the abuse allegation could actually take effect here.Nevertheless, the Commission has to consider a lot of different legal questions. It is quite certain that fact-finding and legal review will take some time to evaluate and define the market. Especially the market definition of the relevant product market for software solutions and/or apps platforms could be crucial, as Apple has a lot of different market shares there.After Spotify had announced it filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission over unfair App Store practices, Apple responded two days later with a statement. It is likely that Apple will defend itself against the allegations like it did with his statement. I intend to write another article about these aspects of the dispute.I look forward to discussing this dispute with you in more detail in the comment section."
4250534,105049,2019-03-22T13:04:06-04:00,"Spotify share prices remain at a depressed level as compared with the metrics of major competitors.Growth continues at a rapid pace, and the success story of Spotify is contingent on this continuing.First-mover advantage in podcasts is seen as a risky move that has potential to materially increase the value of Spotify’s core offering.","Spotify clearly has a first-mover advantage in the realms of music streaming, but with increasing competition from technology giants that possess both competency and war chests measured in the tens of billions, Spotify remains a high-risk high-reward play.Founded in late 2008 by Swedish entrepreneur Daniel Ek, Spotify (SPOT) has revolutionized the consumption of music across the globe. While widely accredited and praised for its role in the reduction of piracy, the royalties paid to artists remains a long-term issue with significant complexities and risks moving forward. It is a music streaming service with a catalogue at present of over 40 million tracks, retaining 96 million subscribers and 207 million aggregated MAU. The group continues to engage in rapid global expansion, happening notably at present in the Middle East and North Africa.Audio PlatformSpotify is an audio-first company, with ambitions to become the world's leading audio platform. CEO Daniel Ek stated:Interestingly, the engagement of podcast users is twice that of non-podcast users. This is perhaps representative of a synergistic relationship between music content and the other various forms of audio content. While this move forward clearly adds value for existing users, it is not yet clear that this improves overall margins on current subscriptions. Due to the initial capital requirements on purchasing a catalogue of podcast content, this is almost certainly a short-term cost centre for the company. The extent of how this monetizes over time and the wider impact on margins remains unclear, and in the author's opinion, it is dependent on the level of competition Spotify faces in the various subsector niches it seeks to gain traction in - in this case specifically, podcasts.AcquisitionsTwo new acquisitions are Gimlet, a content creator, and Anchor, which deals with podcast creation via an app as well as distribution. These purchases indicate management's willingness to invest capital for continued rapid growth in the podcasting space, and across a variety of technology and content-driven subsectors.Gimlet has a reported sale price of $230 million, according to Billboard (Billboard, 2019), representing a relatively small investment equivalent to circa 5% of Spotify’s book value. The purchase price of Anchor is reported to be in the range of $100 million, so altogether these represent a $330 million investment in podcasts this year. This sets the stage for continued M&A activity of $400 million to $500 million spend for full-year 2019, potentially reducing cash reserves substantially from the December 2018 $891 million base should management continue to favor cash as opposed to stock for upcoming deals.Ambitions cited by management in February 2019 via its analyst earnings call is to deploy capital towards both technology/infrastructure and content aspects within the podcast space, in line with the acquisitions mentioned above. It is becoming increasingly clear that Spotify plans to expend material attention and capital towards podcasts in the hope of dominating this space while other major competitors continue to play catch-up in terms of music streaming.Decreased ChurnThis is happening incrementally, and with slight improvements across gross profit margins this is starting to provide material increases in terms of income and as management commented. If it does create a “virtuous cycle”, then lower churn, combined with lower subscriber acquisition costs, might reasonably pave the way towards profitability.User Experience, Apps, QualitySpotify is generally considered ahead in terms of the overall experience, quality and catalogue range provided as compared with other providers, perhaps with the exception of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Consumers more than a decade from launch are well versed in how to use the app, and the introduction of additional services such as podcasts does represent a continual shift towards providing valuable content to its core audiences.Ubiquity Strategy Reminiscent of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows, the strategy to have Spotify available across every major tech ecosystem provides the accessibility necessary to remain as the front-runner in music streaming across North America and Europe. As major competitors Apple and Microsoft focus on fully owned individual ecosystems as the pipeline for audio content delivery, Spotify remains flexible in its scope and approach to the various platforms, from home assistants to mobile phones. In aggregate, this provides for a small comparative advantage.(Source: Spotify, 2019)Marketing Spend Efficiencies In terms of solving the current inefficiencies regarding the “reach” of content: a pain point at present is the marketing spend of major publishers increasing, and Spotify’s role as a platform to tweak the algorithms to provide value-added content discovery that lessens the need for traditional marketing efforts.Perhaps with similarities to Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) search service, Spotify needs to fine-tune its systems to deliver great content suggestions to its users while working within the framework defined by publishers and labels that often dictates terms with regard to minimum number of listens and various other metrics. At present, these force Spotify to provide a content-discovery pipeline that is not the optimal choice in terms of value added for the individual user.Original Content & M&A ActivityEspecially notable in the podcast segment, Spotify is experimenting with the deployment of substantial resources in developing its own catalogue in original and often exclusive content offerings. Drawing comparisons to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), this type of model has the potential to add tremendous scope in terms of the value proposition given to consumers. Creating the next hit to generate this type of pull factor value is, however, far from guarantied.Licensing Agreements via Traditional LabelsCEO Daniel Ek recently commented:This is perhaps on overly optimistic outlook. The extent to which labels negotiate tough deals remains, and artists continue to engage in negative PR for Spotify due to low levels of earnings. Overall, these are material risks that are at present being managed but have the inherent ability to cause substantial adverse headwinds should worst-case scenarios be considered. Spotify simply cannot operate without the deals it signs with traditional labels.Ek further commented: “If I would boil it all down to one thing, it's continued top line growth being the number one focus for everyone in the music industry.”The growing user base will in the long term robustly support the top line of all major actors, as long as the user base keeps growing. The opportunities to leverage efficiencies at scale and thus improve margins will remain a key factor in the Spotify success story moving forward.Growth remains rapid and a key support of current investor sentiment. Expectations for continued growth through 2019 remain as acquisitions, expansion into podcasts, and geographic expansion across the Middle East and North Africa provide multiple material growth catalysts for the company for short to medium term horizons.Further efficiencies at scale in the core music streaming business, coupled with increased expenditure on expansion into relevant audio-based conten,t provides moderate optimism for further margin improvements over the next 12 to 24 months.Subscriber growth remains firm, with synergies emerging via additional content formats as mentioned previously. With a potential long-term market size of a billion plus people, the scope to grow remains substantial while the extent to which competition will reduce both profitability and Spotify’s market share remains unknown.Furthermore, free cash flow continues to grow and this provides further comfort to investors as an indicator to potential profitability that is, perhaps, just around the corner.Particularly welcome news for investors is the expected end of substantial and continued losses in recent years. As the company leverages its scale gross margins, user engagement and churn rates remain materially lower than in the 2016-2017 period, according to management (Spotify, 2019).The 10-year projections are based on an average growth rate of 15%, down from current 25%-plus growth rates as the industry matures, and as competition reduces the scope for future price increases. This may be considered a conservative estimate. Additional considerations include the lack of M&A activity, though this should be minor and partially included in the growth rates outlined in the model above.However, aggregated 10-year present values remain relatively uninspiring. It is possible, as the business grows in scale, that further moderate margin improvements may be made.Furthermore, it is possible Spotify is itself acquired by a large technology company within the next decade should it continue to successfully entrench its position. Google purchased YouTube to gain market share in the video format, and it would not be preposterous for them to undertake a similar acquisition for a front-running audio platform. Such an acquisition would likely be made at a significant premium to current market valuations.Spotify remains a high-risk high reward play. It continues to grow rapidly, and this is largely priced in at current levels. The expansion into podcasts is likely to be a short-term headwind for margins, offering improvements through 2020 on the path to eventual profitability. Substantial risks include negotiations with traditional publishers and labels, and major technology companies seeking greater market share with the willingness to spend vast reserves of capital.This stock remains on my watch-list, at current levels it does not represent a significantly overvalued proposition, in the author's view, but neither does it offer a great entry point for investors. This author remains neutral.To get real-time updates on new articles, follow me right here on Seeking Alpha."
4230126,103480,2018-12-25T12:04:03-05:00,"Shares of Spotify have shed nearly 50% of their value over the past quarter, thanks to an intensifying rout in technology stocks and recent IPOs.The company's market cap has returned below the ~$20 billion mark it notched as a private company.The music-streaming company has been aggressively launching its services into emerging markets in an attempt to combat slowing user growth.Despite persistently high net losses, Spotify has actually managed to boost free cash flow, adding confidence for the company in a turbulent year.Spotify has also announced a $1 billion buyback program, signalling that shares are presently undervalued.","The past few weeks have been rather unforgiving for the technology sector. Companies big and small have lost billions in market value, including those once considered to be untouchable market darlings. Among the fallen is Spotify (SPOT), the streaming-music king that earlier this year became one of the first companies to engage in a so-called ""direct listing"" and at one point nearly rallied to $200 per share.Spotify has soured in recent months, fading especially after reporting weak MAU counts in its Q3 earnings release. The decline in the broader market and the sharp reversal of the NASDAQ into bear market territory have hit the company even harder, and shares of Spotify are now flirting with new lows in the $100s and have lost nearly 50% of their value.SPOT data by YChartsWhile I had previously harbored doubts about Spotify's ability to outperform the market when it was in the ~$150s, Spotify in the low $100s is an entirely different story. The company's valuation, now below $20 billion in market cap, opens many possibilities and allows us to examine the stock from a bullish angle.In my view, the sharp correction in Spotify shares has been sentiment-driven and out of line with the company's fundamentals. I'd use the decline to begin building up a position in Spotify at all-time lows. Here, we'll discuss the major pointsIt's true that Spotify's user growth has slowed down in the most recent quarter, which was the original bearish catalyst that sent Spotify shares over its tipping point. Spotify especially disappointed on its MAU count, which came in at 191 million last quarter versus Wall Street's expectations for 191.8 million.On the whole, however, Spotify's user base is still massive. It grew its premium subscribers at 40% y/y last quarter, within spitting distance of hitting 100 million premium subscribers at some point in 2019. This is an entrenched user base whose memberships to Spotify are as sticky as subscribers of Netflix (NFLX), and each are shelling out $9.99 per month (assuming they are on individual and not family plans). At 100 million premium users, Spotify generates approximately $1 billion in monthly recurring revenue, and that doesn't even factor in revenues furnished by the ad business.Figure 1. Spotify user baseSource: Spotify Q3 earnings releaseThe important piece to pick up on here is that Spotify benefits from extraordinary unit economics. The company bears virtually no incremental costs to picking up an additional $9.99/month subscriber - those subscription revenues flow straight to the bottom line. In last quarter's release, Spotify called out that its subscriber growth ""continues to be healthy across our Family and Student plans,"" alongside strong retention within its current installed base. Churn, in fact, declined 90 bps on a year-over-year basis, validating the thesis that once installed, Spotify remains installed.It's worth noting as well that Spotify has introduced new partnerships as a means of attracting new subscriber growth. The company signed a flashy deal with Samsung earlier this year, for example, which makes it part of the new device setup experience for Samsung phones. The company also recently rolled out a subscription bundle alongside Hulu, which offers savings for subscribers of both services.Alongside new offerings and new partnerships, Spotify is also chasing growth in the old-fashioned way: by expanding into new territories. Spotify's traditional bases of strength are the U.S. and Western Europe, but it has made a strong push in late 2018 to enter into new markets.In November, Spotify announced its launch into the Middle East and North Africa, adding 13 total markets to a total market count of 78. In addition, entertainment news reporter Variety also wrote that Spotify expects to launch into India at some point in 2019, and will offer an extended free trial (longer than 30 days) there. Needless to say, India's population of ~1.3 billion and the rise of consumer technologies alongside its growing middle class presents a huge untapped opportunity for Spotify.Despite the fact that Spotify already has a huge installed base, it's important to recognize that much of the world remains greenfield territory.It's no secret to any investor that like Netflix, Spotify expends huge outlays on content acquisition to fill out its extensive library of music. As the company grows, it has also spent considerable sums on building up its corporate infrastructure as well as marketing. Steep expenses have pitted Spotify into steep IFRS-based losses, and bearish investors are often unconvinced that Spotify can ever achieve profitability.Despite not raking in accounting-based profits, however, Spotify continues to generate positive operating cash flows. In fact, OCF has greatly increased in the year-to-date. In the nine months through September, Spotify's operating cash flows of $194 million have nearly tripled relative to the year-ago period, while the implied OCF margin of 5.2% is 230 bps better than 2.9% in the prior year.Figure 2. Spotify OCF Source: Spotify Q3 earnings releaseAs global markets continue a bearish pattern, investors will be positioning themselves in growth stocks with positive cash flows. Many of Spotify's peers in the recent IPO bucket are still burning through heaps of cash, and these companies - like Snap (SNAP) and Blue Apron (APRN) - may not survive a market rout. Spotify's positive cash flows, however, adds a patina of quality to the stock that will protect its downside. The increase in cash flow margins also offers reassurance that the company is boosting its efficiencies and has a path to breakeven net profits - even if not within the next 1-2 years, Spotify has proven that it's operating a valid business model.In response to a cratering stock price, Spotify has also announced that its board has approved a new $1 billion buyback program. This is a tactic that has been routinely employed by many sagging companies in the tech sector this year, such as Micron (MU) and Facebook (FB). Though shares in most technology stocks have continued sinking despite aggressive buybacks, the move may prove prescient when shares recover.A $1 billion buyback represents about 5% of Spotify's current market cap. The company has free rein to buy back up to 10 million shares (up to $1 billion), and is hopefully taking advantage of the current volatility to reduce its share count. The buyback also functions as a signal from management that it believes its current share price to be undervalued.It's worth noting that Spotify remains cash-rich. Its September-end balance sheet listed $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, with an additional $1.6 billion in longer-term investments. Spotify is also unencumbered of any debt. Strength on the balance sheet gives Spotify plenty of flexibility to navigate through a market downturn.Despite the doom and gloom that is currently prevailing in the markets, there are plenty of strengths in Spotify that we can grow to appreciate as the stock craters to new all-time lows. Though the risks of user deceleration, stiff competition, and exorbitant content costs still carry weight on the bearish side of the argument, I believe much of this risk has been priced into Spotify at its new lower price. Primarily due to the steepness of Spotify's decline without any visible deterioration to the business, I'm reversing a previously bearish opinion on the stock to a bullish one for 2019. It may take some time for growth stocks to come back into vogue and for Spotify to reclaim its prior market value, but now is a good time to buy shares very cheaply and wait for the rebound."
4229513,22717,2018-12-20T16:36:09-05:00,"Spotify Technology, SA enjoys good prospects for revenue growth and potential margin expansion but faces a major valuation problem.Its market value has fully priced in all its best growth scenarios.We estimate its true value over the next several years at no more than $114.89, or 1% over today's price.Look to sell if you have a profit and wait to buy at a margin of safety below today's price.","Spotify Technology, SA (SPOT) is a music streaming service that enjoys good top line growth from an increasing amount of new premium users. Its margins are sub-par, though, compared to the music industry as a whole but they have room to grow. I contend in this article that the most ebullient forecasts for the company are largely embedded at the company's market value, $22.3 billion, for the next several years. For example, the good news is that Monthly Active Users (MAU) have been growing nicely over the past several years. In 2015 there were 91 million MAU, and we estimate that by 2019 there will be 253 million MAU:Source: SEC filingsThis has led to a 38% Year over Year (YOY) growth in revenues in 2017, and I estimate 28% revenue growth for 2018, and 27% in 2019.Source: SEC filings and Hake estimates90% of SPOT's revenue comes from subscriptions, and about 10% from ads. SPOT can't really increase its subscription prices because of competition, so most of the revenue growth comes from adding more listeners or MAUs. The weak spot is SPOT's margins. They are low both on an absolute basis and compared to its industry. For example, since its cost structure is heavily geared to paying major record labels for rights to artist's inventory of songs, and since only a small portion of ads, which are higher margin in nature, SPOT only had a gross margin of 25% in most recent quarter and a net income margin of 2.1%. This is much lower than its public peers in the music industry:Source: SEC filings of companiesThe table above shows that Pandora (P), Tencent Music (NYSE:TME) (which recently went public on the NYSE), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) all have much higher gross margins than Spotify (SPOT). All of the companies are much more profitable on a net income basis than Spotify, except for Pandora (which is losing money and is probably why it is being acquired by Sirius XM for its present market value in a share swap).Nevertheless, Spotify's growth rate in revenue, net income and EBITDA (or cash flow from operations) is on par and slightly higher than the median of the industry. This can be seen in the table below:Source: Hake estimates and SEC filings of companiesSpotify has a good financial position compared to its peers. Spotify has $2 billion in net cash, no debt and annualized revenue which is larger than its peers. Its net cash is almost 10% of its present stock price, whereas its peers, other than Tencent, have debt on their balance sheets. Sirius XM has a substantial amount of debt. This can be seen in the next under table:Source: Hake estimatesAll of the good news above is presently discounted in the price. We can see this three ways, on an absolute, comparable and scenario basis.Absolute ValuationThe table below shows what I mean. The stock trades for 166x earnings and a massive ratio using Enterprise Value / EBITDA. The EV / Sales ratio is reasonable.Source: Hake estimatesWe assumed a 27% growth in sales for 2019 and 2020 (similar to 2018) and normalized the EBITDA margin estimates for 2019 and 2020, which lowers the P/E ratios and the EV/EBITDA ratios. Nevertheless, the resulting ratios on an absolute basis are very high. At this price the stock price cannot withstand any kind of market downturn and has no margin of safety.Comparable ValuationCompared to its peers in the music industry, SPOT is very expensive. This can be seen in the table below:Source: Hake estimates and SEC filings of public companiesEven if we substituted the 2019 estimated P/E ratios and EV/EBITDA ratios for SPOT (from the prior table), the comparable valuation for SPOT is still high. For example, the estimated P/E for SPOT in 2019 is 94x and the TME P/E ratio is 38x. The 2019 EV/EBITDA ratio for SPOT is 57x for 2019, whereas TME's ratio is 25x.Another comparison can be made with technology growth stocks at SPOT's similar market value. The table below compare's P/E ratios of this group with SPOT's P/E ratio:Source: Hake estimates and SEC filings of public companiesThe median P/E ratio is 30x, but even if we used SPOT's estimated 2019 P/E ratio of 94x, or the 2020 ratio of 74x, Spotify is still twice the average of the companies in its technology growth peer group. For example, if we used the industry median multiple of 30x the estimated revenue and margins for 2019 for SPOT, the resulting stock price is well below the present price. This can be seen in the formula below:Source: Hake estimatesThe bottom line that this implies that SPOT's margins are well below par compared to its peers. Let's look at the third valuation measure.Scenario BasisThis is a little more involved. Let's assume there are three upcoming scenarios over the next three years and then assign some probabilities to them. The resulting price will tell us how high the stock is compared to the expected scenario valuation for SPOT.The first scenario is a steady growth scenario. SPOT is estimated to have revenue growth of 27%, and a steadily increasing net income margin. The resulting price by 2021 would be $125.68 per share:Source: Hake estimatesThe second scenario is a slowing growth scenario. Revenue growth slows 3% per year, but the net income margin will have a average 3.5%. The resulting price by 2021 would be $61.42 per share.Source: Hake estimatesThe last scenario is the stagnant margin and growth scenario. This can be seen below. The growth rate of revenue declines substantially and the margins stay at 2.1% (2018) and only grows to 2.5% by 2021. The resulting price is $38.39 per share:Source: Hake estimatesNext, we assign probabilities to these scenarios and compute the weighted average price. I decided that the Steady Growth scenario would be 85% probable, and the second scenario is 10% probable and the last scenario would be 5% likely.The resulting price is $114.89 per share, or only 0.6% higher than today's price over the next three years:Source: Hake estimatesSpotify has a large absolute market value:Source: Hake estimateIt has steady MAU growth, and good revenue growth. It has to pay a large amount of money to record companies to obtain its music inventory. The resulting margin compression has led to a valuation situation where there is not much upside in Spotify. It is worth no more than $114.89 per share, for the next several years."
4227724,101986,2018-12-11T14:21:56-05:00,"Spotify is hammered for failing to report profits, but that’s irrelevant.
        Major expense items in its P&L, like R&D and certain finance costs, aren’t really operating expenses.
        What really matters is the business model, and Spotify’s is positive for customer growth, churn, and gross margin. (Less so for customer duration and ARPU.).","The media is abuzz about Spotify (SPOT) being deep in the red: “If Spotify is so huge, why is it losing money?” ponders ABC News; “Spotify intended to lose more money.” states the Motley Fool, and Fortune buries the music streaming company for good: “Why Spotify will never make money.” (May 3, 2018). Spotify seems to have reached its end.And yet, despite this gloom, Spotify has a capitalization of almost $25 billion, and its current (December 10, 2018) share price around $130, isn’t far from its initial listing price of $132. (Spotify’s NYSE listing in early April 2018 was not a traditional IPO, raising money from investors. Instead, the company just listed its shares for trade.) And no fewer than 459 institutions hold 52% of the company’s outstanding shares. Haven’t these investors heard that Spotify “will never make money”? What’s going on here?To be sure, a superficial reading of Spotify’s recent income statements conveys a bleak picture: Net losses for the years, 2015-2017, were €230 million, €539 million, and €1,235 million, respectively. Thus, as monthly active users grow (91, 123, and 159 million, respectively, for 2015-2017), and paying subscribers multiply (28, 48, 71 million, respectively, for 2015-2017), Spotify’s losses mount. No wonder Fortune predicted that the company “will never make money.”Yet, a closer examination of Spotify’s income statements reveals a different situation. Two, so called accounting “expenses” -- R&D and finance costs -- stand out. The 2017 R&D cost was €396 million. Readers of my recent book (The End of Accounting, Wiley 2016) and my research on intangibles are well aware of my position on R&D, which is widely shared by economists: R&D is not an expense. (R&D has been treated as an investment in the national income accounts for years.) An accounting expense is defined as a cash outlay without future benefits, like wages, rent, and insurance, which are payment for past services. R&D, in contrast, is conducted with the sole aim of generating future benefits from products and services. It is thus an investment and shouldn’t count against earnings. This is particularly true for early-stage enterprises that invest heavily in R&D to generate future growth, and in the process record accounting “losses.”Spotify’s R&D is aimed “… to design products and features that create and enhance user experiences, and new technologies are at the core of many of these opportunities …. Expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for development of products related to our platform and service, as well as new advertising products and improvements to our mobile application…” (Form F-1, 2018). Do these activities sound to you as expenditures without future benefits?If the expensing of Spotify’s R&D doesn’t make much economic sense, its finance expense will floor you: €855 million of finance costs for 2017. You think: interest paid to banks or bondholders. Far from it. This finance cost is a stunt that only accounting standard-setters could concoct. A footnote on page 74 of Spotify’s F-1, 2018 report states that the finance costs are: “… due primarily to the issuance of the Convertible Notes in April 2016, which are accounted for at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations [income]. Due to the implicit interest rate and an increase in the value of ordinary shares, the expense recorded for Convertible Notes increased by €279 million… The expense recorded for outstanding warrants increased by €255 million due the increase in the value of ordinary shares…”What’s going on here? An increase in Spotify’s share price raises financing costs by over €500 million? Yes, by the following accounting “logic”: As Spotify’s share price increases, the likelihood of convertible notes and warrants to be converted to shares increases and their value accordingly rises. But this is not an increase in Spotify’s liability (debt) to note holders. In case of no conversion, the liability, of course, remains the same. Furthermore, there isn’t any cash outflow associated with this “financing expense.” All it indicates is a possible dilution of shareholders’ value upon the conversion of notes. This is far from an operating expense, as it is presented on the income statement. Ironically, as Spotify was battered recently by analysts for being “profitless,” its share price decreased, and so were the financing costs (€76 million only for third quarter 2018), creating an accounting miracle: share price decreases, and voilà, earnings rise. A new value driver.The upshot: Much of Spotify’s 2017 loss of €1,235 million isn’t really an operating loss, and the company isn’t that far from breaking even. This, indeed, is corroborated by Spotify’s 2017 positive cash flow from operations (€179 million), and positive free cash flow (€109 million). Moreover, for the third quarter of 2018 Spotify reported a small profit (€43 million).Harassing Spotify’s managers to report positive earnings by the deeply flawed accounting measurement of this indicator is obviously unproductive, putting pressure on management to reduce R&D and other growth-driving investments. These accounting earnings cannot be used to evaluate the progress and viability of a business enterprise. Nokia reported for years tons of earnings while it lost its mojo to Apple. Amazon was for years a chronic “loser,” masking its huge strides toward dominance.If not by earnings, how else to evaluate Spotify’s performance? Here, as elsewhere, you should examine carefully the company’s business model and its execution. Spotify’s monthly active users increased from 91 million at end-of-2015 to 159 million at end-of-2017, and further to 191 million on September 30, 2018. Paying users increased from 28 million in 2015 to 71 million in 2017, and to 87 million on September 30, 2018. A healthy customer growth, to be sure. Gross margin increased in the third quarter of 2018 to 25%, from 22% in the same quarter a year earlier. Another plus for Spotify. The key indicator of monthly churn (% subscribers leaving) decreased from 7.5% in 2015 to 5.5% in 2017. Good, but a 5.5% monthly churn rate means that subscribers stay with Spotify only 18 months, on average (1 over churn). Not a particularly long period. Another cloud on Spotify’s horizon is the constant decrease of ARPU (average revenue per user): from €7.06 in 2015 to €5.24 in 2017, and further to €4.73 in September 2018. ARPU decreases generally reflect competitive pressures. Spotify explains the decrease as: “… due principally to growth of the Family Plan and movement in foreign exchange rates.” More details would have been helpful.Obviously, Spotify is not out of the woods yet, but not because of the absence of earnings. Key components of its business model―customer retention and ARPU, in particular―must be shored up.Comparisons with Netflix, often made, are misguided. While Netflix’s marginal costs (the costs of servicing an additional subscriber) are very low, given that the investment in content was completed, Spotify’s marginal costs -- payments to music right-holders for subscriber downloads -- are high. So, unlike many other Internet-services companies, Spotify has to reduce royalties to record labels; a challenging task, given the dominant position of the three major label companies (Sony, Universal, Warner). The key to Spotify’s success is to grow and cash-in on alternative revenue sources, such as advertising and providing use of its subscribers’ “big data” to artists and labels. So, Spotify is still a work-in-process, but, I believe, it’s doing the right things."

Spotify will continue to be challenged as it seeks device partnerships.According to Q3 earnings calls, Spotify (SPOT) may seek to broker user data in order to keep average revenue per user afloat.","Summary: According to Q3 earnings calls, Spotify (SPOT) may seek to broker user data in order to keep average revenue per user afloat. Known as programmatic advertising, this method of monetizing data to supplement music revenue may be Spotify’s only hope to stave off competitors who nip at the heels of the music-streaming app.Spotify Technology met its Q3 forecast for paying subscribers and a few other metrics, but average revenue per user declined due to promotional accounts for families and students. Spotify ended the period with 87 million Premium subscribers worldwide, up 40% year-over-year. Spotify has 109 million monthly active users of its advertising-supported streaming service, up 8 million from Q2 or 20% YoY.This quarter, Spotify’s average revenue per user percentage has improved but QoQ growth is still in the red. Average revenue per user declined to $5.50 in Q3 from $5.83 in Q2, or -6% following -12% the previous quarter.Spotify lacks the razor-razor blade Gillette analogy for tech companies, which in this case states you should have ownership of a device if you want to bank on the subscriptions. This is one reason I’ve been long on Roku (ROKU) since its IPO. Roku players are the cheap razors that will deliver the razor blades of ad-supported content in the OTT market. (You can read my analysis on Roku here). However, this lack of device ownership is causing trouble for Spotify. Smartphones dominated by Apple and Google are only part of the story. At home assistants such as Alexa are being designed and leveraged specifically for AI activated music services. To get a glimpse of Spotify’s future, consider that major record labels let Amazon offer a reduced Alexa version of the premium service at $3.99 per month and Apple is requiring users to sign in to Apple Music to power the HomePod – which completely shuts out devout Spotify users.Spotify’s new strategy is to partner with Google to offer free Google Home Mini speakers to users who subscribe to the Family plan as part of a holiday season promotion. The partnership comes at a cost of approximately 50 basis points to the Gross Margin profile in Q4, the company noted. From Google’s standpoint, they get their entry level smart speaker into more homes, while Spotify benefits by having a partner for smart home infrastructure. Ultimately, this is one example of the lengths Spotify will have to go to in order to compete with Apple and Amazon on their home turf.Most certainly, Apple won’t be beat in its own ecosystem. Apple revolutionized digital music with the iPod and iTunes. With smartphone penetration, the Beats acquisition, its Homepod ecosystem and a huge push into connected car infotainment, Apple can surround Spotify in nearly every direction. Keep in mind, that 66% of the world’s paying app users are iPhone users who trend towards higher incomes (vs. only 34% on Android), so Apple users are supremely important for Spotify’s $9.99 subscriptions.In fact, the turf war has already receded Spotify’s market share. Record industry sources state Apple is adding paying subscribers at a rate of 5 percent in the U.S. versus 2 percent for Spotify, and that Apple Music may have already taken over Spotify as the number one streaming service in the United States.In addition, Apple was cleared to complete the acquisition for UK-based music recognition app Shazam Entertainment for $400 million. Due to the threat this poses to Spotify and other smaller apps, regulators in seven countries contested the acquisition when Apple’s plans were first announced. Despite these efforts, the acquisition was approved in August of 2018. To date, Shazam has had well over 1 billion downloads, last reported in 2016, and owns a wealth of information on what music is trending with over 20 million searches per day.Tim Cook is a chief critic on how applications and websites use private data to increase the accuracy of targeted advertising. Therefore, one area Apple clearly won’t compete is in the brokering of programmatic ads based on users’ music choices. Meanwhile, Spotify has every intention of letting advertisers target its users through Ad Studio.Spotify would not be the first mobile application to supplement its core product with a programmatic offering. Facebook and Twitter owe at least 1/6th to 1/4th of their current revenue to programmatic proving it can substantially increase average revenue per user. Therefore, if Ad Studio is executed correctly, it may have the potential to limit stock losses even with stiff competition from Apple and Amazon.Here’s a statement from Spotify’s press release:Spotify owns Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) shares and it’s been stated in past financial reports that “a TME IPO would trigger a fair market value adjustment to the carrying value of our investment recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain could be significant.” This one-time, non-recurring event would generate a Net income for Spotify with a Net loss returning in the following quarters. Spotify stock holders should be aware that this one-time wave may be worthwhile to hold on for, but that the long-term prospects of the company are still not proven.Spotify is a small fish in deep waters. Q3 earnings prove music streaming is a tough business. The company is attempting to partner with device owners, like Google, but these partnerships will eat away at Gross Margins in future quarterly earnings. Last month, when the stock was at $184, I wrote that you could expect a one-day drop. It's now at $140. Tencent Entertainment Music IPO will produce a one-time Net income for Spotify this quarter. If Spotify can revive their ARPU through programmatic ads, the stock may stage a turnaround, but it's not likely in the near future. The bottom line is that the competitive market for music streaming will continue to be a major challenge for Spotify.Portions of this article were originally published September 27th, 2018 in 8 Reasons Spotify will be a Sell Recommendation by 2019 at $184 per share.

The gross profit margin has also increased a lot. In 2017, the gross profit increased by 111% as the company was able to sell more subscriptions. Interestingly, revenue growth can increase at a higher pace in the future as the company is increasing its prices:Source: BloombergWith that, Spotify has not been able to deliver profits at the income level, which may worry value investors. The net losses increased by 436% in the last two years. Growth investors may not really care about the losses at the net income level. However, after ten years, perhaps the company should deliver a profitable business model. The growth is welcome, but Spotify should not be able to deliver growth indefinitely. The image below provides the income statement:Source: ProspectusThe most recent quarterly reports showed that revenue growth continues. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the company delivered a 31% increase as compared to the same quarter in 2017. The gross profit also increased by 48%. With that, it is beneficial that the net income was negative in 2017, but it became positive in the three months ended September 30, 2018. Take a look at the image below for further details:Source: 6-KIn the cash flow statement, Spotify showed positive and growing CFO in 2016 and 2017. In 2017, the CFO increased by 77% after turning positive in 2016. It is quite a beneficial feature that value investors should assess. The image below provides the cash flow statement released in the prospectus:Source: ProspectusAs of September 30, 2018, with an asset/liability ratio of 1.63x, the balance sheet is also quite solid. The financial situation has also improved as the asset/liability ratio was equal to 1x on December 31, 2017. The most relevant was 129% increase in the amount of cash and 74% increase in long-term investments. Spotify seems cash-rich. Cash comprises 26% of the total amount of assets. The image below shows the total amount of assets:Source: 6-KThe liabilities should not worry investors. The company reported an 11% decrease in the amount of total liabilities, and the company paid out its convertible notes. With this in mind, as of today, the balance sheet of Spotify seems quite clean. The image below provides the list of liabilities:Source: 6-KAs of November 22, 2018, with 178 million shares outstanding at $132, the market capitalization equals $23.49 billion. Deducting cash of $1.25 billion, the enterprise value equals $22.24 billion. Assuming 30% revenue growth as suggested by Spotify, 2019 forward revenues of $7 billion seem reasonable. With this figure, the EV/Forward Revenue equals 3.1x.Apple (AAPL) Music is a direct competitor, but it is a business inside Apple. It is not ideal for valuing the business of Spotify. Other competitors are Deezer, Napster or Rhapsody, Tidal, and SoundCloud Ltd., but they are private.Pandora is being acquired by Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) for $3.5 billion. Pandora’s acquisition is made at 1.74x sales with 33% gross profit margin, but very small revenue growth. According to Ycharts, Pandora’s revenue growth was equal to 5.92% y/y. Take a look at it:Source: Ycharts Taking into account the revenue growth of Pandora, it makes sense that SPOT has a larger valuation. The company trades at 3.1x sales while Pandora does it at 1.74x sales. SPOT’s revenue growth is seven times that of Pandora and their gross profit margins are very similar. Thus, SPOT should trade at more than 3.1x sales. It should not trade at seven times the ratio of Pandora, but 5x-6x sales would be reasonable.There is another good reason to believe that SPOT could trade higher in the future. The company announced very recently a new share price repurchase program of $1 billion. The image below provides further details:Source: Seeking Alpha - Repurchase ProgramThe company will buy stock until 2021, thus the market reaction could take many months. However, with the new stock buyback, the demand for the stock should increase in the near future, which should lead to share price appreciation.The founders control large stakes in Spotify, and they decided to sell approximately 55.73 million in the IPO. It is not ideal. It may explain why the stock is trading undervalued. The image below shows that Daniel Ek owns a 37% stake, and Martin Lorentzon owns a 43.5% stake. The images below provide further details on this matter:Source: ProspectusSource: ProspectusWith revenues growing at 30% y/y and fat gross profit margins, Spotify could trade at 5x sales, or $203. The downside risk does not seem that large. If the company’s revenue growth decreases to 6%, SPOT could trade, like Pandora, at 1.74x sales, or $75.

Outside of Apple (AAPL) products in the U.S, the market is positioned to favor an independent streaming service like Spotify. Notable deals with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Sky and DAZN highlight the global leadership position of the service in places like the UK and Japan.Source: Spotify Q3'18 earnings release The company is investing in the future without blowing up the balance sheet. The Q3 results generated positive free cash flow while the Q4 results include a near breakeven forecast.Margins definitely matter long term, but staying close to breakeven is more important than maximizing profits in a competitive space.Spotify sees the recent sell-off as so ridiculous that the company has unleashed a $1 billion stock buyback plan. The balance sheet is stocked with cash and investments of €3.35 billion or nearly $4 billion.One can't really argue with utilizing some of this cash, but the company might be wise to build a war chest for competing with the tech giants in this space. Further investments like the position in Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) at $6.52 prior to the recently paused IPO plan might be more warranted, than share buybacks.The valuation comparison to Netflix (NFLX) is far more compelling as growth continues and the stock is at all-time lows. The companies pay for content differently, but the concept is very similar making the comparison worthwhile. Netflix continues to trade double the Spotify trailing P/S ratio.SPOT PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThose bullish on Netflix need to realize that the historical growth rates haven't been anything special in relation to what Spotify is generating now. The growth rates are actually very similar around the 30% rate.SPOT Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsThe ironic part here is that Netflix is suggested as having the advantage with controlling content, yet the company has over $18 billion in license obligations and an annual free cash burn of $3 billion. In addition, analyst forecasts are for Netflix to continually spend more on content while Spotify has a more fixed component. Goldman Sachs predicted its content costs surging from $12.5 billion to $22.5 in the next four years.The music streaming market is more based on software and services, as opposed to the spending war going on in video content. The original disadvantage could turn into a long-term advantage against the tech giants with unlimited balance sheets.The key investor takeaway is that Spotify is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the global growth in streaming music. Some short-term margin hits for promotional holiday tests is no reason to dump the stock.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4218018,103480,2018-11-04T12:56:01-05:00,"Shares of Spotify cratered nearly 10% after reporting weak Q3 results.Revenues just barely beat Wall Street's consensus, while Premium subscribers were in line and total MAUs fell below estimates.Perhaps even more worrying was that the company's revenue guidance fell light of forecasts, and Spotify also shaved some MAUs off its prior forecast.Spotify is hitting a wall when it comes to growth, while its content acquisition costs show no signs of slowing down. This will drive the business deeper into the red.The company has also signaled that it will begin relying on promotions to drive growth.","Spotify (SPOT) has had a bit of a jerky ride since its high-profile direct listing earlier this year, and after reporting soft Q3 results, Spotify is headed back toward its 52-week lows. Spotify illustrates very clearly to investors that just because a particular company is a high-profile brand that is incredibly popular with consumers, there is no guarantee that it can perform well as a stock (perhaps a lesson to keep in mind as Uber and Lyft stir up IPO talks).Spotify entered life as a public company with extremely high expectations from investors and from Wall Street. At first, investors were hoping for Spotify to become the next Netflix (NFLX) and continue capturing growth in overseas markets while scaling toward eventual profitability. This quarter, Spotify has moved further away from that optimistic thesis: while subscribers and MAUs are definitely seeing a worrying slowdown, Spotify's spending requirements to continue to acquire popular music to attract subscribers keep rising.Spotify, like Netflix, has long struggled with profitability. Relative to the breadth of its service (basically any music you want - at just $9.99 per month, or less if you're on a family plan), Spotify isn't generating nearly enough revenue to keep acquiring expensive content and keep the lights on at corporate. A pricing increase would make Spotify run afoul of the competitive landscape, but neither is a cost reduction or slowdown in content acquisition realistic either.Thankfully, Spotify still has plenty of liquidity to tide it through many more quarters. As of its most recent balance sheet, Spotify carried €3.35 billion of cash on its books (see below):Figure 1. Spotify cash balancesSource: Spotify investor relationsThe company has also managed barely positive FCF in the year-to-date so far. However, IFRS-based profits and a positive bottom line still seem far in sight. The company has also been promoting its offerings heavily in order to attract new subscribers. Just this week, Spotify announced a rather generous promotion in which its Family Plan account holders will be rewarded with a free Google Home Mini (worth $49, per Google's store site). Relying on promos to drive customer growth is always a barbed situation, and one that retailers like Macy's (M) have long suffered the consequences for - it becomes much harder to drive organic growth in the absence of a promo if customers have been trained to expect discounted offers.The cost of this promo isn't inconsequential, either - Spotify has noted that it will drive a 50 bps headwind to gross margins in Q4.In my view, Spotify's share price decline accurately captures the anticipated slowdown in its business as well as the steeper cost environment the company is now facing. Though it's tempting to buy such a high-profile name while it seems to be on sale, I'd rather wait on the sidelines for shares to climb still lower.SPOT data by YChartsPart of the pessimism for Spotify's fourth quarter stems from its rather lackluster guidance. Here's the company's latest outlook:Figure 2. Spotify guidanceSource: Spotify investor relationsWall Street had expected revenues of €1.49 billion for Q4. The midpoint of Spotify's guidance points to just €1.45 billion in revenues, which would imply just 26% y/y growth in the fourth quarter relative to last year's Q4 revenues of €1.15 billion. Sequentially, that's down five points from this quarter's growth rate of 31% y/y.This is in spite of the aforementioned Google Home promo, which is expected to drive 50 bps of margin headwinds in the quarter. Spotify also took down its MAU forecast to 199-206 million (versus a top end range of 207 million previously) and its premium subscriber forecast to 93-96 million (versus a top end range of 97 million previously).There are clear signs, in my opinion, that Spotify is bracing itself for a major growth slowdown and it's applying preventative promotional measures to prevent it. Heavier spending, however, is hardly the answer that investors want to hear.Here's a look at Spotify's full Q3 results:Figure 3. Spotify Q3 2018 resultsSource: Spotify investor relationsRevenues grew 31% y/y to €1.35 billion, just barely inching past Wall Street's expectations of €1.34 billion. Narrow revenue beats (and even misses) have been a major trend with large-cap technology companies in this earnings season, and investors haven't taken too kindly to the deceleration in spite of EPS beats.User results, like at Netflix, carry much weight with Spotify investors and are often considered more important than the financials themselves. Unfortunately these, too, were mixed.Figure 4. Spotify user metricsSource: Spotify investor relationsPremium subscribers were the bright spot here, growing a robust 40% y/y to 87 million. The ratio of premium subscribers to total MAUs has also consistently been on the rise, this quarter hitting 46% of total MAUs (five points stronger than the year-ago period). These results were slightly ahead of consensus, which had pinned hopes of 86.9 million subscribers for the quarter. Total MAUs, however, elicited some disappointment. The company had guided to 188-193 million in total MAUs for the quarter, and Wall Street had expected slightly higher than the midpoint of that range at 191.8 million. Unfortunately, Spotify landed only in the exactly middle of that range, at 191.0 million MAUs. Combined with the news that Spotify is taking down its user forecasts for the fourth quarter, investors didn't react too positively to the user trends this quarter.And, as is usual with Spotify, the company's cost equation continued to raise eyebrows. Again, there is a small positive highlight here - total gross margins increased three points relative to the year-ago quarter, up now to 25.3%, helped by profitability increases for ad-supported (free) users. Premium subscribers, however, are the higher-yielding customers within Spotify's user base, and margins for these customers dipped 80 bps to 26.1% (from 26.9% in Q3 2018).Spotify did well on the bottom line this quarter, bumping up its operating margin to -0.5%, an improvement of 650 bps on a year-over-year basis. However, the company's press release noted that this largely had to do with the timing of hiring. Since the company had a ""shortfall"" in recruitment in Q3, it intends to make up for it in Q4. From the earnings release:The translation: these margin gains are likely temporary, and will be offset by higher headcount costs in the very near future.At the moment, Spotify is at best a hold. The company's business model is at a crossroads: it faces the challenge of stimulating its subscriber growth, but at the same time it hasn't offered much clarity on the status of its path toward breakeven. Its cash flows currently are mediocre at best, and in order to continue growing, Spotify is signaling that it will have to invest heavily not only on content but on promotions as well.With the expected deceleration in both subscribers/MAUs and revenues, I believe Spotify to be fairly priced. Remain cautious on this stock until more favorable news surfaces."

The MAU (Monthly Active User) grew at an average annual rate of ~31% between 2015 to 2017, the premium subscriber grew at ~60%. The company has a history of scaling quickly, having only launched 10 years ago.The current MAU as a percentage of smartphone users is 13% on a global basis. This suggests that upside to user growth is still significant for SPOT when compared to other apps like YouTube and Netflix.Source: Morgan StanleyIn Spotify's current markets, the TAM will increase to 1.6 billion in 2021 according to Morgan Stanley. Additional markets where SPOT doesn't currently have a presence equates to an additional 1.7 billion users by 2021. Given the size of the addressable market and current growth rates, SPOT can add over 200 million new MAUs and 100 million new premium subscribers over the next 3-4 years.Source: Morgan StanleySPOT revenue has grown from 2.9B euros in 2016 to 4.1B euros in 2017 (40% growth) and estimated at about 5.3B euros for 2018 (29% growth). A major factor for the growth is its ""freemium"" model, where mobile users are given limited functionality with advertisements and shuffle playing of music.The free user base is used as a funnel to a paid plan with several unlocked convenience features, including offline access to the content library, removal of advertisements, and unlimited song skips. This model has proved effective thus far with about 45% of users pay for Spotify Premium.One of the most unique approaches of the service is its use of user data, which it collects and converts into suggestions for music to listen to and content to explore. The service is active in pop music culture, with curated playlists tailored to specific eras of music, popularity, and user's mood. Users are active engagers of this content, with up to 20% of streams via Spotify's own playlists. Celebrities and figures of interest also have the capability of sharing their personal playlists to an audience, which supports revenue by increasing the public marketability of the service.Spotify is also venturing into other forms of audio-related content. Podcasts are now available for users, allowing them to engage in an alternative form of entertainment. This expands the portfolio of the company's offerings and provides a platform for future revenue growth in streaming.Spotify is also entering into the marketplace for concerts, with a curated list of suggested and popular music concerts available from within the service, with the option to purchase tickets. By broadening the offering of music-related products, the service is increasing its value as a ""one-stop shop"" for music exploration.Spotify closed on its first day of trading on April 3, 2018, at $149.01 per share. At close, the market value stood at $26 billion, giving it the title of the eight-largest tech IPO. In the next four months SPOT surged, reaching $192 per share in late August. Since it's high, Spotify has fallen to around its IPO price of $149.Several factors have weighed on the shares mostly related to issues outside of the company's control. The October sell-off was concentrated in Technology stocks and consequently affected SPOT. Furthermore, stocks which have recently gone public sold off more than the market. The IPO ETF which tracks companies which have recently gone public is down 12% since the end of September vs. -5% for the S&P 500.Source: KoyfinSpotify recently reported 3Q results that were largely in-line with expectations. Premium net adds of 4m for the quarter matched what analysts expected. The company slightly lowered its top-end of guidance for next quarter but this doesn't represent a material change. The company also announced a $1B share repurchase authorization though the implementation and timing are unclear.There are several moving pieces which are difficult to handicap to arrive at a price target. On the revenue side, SPOT will continue to penetrate new markets and the existing smartphone user base. Using assumptions of long-term penetration rates discussed above, it's reasonable to forecast that SPOT can double its user base to 400m in 4 years. The biggest unknown factor is what are the costs that SPOT will need to pay to the record companies. Bears argue that the record companies will raise prices and eat into any profits for SPOT. However, as discussed below, the record companies are incentivized to support SPOT because it's an effective distribution channel. Furthermore, SPOT provides a counterbalance to other distributors like Apple and Amazon which have more bargaining power than SPOT.Given the difficulty in estimating profits, the best methodology is to use sales. On a P/S basis, SPOT trades at a lower multiple than other internet peers.Source: KoyfinAnalysts estimate that SPOT will grow earnings about 65% over the next 2 years. Given its P/S multiple is at the lower range of its internet peers, the stock can increase in-line with its sales growth over the next 2 years.Most investors don't realize that the music industry was until recently in a steady decline. Music sales peaked in 1999 when CDs dominated the way people listened to music. Over the next 10 years, Napster and MP3s allowed music listeners to bypass the high price of CDs in favor of illegal downloads. Though cost-effective, this solution was inconvenient because the files were of poor quality, difficult to find and unorganized. When streaming music was introduced, it gave people access to an on-demand library of any song organized by artist, album or genre. This was a benefit users were willing to pay for.According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the global music market grew by 8.1% in 2017, marking the third consecutive year of growth and one of the highest rates since they started tracking the data in 1997. This renewed growth in the industry was driven by streaming which accounted for more than 38% of the total revenue in 2017 compared to 6.7% in 2012.Source: IFPISince 2013, streaming revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of ~46% and we believe this trend will continue because of the relatively low penetration rate of the total addressable market. Spotify's leading market share, freemium business model and cross-platform operability gives it the upper hand over Apple Music to capture a significant portion of the streaming music market which is likely to grow by a CAGR of 20% through 2025.Source: Morgan StanleyThough much as been said and written about the battle between record labels and Spotify and eventual judgement day between the two in a Netflix-esque ending because of their push towards two-sided business model, we should not forget the vested interest of record label companies in preventing the demise if not outright success of Spotify.It was Spotify and its CEO Daniel Ek who innovated and brought the streaming business model to the masses to sanitize the digital music industry which was then plagued with rampant piracy. Moreover, Spotify's existence gives them more leverage when negotiating licensing deals with other streaming platforms like Apple Music.In a space where the products are homogenous, how is Spotify different and moreover, superior to other streaming services? The number one thing that sets Spotify apart from its main competitor Apple Music, is that it offers a free, ad-supported tier. 99 million people listen to Spotify through its ad-supported free service. This allows Spotify to gain users that are hesitant to spend money for a music streaming service.Spotify is available on almost every device that can play music. Users can stream Spotify to any audio or Bluetooth wire speaker, to an AirPlay speaker from an iOS device, or to a Chromecast speaker from an Android device. Spotify is available on Amazon Alexa speakers, Google smart speakers, and if a device is certified as Spotify Connect compatible, it means you can use the Spotify app as a remote to control playback. Spotify is also available across a wide range of other devices like Xbox and PlayStation. Apple Music is not supported on Amazon Alexa or Google Smart speakers and it cannot be used on game systems.Technology investment will continue to be a priority for the company to differentiate from competitors. On the 3Q earnings call, CFO Barry McCarthy hammed the point home.Lastly, there is meaningful friction for existing users to leave the app. If users change music streaming services, they lose all their custom playlists and Spotify social network. Furthermore, if users are locked into family plans, an offer that Spotify is heavily promoting, it can be much harder for the users within the family plan to leave. This can be seen in their steadily decreasing churn rate, even as its user growth continues to outpace those of Apple Music and other rivals.Special thanks to Tenzin Thinlley, Owen Chun and Nikhil Kumar for help with researching this report"
4229262,104398,2018-12-19T14:57:37-05:00,"The two biggest online music platforms in the world became public in 2018 and currently carry the same valuation of around $20 billion.Though Tencent Music has drawn comparisons to Spotify, there are big differences between the two companies.Spotify mostly relies on a subscription service that suffers from tough unit economics: after 10 years, it still offers limited social features and has yet to be profitable.Tencent Music offers social entertainment services on multiple apps and uses music content as a gateway to its highly profitable ecosystem.I explain here why I believe Tencent Music is the only one I would consider, and why it could be multiple times the valuation of Spotify in the coming years.","Music is a commodity. The real value is in the ecosystem.Two companies of the online music services industry have become public in 2018: the Swedish company Spotify (SPOT) and the China-based Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), a spin-off of Tencent Holdings (OTCPK:TCEHY), the social media behemoth behind WeChat and most of the biggest video games in the world.Despite the fact that they technically belong to the same industry, there are significant differences between Spotify and Tencent Music. Yet, they almost have the same valuation today of around $20 billion.Here is my thesis:Spotify is to Tencent Music what Snapchat (SNAP) is to Facebook (FB):These two companies should not have the same valuation because they have widely different prospects and optionality.I wouldn't be surprised if TME is more than three times the market cap of SPOT within the next three years.Here's why.Source: Spotify Q2 Earnings and Tencent Music Form F-1. (*) Market Cap from Yahoo Finance 12/16/2018. Charts by App Economy Insights.Chinese Internet equities have suffered through most of 2018. The CSI 300 index is now down almost 30% from its 2018 high back in January. The CAPE (Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings) ratio is currently at 29 for the S&P 500 vs. a PE of 12 for the CSI 300.The main explanation is visible in the comment section of many articles covering Chinese stocks on Seeking Alpha: fear.From a generalization of fraud allegations straight out of The China Hustle to the China-US trade war, investors have many ways to justify that Chinese equities could go much lower - even companies which are solely focused on the Chinese market and are not impacted by any tariffs.Comparing US and Chinese valuations in the same industry can be a great way to illustrate how imbalanced the valuations really are at this point in the business cycle.With Tencent Music down more than 15% following its IPO at the bottom of the range expected, the negative narrative is in full sail. The resulting volatility can be a source of opportunity for suited investors.Image SourceOn the one hand, Spotify is an app that has been out for more than 10 years (an eternity in the tech industry) and is still the same core music streaming product, without the strong social features that should be reasonably expected in this day and age, and without a clear edge over its competitors in Europe such as Deezer, or in the US such as YouTube Music (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Music (AAPL) and Amazon Music (AMZN).Spotify is the world leading platform in number of subscribers with 80+ million reached in 2018.The company is first and foremost an online distributor of the catalog of the Big Three (Sony Music (SNE), Universal Music Group (VIV), and Warner Music Group), with royalties accounting for around 75% of its revenue. I think of it as a Netflix (NFLX) for songs that would have very limited original content.90% of Spotify's revenue comes from users paying a monthly subscription and 10% from ad-supported free users.Spotify is growing revenue at a pace of 26% YoY. Image Source: TME Form F-1On the other hand, Tencent Music Entertainment has built an ecosystem of four core apps that combine 800 million Monthly Average Users: QQ Music, KuGou, Kuwo, and WeSing with a suite of value-added, monetizable interactions with music and its creators that Tencent calls ""social entertainment services."" 70% of TME's revenue derived from ""virtual gifts,"" a business model found on other social platforms such as Huya (HUYA), Momo (MOMO) in China, or the video game streaming platform Twitch (owned by Amazon) in the West.Only 9.5 million users are spending money on features offered by the ""social entertainment services."" That means 70% of TME's revenue comes from only 1% of its Monthly Average Users.In a way, TME's revenue comes from the digitization and monetization of the live entertainment industry online, the true money-maker of the music industry.ARPPU for TME's social entertainment services in Q2 FY18 was about $16, which is nearly 3x that of Spotify.That kind of ARPPU illustrates how Tencent Music is boxing in a different category. A freemium model that converts only a very small portion of MAUs with outstanding monetization coming from the power users is reminiscent of the free-to-play or ""live services"" model in the video game industry.Tencent Music has obviously learned from the gaming industry. After all, Tencent is the world leader in gaming and the parent company of the makers of Clash Royale (Supercell), League of Legends (Riot Games) and Fortnite (Epic Games).From an innovation perspective, Tencent Music is years ahead of Spotify, partially because some of its features are particularly relevant to a Chinese audience. Throughout its F-1 filing, TME has outlined many differentiating features for which Spotify might never find an audience in the West:Given that Tencent Music has now reached more than 800 million Monthly Average Users, any additional feature has the potential to monetize in a meaningful way.Tencent Music is growing revenue at a pace of 92% YoY.Revenue Mix Winner: Tencent Music Entertainment (1-0)Image SourceThe chart above published by Midia Research is already almost two years old, but it is the most satisfying to me as it conveys properly the kind of companies Spotify is really competing with: Google, Apple, Amazon.These internet giants are offering online music services only as an extended retention tool for their ecosystems, and they most likely operate their music division ""at cost,"" given their very competitive pricing.This begs the question: how is Spotify expected to have pricing power over time when its competitors will be willing to maintain very competitive offerings?More importantly, the future potentially profitable ventures that Spotify might consider such as video live-streaming of concerts will face a much tougher competition in the West where video content is dominated by YouTube, Twitch and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Image Source: TechNodeTencent is facing much more limited competition with 75% market share on the music streaming front in China. It makes sense, since it has exclusive rights in China with Sony and Warner.NetEase Cloud Music (NTES) appears to be the only relevant competitor with 16% market share.As explained above, the real rivals of Tencent Music arguably are in the form of social media giants eating away at users' time such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitch in the West, or ByteDance and Momo (MOMO) and Huya in the East.Competition Winner: Tencent Music Entertainment (2-0)As disclosed by the financials at the end of Q2:Not only does TME appear to have more favorable deals than Spotify on the music streaming front, but it also generates the majority of its revenue in a fundamentally different and more profitable business.One might also wonder if Spotify can ever get to the critical mass that will enable its business to cover its SG&A in a meaningful way. It's pretty simple: if 10 years and more than 80 million subscribers cannot get you to profitability, what will?Investors looking at the Price to Sales ratio to justify the valuation of Spotify are making a mistake. Spotify is in a commoditized business with the biggest companies in the world offering most of the same content at cost value in a race to the bottom.Unit Economics are clearly favoring Tencent.Profitability Winner: Tencent Music Entertainment (3-0)In December 2017, Spotify and Tencent Music bought equity stakes in each other.What it really revealed is that these two companies are not competing. Instead, it reveals how Tencent wants to dominate the music industry the way it conquered the video game world, by diversifying its interests in any geography, category and consumers it has yet to reach.Over the years, Tencent Holdings took stakes in the most successful video game studios in the world and shared with them its best practice.Consider this: Tencent Music is years ahead in features, social integration and monetization tools. All Tencent needs is more users under its umbrella.As detailed by Eric Johsa from TheStreet:There is a flywheel effect resulting from Tencent's massive platforms. Users have the option to register for TME's services via WeChat or QQ accounts. They listen to a song on QQ Music, sing it on WeSing and share it with their friend on WeChat, compelling them to download the apps of the entire ecosystem.As Peter Lynch noted in his book One Up on Wall Street, spin-offs like TME can be a great investment for many reasons:Backing Winner: Tencent Music Entertainment (4-0)The IPO dilemma for bothIt can be very tempting to buy shares of a company as soon as they are available publicly. The reality is that it's been historically a bad idea, and you are probably better off waiting for a few quarters before starting a position. It gives you a chance to look into the quarter-to-quarter performance, understand the growth of the business sequentially, and make an educated decision.It's hard to deny that Spotify has a Snapchat profile - an extremely popular app that struggles to define its future among a lack of profitability.Given that both Spotify and Tencent Music are still in their first year as public companies, I would personally stay away from both for now.Legal headwinds & volatility expected for TMEAnother factor to consider is the lack of visibility on the hundreds of pending lawsuits against Tencent Music in regard to allegations of copyrights infringement disclosed by the company in its Form F-1.As any Chinese Internet equity, TME is likely to be an emotional roller-coaster. If you want to get an idea of what to expect, look at the one year chart of companies like iQiyi (IQ) and Huya that went public earlier in 2018. You need to understand that you are looking at a stock that could double in 6 months, but also drop 50% in a matter of weeks. This kind of investment is not for everyone, and your best strategy is probably to stay away if you don't have a three-year-plus time horizon.Risk Profile Winner: nobody (4-0)I would avoid Spotify, the same way I avoided Snapchat. The company has been trying for 10 years to distribute music and still doesn't have a clear path to profitability. Yet, it is valued like it's already there.Meanwhile, I am putting Tencent Music Entertainment high on my watch list. I want to wait for a few quarters to see how TME delivers as a public company before I pull the trigger, but the company represents the closest thing there is to a digitization and gamification of direct-to-fan and live entertainment segments, the true stars of the music industry."
4208158,104746,2018-09-25T12:30:18-04:00,"With growing competition, Spotify's path to profit looks more dull than ever.Spotify lacks a moat which Apple Music has.With their financials getting worse every quarter, their market share dying and their inability to keep up with Apple Music, Spotify is a sell.","Although Spotify (SPOT) might be a good app, their stock and company entail a lot of risks. With a forward P/E of -178.59X and growing competition, their path to profitability is becoming harder every day. With Apple (AAPL) Music growing, Spotify is starting to see big competition. Apple Music, obviously, is able to market on iPhones as Apple owns both.To add to this, Apple recently acquired Shazam which will give them an edge over Spotify if implemented in Apple Music. Considering Apple is making huge efforts to add users and Spotify simply isn’t, Apple Music was able to take over as the top music streaming app. Because of the company's lack of profit, growing competition and lack of a good moat, it is hard to see Spotify becoming profitable anytime soon.Of course, in the music streaming world, there is a lot of competition. For now, to make it easier, we will just focus on Apple Music. Over the years, Spotify and Pandora (NYSE:P) were the two biggest names in this market until Pandora started to die and Spotify took over. This all changed once Apple Music entered the market. Apple Music used to offer songs as a pay per song deal but they ventured into music streaming not too long ago which is proving to be a smart move. Because of Apple Music’s discounts and ability to advertise, they have been able to take over the top spot.Image Source: StatistaAlready, Spotify has had trouble seeing profit and Apple Music’s emergence as the alpha dog has not made it any easier. On a side note, in an interview with The Verge, an Apple spokesperson said this about the Shazam acquisition, “Apple Music and Shazam are a natural fit, sharing a passion for music discovery and delivering great music experiences to our users. We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today’s agreement.” This statement gives many the belief that Shazam’s technology will be implemented into Apple Music. This would give another reason for users to join Apple Music.As many know, Spotify’s financials are not good, plain and simple. With a forward P/E of -178.59, the company isn’t looking at profit. For starters, their EPS in Q2 was -2.59 missing expectations by 223.7%. What is even worse is their EPS for Q1 was -1.19 meaning they lost over double in Q2 quarter over quarter.Although this is bad, what makes it worse is that there is nothing pointing to the fact that they can make a profit. With growing competition and them losing market share, it is hard to believe they will hit a profit soon, possibly ever. With the stock being up 32.59% on the year, and no real incentive, the company should not stay up.Image Source: Shareholder Q2Although revenue has grown year over year, it has come with a cost. As shown in the operating loss, they are losing at a rate higher than ever before. With margins nearly as high as in 2016, things don’t look amazing for Spotify. Considering Apple Music is only on the rise with no signs of slowing down, I can only see Spotify’s losses mounting up as they try to keep up.Finally, one of the more important points is Spotify’s lack of a good moat. Although this could be argued with most music streaming apps, Apple Music is doing things to change that. If Apple Music implements Shazam, that is an amazing moat. Unlike Apple Music, Spotify has nothing but a clean software that makes their app better than any other. Spotify also has an inferior catalog. Certain songs will go on Apple Music before Spotify which is a big hit to Spotify.To go even further, Jay Z a famous rapper has pulled his albums from Spotify. Again, this is a big hit to Spotify. With equal rates as Apple Music, money isn’t a pull factor, in fact, it’s a push factor. I say this because Apple Music offers a discount to students and Spotify doesn’t. This pulls in a lot more students than Spotify does.Overall, I find it very hard to believe that Spotify will see a profit anytime in the near future. With the lack of a moat, growing competition and abysmal financials, Spotify’s future looks bad. If Spotify continues to let Apple Music bully it and take their spot as number 1, Spotify doesn’t seem like a smart investment. With a disgusting P/E ratio, growing loss and an EPS that continues to disappoint, the company does not have much going for them.I have covered a lot of growth stocks that seem overvalued to the shallow eye and have tried to prove that theory wrong yet with Spotify, it is impossible to do that. Unless the company can grow to be the number one streaming service again and start to make acquisitions that help the company, at the price it is at now and the state the company is at now, it is a sell."
4208023,22148,2018-09-24T19:52:31-04:00,"Sirius XM bought Pandora Media for $3.5 billion.Streaming music remains the growth engine of the U.S. music industry.Spotify trades below 4x revenue estimates for 2019, offering an attractive value on any weakness caused by the deal.","On Monday, Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) announced an agreement to acquire Pandora Media (P) in a deal to move the satellite radio leader aggressively into the streaming music industry. The move makes the combined Sirius XM/Pandora cohort a threat to Spotify (SPOT), but the move doesn't change our long-held bullish investment thesis on the streaming music leader.Sirius XM agreed to purchase Pandora for roughly $3.5 billion in an all-stock deal. Pandora shareholders get 1.44 shares of SIRI for each share of P. Due to the over 10% loss by Sirius XM, Pandora shares actually fell following the deal announcement. At $6.26 per share for Sirius XM, the deal only values Pandora at $9.01 per share.In the latest quarter, Sirius XM added 483,000 net new self-pay subscribers, bringing the total paying base to 28.2 million. Total customers were up to 33.5 million. The size of the satellite company seems impressive until realizing why the company felt the need to do this deal.According to music industry research from RIAA, the U.S. market grew by 28% last year to $3.4 billion. Virtually, all of the gains came from the streaming music portion with digital and customized radio services seeing minimal growth.Source: RIAA mid-year 2018 reportOnce a leader in music industry, Sirius XM is now far behind Spotify. In fact, the new combined company has revenue estimates for next fiscal year below the analyst forecasts for Spotify. The analyst estimates show Spotify at $7.9 billion and the combined new entity of Sirius XM/Pandora at $7.8 billion.SPOT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsSpotify leads the streaming music market with paying subscribers at 83 million and monthly active users (MAUs) at an incredible 180 million with a goal of reaching around 200 million by year end. Apple (AAPL) Music has already surpassed the subscribers of Sirius XM due to a global base. The satellite-based service has already lost out on the market and taking a third-tier asset like Pandora and taking a year to integrate doesn't solve the problem.During Q2, Pandora had 71.4 million active users and only 6.0 million paying subscribers, being late to the subscription model. Clearly, Sirius XM hopes to combine the user bases to push more subscriptions of either music or radio service. The problem is that Pandora saw listening hours dip by 2.5% to 5.09 billion hours in the quarter. Maybe a deep-pocket backer will help the business expand again.In my opinion, Spotify has too dominant of a position, and Apple is too big of a competitor for Sirius XM to reclaim share in the market already ceded to these powerful players.Spotify isn't the same bargain above $175 as when the stock came public and traded down into the $130s, though the stock isn't that expensive at less than 4x sales estimates of $7.9 billion next year.The market still has a lot of concerns surrounding the ultimate valuation of the stock due to ongoing losses. A bigger threat the size of Sirius XM doesn't help much with already weak margins.Analysts forecast Spotify getting much closer to breakeven in 2019. The company only forecasts minimal quarterly losses going forward when excluding currency impacts and stock-based compensation charges.SPOT EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsGross margins are targeted to approach 26% in Q4, and reaching 30% would eliminate operating losses. The key to this deal is whether this ultimately has any cost pressures in a competitive market. Absent this issue popping up via promotions on monthly subscription costs, the deal isn't likely to hurt Spotify in any meaningful way.The key investor takeaway is that the stock is more of a tentative buy at these levels. Spotify is not the discount it offered when originally trading below $150 for the first month or so after coming public, but the company has a long path to generating value by transferring another 100 million MAUs to subscribers. Use any weakness caused by this move by Sirius XM to aggressively enter the space as an opportunity to buy the streaming music leader.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4208179,104412,2018-09-25T13:06:19-04:00,"Spotify's numbers don't add up with a huge miss on EPS in Q2, slowing user growth to 5-6% and a decline in average revenue per user of -12%.Spotify is falling behind in voice-based computing with features such as asking for songs through verbal commands and voice-activated queries due to a lack of lyric recognition.Meanwhile, Apple Music is overtaking Spotify in the coveted United States market and Apple's market share will surge in 2019 with the recent acquisition of Shazam.Spotify is surrounded by ecoystem-level competitors who have the device market cornered.Speculators may ride the Tencent Music Entertainment IPO wave but must be careful of Spotify repeating the 40% one-day drop that Pandora experienced. Long-term Spotify will be a sell.","Bandwagons are easy to jump on but it can be hard to decide when it’s time to get off, especially when a stock has famous hedge funds like Soros Fund Management, Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, and Louis Bacon’s Capital Management holding sizable stakes. Since its IPO in April, Spotify (SPOT) has seen an $8 billion rally in market value for an all-time high market cap of $34 billion following Q2 earnings.The bull storyline is that Spotify is the leader in streaming music with nearly 40% of market share in 2017 – which is double what Apple Music holds and 4x the number of Amazon music subscribers (source: Statista). There is a strong case for future earnings as 83 million monthly subscribers pay for Spotify’s premium service price at $9.99 per month to $14.99 for the premium plan.Despite a healthy user base, I believe Spotify is reaching its peak due to hefty royalty payments, a miss in the razor-razor blade model, Apple’s (AAPL) recent acquisition of Shazam, and due to being a small fish in technological advancements such as AI and song services. The stock may have one or two good quarters left but investors should have a disciplined trailing stop. I expect that within 12-18 months the stock will be in sell status with the potential to plummet in price on any single day in 2019 due to the following key issues:1. Numbers don’t lie - as long as you know what to look for. When a company is a leader in a technology vertical such as music streaming, you can easily substantiate the company based on past performance. Yes, Spotify has 180 million users and reported 40 percent year-over-year growth in paid subscribers for $1.49 billion in revenue. However, Spotify missed big on EPS with a loss of -2.20 euro compared to estimates of -0.68 euro in Q2 due to the high cost of royalty payments to record labels and artists.Investors should also watch user growth closely with Spotify as the company added fewer users this quarter compared to last quarter (13 million in Q1 compared to 7 million in Q2 or 5.9% QoQ). The estimates for Q3 call for 8 million users and meanwhile, the average revenue per user (ARPU) has dropped by 12%, which is likely due to bundled offers with Hulu and family plans. The concern here is that user growth is hovering at 5-6% while ARPU is decreasing by 12%, thereby depleting the gains from user growth – meanwhile, competition continues to stiffen. In my opinion, Spotify must reach at least 10% QoQ growth with ARPU increasing before I'd invest in this application.2. Last month, Apple was cleared to complete the acquisition for UK-based music recognition app Shazam Entertainment for $400 million. The threat to Spotify and other competitors was enough for regulators in seven countries to contest the acquisition when first announced in December of 2017 but approval was granted to this potentially unstoppable push into enriched data and augmented reality features. To date, Shazam has had well over 1 billion downloads (last reported in 2016) and owns a wealth of information on what music is trending with over 20 million searches per day.One thing about Apple, is that this company will not be beat on its home turf. Apple revolutionized digital music with the iPod and iTunes. With smartphone penetration, the Beats acquisition, its Homepod ecosystem and a huge push into connected car infotainment, Apple can surround Spotify in nearly every direction. Keep in mind, that 66% of the world’s paying app users are iPhone users who trend towards higher incomes (vs. only 34% on Android), so Apple users are supremely important for Spotify’s $9.99 subscriptions.In fact, the turf war has already receded Spotify’s market share. Record industry sources state Apple is adding paying subscribers at a rate of 5 percent in the U.S. versus 2 percent for Spotify, and that Apple Music may have already taken over Spotify as the number one streaming service in the United States. Apple Music was launched only 2 years ago and has 40 million paying customers compared to Spotify’s 83 million paying customers which took 12 years to build.3. I like the Gillette analogy for tech companies and it’s one of the points I make as to why I’ve been long on Roku (ROKU) since its IPO. As the original set top box manufacturer, Roku players are the cheap razors that will deliver the razor blades of ad-supported content in the OTT market. (You can read more my analysis here on Roku). However, this is the same model that will ruin Spotify in the long run. At home assistants such as Alexa are designed and leveraged specifically for AI activated music services. Major record labels let Amazon (AMZN) offer a reduced Alexa version of the premium service at $3.99 per month and Apple is requiring users to sign in to Apple Music to power the HomePod– which completely shuts out devout Spotify. Car infotainment centers will be the next piece of real estate where Spotify is simply a guest (that will become increasingly unwelcome).4. Spotify states they have spent “years developing an intelligent music streaming platform that leverages proprietary artificial intelligence ((AI)) and machine learning (ML) tools” that tap into “datasets of over 200 petabytes.” It seems every app and platform in tech these days says they leverage AI and ML. Yet for Spotify, the evidence isn’t there in the functionality of the app. (For what it’s worth, I’m a Spotify Premium subscriber but this doesn’t mean I’ll buy their stock). Spotify is falling behind in voice-based computing with features such as asking for songs through verbal commands and voice-activated queries due to a lack of lyric recognition. The future for AI and ML, especially as it relates to music streaming, will be a world where you do not have to look at your phone to prompt the next playlist. As of last month (August 2018), even Pandora had search by lyrics with Google Assistant.The second point here is the amount of data. Yes, Spotify has a lot of music specific data but, again, this is irrelevant when competing with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon or Apple.5. As the earnings report states, “Spotify owns Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME) shares and “a TME IPO would trigger a fair market value adjustment to the carrying value of our investment recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain could be significant.” This one-time, non-recurring event would generate a Net income for Spotify with a Net loss returning in the following quarters. Spotify stock holders should be aware that this one time wave may be worthwhile to hold on for, but that the long-term prospects of the company are still not proven.6. Some speculators have suggested Spotify is a great acquisition target – which is correct. Google attempted to buy Spotify in 2014 and Tencent also tried to buy Spotify prior to the IPO sometime in 2017. Spotify was priced too high then and is most certainly priced too high now. It will have to demonstrate that it has staying power as a public company, which I believe is where Spotify will falter. Meanwhile, Spotify founders and investors can sell their shares any time as Spotify did not have a traditional lock-up period and this was cited as one of the risks to the stock.7. The music industry is not loyal to Spotify. Any catalog Spotify has is likely to be duplicated across all music streaming services, offering little differentiation across competitors for content. (Compare this to OTT streaming like Netflix (NFLX) which is highly differentiated through original content). If anything, artists dislike Spotify very much and are often bringing class action lawsuits against the company. And even though Spotify has paid over $10 billion since 2016 to artists, it’s still not a fair wage according to the musicians who see about $5,000 for every 1 million streams. In this case, Spotify is not pleasing the geese who lay the golden eggs, and this is a huge risk in their business model.8. Pandora (P) is a cautionary tale as it had a steady first year after its IPO until it dropped 40% in one day in October of 2015. The company reported a quarterly revenue increase of 30% year over year, which was within guidance, and advertising revenue had also grown 31% year over year. But there was a $90 million settlement related to royalties and Pandora’s active listeners only rose 2.1% year over year and declined quarter over quarter. I believe Spotify will share a similar fate in the near future.Beth Kindig offers unique analysis on technology stocks not available elsewhere.

Price increases will happen in the future but economies of scale will be the main margin driver.Spotify will not disintermediate the big labels directly. It will do it indirectly by providing artists with the data and tools to do so themselves.Spotify is very cheap if judged against its long-term prospects but has some major hurdles to overcome in order to get there.,"This is the second part of my two-part series about Spotify. For the first part please click here. Source: Spotify's websiteSpotify (SPOT) is in a very competitive market (music industry) that is undergoing a big transformation. Its competitors according to its registration filing are the companies below. It is not a comprehensive list but it provides a clear outline of the industry's competitiveness:Now let's take a look at competitors by category and how Spotify is faring against them.In the minds of many, traditional radio is already dead. I disagree with this as it has some very valuable and unique features. Traditional radio is an interactive (as audience usually participates through the phone or social media) medium where storytelling can be done very effectively. And humans love storytelling. Whether it involves sports, politics, money or music, the traditional radio is a very effective way to spread one's story within a certain locale.However, radio as a music discovery tool is most likely in a decline. The real threat to radio, in my opinion, is podcasting but it is still too early to pick a winner. Podcasts have the potential of disrupting radio but they can also be a factor in its revival it. Radio companies like Entercom (ETM) are trying in various ways to complement their live programming with longer-form podcasts. They see podcasting as a tool that will enable them to get to know their audience better and improve their interactions with it.I think that for the time being, the radio industry will be a strong competitor to Spotify as far as advertising is concerned (which isn't a big part of Spotify's revenue). But I think that Spotify will have no trouble in extracting market share in music discovery and marketing. And this will likely give a big blow to internet radio services like Pandora that are mostly music-focused and have no live interaction with their audience.These services (Deezer, Joox, SoundCloud etc.) have already lost the race in my opinion. They are squeezed between Apple and Spotify and as those two leading players increase their scale the value and subscription base of these services will just evaporate.On the other hand, Apple, Google, and Amazon are a real competitive threat to Spotify. Apple, because it already offers a similar service and has the ecosystem to feed it with subscribers. Amazon for the same reason and because it can lock in its Prime members through Alexa. And Google because it offers Google Play Music and can combine it with YouTube.Those three have the money, the scale, and the expertise to make a dent in the music streaming market. Even these three though, cannot match Spotify's focus on providing the best experience to both sides of the marketplace. The real threat comes from restricting Spotify's access to certain customer groups.If you use Amazon's Echo and have a Spotify account, you can link it through the Alexa app and everything works just fine. If you don't have a music service account though, what would you choose? Spotify or Amazon Music? I bet you would go with Amazon Music. And it is a similarly smooth process with Google Home. However, Apple's HomePod requires an Apple Music account to operate Siri. Which means HomePod owners are for all practical purposes out of Spotify's reach.That said, Amazon and Google do not seem inclined to bet big on their music side. They seem to view music as just one more complementary offering to their users. They are more focused on people adopting their voice-assistants and becoming the de facto interface people use to access the internet. They seem to favor an open approach so that they can entice as many consumers as possible. This makes them less of a threat for Spotify and more of a potential acquirer down the road.It is clear in my mind that the most serious competitor to Spotify is Apple. And the reason is that Apple has millions of loyal customers that had a lot of good experiences with the company's products and services and thus are willing to buy whatever Apple offers. Add Apple's willingness to use Apple Music as a loss leader and it becomes easy to understand why it surpassed Spotify on paying US subscribers.However, Spotify is still way ahead with 83 million paying subscribers worldwide and 101 million more on ad-supported freemium accounts. And don't dismiss the freemium accounts as insignificant. About 60% of Spotify's gross added Premium subscribers are coming from these ad-supported accounts.Both Apple and Spotify have their own efficient way of adding new users. I believe that Apple will easily scale Apple Music even further among its core customer base. Apple currently has 1.3 billion active devices worldwide, but Apple users usually own more than one device. Loop Venture estimates active iPhone users to be about 780 million worldwide. On the other hand, Android active users are estimated to be about 2.3 billion.Which means that there are 2.3 billion potential Spotify customers outside of the Apple ecosystem. I think it is pretty evident that there is enough room for Apple Music and Spotify to co-exist. However, this doesn't mean they will not compete. And it is their fervent competition that will ensure (in my opinion) their dominance of the music streaming market, creating an effective duopoly.There is a lot of speculation about Spotify trying to disintermediate the big labels and how they will thereafter withdraw their song catalogs in response and destroy Spotify in the process.I think that this is not how disintermediation is going to happen. And it has already started to happen. Matthew Ball, one of the best media thinkers out there, laid out the fact that artists will increasingly rely on fixed-fee services (provided by 3rd parties or the labels themselves) to provide them with the infrastructure they need. And he also provided a visual of the economics behind this transformation.Source: redef.comI urge you to go read the whole piece as it is extremely insightful. However, I disagree somewhat with Matthew's conclusion that the streaming services will provide the aforementioned infrastructure services. I think that Spotify, in particular, will provide the necessary data and tools to artists and their service providers but it will not directly clash with the labels. At least until it achieves duopoly status.I think that this is the only way Spotify can fight directly with the big labels and win. It will be untenable for the music labels to fight Spotify when it is their main access to music listeners. It is then that power will have shifted from labels (content owners) to the streaming providers. But going from here to there is one of Spotify's greatest challenges.In the excerpt above Spotify's CEO gives a rough outline of the opportunities he sees available down the road. I will approach this in more back-of-the-envelope kind of way just to be on the safe side. Spotify in its Q2 results gave a projection for 199-207 million of active users by the end of 2018. And an average revenue of 30 euro per user. I believe that within the next 5 years, Spotify can grow this to at least 500 million users keeping stable the annual revenue per user.Source: Investor Day presentationThis equals about 15 billion euro of revenue or about $18 billion using a rough 1.2 EUR/USD conversion rate. Currently, Spotify is trading at about 5.3 times its expected 2018 revenue (the low end of management's outlook). If it trades at about 5x its projected 5-year revenue, it will have a valuation of about $90 billion or 3 times its current size.This valuation is feasible because of two major reasons. First, its total addressable market will continue to grow as more and more people will be using smartphones globally over the years. And second, its gross profits will increase as it scales and generates a bigger portion of its profits from ads. Furthermore, when its duopoly with Apple becomes self-evident, they will be able to both pressure the labels for better licensing deals and rise their service prices at least a little higher.I know this a very vague valuation estimate but I think that what matters most, in this case, is to be right directionally. Spotify is a very focused and competitive company and I don't expect them to stop improving their offerings or trying to find new ways to monetize them.I will probably build a small speculative position in Spotify during the coming months as I expect the market to focus more on their coming renegotiation with the labels. This should provide a better entry point for investors as the market hates uncertainty and the negotiation is sure to generate some drama. I expect the labels to puff their chests and try to demonstrate their superiority. Ultimately though, they have to offer viable terms or else risk killing their own revenue revival.Cheers!"
4211424,103480,2018-10-13T07:55:04-04:00,"Shares of Spotify have fallen amid the tech rout, shedding ~20% from highs just under $200 that it notched in June.Shares are now back in the $150s, where the company originally traded after its non-traditional IPO in April.The company still isn't cheap, however, given intense competition as well as slim margins due to high royalty costs.Tencent Music, Spotify's Chinese counterpart, has filed for an IPO and is likely the much better investment, with a user base nearly 4x larger.The next catalyst for Spotify is its Q3 earnings release, due on November 1.","Like most high-growth technology stocks, Spotify (SPOT) has been suffering from an October scare, as investors indiscriminately sold off technology stocks and pushed the NASDAQ down 8% from recent highs. Spotify has had it worse - relative to a high point near $200 that the company notched in June, the stock is now hovering in the $150s, down 20% from highs (technically marking the stock in a ""bear market"") and returning it to levels not seen since immediately post-IPO:SPOT data by YChartsThe question on investors' minds now is this: has Spotify fallen enough to merit a rebound investment? This is a perennially expensive stock that is commonly associated with turning the music industry on its head, and a venerable brand that has amassed more than 200 million users. Is it time to catch the falling knife?In my view, investors should still stay on the sidelines for Spotify. The company is not yet cheap enough (we'll discuss valuation shortly), and risks to earnings and growth still abound. Margins are low - especially compared to its Chinese counterpart, Tencent Music (NYSE:TME), despite the latter having introduced limited monetization into its product.I wrote that Tencent Music's IPO is a very attractive deal to invest in. At 92% y/y revenue growth, Tencent Music is growing much faster than Spotify due to being in the earlier stages of monetization. The company is also producing positive profits thanks to lower royalty charges as a percentage of revenues, something that has eluded Spotify throughout its lifetime. Market turmoil has put the Tencent Music IPO on hold at the moment, but in my view, this is the far better and faster-growing streaming company to invest in, with a much larger TAM thanks to its roots in China.Deceleration risks for Spotify, meanwhile, abound. The company has struggled with maintaining ~25% y/y revenue growth, while last quarter, premium subscriber growth slowed down to 40% y/y (ad-supported user growth was even weaker). The company's upcoming earnings release, on November 1, could send Spotify into a fresh leg lower.In my view, Spotify's dip into the $150s was a much-needed correction, from which it won't be able to rebound quickly. Keep a close eye on the stock in case it dips to the $130s (at which point a bullish case could be made), but don't buy the stock just yet.With Spotify shares now down 20% from peak (and back to the approximate level that it was trading in April, after its non-conventional ""direct listing""), it's a good time to revisit the company's valuation.At present, Spotify carries a market cap of $28.2 billion, not far off from the ~$25 billion valuation it carried as a private company and the $26.5 billion valuation it notched on the day of its IPO.Spotify also holds €2.66 billion in cash and which at today's exchange rate of $1.16 to the euro equates to $3.08 billion in cash. This puts Spotify's enterprise value at $25.1 billion. Here's how that stacks up against the company's forward-looking guidance:Figure 2. Spotify guidanceSource: Spotify investor relationsThe midpoint of the company's revenue guidance ranges for the third and fourth quarters FY18 is €2.65 billion, which equates to $3.08 billion. If we similarly assume 20% y/y growth in 1H19 on Spotify's 1H18 revenues of $2.80 billion, we arrive at a forward twelve-month revenue estimate of $6.44 billion ($3.08 billion in 2H18 and $3.36 billion in 1H19). This puts Spotify's current valuation at ~3.9x EV/FTM revenues.At first blush, this appears cheap among internet stocks, especially as Spotify is frequently comped against Netflix (NFLX) due to the two companies' similarities in media streaming. Even after its recent fall from grace, Netflix still trades at a ~9x forward revenue multiple:NFLX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsSo it appears, to many investors, that Spotify is a much cheaper streaming business. There are inherent risks in this valuation, however, that prevent me from being able to call it outright cheap. Deceleration and margin risks come into play here, which we'll discuss next. I would consider the buy point for Spotify to be at $135, a price target that implies 3.2x EV/FTM revenues and 15% downside from current levels.Thus far, investors haven't been particularly impressed with Spotify's earnings releases, and with heated competition in the music streaming industry (Sirius XM's (SIRI) takeover proposal for Pandora (P) is one under-discussed risk), the deceleration fears are likely to intensify.Here's a look at Spotify's results in the first half of 2018:Figure 2. Spotify 1H18 earningsSource: Spotify investor relationsRevenues grew 26% y/y in the first half of 2018 to €2.41 billion. While this is still a respectable growth rate, it's far from being enough to qualify Spotify for the ""high-growth"" label. Note that Netflix, despite its most recent quarterly subscriber miss, is still growing revenues in the ~40% neighborhood - which justifies its premium valuation relative to Spotify.There's a general fear that Spotify has reached a saturation point and that its user growth, similar to Netflix, will begin to scare off investors with disappointing numbers. As we've seen from the MAU growth trend this year, Spotify saw a kick in user growth earlier in 2018, but MAUs have more or less leveled off since then:Figure 3. Spotify MAUs Source: Spotify investor relationsAlso of note is the fact that Spotify's ad-supported MAUs slowed down to 23% y/y growth in Q2, and flat quarter over quarter. While Spotify leans substantially more heavily on paid subscribers (which generate more than 90% of its revenues), the flattening of free users does represent a cooling-off of the Spotify brand.Then there's the issue of Spotify's margin profile. The company is a behemoth valued at nearly $30 billion, but has yet to turn an actual profit. The promise of a technology company that is valued at a high multiple of revenues is that it will someday capitalize on its economies of scale and begin to improve margins - but for Spotify, its bottom-line picture is actually deteriorating.High music royalty costs are, obviously, to blame. And Spotify can hardly raise its prices to pass these costs on to its subscribers. Last quarter, Spotify's gross margin contracted by a frightening 280 bps, to a low of 23.0%:Figure 4. Spotify key metrics Source: Spotify investor relationsYes, Spotify's ~4x revenue multiple might appear cheap against fellow internet stocks (Facebook (FB) has often traded at a double-digit revenue multiple), but these internet companies aren't paying out a huge percentage of their revenue bases as royalties. Spotify's 23% gross margin is among the weakest in the internet sector.Margin contraction has also contributed to a souring of free cash flows, as seen in the chart above. Free cash flow declined by 69% y/y in 2Q18 to just €18.0 million, threatening to tip over into negative territory. For the first two quarters of 2018 combined, FCF was €92.0 million, down -25% y/y.Luckily, Spotify is still cash-rich, with nearly €3 billion of cash and investments on its balance sheet, to keep it afloat even if cash flow turns negative. The fact that there's no line of sight to improved profits, however, has investors rightfully spooked.Six months into its IPO, investors are still playing a game of price discovery with Spotify, many of whom are still undecided on what this giant, popular consumer brand with a massive revenue base but poor margins should be worth. In my view, Spotify's ~20% correction has vaulted the stock closer to its proper value, but the company is still not yet at a buy point. Near-term earnings risks, both to top-line/user growth and to Spotify's margin profile, prevent me from being too enthusiastic on the stock."
4208012,25255,2018-09-24T17:38:19-04:00,"Spotify's business model has nothing to do with imitating Netflix, a fact that the market has not fully realized yet.New music discovery is the key element behind Spotify's future and their big competitive advantage.Spotify has plotted a course to become a core infrastructure component of the music industry going forward, just like Amazon did with the book industry.","This is the first part of my analysis on Spotify where I discuss its business model and why comparing it to Netflix is a grave mistake. Spotify (SPOT) is NOT just the most popular music streaming service on the planet. Spotify is a marketplace in the second phase of its creation. The first phase was getting the attention of consumers and enough data about their preferences so that it can provide the best music experience.Source: Spotify's websiteIf you watch Spotify's Investor Day video you will understand just how obsessed they are with providing the best user experience. And for good reason. Most of Spotify's paid subscribers are generated from its free subscriber base. Spotify's flywheel model works like this. Spotify collects user data through playlists, likes and dislikes of songs and provides its users with more of the music they like. As the customer experience gets better, churn falls, resulting in bigger customer lifetime value and higher margin recurring revenue. And as Spotify users compile more and more playlists, Spotify's ability to improve the service increases.As Spotify locks more and more consumers into its platform, suppliers (ie artists, labels, podcasters) will want more and more access to it so that they can reach them. And this leads us to Spotify's key strength and competitive advantage. Discovery.Discovery also is one of the most passionately mentioned concepts by the Spotify management team on their Investor Day presentation. By processing billions (as was explicitly stated in the Investor Day) of user-generated playlists Spotify's AI software creates certain thematic playlists, which are pretty popular as you can see in the app screenshot below.Source: author's Spotify appThe important feature though is that the same data to create these playlists allow Spotify to propose songs to its users that they haven't ever heard and that they actually like. It allows users to discover music that they like and never knew existed.This is the linchpin of the Spotify model and its unassailable competitive advantage. Yes, unassailable. Because it's built on unique proprietary data that Spotify's users are generating at an exponentially faster pace, more users join the service, which currently has more than double the paying users and five times the amount of data compared to its next competitor.Discovery drives Spotify's success going forward because through this process small unknown and niche artists have the opportunity to find and communicate globally with people that like the type of music they make, and if they are good enough to create a dedicated fanbase. And they can use Spotify's data to organize their tours in the most efficient way so that they cover the maximum number of fan locations possible and customize their program to the preferences of each locale.These tools aren't for small independent artists only. Labels big and small will be able to monetize their IP in ways that were impossible a few years ago and take their marketing to a whole new level. Music that stayed ""hidden"" in the archives of the big labels will be monetized in new, novel ways. Labels will turn down way fewer artists because the profitability threshold of its artist will go down. And all these are possible because of Spotify and its algorithms.The bear case for Spotify rests on the fact that the bulk of the music IP worldwide is controlled by the three big labels. The case goes that labels can threaten to pull out their massive song libraries from Spotify and thus kill the service if their whims are not satisfied and that they will impose marginal profitability on Spotify and impede it from realizing its full potential and become the music equivalent of Netflix (NFLX).However, this could not be further from the truth. On the company's Q2 earnings call, Daniel Ek, Spotify's CEO, said:Many think that Spotify is on a collision course with the big labels, but I beg to differ. And this is due to a crucial difference between the way the movie and music industries operate.In the movie industry, the talent that creates the content is paid on a project-by-project basis no matter if it's a movie or a serialized production. On the other hand in the music industry talent is mostly paid through content rights and royalties. Netflix can pay a one-time cost to create content and then own it forever at no additional cost. The music industry though does not operate that way and Spotify cannot either.On the other hand, Spotify can become the platform where content creators (artists) and other content owners (labels) go to monetize and increase the value of their content. It's more similar to what Amazon (AMZN) did with books. It didn't commission the creation of millions of titles replacing publishers. It provided authors and traditional publishers with a marketplace where they could showcase their goods.Spotify is not disrupting the way music content is created. It's disrupting the way music is discovered and distributed. Spotify, given its velocity, is becoming an essential partner of the music industry. It is on a trajectory where it assumes the functions that the radio industry (discovery and marketing) and music stores (distribution) played in the past. It strives to become the core infrastructure where the music industry showcases its creations and connects with its customers.And it's driving this by bringing more and more music listeners to its platform and by providing all kinds of marketing tools to music creators and owners. It isn't an aggregator but a two-sided marketplace.Finally, I would like to address the role that Spotify will play in relation to podcasts. Podcasts are the equivalent of the radio show but with an unrestricted form factor and a virtually unlimited audience pool. Given the magnitude of Spotify's user base that keeps growing and growing and its powerful discovery tools, it's only a matter of time before it becomes the platform of choice for podcast creators and consumers.And once this happens the whole function of the radio industry will indeed be contained within ""just"" an app.This was part 1 of my analysis on Spotify. Stay tuned as in part 2 I will go over Spotify's competition and its valuation."
4181077,24473,2018-06-12T13:11:23-04:00,We partner with Financial Exchange Radio to produce a weekly segment with Seeking Alpha authors.Galileo Russell continues the series with his bullish pick: Spotify.It is a new model - Spotify is looking to move away from licensing from record labels  and streaming directly from artists which means it can have bigger profit margins and musicians can collect higher royalties.,
4200404,104586,2018-08-19T17:19:21-04:00,"Spotify accounts for more than 2/3rd of the global music streaming market.Music streaming has altered the dynamics of the global music industry, also leading to a revival.While competition has been catching up with Spotify, the company has continued to grow its subscriber base.The current market cap of the company significantly exceeds the estimated value of the entire streaming market in 2030E.Excessive valuation, competition and developing threats (blockchain-based music streaming companies) do not support investment in Spotify.","Spotify (SPOT) is the leading music streaming company in the global music market. Music streaming has been credited with the revival of the music industry and SPOT has been a pioneer, leading from the front. However, the company’s 2/3rd share of the streaming market has not been enough. SPOT continues to make losses due to the complexity of the industry structure and competition. In spite of that, the company’s current market cap exceeds the size of the streaming market revenue in 2030! Thus it would be prudent to avoid investments in SPOT.Global Recorded Music MarketThe Global Recorded Music Market (OTCQB:GRMM) has undergone significant transformation, thanks to the rise of technology and streaming in particular.Source: Global Music ReportNot only is streaming the fastest growing segment of the GRMM but also has been GRMM’s knight in shining. As per Goldman Sachs, the streaming industry should grow much faster than the overall GRMM.Source: Goldman SachsThe higher growth rate of the streaming market is attributable to the evolutionary nature of streaming for the music industry. Earlier music consumption used to be through physical records, which lost out to shareable digital storage of content. Streaming, however, has created a new opportunity through a pay per play or rent a song model. While streaming may have disrupted the consumption model, it has still not addressed a long pending issue of payment distribution across the music value chain. Industry estimates suggest that while artist’s share of total music revenues has grown over the last two decades, it still at a low 12% (vs 7% in 2000) with the balance 88% getting distributed among record labels, distributors and concert promoters. Artists have long contended that since they make music, they deserve a bigger cut – this is only possible by cutting out the middlemen. Streaming companies have attempted tying up directly with artists to reduce friction. However, the dominance of the big labels is hard to ignore. This uneven power distribution and the rise of distributed ledger technology has given rise to cryptocurrency backed streaming services. The artists get to keep ownership of their music and get paid in cryptocurrency. The advantages of this system include lower commissions and faster remittances as compared to traditional streaming platforms). Some of the crypto music platforms are Opus, Veszt, Musicoin and Choon. While SPOT has also hired a team of blockchain experts, it would be interesting to see how SPOT balances this evolution in the streaming market with its relationships with the big labels.CompetitionSPOT has maintained over 2/3 revenue share of the streaming market.Source: SPOT Financial ModelThis decline in market share can be primarily attributed to competition from Apple Music and YouTube.Tidal, Deezer and others: These players deserve mention for having tried, but have failed to make any meaningful dent.One more area of competition is the smart speaker market. In competition with Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod, SPOT has recently won a partnership with Samsung. While this does move is likely to increase SPOT’s total user base, as a standalone product competing against large ecosystems, SPOT’s paid user growth may be limited.Another aspect of competition is piracy and stream ripping – the technique of downloading a streaming song or video. This is a global phenomenon with varying views on whether illegal downloads constitute IP infringement or theft.SPOT’s business modelIn addition to the company’s paid subscription model, SPOT also earns through advertising.Source: SPOT Financial ModelAlso, in line with the industry disputes for royalties, SPOT had highlighted in the company’s S1 filing that it is difficult to correctly estimate the exact amount of royalty payments due to artists and labels (essentially the COGS for the company). Despite this uncertainty, the company has aims to expand its gross margins to 30-35% levels in the long run. This clearly points to management's focus on growing direct contracts with artists and generating higher revenues from advertising.FinancialsIn the current scheme of things, SPOT is likely to see strong paid subscriber additions. However, in a more competitive environment, growth could markedly slow down. Also, in the event of SPOT leading a wave of consolidation in the streaming industry and also developing its own blockchain-based artist incentivization program, revenue growth could be significantly higher.Despite the company’s decade-old existence and trading nature of the business, SPOT continues to make losses. Further the low gross margin limits SPOT’s ability to innovate at the level of distribution, leading to continued losses in the foreseeable future.Source: SPOT Financial ModelHowever, FCF has turned positive and likely to continue growing on the back of non-cash items.ValuationThe company currently trades at $190 levels with a market cap of $34 billion. The innocuous P/S is at 5x. The following graph gives further perspective about SPOT’s valuation. Source: SPOT Financial ModelWhile SPOT only operates in the streaming market, the market cap of the company is greater than the total revenue of the Global Recorded Music Market but also is greater than the total expected revenue of the streaming market, more than a decade from now.Although the streaming market has been growing at a phenomenal rate, given the evolving nature of the streaming industry and the solid competition, the market seems to have gotten carried away in ascribing this kind of a valuation to SPOT.So how to value SPOT? The P/E is ruled out due to negative earnings and low gross margin makes P/S unsuitable. The best way is a DCF across scenarios stated above.Source: SPOT Financial ModelSource: SPOT Financial ModelThe bull case, where SPOT should be able to increase the rate of adoption of its paid product across a growing user base and leave competition far behind, looks fully discounted in the current stock price. However, given the size and might of competition that SPOT faces, the probability of the bull case appears rather low (<10%).Despite SPOT’s leadership position in the streaming market, due to intense competition and the evolving streaming industry, the current valuations do not look remotely justified. It would thus be prudent to stay away from the stock.Notes:"
4204563,59551,2018-09-06T13:06:12-04:00,"Spotify has a very high valuation, especially when considering its industry, revenue, losses, gross margin, and competition.Spotify’s growth may be too reliant on student promotions and bundles, which have a significant impact on revenue.Music streaming profitability has never been proven successful; with more competition and greedy labels, this may never change.Let’s remember that Pandora’s stock shrank by 88% in 4 years even though it doubled its revenue during that time period.","Apple (AAPL) was valued at $80B after introducing iPhone in 2007. That year, its revenue was $24B, and its net income was $3.5B. Last year, Spotify's (SPOT) revenue was one-sixth of that while adding another unprofitable year to its streak. Despite the vast difference in revenue and profits between the two, Spotify's current valuation is approaching half of what Apple was when it launched iPhone. Spotify may be revolutionary, but is a big future more obvious to investors than it was to Apple investors after it launched iPhone?Investors are excited about the growth of Spotify, which has been resilient to competition from Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). However, this growth has come at great sacrifice, namely heavy promotions, student discounts, and bundles that have cut revenue. As a customer, I have spent over $600 on Spotify since 2013 paying $10 per month. However, last quarter's earnings indicate that its average revenue per subscriber is shrinking, and that it's barely earning $5 per month per premium subscriber. Unlike video streaming services, music content does not vary greatly from one service to another. Google, Amazon, and Apple have product ecosystems centered around their music platforms that Spotify cannot fully penetrate. Spotify has a great product, and there will be room for it, but with competition and a lack of profitability, it's hard to imagine a valuation nearly as high as Ford (F). Due to that, Spotify is the second loved stock in this series to simply avoid.Source: MeI may not understand the music industry like I do other industries, but I do understand valuation. I can always do enough research to determine if a company is valued fairly, and this has been one of my greatest tailwinds as an investor. Of course, my opinion may differ from Mr. Market from time to time in the short run, but I like to think of the stock market as a marathon.Spotify costs a hefty $10 per month, and I've spent $600 on the service over the years. However, after finding that the average revenue per subscriber is barely over $5 on premium users, I feel a little ripped. Investors should, too. When you have a great product, people will pay for it. Spotify has 83 million subscribers - that's 64% the number of Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscriber count. However, that 64% only produced 29% of the revenue from subscriptions. Spotify costs $1 less than Netflix, but student, family, and other bundles are crushing its average revenue per user (ARPU), which Spotify reported at $5.56 last quarter.Naturally, the goal is expansion, and sadly, these days, expansion means losing lots of money. However, even if Spotify raised its ARPU to $10, it would only have produced an extra $400M or so in revenue. Even if you added that revenue to last quarter, Spotify would have barely broken even last quarter with the $394M they lost. I understand that with more users comes profitability and margin growth, but I am not seeing the light. Even if there is light, you can't ignore that the labels, artists, and producers will want more royalty money and that competitors like Apple, Amazon, and Google can always become cheaper.The terms of music streaming are still too new and unknownThe biggest problem with the music streaming business is that it's still in its infancy and that its level of profitability in the future is questionable. It's growing, and more than 100M people are paying to use the service each month, but nobody is making any money. In Spotify's case, nearly 75% of its revenue is paid out in royalties to music labels, producers, and artists. Producers and artists are paid very little - close to 12% together, which means that the actual artist is paid very little. It's no wonder Taylor Swift felt like a victim. If Spotify were ever to be extremely profitable, their small payments would be a big problem and the greedy labels would also renegotiate a way to improve their royalty payments as well. This is a problem bound to happen, and as an investor, I would not want anything to do with it in the future. I don't see a case where Spotify has negotiating leverage over music labels because there is always Apple, Amazon, or Google.The CompetitionThe obvious reason to avoid Spotify is due to the competition. Lately, competition has been unable to stop Spotify from growing. In fact, the competition seems to be helping Spotify, and given its superior service and interface I am not surprised. I have a HomePod, iPhone, Mac, iPad, and vehicle with Apple CarPlay and have been a part of Apple's 3-month trial for about 2 months. I hate Apple music so much. The user interface is terrible, its ability to curate and recommend music is bad; it's worse than Apple Maps is to Google Maps. In a way, it's shocking that Apple acquired over 50 million Apple Music subscribers, but with its product ecosystem, it's understandable. One example of a disadvantage that Spotify has is that its users cannot access it via Siri. This means no artist searching, playlist accessing and more while going out for a run with your watch or while driving.Spotify is good, and I can understand why it has great customer retention. The most difficult part of leaving Spotify is that the service has spent the last 5 years learning about my music habits. It knows what I like, what I hate, and I have collected playlists and saved songs for years. If I could seamlessly transfer these playlists and listening habits without the use of third party software, I would worry about Spotify's ability to retain customers. After all, this is what Apple and Google did to seamlessly help customers switch between devices.Source: Me; Spotify creates 4 daily playlists with different sets of similar artists while Apple Music compiles everything into a single playlist updated weekly.The royalty problemsLast quarter, Spotify's cost of revenue was approximately $944M, which consists predominantly of royalties paid to labels, producers, and artists. It is believed that 52% of that revenue goes to music labels, while roughly 12% goes to music producers and artists. Jody Gerson, the CEO of Universal Music Publishing, is pushing to increase the paychecks of artists and producers. Clearly, this is a problem, and many Spotify customers believe that a large chunk of their revenue is going to the artists. The labels are extremely stubborn, and with their rights to endless hits and future hits, I don't see them budging to help producers or artists. Furthermore, when Spotify's gross margins improve, and the company finally starts producing a profit - someone is going after them, whether it's the labels are artists such as Taylor Swift. I don't see Spotify ever producing a huge profit without the expense of somebody wanting more, and that's one issue investors may have to face.With a valuation of $34 billion, Spotify is worth 15 times more than Pandora (NYSE:P). Surely, it has a superior product and even beats its direct competitors, Apple, Amazon, and Google. However, it has never turned a profit and its valuation is just shy of Ford Motors. No company in the music streaming industry has been able to prove that it is a lucrative business, and I am very skeptical if Spotify will change this. Furthermore, its competitors have access to virtually the exact same music at the exact same pricing while being housed in a product ecosystem. With such a hefty valuation, there could be a significant downside if investors realize that Spotify can't be very profitable in the future.Once investors realized that Pandora wasn't particularly special, its stock went from $37 to as low as $4 earlier this year. One fact investors should note is that during Pandora's 88% decline, it more than doubled its revenue.P data by YCharts"
4189027,101693,2018-07-22T20:17:26-04:00,"A discussion regarding the required rate of return of Spotify's shares.A discussion about management's expectations for revenue growth.I provide a possible set of valuations for the company depending on the expected.Spotify's management expects a wide range of potential CAGR for its revenues. However, it appears that currently, the market is pricing at the midpoint of that range.I perform a sensibility analysis of the fair value estimate to the changes in CAGR of revenues.","In this article, I'll perform an analysis of the implied growth rate for Spotify (NYSE: SPOT). My approach to this task will be through the CAPM, management's guidance, and the current stock price. With those variables, we can deduce what growth rate the market is currently expecting and compare it with management's guidance.Before we dive into the anything, we need to calculate the required rate of return as suggested by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). For this, I’ll calculate the beta coefficient for the SPOT ticker since its IPO. Below you’ll find the results.Then, I'll have to solve the formula of the CAPM with the appropriate inputs. Below you'll find the required rate of return (RRR) for Spotify's stock.For the risk-free rate, I used the US Treasury 10-year yield. For the equity risk premium (ERP), I consulted Damodaran's latest figure. The resulting RRR seems to be rather low for a growth company trading at a very expensive valuation. It's important to remember that a low RRR will result in a higher fair value estimate for the company.This low RRR in SPOT occurs due to a confluence of factors. First, the risk-free rate is below 3%. Also of note is that the ERP has declined as the RF rate has risen. This is uncommon because typically investors don't change the ERP and instead pass the effects of a higher RF to a higher RRR. Finally, since its IPO, Spotify has traded in a very low-risk way. This is reflected by the beta coefficient being much lower than 1 (a lower beta is usually perceived as safer).Now, this is the tricky part when evaluating Spotify. The reality is that we still know very little of the company's true potential. It could very well be that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) destroy the company's business, or Spotify could also become a music behemoth.My take is that Spotify is a fantastic business. I use the premium service, and I love it. In my view, it's much better than any other alternative I've tried so far. As it stands, I could consider myself a loyal customer. Moreover, I've recommended the services to friends and family, and they've also subscribed to Spotify's premium content.In the long term, I think the music industry will bounce due to the increasing monetization of streamed music. I believe that Spotify will be leading the way, very much like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in VOD. If this happens, I think the company might be able to easily grow its revenues at 25%+ CAGR for at least a decade. The company's target for yearly revenue growth currently is 20-30% YoY, and excluding negative FX impacts, guidance would be 26-37% YoY.Source: Spotify’s Q1 ’18 shareholder letter.The figure above shows the management’s expectations for 2018. However, it gives us a hint of what kind of growth to expect from this company going forward. For me, it’s evident that SPOT is a fast-growing company with a bright future.With that out of the way, I wanted to make my projection of the following quarterly results of SPOT. This way we can have a better picture of what to expect from the company.As you can see, Spotify should grow at a very decent clip for the next few years. The method was a simple linear regression into the future for the EBIT (as a percentage of Gross Income). I also applied a similar process for the Gross Margin forecast, although I had to make sure it fell in line with management's 23-25% estimate. Lastly, for the revenue growth, I assumed a somewhat stable pace, similar to Q1 '18 QoQ growth.The results naturally fall in line with the company’s expectations. Below you’ll find additional metrics from the projection above.The implied revenue CAGR is roughly 30%. This figure also falls within management’s guidance (including FX). However, more importantly, we also have by then a positive EBIT figure. We can use this number as a proxy for the company's earnings and apply the Gordon Growth Model (GGM) to estimate the appropriate multiple. This way we can arrive at a fair value estimate of the company.I think investors often overlook the power of compound interest. High growth companies like Spotify are the ones that benefit the most from this phenomenon. Below you’ll find how much $1 can grow at a similar growth rate that Spotify is experiencing right now.Notice that the effect is roughly 10X the initial figure. That results in a CAGR of 25.90%. However, my forecast for Spotify is actually even higher, at a CAGR for EBIT of 28.17%. Since the company is in its initial growth stages, I think it's more than reasonable to assume a growth stage of approximately ten years for Spotify.Source: P/E variation of the GGM.I'll be using the P/E variation of the GGM formula. Above you'll find the equation. I'll only have to solve it with the data I've previously explained in this article.However, before I continue, it’s necessary to have a reasonable estimate for the payout ratio. As you know, Spotify doesn’t pay a dividend. Therefore, we’ll have to improvise a little bit here.Spotify does have a positive free cash flow figure. For the past twelve months, I've calculated the FCF of SPOT to be $346.35 million. Over the same period, the company has produced $5,073.98 million in revenues. If we divide the FCF by the TTM revenues, we arrive at 6.83%. I'll be using this percentage as a proxy for the Payout Ratio in the formula.The model takes into account two stages, one of high growth and another of terminal growth. For the terminal growth stage in the model, I'll calculate the inputs as a function of the figures I've explained so far.I intend to be as fair as possible. I think the figures I’ve deduced so far are in line with management’s expectations. Furthermore, the low payout ratio is reasonable for a growth company (these types of businesses require high levels of reinvestments to keep growing at a fast pace).Notice that the EBIT Multiple suggested by the GGM is exceptionally high. This is due to a CAGR of 28.17% over the next ten years as an input. The payout ratio is low and very conservative (usually you'd use 20-40% in these types of financial models, which would increase the resulting multiple). All of that discounted at a relatively low RRR of only 6.066% yields an extremely high multiple. As a result, the valuation of SPOT at Q1 ’20 would be approximately $31.7 billion, which approximately the same as the current market capitalization.As I previously mentioned, the toughest part of Spotify’s valuation is estimating a reasonable growth rate. Nevertheless, we have the other three elements for the assessment: the current price, the CAPM’s suggested rate of return, and an estimate of the fair value of SPOT by Q1 2020. With those figures, we can infer the current implied growth rate for the company.In the figure above you’ll find the implied growth rate of 30.03% given an estimated 2020 PPS of $183.14. We can further adjust this number to match the current share price and see the implied growth rate for Spotify according to investors (i.e., the current share price) and the CAPM (adjusted to return 6.07% annualized).As you can see, investors are currently expecting a 29.98% CAGR for SPOT’s revenues. This figure is derived from the model outlined in this article. However, notice that at such growth rate SPOT’s shares have negative alpha (compared to its RRR as suggested by the CAPM).On the other hand, the CAPM suggests a RRR of 6.07%. To achieve this return, the company would have to grow its revenues at a CAGR of 31.03%.Both of these tables show the immense sensibility of the fair value estimation to the forecasted growth rate. This is why estimating the company's growth is so incredibly difficult at this stage. Notice how a mere 1% change in the CAGR of revenues leads to a $3.2 billion difference in the company's valuation.Remember that management guided a low-end revenue growth rate of 20% (including negative FX impacts), and a high-end rate of 37% (excluding FX). In the figure below, I’ll provide the resulting valuations for those figures according to my model.SPOT currently sits at the beginning stages of its growth potential. Because of this, small changes in the CAGRs of its revenues will result in massive changes in fair value for the company.At SPOT's current price of $182.19, the market appears to be implying a revenue CAGR of roughly 30% (very close to the midpoint of management’s growth estimates). Furthermore, for every 1% change in that CAGR the valuation changes roughly by $3.2 billion.The company's management provided a low and high-end estimate for SPOT's revenue CAGR. These figures are 20-37%, depending on different factors. The resulting valuations for SPOT (by Q1 2020) from these CAGRs are $59.76 and $11.82 billion, respectively.I want to add a final commentary on these findings: 1) Spotify tends to report closer to its high-end guidance so far (see their financials before the IPO). 2) The potential reward in SPOT is extremely attractive, but shareholders are one ER miss away from a 10-30% correction or worse. 3) I’d love to own this great business at a lower price. I wish I had paid attention to it at its IPO, $150 looks like an attractive price according to my analysis.Thank you for reading and good luck."

Music streaming has saved the music industry and is now a proven business model that is growing rapidly. Spotify is in the best position to benefit from the industry’s growth due to its leading market share and brand power, single-product focus on innovation, and ability to win across geographies and tech platforms. Spotify’s stock price will likely be worth of multiples of its current value in the long run (5-10 years) if the company continues to execute on its current trajectory.Over the past 20 years, we have seen the decline of the music industry. In the late 1990s music piracy became commonplace. Websites like Napster made it easy to download an endless amount of music without charge. Piracy’s ease of use and access to unlimited quantities of music a la carte fundamentally changed consumer behavior.The next wave of change came when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) pioneered digital downloads through iTunes in the 2000s. I remember when people would shell out $5.99 to purchase a physical copy of a single with a few remixes. Apple made it possible to buy almost any song for $0.99. Furthermore, digital music is convenient. It can be played on a computer, loaded onto an MP3 player, or burned to CD.While piracy chipped away at the notion that consumers should continue to pay a high price for music, digital downloads cemented the idea that buying a physical album is a bad value proposition. This all resulted in the rapid decline in physical music sales and the destruction of the record store industry. For years, the entire music industry saw sales decline. From 1999 to 2010, the music industry’s revenue declined from $25.2 billion to $14.9 billion, a 41% overall decline (Source: IFPI report).Source: IFPI report.Enter streaming.The music industry was ripe for change. Consumer behavior and tastes had evolved. Consumers wanted access to more music and didn’t want to pay an extravagant sum for it. The music industry, reeling from years of pain, was willing to come to the bargaining table. Furthermore, technological developments in increased internet speeds, internet penetration, and software made it possible to offer music streaming as a service directly to consumers in either ad-supported or subscription-based formats.Early adoption of music streaming was slow as consumers had to learn how to use and trust a new format for consuming content. However, growth came and soon streaming became a material slice of the market. Today, music streaming accounts for nearly 40% of the music industry’s total revenue and accounts for most of the industry’s growth.Music labels get paid royalties based on a complex formula derived from the number of streams and a percentage of a streaming service’s revenue. However, music labels are becoming somewhat irrelevant. Listening platforms are the new gatekeepers and through various means control which artists get the best promotion and appeal. In my opinion, platforms like Spotify sit at the most interesting junction of the music industry and will capture the lion's share of the industry’s economics.Spotify (SPOT) is the world’s largest music streaming service. The company has 180 million monthly active users (“MAUs”), 83 million paying subscribers, and is available in 65 geographic markets (source: Spotify Investor Relations).This compares to the #2 streaming player, Apple Music, which has 50 million subscribers (Source: With 50 Million Subscribers, Apple Music Still Lags Behind Spotify -- For Now).Spotify launched its service in 2008 and pioneered the freemium model of premium music listening. Spotify has a free, ad-supported version of their product that anyone can sign up for. However, if customers want to listen to specific songs and in an ad-free format, they need to subscribe to the premium version of Spotify. This freemium model has been core to Spotify’s rise because it caters to a broader spectrum of consumers and brings more people into the Spotify funnel.Pandora (P) primarily offers an ad-supported product (although it has been trying to catch up by offering a Spotify-like premium tier). The ad-supported product that P and SPOT offer is primarily a music discovery platform that plays music according to the user’s indicated tastes. This involves a complex algorithm and lots of listening data. Notably, Apple Music doesn’t offer a free tier for their service and has a less advanced music discovery engine (Source: Apple Gains Power With Shazam, But It's Still 'No Silver Bullet' For Music Discovery: Analysis).Spotify’s sweet spot of offering a solid free and paid product in addition to the service being an early mover in the industry has allowed the company to have a leading market share for paid subscribers.Source: Nomura Equity Research Report.Spotify found the freemium model is a great way to get users onto its platform. Once a user is heavily engaged with the Spotify platform, there is a good chance the user would be interested in the premium version of the service. This can be seen in SPOT’s numbers. A whopping 46% of monthly active users (“MAUs”) are premium subscribers. The average revenue per user is significantly higher for paying subscribers which has made SPOT’s business model viable. Despite paying subscribers accounting for just 46% of MAUs, they account for 90% of revenue.Spotify not only has the largest streaming subscriber base, but it is also growing users at a fast rate. Spotify’s largest geographic market is Europe where it had 58 million MAUs in 2017 (37% of total MAUs); SPOT saw its European MAUs grow 25% from 2016 to 2017. In the US (32% of MAUs), SPOT grew MAUs by 21% in 2017. In Latin America (21% of MAUs), SPOT grew MAUs by 35% in 2017. And in the rest of world (10% of MAUs), SPOT grew MAUs by 49% in 2017. (Source: SPOT IPO prospectus)Not only are SPOT’s users growing, but existing users are spending more time on the platform. From Q4 2016 to Q4 2017, users spent 13% more time on the platform. This has resulted in more engaged users and has translated into lower churn rates. In Q4 2017, SPOT’s premium churn was 5.1%, compared to 6.0% from Q4 2016 and 7.5% in Q4 2015.Spotify owns a 9% stake in Tencent Music which gives the company a call option on the Chinese market. Tencent has a dominating position in the Chinese streaming music industry with over 700 MAUs and over 20 million paying subscribers. According to IFPI, music revenue in China grew 35% in 2017.Spotify’s Tencent Music ownership is likely worth ~$2.25 billion based on the potential IPO valuation of Tencent music. Tencent Music could go public as soon as this year based on media reports (Source: Tencent Music Plans IPO; Valuation Could Exceed $25 Billion).The biggest risk to the investment thesis for Spotify is that the company loses its competitive position as the most relevant streaming service. Currently, there are at least half a dozen direct competitors to Spotify, although the only serious competitors today are Apple, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And really Apple is the only company that has made progress in closing some of the market share gap.The biggest issue for Spotify is that it has few avenues for differentiation vs. peers. Everyone has a similarly-sized music catalog and offers similar pricing.Source: Nomura Equity Research Report.In my opinion, Spotify does have a competitive edge, but that edge may be eroded in the future if the company fails to continue innovating. The competitive edge today is that Spotify is known for its freemium business model, leading music discovery algorithm, and brand equity from being an early player in streaming.Now that Spotify is a public company and is cash-flow positive, I believe the company is in a superior financial position to compete. Smaller players that are not backed by mega-cap tech companies will likely drop out of the streaming market in the coming years due to their inferior scale and inability to generate profits.Apple has been able to gain market share because it is able to pre-install Apple music into iPhones and has made strides in its platform through its acquisitions of Shazam and Beats. However, Spotify is consistently relevant across platforms, even in iOS, while Apple Music has very low relevancy outside of its own ecosystem.Even within iOS, Spotify is consistently a top-ranked app. That likely won’t change anytime soon. I pulled the below screenshot from the Apple app store:Source: iTunes - Browse the top free apps on the App Store - Apple.Spotify is ranked ahead of the following apps:Finally, Spotify is a focused company with the sole mission of delivering the best music streaming experience possible. This focus should enable the company to innovate the most and develop features that will attract new and existing customers. The company is still led by its visionary founder Daniel Ek, who maintains a large ownership stake in the company and will continue to execute on the company’s long-term goals.Spotify is growing its top-line revenue at a fast rate and is expected to continue growing at a 20%+ rate in the near future, based on Wall St. consensus estimates (source: Capital IQ). The company is unprofitable on a GAAP basis but is actually cash-flow positive. Being cash-flow positive will obviate the need to raise capital. SPOT is expected to reach profitability on an EBIT basis by 2020E which will be enabled by greater scale and operating leverage.SPOT trades for 4.7x forward EV to sales. This compares to internet peers which on average trade for 4.1x forward EV to sales. Notably, SPOT trades at a significant premium to Pandora and a significant discount to Netflix (NFLX). Pandora is in a much worse position than SPOT. Pandora operates at a smaller scale, is cash-flow negative, and is only growing revenue at a single-digit rate; therefore, SPOT’s premium to Pandora is justified. Netflix is an interesting comparison, but is likely apples and oranges. The biggest difference is that Netflix produces a significant amount of original content and thus is a bit more insulated from competition. However, the drawback for Netflix is that it must spend a significant amount of money up-front to pay for content production which is not an issue for SPOT. As a result, Netflix is actually cash-flow negative and has a levered balance sheet. SPOT is cash-flow positive and has no debt.SPOT doesn’t really have any good pure-play comparable peers. A more constructive way to value Spotify is to think about its Total Addressable Market (“TAM”), and its potential share of the market. Based on the below chart from Nomura which cites the World Bank and IFPI, there are currently 180 million music streaming customers world-wide (5% of 3.6 billion), but the total size of the paid music streaming market could grow to 450 million customers by 2020E (11% of 4.1 billion). This is a 35% compound annual growth rate in the number of paid streaming customers. Spotify currently has a ~40% market share of the global streaming market. Even if you assume Spotify’s market share declines to 30% by 2020E, that still represents 135 million paying subscribers which is almost double SPOT’s subscriber base in 2017.Source: Nomura Equity Research Report.If you assume that the 135 million subscribers pay SPOT’s current subscription rate of ~$85 per year (source: SPOT IPO prospectus), you get to $11.475 billion in subscriber revenue by 2020E, which excludes revenue from advertising (currently 10% of sales). You quickly get to much more reasonable multiple on SPOT’s enterprise value to future revenue if you extrapolate the expected market growth for 3 to 5 years.The numbers are very squishy because no one knows with any precision how much the industry will grow, what SPOT’s subscriber count will look like in 5 or 10 years, and what kind of average revenue per user or EBIT margin the company will achieve. However, making reasonable assumptions that SPOT will continue to grab a significant market share, will generate within the same ballpark of revenue per user, and will eventually produce an EBIT margin of ~10% (Netflix currently) or higher, implies that Spotify’s stock price will likely be worth a significant multiple of its current value within 5 to 10 years."

To feed himself, the serf would have to cultivate a plot of land owned by his lord, to whom a substantial proportion of the grain grown would be given to.Spotify (SPOT) sits on a danger zone as the company has no control over what fundamentally constitutes the majority of its revenue. Compounding this danger is that fact that Spotify will never have control and is currently competing against three of five FAANG stocks. Spotify, Apple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon Music (NASDAQ:AMZN), and YouTube Music (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), virtually, all have the exact same songs, effectively rendering obsolete the tried and tested strategy of constructing a deeply entrenched competitive moat.Having played a pivotal role in creating the streaming market, Spotify now finds itself much like David as he was about to fight the Philistine warrior Goliath. But without the God of music streaming on their side, and in a world where the brute force of unhindered capital reigns supreme, Spotify faces an increasingly bleak future. At best, this would be as a minnow, credited with championing a model which liberated the music industry from the clutches of online pirates. At worst, total destruction if the music streaming doomsday scenario becomes a reality.Spotify ended its first day of trading at a $26.5 billion valuation, 157 million monthly active users and 71 million premium subscribers. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently has 130.1 million subscribers and IPOed on May 22, 2002, at a valuation of $300 million. Not only is there less upside to SPOT due to the law of large numbers, Netflix also did not have the same gravitas of competition that Spotify does.The combined market capitalization of Apple, Amazon, and Google is $2.8 trillion. As at the end of 2018's second quarter, their total free cash flow was $22.47 billion, with a total gross cash on hand of $201 billion. And while Netflix was pivotal in the popularising subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) services, it still faces limited competition, unlike Spotify.Source: Macrumors 'Spotify Announces 75M Active Users, Raises $526M Following Apple Music Debut'When Apple Music was launched during in June 2015, Spotify had 75 million active users and 20 million paid subscribers worldwide. It commendable that they've still been able to grow from this point, but it's clear from their Q2 2018 results that this growth is now at a negative inflection point.Spotify grew both monthly active users (""MAU"") and premium subscribers by 30% and 40% year-on-year, respectively. The latter also grew by 12 million to 83 million from when Spotify directly listed its shares on the NYSE.But this has come at a cost.Source: Spotify Investor Day PresentationAverage revenue per user (""ARPU"") for Q2 2018 had declined further to €4.89 from €5.32 as at the end of 2017. This was due to factors like the growing popularity of their family and student plans, as well as their growth in lower ARPU geographies like Latin America and Southeast Asia.A 28.5% decline in ARPU from 2015 is a negative long-term trend that will increasingly diminish Spotify's attractiveness as an investment. Critically, it is this facet that differentiates Spotify from Netflix. Spotify will be heavily restrained in its ability to raise the cost of its monthly subscriptions to boost revenue.Source: Netflix`s average revenue per streaming customer worldwide from Q3 2012 to Q3 2017In a just over 12 months' time, Spotify will have to renew their contract with the big three record labels. This comes fast on the heels of Spotify's pre-public listing negotiation deal which saw the monopoly agree to reduce the average percentage of Spotify per-stream revenue they received in order to give the company a better chance of profitability.Sony Music Entertainment Inc, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group, henceforth referred to as SUW, did not sacrifice their revenue because of corporate altruism, but of self-interest as all three held equity stakes in Spotify. Warner has since disposed of its entire stake, Sony has sold fifty percent of its shares, and Universal has announced its intention to dispose of its.The result of the pre-listing negotiation with SUW saw Spotify's average percentage payout fall from 55% to 52%. This led to a marked increase in Spotify's 2017 gross margin to 21% from 14% in 2016.Spotify's gross margins from Music Business WorldwideThe importance of this crucial facet of Spotify's investment case was underlain when SPOT hit a 2018 all-time high on Friday, June 8, as news of the company directly licensing artists was published. However, Spotify's CEO Daniel Ek opened the company's Q2 2018 earnings call by stating the platform is not working to replace record labels and that licensing content ""doesn't make us a label, nor do we have any interest in becoming a label.""Again, this is not because of the misguided form of corporate altruism. The 24-month contract negotiations between Spotify and SUW heavily disincentivize Spotify from attempting to own its own music rights by becoming a label itself. Indeed, Music Business Worldwide quotes a very senior US-based source at a major record company stating that ""If Spotify comes in here [during the 2019 re-negotiations] and asks for any sort of margin improvement, we're going to laugh them out of the room."" And that ""Over the last six months, trust has eroded and they've started doing things which seem blatantly out to get us. They're valued at a multiple which is much higher than any major label today; perhaps it's now time for us to start clawing that margin back.""87% of Spotify streams are owned by SUW. Any attempt by Spotify to sidestep them dramatically will be met with a swift response. Spotify, unlike Netflix, cannot become a purveyor of original content. The entrance and growth of Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music also gives SUW more leeway in their negotiations with Spotify as they are less dependent on one source for their streaming revenue. Tim Ingham's article goes into further detail on a number of pain points SUW will be looking to address during the 2019 negotiations, conveying the depth of control SUW has over Spotify's future.In medieval England, a serf who made his way to a chartered town and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom. Hence, one has to wonder what day after what year if ever, Spotify's fate is not shaped and molded by the interests of a monopolistic trio.The acquisition of one of SUW by Apple, Amazon, or Google is spectre that hangs over Spotify. Universal's parent company Vivendi (OTCPK:VIVEF), is looking to sell 50% of the music label, Apple has also already launched a global music publishing division, and Amazon has a brutal reputation for large acquisitions meant to enhance the attractiveness of its prime platform.In the event that either one of SUW is acquired by Apple or Amazon, SPOT will experience a material decline as another spectre of anti-competitive practices being enacted to take market share would hang over the company. This could take many forms like delaying the release of specific albums on Spotify's platform, pulling songs after a set time period, or mandating an increase in the average percentage payout per stream.There is no doubt that the future of music is streaming. Long gone are the days when the John Cusacks of their time would blast Peter Gabriel on a boombox held above their head while standing outside the window of a love interest. So too are the days when the ultimate act of romance was curating a playlist, then burning it into a CD to give to a crush.Screenshot of Old Napster from Notes on Digital AudioSpotify helped reign in the online piracy of music, indeed, the WSJ heralds the company as the ""savior"" of the music industry. The advent of the widespread adoption of the internet at the start of the new millennium saw the rapid uptake in music piracy sites like Napster, LimeWire, and Pirate Bay. The effects of the digitization of music piracy were the decade-long decline in the global recorded music industry revenue from its peak in 1999.Source: Global Music Report 2018: State Of The IndustryAnd while applications like iTunes gave users the ability to buy and download songs, its growth was not nearly strong enough to offset the structural decline in physical music sales. Accounts of the 'death of the music industry' piled up and the big four record companies became the big three with the demise of EMI.2016 marked a milestone for the music industry, as for the first time, streaming overtook digital downloads as the second largest revenue source. 2017 was another milestone as a 41.1% increase in streaming revenues meant it became the single largest source of revenue for the industry.Source: Global Music Report 2018: State Of The IndustryThe strong revenue growth profile for streaming is expected to continue at a CAGR of at least 16.77% from 2018 to 2022.Source: Global Music Report 2018: State Of The IndustryThe macro trend is undoubtedly bullish for Spotify as we are currently witnessing a structural shift in the way music is consumed worldwide. However, to what extent is the company's current valuation a fair reflection of this future market and the competition ramp?Kanye West's 5th album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has a number of great tracks, my favorite being POWER as over melodic tunes, it reverberates that ""No one man should have all that power."" In the case of Spotify, this could not be truer. Spotify's song is at risk of being muffled amongst the giants of technology. The company's fate is beyond its own hand, and its liberty will remain even further beyond the horizon."

Spotify has over 75 million subscribers (the company says it's going to 100 million by the end of the year) and 170 million active monthly users who are able to stream over 35 million tracks on demand. It is moving the music industry from a transaction-based to an access-based model allowing users to stream on demand.In just my lifetime, we have gone from 8-track tapes to records, to cassettes, to CDs, to iPods. Remember Napster? Then, companies like Pandora (NYSE:P) came onto the scene. Now, most of the music I listen to is streamed from one source or another. I say most as my daughter has recently been listening to records - the old records. Maybe it’s a throwback to old technology and a fad. I do miss the old album covers with pictures of the bands and their song lyrics.However, streaming is where it’s at - a worldwide library of songs that I want to listen to anytime and anywhere. While the youth might be trying out records, they are coming and staying with Spotify.(Source: Spotify)Spotify just went public in April of this year. According to the annual report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the company controlled 44% of the overall global streaming market. In addition, it has been noted that Spotify contributes an average of $20 per user to the music industry, while YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) returns less than $1. Last year, subscription-based streaming revenue accounted for 38% of all recorded music, up from 29% the year before, per IFPI. In addition, IFPI’s Global Music Report 2018 shows total recorded music industry revenue for 2017 was $17.3 billion, with an increase of 8.1%.(Source: Global Music Report 2018)The use of Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI) sets Spotify apart from the pack. Spotify’s acquisition of Niland in 4Q2017 allows it to use the product and machine learning to provide users with a better experience allowing more specific search results and recommendations based on user preferences and historical use. In 2018, the company acquired blockchain Mediachain Labs to help develop a decentralized database connecting artists, licensing agreements, and music tracks.In conjunction with these new AI technologies, Spotify is able to analyze users’ behavior via collaborative filtering - this is similar to what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) uses to push recommendations to its users. With this technology, Spotify is able to provide a unique experience for each of its 170 million users. While the following data on Spotify moves so quickly and therefore might be outdated, it shows you the massive market for Spotify. Every day 20,000 new songs are added to the database. Users have created over 1 billion playlists and create 600 gigabytes of data per day.While Spotify is still the dominant player, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth rate is faster than Spotify's in the U.S. Apple Music has approximately 21 million subscribers in the U.S., while Spotify has approximately 22 million. Last year, Apple had 13 million U.S. subscribers, compared to Spotify’s 17 million subscribers. It is expected that Apple might exceed Spotify’s number of users by the end of 2018.While not stellar, Spotify’s fundamentals are improving, with a steady rise in earnings per share through at least fiscal year 2021. Sales are forecasted to grow at over 12% quarterly and over 27% annually. As can be seen below, profit margins are estimated to continue to strengthen and operating cash flow continues to grow.(Source: Nasdaq)(Source: CNN)(Source: Bloomberg)(Source: Bloomberg)Currently, Spotify’s relative strength index (RSI) is just above 50 and positive. The MACD is positive. The stock is currently trading above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages of 172.66 and 163.54, respectively. Resistance is 192.80, while support is 162. The stock is trading close to its all-time high of 182.45 reached on June 22.(Source: Fidelity Investments)Spotify's second-quarter earnings come out towards the end of July. If one is bullish on the stock, one might consider buying August 3 calls; however, they are expensive. As an alternative, one could enter into a bull call spread (e.g., 185/195), where you buy a call and sell a call further out of the money to offset the cost of the purchased call.

4182783,102214,2018-06-20T07:44:43-04:00,Spotify has been one of the fastest growing technology groups.Challenges are abound; Spotify's position in the value chain leaves it vulnerable.Being an independent music operator provides challenges as well as opportunities.,"Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) has a leading market position in its sole line of business - online music streaming on demand. It’s closest rival, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has about half Spotify’s number of subscribers. Spotify is the undisputed leader in streaming, with more subscribers than Apple and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) combined.But Spotify does not have a moat yet that can protect it from serious competition, and can guarantee its shareholders sustainable and superior returns. Apple and Amazon have both been pushing hard to expand their subscriber base, while Alphabet's (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google has unveiled a new music subscription service, and will promote it with YouTube’s most expensive advertising campaign. The service, called YouTube Music, mimics the Spotify model: there will be a free, ad-supported tier with more limited functions, and a $10 a month subscription without advertisements and with extra functions.Spotify's sources of revenues are not unique, advertising and subscriptions, with more than 90% of revenues coming from the latter. Its cost base is loaded by expensive royalties that it has to pay to the oligopoly of four record companies, which control 90% of its song catalogue. The big four companies are Universal, Sony and Warner Music, along with Merlin, an agency that represents smaller labels. Spotify's position in the value chain leaves it squeezed between its suppliers of record companies, behind them the artists, and in between end costumers, the music listeners, who are still not willing to pay big bucks for music streaming. This leaves Spotify with a heavy cost base and a suppressed gross margin of just 25% in Q1 2018 - well above the 16% of 2016, but still not sufficient to generate a positive bottom line, and a more comparable gross margin to low margin brick-and-mortar businesses than to trendy technology mega success stories. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) generates a 25% gross margin, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) generates 85% and Alphabet 60%.With 75 million premium subscribers, and another 99 million monthly active users who do not pay subscription fees and who generate advertising revenue, Spotify is some distance ahead of its second closest competitor Apple, which holds about 40 million subscribers. And the market has been growing strongly; global recorded-music market grew for the third consecutive year in 2017, and that growth was led by streaming. US music sales jumped 17% last year, the fastest pace in 23 years, powered by streaming. Thus, the whole market pie is growing, widening market space for Spotify's formidable competitors to have satisfactory business for themselves without necessarily pushing for a winner-takes-it-all ending.For Spotify to generate fat sustainable profits, like its cousin in the FANG group of leading technology companies, it will have to look beyond music’s pricey royalty system. Spotify did start licensing music directly from performers who own their own licensing rights. Direct licensing deals are a way to cut the middleman of record companies and to increase margins. This process is still in its infancy; for it to have any meaningful impact on improving Spotify’s gross margins, massive scaling of this self-licensing model would be required. But this process could risk raising tensions with the four oligopoly record companies, and they could potentially threaten to pull their music, leaving Spotify vulnerable versus competitors. Spotify needs to negotiate with the label companies every few years for fresh licensing agreements.Spotify is sometimes compared to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Netflix was also loss-making for years but has become one of the most successful stocks in recent history, multiplying its stock price by 7 times in the past 3 years. Netflix continues to grow subscribers at a blistering pace as well as making operating and net income for the past few years - although still with suppressed margins. There are clear similarities: both companies sell subscriptions for about $10 a month and content makes up the bulk of their expenses. Spotify's enterprise value is about four times its expected revenue in 2019, compared with seven times for Netflix. But Netflix has been able to raise its prices without losing many customers — a strategy Spotify has not tested yet. For Spotify to replicate the success of Netflix, it needs to make or own original content - a challenging path for Spotify. And unlike Netflix, which pays once for a piece of content then can stream it as many times as it wants, music services have to pay music labels and other music owners each time a song gets played. So the more users and the more usage Spotify has, the more content costs it has - eliminating any economies of scale in the process.Spotify has an advantage of being independent, not belonging to any of the giant technology groups. It gives the impression it is the real specialist in music. Also, it markets itself as being trustworthy and genuine, to benefit from recent trust concerns about major technology groups, such as Facebook. It is also not attached, psychologically at least, to any of the operating system rivals; whether you are an Apple device owner or an Android/Google owner, you can use Spotify freely without feeling obliged to use your operating system music streaming application.The downside of course of being independent is that Spotify does not have the deep pockets of the giant groups. Investors will keep supporting Spotify, but not endlessly if it does not start generating sustainable attractive profitability. More than USD 1.5 billion in losses have been incurred by Spotify in the past 3 years. And Spotify lacks the economies of scale and bundling of services that the large, multi-service groups such as Apple and Google can offer.Spotify has had an impressive run, increasing revenues by 400% in the past four years. Its struggle now is to turn the tables on its supplier overlords, and to be more valuable to them than the other way around. If it manages to do this, while continuing its charm offensive with end users to outmanoeuvre its formidable competitors, it will establish itself as the supreme queen of music streaming and will earn a well-deserved premium subscription to the FANG+S club."
4174173,24157,2018-05-15T11:41:23-04:00,"We've found two more high-profile examples of greed for underwriting fees coloring Wall Street analysts’ coverage of previous Danger Zone picks.Investors should not be buying the positive analyst spin on ugly earnings reports from Tesla and Spotify.Given the issues facing both businesses and the risk in their valuations, it's difficult to accept research that touts the ""future potential"" or ""long-term value"" of either stock.","Last week, we highlighted how Netflix, and its overwhelmingly positive analyst coverage, reveals the conflicts of interest in Wall Street research. This week, we get two more high profile examples of greed for underwriting fees coloring Wall Street analysts' coverage of previous Danger Zone picks.Investors buying the positive analyst spin on ugly earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA) and Spotify (SPOT) are in the Danger Zone this week.As we noted in our previous report, investment banks make big fees by underwriting both equity and debt offerings.According to data from Thomson Reuters, underwriting fees are about $12 million for every $1 billion in junk bond issuance. Equity underwriting fees are much higher. Another Danger Zone pick, Snapchat (SNAP), paid Wall Street about $90 million to underwrite its equity IPO.With this much money at stake, investors should not be surprised that Wall Street works hard to stay in good graces with those companies most likely to need debt (or equity) funding. In some cases, the lengths to which certain analysts will go to curry favor with potential underwriting clients are, well, worth noting. Enter Tesla and Spotify analysts.For 2017, Tesla's cash burn rate was $6.5 billion with only $3.4 billion of cash left on the books at the end of the year. If anything, we think the cash burn rate is getting worse not better for Tesla.Nevertheless, in a bizarre conference call for Q1 earnings, CEO Elon Musk maintained he won't need to raise capital. He was dismissive and responded rudely to questions about cash flow.If the company continues to miss operational targets as it has in the past, Musk will need to eat his words and ask the investment banks to help him raise money before the year is out. Sell-side analysts weren't shy in pointing out this fact after the call. Evercore ISI wrote that the questions Musk mocked on the call were:Additionally, as Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley notes:Despite their criticism of Musk's behavior, Evercore raised its price target on TSLA, and Morgan Stanley has a $376/price target on the stock, 32% above the current valuation.Both Evercore and Morgan Stanley have earned significant fees from Tesla in the past. Evercore advised the company on its acquisition of SolarCity, while Morgan Stanley helped it sell $1.8 billion in junk bonds last summer.Both companies doubtless want a piece of the action on any capital raises or deal making in the future, and they'll be hesitant to alienate a CEO with a prickly ego when millions of dollars for their employer are on the line.Since 2012, Tesla has raised more than $8.9 billion (17% of market cap) in investor capital, which includes:The company's cash and equivalents fell over $700 million in 1Q18 to $2.7 billion, coming off 2017 which saw Tesla burn through $6.5 billion. Since 2011, the company has burned through $25.5 billion. Naturally, Wall Street is jockeying for a piece of the next offering. Moody's predicts Tesla will raise an additional $2 billion this year.Per Figure 1, Tesla's cash on hand has fallen in three of the past four quarters, and now sits at its lowest level since 1Q16. In 2Q16, Tesla raised $1.5 billion.Figure 1: Capital Raises Can't Sustain Cash LevelsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Helping fuel the cash burn, Bloomberg notes that Tesla's ongoing hiring has created an even further strain on its finances. Compared to peers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) Tesla brings in 2.5 times less revenue per employee. We've previously covered other significant issues facing Tesla, such as strong competition here.Even after falling 24% since September 2017, Tesla shares remain significantly overvalued. Comparing market cap to cars sold in 2017 shows how staggeringly overvalued TSLA is relative to peers. Per Figure 2, the market cap per car sold at GM, F, and TM is $4,497, $6,762, and $18,655. Tesla's market cap per car sold is $465,677.TSLA's valuation implies its cars are nearly 100 times more valuable than GM's. At $132,985 per car (or 30 times as high as GM), the valuation is still looks ridiculous if we assume Tesla can meet its heretofore unmet production goals and sell all the cares it makes.Figure 2: Tesla's Valuation is Astronomically Higher Than PeersSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Using our dynamic DCF model to quantify the expectations already baked into the stock price further highlights how overvalued TSLA remains. To justify its current price of $285/share, Tesla must immediately earn 8% NOPAT margins (between a mass-market and luxury car manufacturer, compared to -8% in 2017) and grow revenue by 20% compounded annually for the next nine years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here. In this scenario, Tesla would be generating just under half General Motors' 2017 revenue. For reference, GM sold over 10 million cars in 2017 or 100 times as many cars as Tesla.More details in our last report on Tesla.After reporting its first quarterly results since going public, Spotify ended the day down 6%. In the week leading up to the earnings release, seven different analysts initiated Buy ratings on Spotify. Despite the disappointing results there were no downgrades or target price cuts. Instead, many analysts offered positive commentary on the firm's ""long-term prospects.""Rather than blame the firm's falling average revenue per user or weak guidance for paid subscribers, analysts blamed the market for being too optimistic. As JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note, ""Spotify delivered a solid Q1, but the Street expected more upside in its first quarter as a public company.""As we noted in our report ""How Much Should Investors Pay for Spotify,"" the firm's average revenue per user (ARPU) has been falling since 2015. This decline continued as Spotify's 1Q18 results revealed ARPU fell to €4.72, down from €5.32 in 2017 and €6.84 in 2015. Analysts believe Spotify's promotion of its Family Plan and discounting standard plans is to blame for the deteriorating ARPU. However, while a lower price helps Spotify grow and retain its user base, it puts further pressure on already negative margins.Adding additional pressure to margins, Spotify recently announced upgrades to its free subscription.The other issue we noted in our original report on Spotify, costs rising faster than revenue over the past two years, continued in 1Q18 as well.These rising costs, when combined with falling ARPU, make a path to profitability especially difficult.While RBC's Mark Mahaney notes that ""the business model is inflecting and the valuation is highly reasonable,"" simple math shows otherwise. In our original report, we presented three future cash flow scenarios to help determine a reasonable price for the IPO.Scenario 1 - The Movie Theater: This scenario assumes that Apple Music and other streaming services continue to grow and challenge Spotify. As a result, Spotify grows slower than expected (midpoint of subscriber guidance for 2Q18 came in below expectations) and struggles to earn significant economic profit.If Spotify increases NOPAT margins to 3% (-8% in 2017) and grows revenue by 10% compounded annually over the next decade, the stock is worth just $9/share today - a 94% downside to the current price. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here. In this scenario, Spotify would earn an ROIC of 10% compared to the -79% earned in 2017.Scenario 2 - Consolidation: In this scenario, we assume Spotify emerges as the clear winner among the various streaming services. If Spotify achieves an 8% NOPAT margin (slightly below the median of 67 media companies we cover) and grows revenue by 15% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth $72/share today - a 55% downside to the current price. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here.In this scenario, Spotify would earn a 21% ROIC and generate $19.4 billion in revenue ten years from now, which is 24% higher than the entire recorded music industry in 2016.Scenario 3: Ownership: In this scenario, Spotify successfully pushes out the record labels and takes ownership of all its content. Its revenue and user growth over the next decade are the same as the consolidation scenario, but it now has the ability to earn a long-term NOPAT margin of 16%, on par with a successful content creator like Disney (NYSE:DIS).In this scenario, SPOT earns an ROIC of 43%, which would put it in the top 3% of all S&P 500 companies, and it is worth $177/share today - only 11% above the current stock price. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here. Essentially, believing Spotify can achieve anything less than this optimistic scenario leaves nothing but downside for investors buying the stock today.Given the issues facing Tesla and Spotify's businesses and the risk in their lofty valuations, it's difficult to accept, with straight face, research that touts the ""future potential"" or ""long-term value"" of either stock.Don't get us wrong. Some research from Wall Street is top notch. The problem is there's no way to be sure which research is or is not conflicted given the lengthy disclaimers at the end of every report. These disclaimers protect the publishers from prosecution for nearly every imaginable conflict, including, for example, being short a stock which the report recommends buying.These issues only strengthen the case for independent research and due diligence. Investors deserve research that gets to the core drivers of valuation, and they deserve independent due diligence because it is part of fulfilling fiduciary duties.Recent advances in technology[1] make it possible to deliver research at scale that is based on all available financial information, including items found in the footnote and MD&A. Those ignoring such technology and blindly following Wall Street research are doing a disservice to themselves and/or their clients.This article originally published on May 7, 2018.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.[1]Harvard Business School features the powerful impact of research automation technology in the case New Constructs: Disrupting Fundamental Analysis with Robo-Analysts."
4174686,104394,2018-05-16T13:29:37-04:00,Spotify is financially strong.One of its key strengths lies in being able to retain its customers.It is well-placed to succeed.,"Last month, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) went public on the New York Stock Exchange. A decade after its inception, the company has undoubtedly become a major player in the music industry. After more than a decade of declining revenues, the music industry recorded an increase in revenue in 2017 for the third year running. Streaming revenue was the largest contributor, having increased by 40% in the past year and close to 70% in the year before. While it may be stretching it to say that Spotify has single-handedly saved the music industry, there’s no denying the company has played a significant role in contributing to this turnaround.Source: Global Music Report 2018Spotify adopts a freemium strategy - its basic service, streaming music, is offered to users for free with Spotify Free, while additional features come at a cost with Spotify Premium (nominally $9.99/month, but it varies depending on the promotion). Additional features include being able to listen to music offline, as well as having an ad-free experience. Apart from being able to generate revenue through Spotify Premium from paid subscribers and partners such as telecommunications companies who include these subscriptions in their plans (premium), the company is also able to monetize its free user base by charging advertisers for advertisements on Spotify Free (ad-supported).The company has done well in being able to monetize the entirety of its user base, free and premium users alike. Its success in doing so has been reflected in its revenues, which more than doubled from €1.9 billion in 2015 to just over €4 billion in 2017. The case is similar when revenue is broken down into the two segments. Both ad-supported and premium revenue have seen similar growth over the past few years. It’s also worth noting that in previous years, the company was making a loss on its ad-supported segment. However, this changed in 2017, when it finally turned a profit. This is significant, as the ad-supported segment will no longer serve as a drag on profits. Gross profit margin as a whole has been increasing as well, showing that the company is becoming more efficient with its resources, whether through economies of scale or some other means.Source: Figures obtained from SPOT Form F-1That being said, it’s important to note that Spotify has been a loss-making company and continues to be so. The company’s operating losses in 2017 were €378 million, an increase from the previous year. However, its operating margin has been improving, and was around -9% in 2017, up from close to -12% the previous year. While still making a loss, its improved operating margin provides optimism for the future. Additionally, its high operating expenses are largely due to sales and marketing. As Spotify continues to expand into other countries, this figure will undoubtedly be high. However, this increase will not go on forever. Once the company has achieved a strong foothold in a particular country, it can begin to cut back on spending in this area. This, coupled with an already improving operating margin, signifies that Spotify will be able to eventually become profitable.Source: Figures obtained from SPOT Form F-1When Spotify went public last month, it took the unusual step of opting for a direct listing instead of a traditional initial public offering, meaning the company raised no new capital in the process. In comparison, Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) raised close to $900 million when it went public in March. Spotify cited several reasons for not doing so, among which was a strong balance sheet. In recent years, the company has become cash flow-positive, recording free cash flow of $109 million in 2017, and has approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. On top of this, the company is also debt-free, meaning it has no pressing obligations to creditors. While its strong financials should not preclude raising more money, the very fact that Spotify was willing to forgo raising additional capital in favor of transparency and equal access (some of the other reasons cited) speaks volumes about its confidence in the business.Source: Figures obtained from SPOT Form F-1Although the music industry has completed a turnaround in recent years, revenues in 2017 were still only around 70% of its peak, achieved back in 1999. Whether the music industry will be able to return its peak is debatable, but at the very least, there is the potential for an additional $8 billion in revenues. This figure has not even included the human factor. The global population today is far greater than it was 20 years ago, which translates into more potential sales. Of course, while this may seem like a simplistic view, it should not be forgotten that humans today are more affluent than ever before and have much greater spending power.Source: Global Music Report 2018Of course, regardless of how much potential the industry has, it means nothing if the company itself is unable to command a sizable market share. In this respect, however, Spotify has proven its worth. While Spotify’s ad-supported segment has begun to turn a profit, there’s no doubt that its premium segment remains key, accounting for 90% of its revenue. In terms of both the number of paying subscribers and streaming revenue, Spotify is by far the market leader. It had 71 million paying subscribers in 2017 out of 176 million subscribers globally - in other words, 40% of the market share. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) came a distant second, with 30 million subscribers in September 2017. The most recent figures put Spotify and Apple at 75 million and 40 million paying subscribers, respectively. While Apple has done well to close the distance, there remains a sizable gap between the two. It’s a similar story when it comes to revenue. In 2017, Spotify generated €3.6 billion ($4 billion based on the average 2017 exchange rate) from its premium subscribers, while global revenue from streaming services was $6.6 billion, accounting for more than half of the revenue. Do note that it isn’t clear whether the $6.6 billion is inclusive of revenue from advertisers. While I think it counts as part of streaming revenue, I’ve excluded it from my calculations in order to be conservative. Despite this, the results are still astonishing, displaying clearly Spotify’s strength in the market.It’s commonly known that staying on top is harder than reaching it in the first place. If Spotify is unable to maintain its market share, its profits will eventually dwindle. Spotify’s premium churn - a way to calculate the proportion of premium subscriber cancellations in a particular period (basically, the lower the better) - has been trending downwards over the past two years, reaching 5.1% in Q4 2017. While this may seem like a high number, the company has said that a third of these churns generally happen due to payment failure. Moreover, historical data has shown that 50% of users who churn rejoin within 12 months. Additionally, the downwards trend looks sent to continue. In its Q1 2018 earnings report, while not disclosing actual figures, the company stated that premium churn had fallen below 5%. Thus, Spotify has displayed the ability to not just obtain new customers, but keep them as well.Source: SPOT Form F-1While Spotify is in a strong position right now, it does have to be careful in order to avoid losing out in the future. While Apple currently has fewer subscribers than Spotify, its faster growth means it is forecast to overtake the latter in terms of US-based paying subscribers. Additionally, in terms of availability, Apple has a much greater outreach than Spotify. Apple Music is available in over a 100 countries, while at latest count, Spotify is available in 65 countries and territories. Among the key locations in which Spotify is not available are China and India, two of the most populous countries in the world. A failure to enter these two markets would mean giving up on hundreds of millions of potential users in both countries, and thereby, giving up millions or even possibly billions in revenue.However, despite all this, there are some things to take into consideration. While Apple may overtake Spotify in the US, this does not hold true for the rest of the world. Spotify has much more subscribers than Apple, spread out globally. While Spotify may have a small outreach at the moment, as it continues to expand, the importance of its ability to retain its users should not be understated. Moreover, among other countries, Spotify disclosed in its Form F-1 that it has leased offices in India, which could indicate that a launch in India is potentially forthcoming. With regard to China, it seems like Tencent’s (OTCPK:TCEHY) dominance of the Chinese market has deterred Spotify from entering into the market. While it is a pity to be unable to break into the Chinese market, it is not the end of the world. The company has done just fine without entering the Chinese market, and will continue to survive without it.Spotify is the largest music streaming company at the moment. Its various advantages, including strong financials and, perhaps more significantly, the ability to retain its users, ensures that it is well-placed to succeed and continue its growth."

The bill, ""Music Modernization Act"" which is really 3 acts clumped together, will now move to the Senate and be voted on in May. Whether or not this bill is good, depends on what side of the track you're on. The bill looks to increase payments to musicians and those involved, however it would also lower costs for streaming companies if sued. This will further bog down the costs associated with royalties and keep music streamers even further from profitability.Source: ASCAPThe ""Music Modernization Act"" has proposed to tackled three issues in regards to royalty payments:Under the Music Modernization Act, the bill would require a single database to be created by all music streamers: Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Pandora (P), Spotify (SPOT) and Apple (AAPL). There would then be 3 judges randomly assigned to make payment decisions. These judges would set the royalty rates for both BMI and ASCAP. Thus, this leaves uncertainty for companies such as Pandora and Spotify. Will the rate be lower or higher? Most likely higher, but it may depend on the judges. We also are not completely sure if the judges will rotate or not.The AMP Act ""improves and simplifies the payment of royalties owed to music producers, mixers and engineers"". The passing of the bill would allow SoundExchange to pay these people directly and will also be in charge of the collection and distribution.The CLASSICS Act aims to properly reward artists who recorded before 1972. Under currently laws, these songs are not required to earn royalties from digital plays. This act is the most likely of all to pass given that these artists tend to not tour anymore due to old age. As a result, the royalty stream should be their main income which is where the support has generated from.The bills have a focus on digital plays. This means that streamers such as Pandora and Spotify are going to be hit the hardest if the bills pass, which they are projected to. Given that the largest cost for both of these companies are content acquisition/royalty payments, the pressure to become profitable will be even harder.Pandora's content acquisition costs are shown below. These costs as a percentage of revenue continue to increase, representing 52% of revenue in 2015, and increasing to 55% in 2017.Source: 10-KBelow is Spotify's cost of revenue. These costs represent 79% of revenues in 2017. However, this percentage of revenue has been on the decline, being 88% in 2015. This number is predominately composed of royalty and distribution payments, but does include other costs. Given this, the percentage is slightly inflated.Source: F-1Neither company has been able to strike a profit. The primary reason has been due to royalties. With the passage of this proposed bill, the hope of profitability will most likely fly right out of the window for these companies. These bills are meant to increase the royalty payments to reward music producers, but punishes the platform that allows them to stream in the process.The passage of this bill may hurt who it trying to help. If Pandora and Spotify, who are the primary streamers, both continue to lose money they will at some point be forced to shut down. This would leave Google, Apple and Amazon. With the increased payments and costs, and lack of profitability inside this space, this segment would be one of the first to ditch if these companies run into financial trouble. The future is uncertain with the passage of this bill, but all we can do is wait."
4170132,22148,2018-05-04T18:24:13-04:00,Spotify reported fantastic Q1 numbers that were hit by currency headwinds.The company continues to expand non-music options and drive innovation in the music industry.The stock valuation remains compelling for a company generating substantial recurring revenues.,"The first quarterly report after a company goes public is always dramatic for shareholders and the stock. Different management teams present and guide in different manners and the quarterly report provides the initial opportunity for investors to react to the presented data. In this scenario, the market isn't appreciating the guidance from Spotify (SPOT) due in part to over extrapolation of the currency impacts on the results.Source: Spotify In the third sentence of the shareholders letter, Spotify summed up the quarterly results without much further research needed.The stock ended up dipping 6% on the day following earnings that probably wouldn't have occurred if the reported earnings growth was 37%. So basically, the company is located in Stockholm, Sweden, and reports in euros, so the translation with the U.S. dollars impacted revenues. The euro strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar in the 2H'17 so the comparison to last Q1 is skewed.Source: XE currency chartsThe company only has 40% of subs in Europe so currency impacts could go far beyond the U.S. as well.Source: Spotify Q'18 shareholder letterSo despite these currency headwinds and knowing that Spotify originally guided towards a €280 million impact for the year, the market just wasn't prepared for the Q2 guidance that revenues might only grow a meager 10%. The currency headwind is alleviated in the 2H based on where the euro trades now. As well, guidance sees €195 million of the impact in the 1H and only €85 million in the 2H.The overreaction is clearly and likely based on the market not being familiar with Spotify. Very few tech stocks on the U.S. markets report in a foreign currency with the majority of revenues not generated in U.S. dollars.The better focus is on the surging subs that continue to help grow the music industry. As expected, Spotify reached 75 million subs last quarter and forecasts another jump to 79 to 83 million this quarter. The company expects to ultimately reach around 94 million at the end of the year.Spotify continues to crush Apple (AAPL) that ended Q1 with only 40 million subs. Other players in the streaming music industry remain a threat, but Spotify continues to expand business opportunities like all good companies. The integration into auto infotainment systems, the use of scale to work with exclusive content from artists, and non-music products like the podcast partnerships set up the company to be more than just a streaming music service.The key to the story similar to Netflix (NFLX) and other subscription services is once a customer subscribes to the services the business model only requires fine tuning to make a successful business, whether the margins are under pressure currently or not. The recurring revenues eventually reach the scale to make the business highly profitable.Spotify has the added benefit of nearly 100 million MAUs on the ad-supported model. The business has plenty of future customers already on the platform and some of these new partnerships will benefit from access to nearly 200 million users.My original research on Spotify still supports a $150 price as the low-end valuation. The stock only trades at roughly 4x sales at those levels and far below where Netflix trades with a similar video streaming business no matter how many comments that the businesses can't be compared.The key investor takeaway is that Spotify was hit by irrational fears due to currency impacts. Reuters recently detailed the impact to other European companies and the benefits these corporations will see if the euro dips to the €1.15 level as predicted.The stock will magically return to substantial reported growth come the second half of the year and the market will praise the innovation of the music-streaming service. Use the weakness in the stock as an opportunity before the market catches on to the obvious."
4162228,20521,2018-04-10T18:38:05-04:00,"Spotify may be a leader right now, but it will take a lot for it to compete against the financials and the technology that tech giants have access to.How is Spotify planning to address these concerns? How will it compete?And how will the company finally turn profitable?","According to a report by Statista, the global music streaming market is expected to grow from $11.44 billion in 2018 to $14.79 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 6.6%. User penetration was at 24.7% in 2018 and is expected to grow to 26.6% by 2022. Earlier this month, streaming music service provider Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) went public. Here's a quick look at the Billion-Dollar Unicorn player's performance so far.Sweden-based Spotify was founded by serial entrepreneur Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Its service was launched in 2008 when global music industry revenues were declining due to growth in piracy and digital distribution. While listeners were still listening to music, the artists needed a better way to monetize their music and consumers needed a legal and simpler way to listen. Spotify was set up on the belief that streaming music was beneficial to both artists and music fans.Spotify operates on a freemium model, allowing access to an ad-supported streaming radio service. Customers also can select a paid subscription that grants them unlimited online and offline, high-quality, ad-free streaming access to its catalog. The membership fee is $9.99 a month. Spotify is present in 61 countries and territories. It has a monthly active user base of more than 159 million subscribers, which grew 29% over the year. Its Premium Subscribers have grown 46% over the year to 71 million. Spotify claims that its premium subscriber base is nearly double that of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music subscriber base. Spotify accounts for the largest global streaming market share by revenues. It accounted for 42% share in 2016, and had 41%, 42%, and 59% in the US, Brazil, and United Kingdom markets, respectively.Spotify has seen strong revenue growth over the past years. For the years ended December 31, revenues have grown from €1.94 billion (~$2.38 billion) in 2015 to €2.952 billion (~$3.62 billion) in 2016 to €4.09 billion (~$5.02 billion) in 2017. During the same period, net losses grew from €230 million (~$282.39 million) in 2015 to €539 million (~$661.78 million) in 2016 to €1.235 billion (~ $1.52 billion) in 2017.Until earlier this month, Spotify was venture funded with $2.71 billion in investments from Asset Management Partners, Baillie Gifford, D.E. Shaw & Co., Discovery Capital, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), GSV Capital, Halcyon Asset Management, Lansdowne Partners, Northzone, Rinkelberg Capital, Senvest Capital, Technology Crossover Ventures, TeliaSonera, Alexandre Mars, AFSquare, Fidelity Ventures, Lakestar, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), 137 Ventures, Accel Partners, DST Global, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Founders Fund, Sean Parker, Horizons Ventures, and Li Ka-shing.Last week, Spotify went public and began trading on the NYSE under the ticker SPOT. Unlike traditional IPOs, Spotify had followed the direct listing method that allowed it to trade its shares publicly without underwriting pressures, lock-in periods, and listing prices. As part of the process, Spotify hired Citadel Securities as a market maker to set the opening price on the NYSE, with help from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The reference price for the stock was determined at $132, valuing the company at $26.5 billion. That's a significant increase over the $8 billion valuation in March 2016. Spotify did not execute a traditional listing, and its listing method helped it save on IPO expenses. According to analysts, it paid nearly a quarter of what it would have had to pay if it had done the traditional way. But while this may be a cheaper option, the market does not think that many companies will go down this path. Spotify's strengths including a powerful brand, a global scale, rapid growth, positive free cash flow, and a dominant position in a large market with secular growth allowed it to go for that route. But that may not work out for many other players.Spotify's valuation and user base may be rising, but that's not spelling an end to its losses. Since inception, the company has amassed an accumulated deficit of €2.43 billion (~$2.98 billion). Its losses have been attributed to the significant costs to license content and royalties to music labels, publishers, and other copyright owners. In fact, rival Pandora (NYSE:P) has yet to turn in a profit. Pandora's valuation has fallen more than 60% since it went public, as it has failed to keep up with market expectations on revenue, subscriber growth, and profits.Additionally, competition from tech giants with deeper pockets is heating up. Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Music, and Google Play Music (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all bigger brands trying to make their moves in the streaming industry. For these companies, music streaming is another line of business, and they can afford to run losses on the segment. Spotify may be a leader right now, but it will take a lot for it to compete against the financials and the technology that these giants have access to.How is Spotify planning to address these concerns? How will it compete? And how will the company finally turn profitable?For now, the stock is trading at $150 with a market capitalization of $27.5 billion. It had touched a high of $169 soon after listing. I'm not convinced that this is a good company to invest in."
4173372,103338,2018-05-13T02:29:41-04:00,"Several traits combine to make a company a possible candidate for a trillion-dollar valuation.I believe Spotify could be the next horseman.Pandora was first, but Spotify has better technology, merchandising (like discovery playlists), and brand.","Since the Great Recession, the Four – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – have amassed a combined market cap greater than the GDP of France. The accretion of stakeholder value (for consumers, investors, and employees) is staggering. If we could suss out the underpinnings of these horsemen, we could focus governments and universities on investing in the infrastructure that blooms these attributes (great engineering schools, bankruptcy laws, after-school music programs). And we’d be better stock pickers.Several traits combine to make a company a possible candidate for a trillion-dollar valuation. The T Algorithm:The shorthand is firms that become operating systems, dashboards, or portals for a large consumer category, and have network effects that reverse the aging process. Every Google search makes the algorithm more agile, stronger, younger. The Four have achieved OS status for their respective categories, and use their portal power to launch other businesses like X-15s being dropped from a B-52… able to reach the speed of sound much faster than any startup.In addition, the firm needs to speak to a specific instinct so scale is enabled both by digital technologies and our caveman selves. The Four tickle our need for a superbeing, for love, consumption, and procreation. Searching, connecting, consuming all feel… natural, easy.So, who’s the fifth horseman? Each year, we try to ID who might join the medals podium of firms who personify us and whose leaders we anoint the Jesus Christ of our religion: innovation. At the beginning of 2017 we posited Netflix had become the OS for the second most important screen in our lives, the TV. It had begun to build an AI that made your viewing experience better as you viewed more. Storytelling that educates and bonds communities is key to survival, and it’s why we love Search Party. Since we labeled Netflix “the next $300B firm,” the stock has tripled in value.In 2018 we proposed that Disney (NYSE:DIS) could be a viable competitor to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) / Amazon Video, as it could offer the mother of all video bundles, and then merchandise a Frozen doll / Disney World weekend / Disney Cruise Line experience, and move from a transactional firm, valued at a multiple of EBITDA, to a recurring-revenue business valued at a multiple of revenues. However, the acquisition of Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) assets has hit some bumps (Brian Roberts), and the latest word from the Mouse is they’re going to have several streaming properties (Hulu, ESPN+, “Disneyflix” )— dumb, just dumb. Fairly obvious that exponential growth in shareholder value stems from one type of brand architecture — a master brand. However, I’ve come to believe…I believe Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) could be the next horseman.Steven Pinker said music is auditory cheesecake, serving no evolutionary purpose. Others disagree. There has to be a pretty deep reason in our lizard brain why Mick Jagger gets to date ballerinas four decades his junior. Music plays a key role in educating the young (see above: storytelling), and Dr. Geoffrey Miller at the University of New Mexico believes musical ability is a sexually selective indicator, as it’s a signal of underlying fitness. I registered early that if you can dance, or make people laugh, women will kiss you. Also, musical ability seems to mirror fertility. Darwin found that female birds prefer more complex songs from their suitors, putting males under pressure to evolve the neurological apparatus to create and sing them. Think of the great artists, and when they were really productive, so to speak. Bottom line, they were young and virile/fertile. In sum, music does join the ranks of food and sex as something where there’s “something else” going on. Young people spend an eighth of their waking hours listening to music.Social features that let you access others’ playlists and signal your attractiveness via your musical taste — while also entertaining and strengthening bonds with friends — give the streaming music company instinctive scalability. Every time you use Spotify, grouping songs into playlists, and your music pops into your friends’ feeds, giving them ideas, Spotify gets better, making it a Benjamin Button firm.A recent study found that the more social elements a service has, the more likely it is to make users unhappy (like passive browsing on Facebook). On the flip side, the more a site focuses on entertainment and discovery, the happier its users say they are. Spotify is entertainment focused but has a social element — the best of both worlds.Pandora (NYSE:P) was first, but though it tailors to your taste, there is no social aspect. It’s also only available in the US and is seriously uncool. Spotify has better technology, merchandising (like discovery playlists), and brand. Unlike Apple Music, being a pure-play (as opposed to being owned by a tech giant) gives Spotify more cred among purists, young people, and influencers. The instinct / T Algorithm cocktail has resulted in a firm with 170M users, 75M of whom are premium subscribers. The firm registered €1B this quarter, representing 37% growth. Spotify accounted for 36% of premium music subscribers globally.The most valuable consumer organizations of the 20th century were often real-estate based: Sears (SHLD), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the Yankees, Stanford, Disney. Things have changed, but not really. The most valuable consumer firms of this century are also real-estate based: the icons on your smartphone’s home screen are the most valuable firms in the world. Spotify has the second-best space in the mall, next to the Apple store — if not in the dock with the most-used apps, it’s often on users’ home screen.It’s likely more young affluent people feel passionate about Spotify than about any clothing or tech brand — even Apple, as many of us are becoming aware of compulsively checking notifications. But the zone your favorite music puts you in fuels work and play. Music is inextricably linked to our deepest reward centers, and it accompanies most of our daily activities. The only apps that are a bigger part of young people’s day are firms worth well north of $100B. I think there is a decent chance Spotify could join them.The biggest risk to Spotify is arguably the biggest risk to our economy — that incumbent big tech firms continue to employ anticompetitive behavior. Apple Music is… awful. Every time I get in my car and U2’s Songs of Innocence autoplays, I feel my boys’ image of me eroding. Tim Cook has ruined U2, but that’s another post. Anyway, despite a substandard offering, Apple Music is growing faster in the US (5% monthly) than Spotify (2%), as the Apple Music icon is on the home screen dock of 1B iOS devices. Apple charges Spotify a 30% tax to be in the App Store and denied an update to the iOS Spotify app, essentially blocking iPhone users’ access to the latest version of the Swedish service.Oh wait, it wasn’t a mistake, but intentional anticompetitive behavior that our elected officials are too stupid and enamored with “innovators” to actually hold Apple accountable for. Amazon is also abusing their platform, the Echo, to juice another inferior product, Amazon Music. In sum, it’s considered anticompetitive behavior when a portal/OS leverages its portal power to send consumers to an ancillary service that’s distinctly shittier than other services. Google keeps signing consent decrees saying they will send us to the best place, instead of another place they can monetize. They keep violating these decrees, last year absorbing a $3B fine from the EU. By the way, that fine amounted to 3% of their cash on hand. Neither their business nor their stock was affected.Like most platform/network players, the firm is “investing” — Latin for hemorrhaging money. Spotify lost €378M, on €4B, this year.As I write this, Spotify stands at $150/share. At $28B in value, or 5x revenues, it’s trading at Amazon-like multiples (expensive). However, it’s hard to see why Amazon or Netflix wouldn’t endure 7% and 25% dilutions, respectively, and pay $50B+ to cement a leadership position in what may be the last media battleground — music. Netflix would be the dominant streaming company, vs. just video streaming, and Amazon would further buttress the intensity across the two-thirds of households that are Prime members. So, is Spotify worth $28B in its current state? Maybe. But it’s worth $50–100B to one or more of the Four.Prediction: Spotify stock doubles in the next 12–24 months.What takes Spotify to $300B, and true horseman status? They launch video, and become the most successful streaming entertainment firm, full stop. Netflix’s legacy is on the second most important screen, TV. Spotify was raised on the most important – mobile. Netflix needs to become Spotify before Spotify becomes Netflix. Nobody has cracked social and TV, and as half of young people no longer watch cable TV, if Spotify were to launch video and captured any reasonable share and engagement via unique playlists, then cable and Netflix would begin ceding market cap to Spotify.Many of us would rather have a playlist / curation from friends of the great art form of our age, TV, in addition to music. It would lead to better distribution and sharing. Spotify now means streaming music – it could mean social entertainment. It’s also a better model than Facebook or Google, as 90% of revenues are from subscriptions. We’ve come to the realization that social is nicotine (addictive, but not that bad for you), but advertising is the shit that gives you cancer (tobacco). The quest for more ads and engagement renders these firms arms dealers that traffic in rage and negligence. Subscription-based media won’t be saddled with a parent company tempted to tear at the fabric of our society to make their numbers.It took Spotify 12 years to become a unicorn. In another 3–5… it could be a horseman.Our Spotify playlist is so rich,Scott"

The streaming services for music and video aren't exactly the same, but the opportunity is similar; making the case for owning the laggard of the group.Source: Spotify websiteMy previous research highlighted how the unique direct listing might present an opportunity to own Spotify on the cheap. The availability of virtually all outstanding shares at the initial trading made the dynamics of this listing different form the traditional IPO. The supply/demand equation was shifted in favor of buyers while traditional IPOs lean towards sellers.For this reason, Spotify trades closer to the reference price of $132 than the initial highs around $169. The market cap is around $25 billion when revenues are targeted at over $6 billion this year.My work highlighted how the stock is only worth about 4x sales estimates with the stock trading around $150. Conversely, Netflix trades at over 9x sales estimates as the SVOD stock races towards a $150 billion market cap.SPOT PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOne reason the market gives Spotify a lower multiple is the misplaced fears surrounding competitive threats. Apple (AAPL) Music recently announced 40 million subscribers, likely leading to the post-listing weakness in Spotify.The tech giant has seen phenomenal growth since launching the streaming music service a few years back. The impact on Spotify though is overstated. The below chart clearly shows how the leading music streaming service has expanded the lead over Apple during those years. Spotify has gone from about a 15 million subscriber lead when Apple Music launched in 2015 to around 35 million now.Source: BTIGSpotify has forged a partnership with Hulu for a packaged service allowing customers to combine music and video streaming services at a discount. The combined $12.99 plan saves consumers $4 from the individual plans.The deal is important for Hulu to separate the SVOD service from competitors like Netflix. Statista suggests that consumers subscribe to multiple video services due to the unique content, but a combination with Spotify could set Hulu apart as a better package than individual services.The lack of separation in the video segment that also includes traditional content firms like Disney (DIS) and Time Warner (TWX) sets Spotify up as an acquisition target. One way to compete in the crowded video space is for Disney or HBO to combine a video service with a music subscription from Spotify where the other big competitor in Apple Music clearly isn't going to sell out.The key investor takeaway is that when Spotify reports Q1 earnings likely in May, the market will get the opportunity to get excited about the subscriber growth similar to what traditionally happens with Netflix. Considering Netflix just crossed 125 million subs in the rather crowded video space, Spotify has a long runway to match those numbers and expand the music market in a similar manner.Spotify offers a great opportunity to own the stock here as the market overlooks the valuation due to the weakness following the direct listing. The price isn't likely to last at these levels for much longer."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to the SA PRO archive. Click here to find out more »Since there are countless articles concerning the business model of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), I intend to focus on valuation metrics that should be considered before a potential investment is made.Naturally, as a passionate analyst, I have smelled the money and decided to involve myself intensely with the business model and its outlook as soon as the IPO held firmly. Disregarding the development of Spotify’s business, and after taking into account the successful launches of comparable corporations (e.g., Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)), I decided to be one of the first to purchase the stock as soon as it was listed on the exchange. However, I was able to tame my euphoria and decided to analyze the facts first. If you have been ecstatic about the stock as well, then this analysis is just what you’re looking for.Spotify traded at an opening price of $165.90 on 3rd April. According to the share issuing prospectus, the total number of shares as on 28th February, 2018, was 176,976,289. Consequently, the total market value of Spotify was $29.4 billion. This market capitalization corresponds to a six-fold turnover in 2017 and a five-fold turnover in 2018. Since the company hasn’t yielded any profits to this date, it is not possible to produce a clear assessment of the P/E ratio. Thus, investors paid $165.90 per share, generating a loss of €8.14 in the past year and an operational loss of at least €1.50 this year (according to Spotify projections, the overall operative loss in 2018 will be anywhere between €260 and €340 million).With this, Spotify has a similar rating as the two DAX companies Münchener Rück and Fresenius. Both are profitable and, for decades already, have delighted their shareholders with dividends (and dividend increases).The following figure shows the price at which shareholders traded shares in off-markets before Spotify’s stock market launch.(Private transactions of Spotify shares before the DPO. Source: Spotify registration statement)In December 2017, Spotify shares changed owners for a share price of a maximum of $132.50. And so, investors who bought shares on the day of the stock market launch paid an extra charge of 25% on the then trade price.The company also gives a fair value for shares in its registration statement (see screenshot below).(Ordinary shares valuation during 2017. Source: Spotify registration statement)In this context, it’s also important to mention that the number of outstanding shares was 167,258,400 in December 2017. Thus, investors not only had to pay around 38% on top of the fair value published by Spotify in its registration statement but also received 6% fewer shares, since the overall number of shares went up. Depending on the point of view, the stock market launch was surely a success.Also, the media reported that during the direct placement, no lock-up period was imposed. This means shareholders and employees were able to offer their shares right after the stock market launch. Nevertheless, regarding this, the registration statement mentions an important detail. Tencent's (OTCPK:TCTZF, OTCPK:TCEHY) subsidiary Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME) owns 7.5% of the shares, which are only allowed to be traded after a period of 180 days has passed. Conversely, this means that after expiration of this period, more shares could be thrown on the stock market, which could cause additional selling pressure and, consequently, could result in further decline of the stock price.(Tencent and TME lock-up agreement as of 28/02/2018. Source: Spotify registration statement)Let’s take a closer look at the recent stock market launches of some other tech companies that also received some media attention. This comparison will help to put this evaluation in some perspective and will also interpret the position of Wall Street.Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), which produced $1.1 billion of revenues in 2017, reached a market capitalization of $8 billion during its stock market launch on 23rd March, 2018. This roughly equals the seven-fold turnover of 2017. What Dropbox and Spotify have in common is that they both made losses but had a positive free cash flow at the point of their stock market launch.Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) had a market capitalization of $29 billion at its stock market launch in 2017. Its turnover for 2017 was $825 million. Wall Street was more generous with Snap and valued the company at 36-fold of its turnover. Similar to past years, Snap made a loss in 2017, and in contrast with Spotify and Dropbox, it had a negative free cash flow. The share value has decreased by 40% since the stock market launch.Let’s also make a comparison to Netflix. Even though the stock market launch lies a few years in the past and conditions were somewhat different, Netflix and Spotify are often compared because they are both in the streaming business.Netflix went public with a market capitalization of $309 million on 23rd May, 2002 - not billions, but millions. This equals a four-fold revenue of 2001 and doubles the revenues of 2002. Indeed, compared to today’s standards, it seems like a bargain, even though Netflix also made a loss and acquired a negative free cash flow during the IPO (to this date, the free cash flow is still negative).Today, 15 years after going public, Netflix has a market capitalization of $126 billion, revenues of $11.7 billion and a profit of $560 million (as of April 4th, 2018). This equals to an approximate 11-fold revenue and a 225-fold net income in 2017. Nowadays, the company generates nearly double the profit of its market capitalization than it did at its stock market launch. Whoever had the vision to sign up for Netflix shares during the IPO clearly made a profitable deal, regardless of today’s assessments.Based on the current valuation of Netflix and the recent IPOs of Dropbox and Snap, Spotify doesn’t seem to be that overvalued after all. Nevertheless, all the examples given seem overvalued compared to the Netflix IPO. That opens up the question: “How much more fantasy can the market capitalization of unprofitable growth companies in today’s relatively posh market stand?"" Also keeping in mind here the potentially rising interest rates.With Pandora (NYSE:P), there is an alternative music streaming service which, like Spotify, offers, for the same price, a free and a premium subscription model. In addition, it also makes a plus-membership available, which only costs half of the premium subscription model. Pandora produced revenues of $1.5 billion in 2017 and has a market capitalization of only $1.2 billion. Since its IPO in 2011, the company didn’t realize any profits. Even though Pandora has only 74.7 million free, complimentary service and 5.48 million paying customers, the company has a gross margin of 35% and operating costs of 67%, which is by far better than Spotify's. Based on this, Spotify's valuation doesn’t seem appropriate.As of 2017, Spotify’s equity ratio was 38%, with stockholders' equity of €1.2 billion and a balance sheet totaling €3.1 billion. The company declared itself to be debt-free and to have cash and liquid assets of about €1.5 billion (see figure below).(Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of 31/12/2017. Source: Spotify registration statement)It is my view that one must take Spotify’s statement that is debt-free with some caution. It must also be considered that this balance sheet is showing current liabilities of €1.86 billion. This is offset by short-term receivables of only €360 million. When the current liabilities are resolved with cash, cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, a cash amount of only €9 million is left.(Current liabilities as of 31/12/2017. Source: Spotify registration statement)Furthermore, one should assume that the majority of those €1.5 billion come from a €1 billion convertible loan in 2016. How am I getting to this point?This gives us a perfect connection to the cash flow. When considering what is, in my opinion, the lack of liquid funds for Spotify, it would be great to know how much cash the company generates. The following figures show that Spotify had a positive cash flow for the first time in 2016. In the following year, free cash flow increased from €73 million to €109 million. This equals a growth of 49%.(Free cash flow for the period 2013-2017 as of 31/12/2017. Source: Spotify registration statement)Unfortunately, the registration statement doesn’t really share any detailed information about the company's cash flow. However, it must be emphasized that the third quarter of 2017 had a negative operative cash flow. It would be interesting to know why this occurred and if it’s only a one-time incident (see the following figure).(Operating cash flow for the period 2016-2017 as of 31/12/2017. Source: Spotify registration statement)Its assets account for €3.1 billion. Taking into consideration that Spotify is “pro forma” debt-free and holds a cash inventory of €1.5 billion, this results in long-term assets of about €1.6 billion. At the same time, the company entered into an equity swap deal in the form of minority interests with TME in December 2017. Spotify claims that these minority interests are valued around €910 million. This brings us to the conclusion that these minority interests would actually represent a majority of Spotify’s assets.(Total assets of Spotify as of 31/12/2017. Source: Spotify registration statement)Indeed, Spotify is an interesting story and clearly contributed to revolutionizing the music industry. Within the framework of this analysis, I downloaded the Spotify app and tested the free subscription model. The app is convenient and useable.Nevertheless, it is important to differentiate between the general idea and the business model from the perspective of an investment. If Spotify is viewed from an investor point of view, it is clear that the company has been unprofitable for years, and this is unlikely to change in the near future. The higher the revenues climb, the higher the losses that are generated. In this context, royalty fees due to licensing agreements with labels represent the bulk of the expenses. In addition, Spotify’s current business model makes the company highly dependent on these licenses. Furthermore, extensive competition, as well as the fact that growth is projected to possibly reach a slowdown in the future (according to registration statements), also needs to be taken into consideration.So howcome a company delivering losses year after years is still valued at $30 billion by Wall Street?My answer to this: (cheap) money and (plenty) fantasy, in combination with the best friend and worst enemy of Wall Street, greed.The stock market launch was probably most profitable for Spotify’s founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, as well as existing shareholders like Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Tencent that can now sell their shares for high gains at the stock exchange. Tencent purchased 15.986.920 shares in return for the exchange of its convertible loan. According to the issuing price, it equaled $2.65 billion. Once the $1 billion convertible loan was deducted, the company made a (book) profit of more than €1 billion in a brief period of time. This was definitely a profitable investment for Tencent. Maybe I should have named this article “Why I am buying Tencent shares instead of Spotify shares”.The interests in Tencent Music Entertainment Group could grant Spotify with temporary illusions, provided that TME enters the stock exchange market soon. But this would be even more interesting for traders. Similar up and down movements can also be observed with Snap. On the other hand, Snap Inc. stock still is 40% lower than it was at the time of its stock market launch.Investors shouldn’t be misled by potential takeover speculations. Both founders, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, want to keep control over the company and hold 80% of voting rights. For this reason, I don’t assume that an activist investor will get in. Spotify mentioned that the company intends to go public in order to give existing shareholders more liquidity in trading their shares (“cashing up”). And the bull market turned up just at the right time.With a predicted operating loss of at least €1.5 per Spotify share as of 6th April, 2018, I would have to pay around $147.5 for one share. The company won’t make profits in the near, foreseeable future. Additionally, I as an investor I don’t even have a right of co-determination when it comes to the business strategy because the founders have voting rights of more than 80%. Also, there is a risk of share dilution in case Spotify undertakes a capital increase to fund further growth or the share value become pressurized when investors throw their shares on the market. As a value-based investor, I believe that the risk-reward ratio seems to be decisively unattractive.With reference to my initial euphoria, I would like to conclude my analysis with a quote from Benjamin Graham, the mentor of Warren Buffett:I hope you enjoyed my article and it helps you with your further investments. Good luck and continued success!"
4161166,104186,2018-04-05T08:05:26-04:00,"Spotify has a history of posting net losses, but its revenue streams are rapidly swelling.The company enjoyed a blockbuster market debut that saw shares briefly trading as high as $169 each.Spotify needs to expand its premium user base and keep a close eye on competitors like Pandora if it hopes to endure in the marketplace.","Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) debuted on the open market for the first time recently, though the music streaming company shunned the traditional IPO route that many of its competitors have favored. In a direct listing that saw the company hit the NYSE with a reference share price of $132 each, investors quickly backed the music streaming service, hosting its shares above their expected value before closing at around $149.60 each.Its financial filings only recently made public show that investors have plenty of reasons to back Spotify; the company’s soaring revenue figures prove that it’s rapidly nearing profitability, for instance. Still, there are some hurdles in the company's way before it can hope to achieve enduring success in the market. Here are the intimate financial details of Spotify’s recent direct listing, and how the company aims to remain relevant in the fragile global music industry.The most peculiar thing about Spotify’s market debut isn’t that its shares immediately began trading upwards, but rather that the company’s CEO decided to pursue a direct listing. CEO Daniel Elk opted to enter the market without any underwriters and pursued a stealth filing option that kept many intimate financial details out of the reach of investors until the last minute. Now that the company has debuted, however, its recent financial performance is available to the public, and investors are seeing many reasons to bank on Spotify’s continued success.For instance, the company has seen some seriously stellar revenue growth in recent years; it reported that revenues soared by 39% last year alone, for instance. Savvy investors will understand the social buzz around Spotify shares and that rising revenue streams don’t mean much if they’re eclipsed by losses, however, and in that regard, Spotify is hurting; the company has a history of posting net losses that will make some investors blush and shun it like a leper. Over the past three years, for instance, Spotify has posted more than $1 billion in total losses, according to the company’s prospectus.Despite its net losses problem, Spotify remains optimistic that it will soon be turning a profit. When you analyze the company’s user base, from which huge chunks of its revenue flow, it’s not hard to see why; Spotify already has more than 150 million total users, for instance, and has a plethora of premium users that it can rely upon for consistent payments, too. It only had some 30 million premium users in 2016, for instance, but now the company is enjoying more than 70 million premium users within its ranks. Consistent growth in the number of premium users it has will doubtlessly be one of the primary measures of Spotify’s success and competitiveness in the immediate future.Still, desperate competitors like Pandora (NYSE:P) and other music streaming services like Apple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL) will remain hot on Spotify’s tail for some time, and the company can’t afford to slow down the rate at which it’s scooping up more premium users if it hopes to remain viable in the global music industry. That industry has seen steady decline in recent decades, largely thanks to the era of digital privacy that took the web by storm, but it has been bouncing back in recent years, and could stand to buoy Spotify (and its competitors) more in the near future.Some investors will have accurately noted that the nature of Spotify’s direct listing onto the NYSE means that the company’s shares will be more volatile than usual in the future. That means tech investors considering throwing their financial weight behind Spotify should be aware that the company’s share prices could rapidly tumble (or swell even further) with little warning. Still, most tech investors see plenty of reasons to remain optimistic about Spotify’s future in the market; after all, the company ended its first day of trading at a valuation exceeding $26 billion, meaning it won’t struggle to finance its future endeavors anytime soon.As long as it keeps a close eye on its competitors and continues to expand its premium subscriber base, expect the music streaming service to grow. The company's net losses will be worrying to some, but Spotify has proved it has the perseverance and calculated strategy needed to thrive in today’s global music industry. Its unconventional NYSE listing may have turned some investors away, but Spotify’s market debut will doubtlessly be remembered as one of the hottest tech events of 2018."
4161713,104214,2018-04-09T02:17:19-04:00,"Spotify is the market leader in the high-growth music streaming industry with over 70 million subscribers and almost 160 million MAUs.Feedback from users has been consistently positive regarding Spotify’s algorithms, which allow it to suggest fresh new music to users via Discover Weekly.However, competitors include arguably the three greatest companies in history, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet (Google), against whom Spotify does not have an impenetrable competitive advantage.The company needs aggressive growth to justify its current pricing, and given the competitive pressures, this is a stock I would avoid outside of “taking a punt”.","Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is a digital music, podcast and video streaming service founded in Sweden in 2008. Spotify has acquired the rights to over 35 million tracks, and pays royalties to artists as compensation. It generates the majority of its revenue through a premium, subscription-based service, but also offers an ad-based “free” service for its users. The company pays music artists a royalty fee equal to c. 70% of revenue generated, which is split between the artists based on each artist’s respective share of the total music streamed on the service. It elected to do a direct listing on the NYSE last week, which had mixed results. Following a Day 1 “pop” to over $165, the stock is now trading at c. $148 per share. This article presents my initial views on Spotify as an investment at a market capitalisation of ~$26.4 billion.Figure 1(Source: Spotify.me)The feedback I have received has been virtually unanimous - Spotify is an excellent music streaming service. Many would call it the best in the market and user growth has certainly supported that consensus view.Through Discover Weekly, Spotify has managed to find a way to differentiate itself from the chasing pack and establish a sizeable lead in the race to dominate the music streaming market. This feature has given Spotify a compelling advantage in an industry where music content is largely the same across services. When one factors in the expectation for relatively low churn amongst music streaming subscribers, the early advantage could, in theory, turn into an impenetrable competitive advantage.Figure 2(Source: How Does Spotify Know You So Well? - Medium)Spotify expects over 90 million premium subscribers and nearly 200 million MAUs by the end of FY2018, which would represent remarkable growth and put the company well on track to achieving profitability.The company operates in 65 markets and has plenty of runway in terms of addressable market potential, hence why many prospective investors are hoping to “take a punt” on Spotify as a growth asset. Research on growth of the music streaming industry appeared to be less bullish than I expected, as per Statista, with a forecast for c. $15 billion global market revenue from paid subscription music streaming in 2022.Spotify is trading a little over 5x its latest revenue figures of c. $5 billion, but as mentioned previously, remains a loss-making business at the operating level, as it continues to invest aggressively for growth. That said, the valuation does not appear eye-watering or unreasonable when compared to similar businesses like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which trades at a market capitalisation above 11x revenue. Spotify has often been compared to Netflix, although, as I will discuss later, despite having a very similar ARPU and subscriber-based model, comparisons are misleading.As a company operating in a high-growth industry, Spotify is susceptible to competitive forces. Unfortunately, it has arguably the three greatest companies in history competing for market share (Apple (OTC:APPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)), as well as others like Deezer, QQ Music, Tidal, Pandora etc. This stands out as a major risk for the business.Figure 3(Source: Share of music streaming subscribers worldwide in June 2017, by company - Statista)On the one hand, it is probably good for Spotify that, for some of these competitors at least, revenue from music streaming is not a core focus, especially Alphabet (Google). On the other hand, it does mean that these competitors could compete more aggressively in future, as they are able to offer more complementary features and have the financial muscle to remain loss-making to win market share for a longer period of time.I especially fear for Spotify if Alphabet did begin taking music streaming more “seriously”. My sense is that it could develop an algorithm that is as good, if not better, than Spotify’s Discover Weekly, given the company’s reputation for excellence in AI, ownership of YouTube and corresponding user data. Some reviewers even regard Google Play as the best streaming service already, though this view has not translated into any meaningful market share for the ad giant. The combination of Google Play and YouTube Red is considered a proactive shift to change that going forward.Currently, Apple is by some margin the most threatening competitor to Spotify. Apple’s music streaming service is a natural add-on for existing Apple product users. Although music streaming revenue would not really move the needle for a business of Apple’s size, it is well known that the company is looking for different levers to drive growth. The music streaming business syncs well with its existing ecosystem of products, hence why it continues to grow subscribers at an impressive rate, growing to above 40 million global subscribers as per recent reports.Then, of course, Amazon wants to be involved in everything to keep growing. Offering Amazon Music as a cheaper, loss-making service to win market share and ultimately add to the value proposition of its Prime ecosystem is another significant threat to Spotify.Secondly, unlike Netflix, which have begun investing $8 billion per annum on original content unavailable elsewhere, Spotify does not have much music that is “exclusive” or unique to its platform. In essence, Netflix can use its growing content budget to set itself apart as a unique, ""must-have"" entertainment platform. The overwhelming majority of the music available on Spotify should be available on all the other music streaming services, which levels the playing field for competitors. Not only that, Netflix can spend a fixed amount to establish a platform that provides video content with high-quality original content, whereas Spotify must keep paying its artists a royalty based on a material percentage of revenue (although this could change as the company grows).Thirdly, music suppliers (music artists and their respective record labels) have considerable clout, which, as mentioned previously, means they can to a large extent “dictate” financial terms with Spotify. That should change in time, and how it could do so is articulated quite well in the article, ""How Spotify is finally gaining leverage over record labels"". However, for the time being, its gross margins and, hence, profit potential is greatly limited by the c. 70% royalty arrangement, which means it should rightfully trade at a material discount to other high-growth subscription-based companies in terms of Price-to-Sales ratio.I constructed a ""quick and dirty model"" on Spotify to give myself a sense of the potential profitability and returns an investment in the company could generate. Note, this is not guided by any significant due diligence or forecasting, but does provide a foundation from which one can make a more informed investment decision.I used the full-year 2018 financial outlook mid-points for key metrics (revenue, paid subs, MAUs and operating income / (loss)) and a 1.23 US/euro exchange rate. To inform the split between premium and ad-based revenue forecasts, I surmised that Spotify generates c. 90% of its revenue from premium subscribers versus the ad-supported free service based on the figures shown here and back-solved the ARPU based on year-end ARPU.My assumptions included a reversal of the ARPU decline in recent years to become a c. 3% per annum growth in ARPU for the next 9 years. Further, I assumed a CAGR of c. 9% for paid subs and c. 5% for free MAUs, resulting in an increased overall percentage of paid subscribers (as a % of MAUs), topping out at c. 206 million in FY 2027. I assume that gross margins trend towards 30% (i.e., 100% less 70% royalty), with the remaining assumptions being fairly bullish estimates on cost growth, no interest assumption and shares in issue remaining fixed.Figure 4(Source: Author's model)The output suggests a revenue of c. $17.4 billion, with PAT approaching $2 billion (applying an average 21% tax rate). If I then apply a 30x exit P/E multiple to the forecast FY 2027 PAT, it would equate to a c. $58.2 billion market capitalisation for the company at the time. Using the 9.75-year time horizon from today, that would equal to a c. 8.5% IRR for investors buying Spotify.If I consider the competitive threats in the market and the bullish nature of the forecasts presented above, I do feel the risk-reward dynamic is not favourable to investors. I would therefore avoid investing in Spotify unless one is tempted to ""take a punt"". The reasons for such a punt may include a more robust view on the company’s ability to fend off competitors and/or win market share beyond what I have assumed above.The most important variable which would improve Spotify’s investment thesis would be a gradual reduction in the royalty payments from c. 70% down to about 60% (or lower) over time. This would be a game-changing shift, though my concern is that it would be incredibly difficult to achieve. Other reasons to invest in the stock may also involve the view that Spotify can maintain a premium multiple far beyond FY 2027, or grow ARPU to closer $10 per month per paid subscriber. However, given the popularity of Family Accounts, where Spotify allows up to 6 users, I consider this scenario as unlikely. From my own perspective, the stock would have to drop materially from current levels (around $95 per share) for me to become interested, or else negotiate a change in the royalty arrangement with artists and record labels, as discussed above."

The stock lost some ground by market close but still managed to finish at $150 on the listing day. Spotify continues to drift today, down ~7% from yesterday’s closing price. In an unconventional direct listing, Spotify eliminated the middle man to get listed on the stock exchange. The company also didn’t raise any money from the listing; all the listed shares came from insiders.It’s not a good sight for the outside investors as the stock is down to $138 today, losing ~16% on the opening price yesterday. Selling insiders, however, made a decent buck given the stock is trading at a premium to its reference price.Spotify has been growing its paid subscribers at a higher rate than Apple (AAPL) Music. Spotify’s user base is almost double as compared to Apple. Monthly active users (MAUs) are forecasted to rise to 208 million, an increase of 32% on a year-over-year basis during the year ended 2018. However, a report from Wall Street Journal notes that Apple Music is set to surpass Spotify in terms of paid U.S subscribers during this summer. Apple has around 36 million paying subscribers while Spotify is looking to end the year with more than 90 million subscribers. Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play Music, including YouTube Red, had 7 million subscribers by the end of the first half of 2017.Source: F-1 ProspectusChurn rate is declining, which is an indication of customer satisfaction and sustained adoption of Spotify. However, the decline in churn can also be attributed to the declining revenue-per-user of the company. To review, Spotify is witnessing strong growth in its subscriber base despite competition from Apple. Moreover, the company is sustaining its subscriber additions, which can prove beneficial in the long-run.Spotify is guiding for mid-point revenue of $6.3 billion for fiscal year 2018, up 25% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin is expected to be 23%-25%. The company is expected to post an operating loss between $282 million and $405 million.During the year ended 2017, the company generated 90% of its revenue from premium subscriber while 10% of the revenue came from ad-supported music streaming. Revenue growth is slowing down though. Source: F-1 Prospectus and 2018 guidance Revenue growth is slowing down despite growing user base. Competition from Apple and Google is keeping Spotify on its heels. Both Apple and Google can afford loses as streaming only makes a very small part of their revenue stream. Spotify, as a stand-alone, streaming business has to gain subscribers. The company has been doing so at the expense of ARPU, which has declined substantially since 2015. The company notes the following in its filing prospectus:Source: F-1 Prospectus and 2018 guidance Despite competition, gross margin is showing improvement. Overall, financials look healthy. Revenue is growing; gross margin is improving. Nonetheless, declining revenue growth and ARPU are some of the red flags that shouldn’t be ignored.The stock is trading at ~3.9 time forward sales as of Wednesday’s market price. This is not expensive for a stock that is expected to post more than 30% growth in active users during the year. However, Spotify’s ARPU is less than Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on the paid subscription side, and it also lags behind Facebook on the advertisement front. See the chart below:Source: Facebook 10-K, Spotify F-1 and Netflix Q4 Letter to shareholders*Facebook’s average annual revenue per user is derived from dividing the company’s year-end revenue by average number of monthly active users (MAUs) during 2017. Netflix’s average annual revenue per user is based on annual revenue divided by average number of paying subscribers during 2017. Spotify’s premium ARPU is based on premium revenue divided by premium subscribers during 2017. Ad-supported APRU is based on Ad-supported revenue divided by the average ad-supported subscribers during 2017.It can be seen that Spotify generates lower revenue-per-user as compared to technology peers, both on the premium side and the ad side. Therefore, a price-to-sales above Netflix or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), isn’t warranted for Spotify. Facebook is trading at a forward P/S of 8.11 while Netflix is trading at a forward P/S of 7.87. On a P/S basis, Spotify is trading at a discount of 110% and 103% to Facebook and Netflix respectively, indicating that the stock is not very expensive after all. As the company generates most of its revenue from subscription, a comparison to Netflix is more suitable. Note that Netflix’s ARPU is only 37% higher than Spotify while supporting a P/S that’s 103% higher. This indicates that Spotify is priced cheaply as compared to the video streaming giant.Well, things look not so good if you look at the overall market. S&P 500 remains volatile; the index is down around 8% since touching a high in late January. SPYG, ETF tracking S&P 500 growth stocks, also lost ~8% during the last three months. Technology stocks are also under pressure given Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica fiasco and Trump’s confrontation of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Moreover, high interest rate narrative from Federal Reserve isn’t helping the market. In short, sentiment is turning bearish; momentum isn’t going to be a friend of Spotify during upcoming months.However, some analysts beg to differ. Gabelli & Co.’s John Tinker is confident that demand for Spotify shares will stay high amid institutional involvement.RBC’s Mark Mahaney is also bullish on Spotify’s prospects. He initiated Spotify with a price target of $220, arguing that the company is a leader in streaming services with an addressable market of $125 billion. MKM Partners is also in the bull’s camp with a price target of $200. Guggenheim also values the company at $175 per share. Overall, the sell side seems to be bullish on Spotify.Direct listing proved successful for selling insiders as the stock opened at a premium to its reference valuation. However, it has been a bad ride for initial buyers as the stock had shed ~15.7% of the market cap since its listing. Looking forward, Spotify has the potential to be a leader in the music streaming arena due to its head start over Apple and others. However, big players have the ability to cram the space with price discounts, which can prove fatal for Spotify given its total reliance on music streaming revenue. Although the stock is price cheaply as compared to other technology growth stock, it’s better to stay away for now given strong competition, declining revenue growth and heavy reliance on a market that doesn’t offer high margins."
4161056,69675,2018-04-04T15:22:50-04:00,"Spotify, the largest streaming service in the world, went public, garnering a valuation on its first day of $26.4 billion.The company's business appears robust, with strong subscriber growth and significant customer loyalty.The business offers users attractive growth prospects over the next several years and has been innovative in terms of expanding.","April 3rd was a big day for investors who are music fans. During the day, Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT), the parent company of Spotify USA Inc. and other similar subsidiaries, went public. The market’s reception for the world’s largest premium-based streaming service was upbeat, giving the entity a nice first day with its shares in the hands of the public. Generally speaking, I am skeptical of tech-based service firms because I tend to believe they will never achieve the growth the market prices in, but in the case of Spotify, I must say that the firm’s prospects from here look appealing.Shares of Spotify soared to as high as $169 on April 3rd after opening at $165.90. However, its closing price of $149.01 was still nearly 13% above its $132 reference price. In all, the company’s first day values it at $26.4 billion, but one interesting point investors should keep in mind is that, unlike most companies that go public, this business did not actually raise capital from its offering. Instead, all it did was list its existing shares on the market, allowing current holders to cash out if they so desire.*Taken from SpotifyIn the image above, you can see the hierarchical structure set up by management over time. Investors who hold stock in the streaming service technically own a piece of the parent business that, itself, owns the subsidiaries listed. But what does this ownership entail for shareholders?*Created by AuthorBy acquiring stock in the streaming business, market participants are nabbing a social network and marketplace that, according to management, had 157 million MAUs (monthly active users) at the end of 2017. As you can see in the graph above, this represents a sizable increase over the 123 million in 2016 and the 91 million seen in 2015.Through its user base, Spotify distributes over 35 million tracks of music to users who, last year, consumed 39.8 billion content hours, or about 253.5 hours per user. In the graph below, you can see that this represents a large increase over the 17.4 billion content hours (or 191.2 million per user) seen two years earlier.*Created by AuthorToday, about 36% of the company’s user consumption comes from 3.2 billion user-created playlists that stream more than 500 million times each day. This doesn’t count the 484 million podcast listeners and other ways in which customers and artists alike benefit from the platform. Many of Spotify’s listeners appear to start off as ad-supported ones, of which the company has 90 million today, but while this creates a modest amount of revenue and finally turned profitable on a gross margin basis in 2017, it serves as a feeder into the real money-maker for the firm.*Taken from SpotifyAs of the end of its 2017 fiscal year, Spotify had 71 million premium subscribers on its platform. As you can see in the image above, this represents a major upswing of 47.9% compared to the 48 million in 2016 and is 153.6% above the paltry 28 million seen in 2015. At the end of the first quarter of 2015, that figure was just 18 million. In the images below, you can see that not only does this represent the bulk of revenue for the firm, the gross margins outclass ad-supported revenue and have grown over the past three years from 15% to 22%.Over 60% of the users who become premium subscribers were once classed as MAUs under its ad-supported scheme. According to management, its size today is nearly twice as large as the premium subscriber base believed to be under the Apple Music banner run by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).*Taken from Spotify*Taken from SpotifyIt should also be mentioned here that Spotify’s MAU composition is highly desirable. As the image below shows, an impressive 61% of its users are between 18 and 34 years of age (roughly the age range of Millennials). A further 10% are under 18. Investors will need to watch these numbers to ensure the business can capture the younger generation over time, but so long as the firm continues to receive a large portion of its MAUs from America’s youth, its business is staying relevant to the times and will create enduring value.*Taken from SpotifyThanks to its growing premium customers, Spotify has done well to see is cash flow improve. As the chart below shows, operating cash flow for the firm grew from a negative 38 million euros in 2015 to a positive 179 million euros last year. Free cash flow has seen a similar swing, rising from a net outflow of 92 million euros in 2015 to a net inflow of 109 million euros in 2017. Sure, EBITDA last year was -324 million euros, which was worse than each of its prior two years, but at the end of the day, what matters is cash flow for any business.*Created by AuthorNot only are Spotify’s cash flow figures improving as revenue has grown from 1.94 billion euros in 2015 to 4.09 billion euros in 2017, but other fundamental metrics indicate that the company’s customer base is becoming entrenched. Take a look, for instance, at the image below. In it, you can see that premium subscriber churn declined from 6.9% per month in the first quarter of 2016 to 5.1% in the last quarter of 2017. This trend suggests not only a commitment by premium subscribers to the business, it also shows that they feel they are receiving more bang for their buck over time.*Taken from SpotifyMoving forward, it’s hard to believe that Spotify’s growth is going to slow materially. In the chart below, you can see that its largest customer base is in Europe with 58 million MAUs (28 million of whom are premium subscribers). This is followed by 51 million (including 22 million that are premium subscribers) in North America, and a further 33 million (with 14 million as premium subscribers) in Latin America. The population of the US alone is around 326 million, while Europe’s population stands at 742 million. This gives a lot of upside for the business even if management can get a large hold in either one.*Created by AuthorAn interesting case can be seen by looking at the US. Last year, only 35.3 million Americans paid for a subscription to a music service, which comes out to about 10.8% of the population. However, that figure, as shown below, represents a nice increase over 2016’s 22.7 million subscribers. 65% of the US music industry’s revenue for the year came from streaming services and that totaled an impressive $5.7 billion. Even a doubling of streaming from today’s level would be a modest portion of the population and would likely grow sales in this space materially.*Taken from the Recording Industry Association of America*Taken from the Recording Industry Association of AmericaWhat’s missing from this, though, is its focus on the rest of the world. Management reported that everywhere else on the planet has, in aggregate, only 16 million MAUs, with 6 million representing premium subscribers. This gives Spotify tremendous upside, and one way the firm may have already found to benefit from the developing world is through its partnership with TME (Tencent Music Entertainment Group).Last year, TME, a subsidiary of Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) that handles the company’s karaoke and music streaming services, swapped shares with Spotify so that each would own a slice of the other (along with purchase made by Tencent of Spotify’s stock, it appears each firm owns around 9% of its rival). Even in the event that stringent regulations make it challenging for Spotify to capitalize on China’s large population, its stake in TME will ensure that it wins so long as its rival does.Spotify is a fascinating company with a strong and growing user base that has and will continue to create value most likely. Already, 10 billion times per month an indie artist is introduced to a person who has never heard of or seen their work before and between indie artists and major record labels (mostly major record labels), the company has paid out over 8 billion euros in the form of royalties. Add to this the fact that the firm is already cash flow positive, with great user metrics, and it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where the business fares poorly over the long haul.*As a note, all financial reporting for Spotify is done using IFRS, not US GAAP. While user metrics will cross over perfectly with other tech and service firms, some financial measures may not be comparable with businesses that utilize GAAP."
4160967,104080,2018-04-04T10:11:33-04:00,"NYSE reference price of $132 was below the actual listing price of $165.90.The company is far from making a profit but is cash flow positive.While having experienced impressive user and revenue growth, the journey has been rocky and will likely continue to be.Shares are grossly overvalued, and investors should stay far away from these high price levels.","Spotify (SPOT) officially hit the markets on Tuesday, becoming listed on the NYSE. Despite being one of the hottest companies in the modern world, the debut price point of the shares is grossly overvalued and hyped. Financially, the company is going to have trouble for years to come and may not become profitable ever. At the end of the day, just because a company is a household name does not mean it is a good investment. Source: NBCSpotify was listed on the NYSE in a highly unusual fashion, through means of a 'direct listing'. This means that the shares were not sold with the help of intermediaries and the company received zero cash investment as a result. Spotify is unique in doing this, but it is able to do this. The company has simple-to-understand operations and has enough cash on the books for the foreseeable future. Management also believes that this method will provide transparency for investors. This also means that there are no underwriters for the stock and that the price point will be set purely by supply and demand. Finally, not to be outdone, CEO Daniel Ek was nowhere to be found. Management did not want to be flashy and felt that showing up to ring the bell, as tradition, would signal that the company is nearing the end instead of the beginning.The company was given an original reference point of $132 in the early trading hours. This essentially means nothing and is just used as a possible price level. With slightly over 178 million shares outstanding, this would have valued the company at $23.5 billion. The closest listed rival is Pandora (P), with a market cap of just over $1 billion. However, Spotify eventually hit the market for trading at $165.90 per share. A valuation of $29.5 billion.Spotify ended its first day of trading at $149.60 per share, giving the music streaming company a valuation of $26.6 billion; still higher than its reference price (up 13.3%), but lower than its listing price (down 9.8%).Spotify has been able to show impressive user growth in the past, growing from ~12 million MAUs in 2012, to ~140 million MAUs in 2017. This represents a 50% CAGR and is nothing to shy away from. Along with this, the subscriber base has also grown impressively, growing at a 59% CAGR between 2012 and 2017.As can be expected, revenues also increased over this period. In 2012, revenues were €430.3 million ($527.96 million). As of 2017, revenues were €4,090 million ($5,018.27 million). However, the company's net loss grows as the revenue grows, which is never good.This is because of royalty payments. Royalties are never easy to understand and music labels love it that way. In Spotify's F-1 it states:Because of this system, Spotify is essentially screwed into an ever-increasing net loss feedback loop. The only way to combat this is to either negotiate lower deals directly with music labels or to cut costs somewhere else. This is the main problem with music streaming services and it is why they are difficult to become profitable.Along the road, Spotify has also had some bumps. As of recently, there have been some notable lawsuits. In the January of 2018, Wixen Music Publishing sued Spotify for $1.6 billion. The allegations were that Spotify was streaming songs without a license and not paying out the royalties. This is nerve-racking for the company. If the allegations are true, the company managed to finish with a net loss while not paying out $1 billion in royalties.This isn't the first time that Spotify has had these allegations. In 2017, there were two lawsuits:Both of these cases dealt with Spotify streaming music without acquiring a license and both ended with a settlement to compensate affected musicians.A lot of investors like to compare Spotify to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), claiming that price/sales is a valid way to value this company. However, I do not see the relation other than each service allows users to stream the works of other people. Despite this, price/sales is valuable here to an extent. Because Spotify is yet to have earnings, it does make more sense to use sales to value the company. That being said, eventually the company needs to make positive earnings, otherwise, it is a terrible investment. Period.P P/S Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsUsing Netflix and Pandora (P), we can see that there is quite the gap in P/S ratios. At market open today, Spotify was trading at 7.21x sales. This is lower than Netflix but much higher than Pandora. I prefer to put more weight on the Pandora sales ratio because it is most similar (personal opinion). I think the shares would become fairly valued at around 4x sales. Another thing to remember is that Spotify is yet to turn a profit and doesn't look to turn one soon. If this company continues to be valued on anything other than earnings for a prolonged period of time, it is all hype.While Spotify is without a doubt one of the biggest names today, it doesn't mean that it is a good investment. With investors turning to sales to value the company due to the lack of earnings and the company falling below its listing price on day 1, people will hopefully realize soon that it is not worth $26 billion.In order for the company to be worth that much, they need to post earnings. This will be difficult as they need to overcome the shadow of royalties and lawsuits. The company may even expand into other areas of entertainment at which case, another review is needed. However, for now, it is not recommended to touch this stock at current price levels."
4160940,103480,2018-04-04T08:12:41-04:00,"Spotify debuted its long-anticipated IPO on April 3.The company's so-called ""direct listing,"" an IPO done largely without investment banks, threw some quirks into the process.The stock opened at $165.90 but spent much of the day facing downward price action, closing down 10% at $149.01.Spotify's Day 1 closing price indicates a market cap of $27.4 billion, representing 4.4x forward revenues.Spotify closed at a valuation far below what initial brokers' price targets (ranging from $200 to $225) had predicted.","The long-awaited IPO of Spotify (SPOT), the Swedish streaming music king, has finally come and passed. A success? The major news outlets, at least, seem to think so, with the New York Times publishing an article titled, ""Spotify's Wall Street Debut Is a Success"".As most observers are aware, Spotify's IPO went against convention by undergoing a ""direct listing"" - leaving only a minimum role for investment banks. Spotify did hire Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Allen & Co. to act as market-makers on the deal, but did away with much of the hoopla in a typical IPO - roadshows, order book-building, pricing, and even ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. It ended up paying its small consortium of banks on $36 million in fees, versus the typical ~7% in underwriting fees paid in a typical IPO. Snap (SNAP), which went public at a similar valuation to Spotify, paid its underwriters $85 million in fees.So in terms of defying Wall Street's traditional high-fee model and making investment bankers shake in their boots at the prospect of more unicorns avoiding the standard IPO process, Spotify's IPO certainly was a success. But whether or not it was a success for investors depends on how you look at it. Overall, Spotify's rather lackluster opening leaves the shares at a rather modest valuation that leaves much room for upside. Opportunist investors can certainly dive in now.One of the wrenches thrown into the mix of the Spotify deal was its use of a ""reference price"" in lieu of an IPO price. In a typical IPO - let's take Dropbox's (DBX) IPO last week for example - the Day 1 ""pop"" is calculated against the offering price at which shares were offered to institutional investors during the IPO. With Dropbox closing its first day of trading at $28.48, the press reported a 36% jump over its IPO price of $21.With Spotify, however, no IPO price exists because the company didn't sell any new shares to investors. The New York Stock Exchange thus used $132 as the ""reference price"" for Spotify.Shares opened at $165.90 past noon in New York, one of the latest opens in a recent IPO, and sank for much of the day. See Spotify's first-day chart below:SPOT Price data by YChartsShares closed at $149.01, and fell slightly further in after-hours trading to $148.62. Against Spotify's reference price of $132, the company certainly did well - a jump of 13%. But relative to the opening price, Spotify actually lost 10%.The reference price is obviously a good benchmark for Spotify's first-day performance - multiple news sources report that Spotify shares traded in the private market around $132-$137.50, so those buyers have certainly seen appreciation in their shares. But the actual trading activity during the opening day was clearly weighted toward sell orders.Price movements aside, where does this leave Spotify from a valuation standpoint - and should investors use the lackluster opening as a window to buy shares of one of the world's hottest internet companies?I covered Spotify's valuation in a prior article, back when we were all flying blind as to what price Spotify would ultimately trade at. Two brokerage firms have come out with price targets on the stock already, and more Wall Street firms are sure to follow soon - the first price targets were set at $200 and $225, indicating market caps of $36.8 billion and $41.4 billion, respectively - targets that Spotify clearly fell short of. While these price targets were optimistic, I'm more than confident that Spotify can surge past the $149 at which it's currently trading.At $149 per share and with 183.852 million shares outstanding, Spotify currently has a market cap of just $27.4 billion. Of course, we do have to take this number in context - in Spotify's last, most publicly visible share sale, it swapped shares with Chinese internet giant Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) for a rough valuation of $19 billion. So at the very least, this IPO is not a so-called down round.As a reminder, Spotify has taken the extra step of providing guidance for FY18, not a usual disclosure in IPOs:At the current exchange rate of $1.23 to the euro, Spotify's FY18 revenue guidance implies revenues of $6.03 to $6.52 billion. This puts Spotify's current market cap at a price/revenue multiple of 4.20x to 4.55x, or 4.38x at the midpoint.As Spotify is frequently referred to as the ""Netflix of Music,"" many observers feel Netflix (NFLX) is the closest trading comp to Spotify (relative valuation is probably the only yardstick we have here, as Spotify's cash flows are far too small at the moment to warrant a discounted cash flow or other cash flow/earnings-based valuation), though Netflix's higher gross margins (and thus, lower content costs - Spotify's gross margin of 21% in FY17 showed a 13-point deficit to Netflix's gross margin of 34%) do make its revenue streams more valuable to Spotify's.Netflix trades at 8.1x forward revenues, and plenty of other high-growth internet sector companies trade at equally high multiples:NFLX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsBased on revenue multiples alone, Spotify could still see an uptick in its valuation, though we do have to be wary of its gross margin deficit and the highly competitive nature of the music streaming space, versus a company like Facebook (FB) which virtually owns its market.At its $27.4 billion market cap, Spotify is also valued at $386 for each of its 71 million subscribers in FY17, and $291 for each of the 92-96 million subscribers it's expecting in FY18 (as seen in the guidance chart above). Considering each Premium subscriber brings in $120 of annual revenues, these aren't crazy user valuation metrics - and compares especially favorably against Netflix's valuation of $1,158 for each of its ~111 million subscribers.Spotify is also valued at $175 per MAU (monthly active user) for each of its 157 million actives in FY17, and $135 for each of the 198-208 million MAUs it expects in FY18. This in turn compares favorably against Facebook's value of $218 per MAU.Though basing Spotify's valuation on other internet companies - with different business models, growth trajectories, and margin profiles - isn't exactly a like-for-like comparison, relative valuation is likely the best yardstick we have while Spotify is in high-growth, high cash burn mode. After all, valuation is an imprecise art - especially when the target in question is a high-growth tech unicorn.Overall, I have my eye on a price target of 6x forward revenues for Spotify, implying a price target of $205, or 37% upside from current levels.There's certainly a lot of catalysts coming up for Spotify as it transitions to public company life - and in particular, we've never seen how Spotify performs during earnings season. Trading is highly likely to be choppy over the next few months, but this has been typical of internet sector IPOs of late. Stitch Fix (SFIX), for one, also got pummeled on its opening day, but is now up 22% from its offering price of $17. Late bloomers abound everywhere among unicorn IPOs - and just because Spotify slid downward ~10% from its opening price on Day 1 doesn't mean it can't make up for the losses in the near-term window.When looking at the company's valuation relative to peers, Spotify certainly has the numbers to back its $27.4 billion market cap. A 4.4x forward revenue multiple is an extremely reasonable valuation to pay in an otherwise heightened and richly valued tech market.While Spotify is a high-risk, high-reward play (as is every IPO), there's enough of a margin of safety in Spotify's valuation to warrant a buy. At the very least, keep a close eye on how Spotify shares continue to perform and look for timely entry points."
4160368,103480,2018-04-01T14:38:38-04:00,"Spotify is set to go public on April 3.Brokers have already published price targets in the range of $200-$225 per share.With 184 million shares outstanding, this implies an approximate market value of between $37-$41 billion, far higher than its last reported valuation of $19 billion.Without underwriters to stabilize the offering, Spotify's IPO is likely to be much more volatile than the typical IPO - either up or down.","It's not an understatement to say that Spotify (SPOT) is the most anticipated IPO of the year. The Swedish music streaming company, over the past several years, has risen to nearly one hundred million paying subscribers and has become one of the world's largest unicorns. In December of last year, Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) bought shares of Spotify at a reported valuation of $19 billion.Just seven unicorns are larger than Spotify at the moment, according to the definitive list from CBInsights. These include Uber ($68 billion), which has topped the chart for years; Didi Chuxing ($56 billion; and effectively ""China's Uber); Airbnb ($29.3 billion); and Palantir ($20 billion). With none of these companies signalling intentions for a public offering in the near future, Spotify is likely to be one of the highest profile deals for a long time.By now, most investors also know that Spotify's IPO is an unusual ""direct listing"" - meaning no investment bankers, no roadshow, no capital raise, and no set price for the deal. Supply and demand will determine where Spotify trades on its first day of trading, instead of IPO underwriters determining a price to fill the order book. As most are aware, the typical IPO sees a ""pop"" on Day 1 because underwriters artificially price a stock somewhat low in order to guarantee institutional investors a good return and generate the ""pop"" in the first place. Dropbox (DBX), for example, priced at $21 but opened for trading at $29 - a 40% pop.The bottom line for Spotify - without an artificially low starting price, and without investment bankers stabilizing the offering in either the up or down direction, Spotify could see far more volatility than the typical deal. With so many investors clamoring for a piece of the pie, having a feel for Spotify's valuation as it gyrates throughout its early life as a public company is of utmost importance.One of the benefits of a direct listing is that brokers aren't subject to a quiet period. RBC Capital Markets was first out of the gate with a $225 price target; other brokers have a target of $200. At the top end of that range, with 183.852 million shares currently outstanding, RBC implies a market value of $41.4 billion for Spotify - more than twice its most recent private valuation. At the moment, the $200-$225 mark is the only anchor the public has on Spotify's share price.Is this a reasonable target, or was it a number pulled out of a hat? Let's look at Spotify's valuation against three important metrics: revenue, subscribers, and MAUs.The easiest valuation comp for Spotify is also probably the least reliable. Revenue multiples are useful in evaluating SaaS IPOs because all the companies in the comp set typically have similar characteristics - high gross margins in the 70s-80s, and a mostly recurring revenue subscription base. But in the internet sector - particularly in Spotify's case - the revenue and margin profiles vary widely.Spotify recently released guidance for FY18 that called for €4.9-5.3 billion of revenue, or 20-30% y/y growth:Figure 1. Spotify guidanceSource: Spotify 6-K filingAt today's exchange rate of $1.23 to the euro, this implies a revenue range of $6.03 to $6.52 billion. Against the high price target of $225 ($41.4 billion market cap), this implies a price/revenue multiple of 6.6x.Since Spotify is primarily a subscription business (though free ad-supported users make up more than half of Spotify's MAUs, advertising revenues make up barely a tenth of its revenues - see the revenue breakdown below), it makes sense to compare its revenues against other internet subscription businesses. And since Spotify has earned a popular moniker as the ""Netflix of Music"", it makes sense to compare this valuation against Netflix (NFLX) itself.Figure 2. Spotify Premium vs. advertising revenueSource: Spotify F-1 filingThough Netflix has not formally issued FY18 revenue guidance, its CEO Reed Hastings has been quoted predicting $15 billion in revenues this year. Wall Street analysts, to be more specific, have a consensus revenue target of $15.82 billion (+34% y/y), as reported by Yahoo Finance.Against Netflix's current market cap of $128.17 billion, that's a price/revenue multiple of 8.1x. So certainly, RBC's target isn't too far out of left field. Do note, however, that Netflix had gross margins of 34% in FY17 - Spotify, only 21%. So in theory, Netflix's premium is justified by the fact that its revenue stream is worth more in gross margin dollars. Netflix's film content is expensive to acquire and produce - but Spotify's music licenses are even more so. Note also that Netflix's expected 34% growth rate is also higher than the top end of Spotify's growth range of 20-30%, despite being more than twice the scale, justifying even more of the premium.There's one more comparison that's apt to make, and that's against Pandora (P), Spotify's only real pure-play comp in the music streaming space. Pandora has a current bite-sized market cap at just $1.28 billion. Like Netflix, it hasn't formally issued FY18 revenue guidance, but Wall Street has a consensus of $1.51 billion in revenues for the year. This puts its price/revenue multiple at 0.9x.To be fair, Pandora is somewhat dying - a death inflicted by none other than Spotify. Its ad revenues are faltering, while growth in its subscription and ticketing revenues aren't enough to eke out more than flat y/y growth. But still, the valuation gap between Pandora's <1x multiple and Spotify's expected multiple above 6x is quite wide.We can also compare Spotify's valuation against its subscribers, comparing it to the subscription bases of the companies above. Since Spotify Premium's cost of $9.99 per month is equal to Pandora Premium and Netflix's monthly cost of $9.99, a comparison of the subscriber counts is apt, excluding the gross margin deltas discussed above. (We note also that Pandora has a streaming radio offering called Pandora Plus at $4.99 per month, but we'll consolidate this in the total here).Spotify is the only company to have issued subscriber guidance for FY18, so we'll use FY17's subscriber counts here. Here's a look at Spotify's historical growth in Premium subscriptions:Figure 3. Spotify Premium subscribersSource: Spotify F-1 filingBarring any pricing abnormalities, each Premium subscriber brings in $120 per year - so if this subscriber base experiences zero churn (historically, churn has been between 5-6%, though net adds have more than made up for it), a subscription base of 71 million users is worth $8.5 billion in annual recurring revenue. For FY18, we'll note also that Spotify is expecting 92-96 million Premium subscribers, up 30-36% y/y.Again using Spotify's top valuation mark of $41.4 billion as our starting point, Spotify has a market value per subscriber of $583, based on FY17 subscriber counts. When you think about the fact that each subscriber brings in $120 of annual revenue (not counting their month's free trial or churn), that's not too unreasonable.Netflix, on the other hand, had 110.64 million paid subscribers at the end of FY17. That comes out to a market value of $1,158 per subscriber - again, a large premium to Spotify.Pandora had 5.48 million paid subscribers (Plus and Premium) at the end of FY17, a measly amount compared to Spotify. That comes out to a market value of $234 per subscriber - but again, a large portion of Pandora's subscriber counts come from the lower $5/month Pandora Plus offering.One other comparison we can make - iQIYI (IQ), the so-called ""Netflix of China,"" just went public in the U.S. last week. Its current $10.99 billion market cap stacks up against 50.8 million paid subscribers, or $216 per subscriber.Finally, we can also gauge Spotify's valuation on a MAU basis, as many internet investors typically do. Using MAUs as the user metric rather than subscribers captures the value of Spotify's free tier users - though they don't generate as much revenue as the Premium listeners, they do contribute to Spotify's scale. Subscription businesses like Netflix don't report monthly active users, but other large internet companies like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) do.Spotify reported 157 million MAUs in FY17, as shown below:Figure 4. Spotify MAUsSource: Spotify F-1 filingUsing the same logic as above, a market value of $41.4 billion for Spotify would imply $264 per MAU. We'll note also that MAUs are expected to grow 26-32% y/y in FY18 to a range of 198-208 million.After the Cambridge Analytica outbreak, Facebook is left with a market cap of ""just"" $464.19 billion. The company reported 2.13 billion MAUs at the end of FY17, coming out to $218 per MAU. When considering that Facebook is already heavily saturated and its MAU growth rate of 14% y/y is much lower than Spotify's, this makes Spotify's per-MAU valuation appear reasonable.Twitter also is seeing rather flat MAU action. In FY17, it reported 330 million MAUs. Against a current market cap of $21.78 billion, that's $66 per MAU.The one other big internet company that reports similar user metrics is Snap (SNAP), though it reports in terms of daily active users (DAUs) instead of MAUs. DAUs, clearly, are much more valuable than MAUs - so it doesn't translate exactly into an apples-to-apples comparison. Snap had 187 million DAUs at the end of FY17 against a current market cap of $19.47 billion, or $104 per MAU.When using Netflix as an anchor for Spotify's valuation, a price range of $200-$225 doesn't seem all to unreasonable. At the top end of that range, a market cap of $41.4 billion for Spotify, though more than twice its most recent private valuation at $19 billion, is still less expensive than Netflix on a revenue or per-subscriber basis.We do have to take some common-sense cautions, however. Netflix's gross margins are substantially higher than Spotify's - theoretically making its revenue stream and subscriber base more valuable than Spotify. Netflix is also growing slightly faster and generates strong EBITDA.With Spotify's underwriter-free offering, volatility is bound to be accentuated. Keep an eye on Spotify's valuation and take care not to trade blindly."

The music industry -- and, more specifically, the cost curve per song -- has come a long way. This is partly due to the success of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT). Spotify has reshaped the music marketplace for users and artists. They leverage powerful data, analytics, and software to create a product that users love with an affordable subscription based model. By providing two tiers of service, Premiere and a free ad-supported version, Spotify was able to turn the industry on its head and lower the costs for all users.Spotify has taken things a step further and is now considered one of the best at suggesting new music to fans, while also providing artists a platform to monetize their creative projects. Using location and demographic data, Spotify gives artists a better and more thorough understanding of their fan base. They also provide artists with access to 157 million monthly active users, the highest of any other streaming service. Their upcoming IPO has been years in the making and represents a strategic decision to once again pivot the streaming industry. Before we explore Spotify's potential future business model, strategic plans, and value proposition for users, let's take a moment to understand Spotify's position in the industry today.Spotify is set to hold its direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3. Analysts estimate price targets of $160 to $220 per share and a market value of over $43 billion. That is 4x more than the last value set during private funding of $8.5 billion. Spotify has secured such funding and high price estimates for a number of reasons, one being their ability to carve out their place as the largest music streaming service available, with over 71 million paid subscribers and nearly 90 million more listening via their free ad-supported version.Their declining churn rates and large premium subscriber base illustrated below provides evidence of a narrow moat, attributed to high switching costs. Listeners don't want to exhaustively transfer over their playlists, relearn an entirely new piece of software, or spend weeks to months training this new piece of software on their listening habits and preferences. This moat helps Spotify retain subscribers and keep competitors at bay.Source: SEC Filing F-1/AApple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL) comes in at No. 2 with 38 million paying subscribers. Next is Amazon Music Unlimited (NASDAQ:AMZN) with 16 million paying subs, and then Pandora Media (NYSE:P) with 5 million total subs. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) does not release paid sub numbers, but Billboard magazine, citing an anonymous source, has reported YouTube Red's and Google Play Music's combined subscriber base at nearly 7 million.It's clear the Spotify wins the quantity debate, but how do they stack up in terms of quality?The fact that Spotify is the most popular music streaming service in the land is shocking. Especially when we consider that they were not the first service to penetrate this market. That honor belongs to Last.fm, Pandora, and Soundcloud. All of these were launched between 2002 and 2007, achieving various levels of success but eventually losing valuable momentum and subscribers after Spotify launched in 2008. Even more impressive is the sheer size of Spotify's current rivals. Amazon, Google, and Apple have a combined market capitalization of over $2 trillion and comprise the majority of the FAANG tech giants. Each of these behemoths sport huge balance sheets and a history of investments into Research and Development.The list of handicaps continue as we remember that Spotify does not sell any hardware to compliment their software. While Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Homepod all act as auxiliary pieces to support their respective music services (and other software components), Spotify is an agnostic application that can be used across a variety of devices, platforms, other applications, and non-handsets alike. Their most recent display of connectivity and versatility can be seen in their initiative with Cadillac. The odds are stacked high against Spotify, but there seems to be one clear explanation for why people prefer this service over their richer, more rigid, and (in some cases) older competitors -- it's better. Spotify simply creates a better product that is more user friendly and currently more popular than its competitors. We'll talk more about their competitive advantage below.Now that we understand what Spotify has done thus far to be crowned king of music streams, let's take a closer look at potential shifts in their business model and strategic plans by exploring the elephant in the room. Spotify's biggest pain point is their cash burn. They spent over $1 billion in the last three years, and more than $8 billion since their 2008 launch in royalties to artists, music labels, and publishers. For every $1 of revenue Spotify made, they paid out $0.70 in the form of royalty payments. In 2017, 87% of all streams consumed on Spotify were licensed to them under their agreements with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Merlin.Spotify has already begun exploring a short term solution to this issue, which includes renegotiation contracts with the three major labels. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek believes their relationship with these record labels is mutually beneficial and ending it would be mutually destructive. It is painfully clear that Spotify must lessen their dependence on the big three record labels in order to turn a profit for their shareholders. One way they could do this is to continue growing their footprint organically. As Spotify grows its subscriber base and becomes more popular, they could make up a larger percentage of the record label's revenues. This additional scale could allow them to leverage better royalty pricing in the future.Spotify could also reduce their dependence on music providers by diversifying beyond music. Podcasts, stand up comedy, and educational content are just a few growing segments Spotify could continue to explore. In May 2016, Spotify announced 12 new music-themed original programs that might pick up steam post IPO:Even though Spotify has gained traction with contract negotiations, allowing them to widen gross margins, it is ultimately still at the whim of the major record labels. However, I believe there is a much bigger plan in motion for Spotify on the horizon.Source: SEC FilingF-1/ASpotify has become an essential partner to both aspiring and established artists by enabling their music to be discovered. My theory is that Spotify will create their own record label to relieve pricing pressures from other labels. ""Spotify Records"" has a nice ring to it. By adopting the ""Netflix Original"" business model, which is essentially shifting to a company owned original content model, Spotify would cut royalty costs substantially. This is arguably the perfect time to lay the foundation for such a pivot in the music industry.Since more artists opt to bypass the traditional record deal route and pursue careers independently, Spotify is positioned well to offer exposure, freedom, and most importantly valuable fan data to them. This would be a win win for Spotify, allowing them to lower costs with record labels and strengthen collaboration with artists, while giving subscribers more options to discover new artists. Through a string of acquisitions we will discuss next, Spotify has established a wide suite of tools for artists to create content and be discovered like never before. This is a huge differentiator for Spotify.In 2017, Spotify acquired online music studio Soundtrap in an effort to attract artists directly. Soundtrap could be the most recent step in a strategic pivot into ""original content."" They provide artists with a platform to record projects directly with any device and connect them with a wide variety of loops and instruments. This could make it easier for artists to collaborate globally as well as release new music quickly. Another key reason ""Spotify Records"" would be a good idea revolves around its ability to predict personalized music suggestions. Many Users rely on Spotify to provide the soundtrack to their day, through editorially-curated playlists like RapCaviar or personalized machine-generated playlists like Discover Weekly, Daily Mix, or Release Radar. You may be surprised to learn that approximately 31% of all listening on Spotify is automatically programmed compared to less than 20% just two years ago. This is a huge part of their competitive advantage.Spotify acquired Artificial Intelligence startup Niland in 2017 and music intelligence company Echo Nest in 2014 to develop its music personalization and recommendation capabilities. Custom playlists like Release Radar and Discover Weekly have drawn in over 40 million new users to Spotify in just one year. Now imagine if Spotify used that same data and analytics to predict which artists would succeed in certain global markets? They could sign artists based on data and global trends and then suggest them to users that they know will like their music.Spotify has become the industry leader in music streaming with the most monthly active users and paying subscribers. They benefit from a switching cost moat and have been able to retain more premium subscribers over time. The biggest challenge facing Spotify is their high dependency on major record labels. In order to create value for investors, Spotify will need to find creative ways to spend less money or rapidly grow their user base. I believe creating their own record label is the most logical solution to this problem. Based on Spotify's acquisition history, I think this opinion will gain traction in the coming years."

Opportunities tend to exist when companies operate outside the normal methods of a developed market.Source: ReutersThe music streaming business is highly competitive and not historically very profitable. Pandora Media (P) still struggles and reports losses on a regular basis after being public for years now.Spotify changed the focus of the industry proving that music lovers would readily pay a subscription to stream music. The company has now built up a premium sub base that could approach 100 million by the end of the year.Source: Spotify F-1/A This large base still isn't profitable so Spotify needs to continue expanding paying members or figure out how to grow ad revenue. The company has forecast for MAUs to touch 200 million this year so the easy opportunity exists to convert those users. Long term, the company estimates a market opportunity approaching 3 billion smartphone users once expanding to new markets with some 1.3 billion smartphones in existing markets already payment enabled.While the strong base is nice, Spotify has to prove to the market how the company will ever turn a profit due to high content costs. Royalty rates regularly eat away at revenues with gross margins only approaching 25% this year.Revenues are already massive forecasted at €4.9-5.3 billion or roughly $6.3 billion. The company doesn't lack for scale, yet still forecasts an operating loss approaching $300 million for 2018.The market highly values recurring revenues and subscribers so value will ultimately exist here. Spotify expects to improve gross margins by around 300 basis points from 20.8% in 2017 to 24% in 2018. These margin gains at scale will boost the bottom line.Source: Spotify Investor Day 2018At a 30% gross margin in 2018, the 600 basis point improvements in gross profit would eliminate all of the operating losses. At 35%, Spotify will generate substantial profits.This all brings us to the direct listing opportunity. Bringing the stock directly to the NYSE on April 3 suggests the IPO may not have the traditional support of market makers and more shares available without the traditional six-month lockup of pre-IPO investors. Also, Spotify won't raise any cash to fund operations. The company though ended 2017 with roughly $1.5 billion on the balance sheet already.The company suggests that an incredible 91% of the outstanding shares will be available for trading from day one. Of the 178.1 million shares outstanding, 162.0 million will be available when Spotify begins trading on April 3. The reality though is that only stock options that aren't exercisable yet and a position by Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) obtained last year aren't available for immediate sell.One of the main reasons that traditional IPOs surge when going public is the limited float available along with the high public demand for shares. A lot of hot IPOs plunge around the six-month lockup as more share supply hits the market to satisfy investor demand that artificially inflated the stock.The opportunity in Spotify is that the stock isn't likely to see the inflated prices at the initial trading typical of a traditional IPO. Ultimately though, whether one wants to invest in the stock at initial trading is based on where Spotify trades.At previous trades in the private market, the stock trades close to a reasonable P/S multiple of 3.5x. Note that Netflix (NFLX) that offers a similar model for streaming premium video content trades at 8x 2018 sales estimates after a market route in the tech sector. The table below provides examples of the P/S multiple based on trading price.Source: Stone Fox Capital MKM and RBC have already issued price targets of $200 and $220, respectively. Both prices appear reasonable based on the subscriber base and revenue streams.The key investor takeaway is that where Spotify trades based on the direct listing concept is widely unknown. A discount is possible if enough shares are sold. Investors should watch to see if the low end of the stock prices in the above table are reached providing a solid opportunity to own the leading streaming music provider at close to 4x forecasted sales."

The Swedish streaming service instead plans to do a direct listing of its stock. Employees and investors will be able to sell shares on public markets, but the company itself will not be raising any new capital.The lack of a traditional IPO process makes it much harder to predict where shares will trade initially. It doesn't help that shares changed hands at prices ranging from $37.50 to $125 in 2017, according to Spotify's F-1.To help investors sort through the confusion, we will present three different proposed valuations for Spotify based on three different scenarios of growth and profitability. We will also explain the strategic challenges the company faces that make the pessimistic scenarios more likely and make the stock this week's Danger Zone pick.The biggest challenge Spotify faces is simple. It doesn't own the music that consumers listen to on its platform. Instead, it licenses the music from major record labels. The ""Big 3"" record labels - Universal Music, Sony Music (NYSE:SNE), and Warner Music - along with Merlin, which represents a large number of independent artists, accounted for more than 85% of all streams in 2017.The oligopolistic nature of the music business gives the record labels a significant amount of leverage in negotiations with Spotify. All the major labels have ""most favored nations"" provisions in their contracts, which means Spotify cannot give more favorable terms to one label without extending those same terms to all the others. In essence, Spotify has to negotiate with the major labels as a unified block.As Figure 1 shows, Spotify managed to negotiate better rates with the labels in 2017, which helped its gross margins improve from 14% to 21%. However, that increase comes with a significant caveat. The major labels all have significant equity positions in Spotify, and they had an incentive to help the company go public faster in order to avoid triggering clauses in its convertible debt that would have diluted their equity. The labels won't have this same incentive to grant more favorable terms when terms are renegotiated in 2019.Figure 1: Revenue and Gross Margins for Spotify Since 2015Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsSpotify has targeted long-term gross margins of 30-35%, but the company may find it difficult to achieve that level of profitability as long as it has to negotiate against a highly consolidated group of content owners. We expect that the content owners will always aim to maximize their profits on the content. Accordingly, any time they see Spotify as making too much money, they will raise their prices and compress Spotify's margins.Increased competition from other streaming services, especially Apple Music (AAPL), should also decrease Spotify's leverage in the future. Although Spotify remains the largest player in the global streaming music market, its competitors are catching up.A recent report in The Wall Street Journal found that Apple Music has been growing paid subscribers at a monthly rate of 5% versus just 2% for Spotify. At current growth rates, Apple Music will overtake Spotify in terms of paying U.S. subscribers sometime this summer, even as Spotify still has nearly double the number of paying users globally.Apple Music is the most notable competitor, but Spotify also faces pressure from Amazon Music (AMZN), Google Play Music, and YouTube Music (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Pandora (P). If Spotify ever gets too aggressive in its negotiations with record labels, the content owners can always threaten to walk away and just let consumers access their music through these other services.In addition, Apple, Google, and Amazon can all afford to treat their streaming services as loss leaders to draw users into their platforms. As long as customers buy more HomePods and iPhones, Apple doesn't care if it makes money on the streaming service itself. As a result, these competitors can easily absorb less favorable terms than Spotify, which eventually needs to earn a profit.Increased competition has also forced Spotify to lower its prices for consumers. The company's average revenue per user has declined from €6.84 in 2015 to €5.32 in 2017 as it promotes its ""Family Plan"" that allows several users to share one account. The lower price helps Spotify retain users but puts more pressure on its margins.Given that all the major streaming services have fairly comprehensive libraries, the only way Spotify can build a competitive advantage is through music curation and discovery. The company has made a big push to build hyper-specific playlists in order to differentiate itself from the competition, but it remains to be seen if this feature can be a true difference maker.Even if Spotify can achieve its gross margin goals without losing more ground to its competitors, the company's rising operating costs make profitability difficult. As Figure 2 shows, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative costs have all grown faster than revenue over the past two years.Figure 2: Costs Growing Faster than RevenueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFigure 2 actually understates the issue for Spotify, as general and administrative expense was artificially decreased by a €12 million reversal of its provision for doubtful accounts. When we account for non-operating items, general and administrative expense actually increased by 55% in 2017 rather than the reported 51%.These numbers make a path to profitability seem especially difficult for Spotify, as it will need to rein in operating expenses as well as improve gross margins.The issues presented above are understood by many participants in the market, which is why the bull case for Spotify often revolves around the company's ability to become the ""Netflix of Music."" Just like Netflix (NFLX) has invested heavily in original content, Spotify bulls see potential for the company to thrive by owning its own music rights, in essence becoming a label itself.We see two big problems with this plan. First, developing original content is expensive. Netflix spends an extraordinary amount of money on original content to attract new users. It also pays significantly more than traditional media companies to attract new employees. Those high costs are an unavoidable part of trying to break into a consolidated industry, and they've kept Netflix's margins fairly low.If Spotify wanted to take on the labels in this fashion, it would need to raise a significant amount of capital. Instead, the company has gone out of its way to go public in a manner that does not raise any money. We can't know what Spotify executives are thinking, but they certainly don't seem to be making a push to own their content.It's probably a good thing for Spotify that they're taking this path. While Netflix's push into original content has been challenging, it might be all but impossible for Spotify, simply because a successful music streaming service needs to be nearly universal. Streaming video users may be willing to subscribe to multiple services, but most music listeners want their music all in one place so they can create customized playlists and switch between songs at any time.Netflix's push into original content caused Disney (DIS) to pull its movies from the service. What would happen to Spotify if, say, Universal Music pulled all its artists? How viable is a service without current stars like Katy Perry and Kanye West or classic artists like Johnny Cash and Queen? Spotify knows that if it makes a serious move to compete with the record labels, it can cripple its business in a stroke.We don't think Netflix is the best business comparison for Spotify (not that it should necessarily want to be compared to Netflix). A more fitting comparison for the streaming music business is the movie theater industry. Consider these similarities:The similarities are striking, and they suggest that the profit potential for Spotify is limited. Looking at the three movie theater companies for which we have data - Regal Entertainment (NYSE:RGC) and Cinemark Holdings (CNK)-neither has earned a return on invested capital (ROIC) above 8% at any point in its history[1]. It's hard to earn significant profits just by distributing other people's content.Additionally, it's hard to build a sustainable moat through the distribution of content, especially when the means of distribution constantly change. Movie theaters have seen their business model disrupted by on-demand services, and Spotify could see its model similarly disrupted in the future. Over the past few decades, the primary method of listening to music has gone from vinyl records, to cassette tapes, to CDs, to MP3s, and now to streaming music. It's hard to predict what will come next, but it's naïve to assume that streaming music will be the end of this evolutionary chain.To be fair, there are significant differences between the movie theater business and the streaming music industry. Streaming services require much less capital than a movie theater. On the other hand, the recorded music industry is also much smaller than the movie industry. Global recorded music revenue totaled ~$16 billion in 2016, while movie revenues were more than double that at $39 billion. Spotify may be able to achieve a higher level of profitability than movie theaters, but its scale is limited by the relatively small size of its industry.Like Dropbox (DBX) and Snapchat (SNAP) before it, Spotify plans to go public with a dual-class share structure that will leave its founders with total control over the company. Investors get no say over executive compensation practices, acquisitions, or any other major strategic initiatives that normally fall to shareholder votes.Spotify's reluctance to give outside investors a say in the company also raises questions about its decision to pursue a direct listing rather than an IPO. The company claims to be cutting out the bankers, but it still plans to pay $30 million in advisory fees to several investment banks to manage the deal, so it's not clear that there's an economic advantage.Instead, the goal of this direct listing seems to be minimizing dilution for the founders of the company. They avoid triggering dilutive clauses in the convertible bonds and give employees and investors liquidity without having to dilute their own stakes. Spotify's founders seem more interested in retaining their control and stake in the company than in maximizing the long-term value of the business.Spotify's corporate structure hurts one of the big bull cases for the stock, which is an acquisition from a larger company that would fold its service into a comprehensive ecosystem. Spotify's founders clearly don't want to give up control of the company, and with its dual-class structure, they can veto any acquisition offer.The outsize power of Spotify's founders shows up in its executive compensation practices as well. CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek does not take a salary but receives annual bonuses based on certain performance targets. For 2017, his targets were:Even though the company failed to hit the third target, the board decided to award Ek the full bonus anyway. Investors may not like a company rewarding its executives for missing their targets, but they won't have any say when it comes to Spotify.Given all these concerns, what should investors be willing to pay for Spotify? We'll run through three different profitability and growth scenarios to assign a range of potential valuations:Due to all the concerns discussed in this article, we believe the first two scenarios are more likely, and they show that Spotify is probably not worth the $19 billion ($107/share) it has reportedly been valued at over the past few months.Note that all our valuation scenarios factor in two significant hidden liabilities that impact SPOT's valuation:Combined, these two items equal $1.5 billion, about 8% of the rumored $19 billion market cap.This scenario assumes that Apple Music and other services continue to grow rapidly and challenge Spotify. As a result, Spotify grows slower than expected and struggles to earn significant economic profit as the content owners have all the leverage in the relationship.If Spotify grows revenue by 10% compounded annually over the next decade and earns an ROIC just under 10%, it's worth ~$14/share today, an 87% downside from the rumored opening price of $107/share.For comparison, Spotify's current ROIC is -79%. Its revenue growth slowed from 52% in 2016 to 39% last year, and the company projects slower growth of 20-30% in 2018 with further deceleration expected over time.Assuming its customer pricing model does not change, Spotify would have 158 million paying users if this scenario came true.In this scenario, we assume Spotify emerges as the clear winner among the various streaming services. The company grows revenue at a rate of 15% compounded annually for the next decade. In this scenario, Spotify's revenue of $19.4 billion in year 10 of the model, or 2028, is 24% higher than the entire recorded music industry in 2016, so we're predicting that it controls most of the music industry and the industry grows significantly.In this scenario, Spotify's margins would still be constrained by the content owners, but its scale would give it more leverage. We assume Spotify can earn NOPAT margins of 8%, just slightly below the median of the 67 media companies we cover. Due to its relatively light capital requirements, it would earn an ROIC of 21%. In this scenario, SPOT is worth $78/share today, 27% below the rumored opening price.Assuming its customer pricing model does not change, Spotify would have 246 million paying users if this scenario came true. If the ratio of paid to free users stays the same, the company would have 545 million total users.In this scenario, Spotify successfully pushes out the record labels and takes ownership of all its content. Its revenue and user growth over the next decade is the same as the consolidation scenario, but it now has the ability to earn a long-term NOPAT margin of 16%, on par with a successful content creator like Disney.In this scenario, SPOT earns an ROIC of 43%, which would put it in the top 3% of all S&P 500 companies and is worth $185/share today, 74% above the current stock price. Investors need to believe in this wildly optimistic scenario to buy into SPOT.Notably, even this bullish scenario does not reach the $200 and $220 price targets already put out by sell-side analysts. As with Snapchat and other highly touted IPOs, investors should be wary of sell-side price targets based on dubious math.We believe a fair value for Spotify probably lies somewhere between the first two scenarios. Once the stock begins trading publicly, there are plenty of issues that could send shares down into this range, including:Longer term, Spotify will need to renegotiate its licensing agreements in 2019, and an unfavorable outcome then would be a significant negative for the stock.Our Robo-Analyst technology[2] enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to the financial statements in Spotify's F-1:Income Statement: we made $2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of removing $447 million in non-operating expense (9% of revenue). We removed $782 million related to non-operating income and $1.2 billion related to non-operating expenses. See all the adjustments made to SPOT's income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $2.8 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $752 million. The most notable adjustment was $1.7 billion (112% of reported net assets) in excess cash. See all adjustments to SPOT's balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $3.2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by $162 million. The excess cash was mostly offset by the off-balance sheet debt and the employee stock option liability referenced above.This article originally published on April 2, 2018.Disclosure: David Trainer, Sam McBride, and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.[1] Research shows that ROIC is the primary driver of valuation.

4160205,101421,2018-03-30T12:51:56-04:00,Spotify intends to list its shares in a U.S. IPO.The firm will directly sell existing shareholder shares via the NYSE; it will receive no proceeds from the listing.SPOT is growing top-line revenue a slower rate but is showing increased gross margin as it transitions to a more mature and sustainable growth trajectory.,"Spotify's (SPOT) direct listing IPO is scheduled to begin trading Tuesday, April 3, 2018, according to its most recent F-1/A registration statement.SPOT provides listeners with streaming music and podcast entertainment via its popular global platform.The firm's business model is a combination of both advertising-supported streaming and premium subscription revenue-based access.Management is pursuing a direct listing through the NYSE, bypassing traditional IPO processes that are mediated by underwriters and bookrunners.This will allow the firm to sell (transfer) ordinary shares from existing shareholders directly to the public using the NYSE as an ostensible market maker.The firm will receive no proceeds from the sale of shares, and the total number of shares to be sold is not a set figure.The advantages of this type of issuance are that the firm can avoid lengthy roadshows and underwriter expenses while presumably making its shares available to a wider swath of investors. Management believes this is a fairer approach as well as dovetailing conveniently with its desire to reach as many users in the lucrative U.S. market.The disadvantages of this approach are that although the NYSE will act as the transfer agent for the shares, there will be no market stabilization capabilities which are typically undertaken by traditional IPO bookrunners and underwriters. Additionally, initial price discovery will be more uncertain, since bookrunners typically provide management with investor feedback on pricing during the typical pre-IPO roadshow.Spotify's management has more recently published its financial outlook for Q1 and full year 2018.Notably, the firm forecasts full-year 2018 total revenue growth of between 20% and 30%. If SPOT achieves this growth rate, it will represent a further slowing of top-line revenue growth rates from previous years, as the recap below indicates:(Source: F-1 and IPO Edge)Additionally, management expects the euro to fall against the dollar during 2018, as evidenced by its statement, 'We anticipate changes in foreign exchange rates will have a negative impact of approximately EUR260-300 million for the full year.'That is a fairly significant impact, approximately 5.8% reduction in top-line revenue since its full-year guidance midpoint is EUR5.2 billion.On a positive note, Gross Margin is expected to be in the range of 23-25%, which would represent a continued improvement compared to previous years shown below:In addition to the uncertainty caused by a lack of proposed pricing range with Spotify's direct listing approach, the risk to SPOT investors is overall market volatility as shown in the VIX chart below:(Source: StockCharts)After a quiet 2017, overall market volatility has risen markedly since the end of January, owing to a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.Volatility is the enemy of a smoothly functioning IPO market as it makes valuing new issues, which tend to be riskier, more difficult.Additionally, SPOT's direct listing on Monday, April 3, will come immediately after a long Easter weekend with no trading in most U.S. markets on the previous Friday due to holiday observance. This dynamic may cause greater volatility in SPOT share prices during early trading.Using a wider lens, management has admitted that it expects initial trading to have the potential to be more volatile:(Source: SPOT F-1/A)Since management hasn't provided a proposed price range for the direct listing and due to the uncertainty of the direct listing process itself, coming to a firm opinion on valuation can be tricky.The firm has provided a recent history of its share price activity in private, secondary markets in 2017, as the table below shows:(Source: Spotify F-1/A)Notably, the December 2017 price indicated more than double the price in February 2017. I find this change difficult to fathom on a fundamentals basis, as it is unlikely that the value of the firm's underlying business more than doubled in value in only ten months.I wonder if the price run-up was more a function of expectations of an IPO in the near future driving demand for short-term 'flip' opportunities by late-stage institutional investors.If so, that potential short-term speculation aspect, combined with the fact that there are no lockups requiring existing shareholders to avoid selling into the direct listing (not including TME and Tencent shareholders), could result in significant downward pricing pressure in the hours or days immediately following the IPO.In fact, management has outlined this very scenario in its filing:As to valuation, I will take this opportunity to defer to a valuation expert, NYU Stern professor Aswath Damodaran. His detailed analysis puts the full value per share at $115.31.Damodaran highlights the main points of SPOT's financial metrics, namely slowing revenue growth, decreased content costs but increased other costs such as R&D, Selling & Marketing and G&A.Below is his valuation worksheet where he comes to a value of EUR93.40 ($115.31) per share:(Source: Aswath Damodaran)On one aspect, I disagree with his assumption about SPOT's future revenue mix shifting to a more subscription-based model.I believe that it will shift to a more advertising-based model since its largest penetration to-date has been in the developed, wealthy nations who can afford subscriptions. Future market expansion will include less-developed regions which are more price-sensitive and, in my view, will stay with the free, ad-supported version rather than pay for avoiding commercials.Expected trade date: Tuesday, April 3, 2018."

Indeed, streaming has turned the music industry around. From Spotify's F-1/A, it presented some enlightening facts. It's a good time to be an artist.By focusing on the artist, and the end listener, Spotify has been able to become a dominant player in a crowded market. Its competition is formidable. It competes with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - just to name a few. Yeah, those guys. But somehow, they are thriving. I have to give a big thumbs up on that effort. Paying out €8 billion in royalties? I suppose it's only fitting that Sean Parker is still on the scene, investing $15 million in Spotify in 2010, and currently serves on the board.Spotify's revenue has passed 4 billion euros annually, and although margins are not exceptional, there is an eventual path to profitability.This is where things get a little weird. You see in the old days, companies would go public on a stock exchange to raise capital to fund their businesses. It's tough to build railroads and power plants. It's capital intensive work. Tapping into the capital markets, in exchange for the future profits and cash flows of the business, is a hallmark of the capital markets system.But that's not what this is. With Spotify, it claims it doesn't need any money. Indeed, no proceeds from this offering are going to the company. It is simply listing existing shares held by company insiders. And who does it want to sell these shares to? - you my friend. Sold to YOU. This is a cash-out. From insiders to you.Sure - but it's the unusual process that Spotify is taking with this offering that creates an atypical short-term risk. It acknowledges this risk in its F1-A.Below is a simple diagram of a normal underwriting process.(Source)Steps 1 and 2, in this case, are not so important. What's now lacking is steps 3, 4, and 5.Normally, companies go on a bit of charade prior to an offering, where they do ""road shows"" to drum up institutional and client support. In a lot of cases, these are more of a formality. If you want a great explanation of the price discovery process, James Cramer opines in great detail in his 2002 book, Confessions of a Street Addict - There's a good portion of it here. What's important is no investment bank wants to be known as the guys who brought the last GeoCities to market.But most important is point #4 and #5. This is stabilization and transition. In an underwriting process, there are over allotments of shares. These shares are for the investment bank and market makers to provide stability to the market prior to the transition phase. Further, and more important, is many shares are restricted for sale. These are the infamous ""lockup"" periods that many investors discuss.In this case - there is no price stability and no lockup on a majority of the shares…The company lists this risk specifically in its F1-A filing.No underwriters - no price discovery, and other than Tencent (OTCPK:TCTZF) and TME - there are NO LOCKUP periods. Don't take it from me - take it from Spotify.Also, directly from the F1/A. ""The public price of our ordinary shares may be volatile, and could, upon listing on the NYSE, decline significantly and rapidly.""Couldn't have said it better myself, Spotify. Currently, only 9.1% of all outstanding shares are subject to selling restrictions.I really don't care for the recent trend in voting rights of shares. Seems founders nowadays feel compelled to ensure they don't get removed, while still enjoying the luxury of selling their ownership. Spotify has issued ""Beneficiary certificates"" and may issue more (up to 20 for each ordinary share) to ensure that Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon have total control over the company.Per the F1/A,And,Well, don't say they didn't warn us.For a company with a near $30 billion market cap, a long way from GAAP profitability, and an unusual short-term risk, I will be avoiding shares of Spotify. I do commend its vision and progress, but this ""offering"" being nothing more than a cash out to the public just does not seem a good risk/reward at these prices. Who is going to step in when employees are looking at the cash boon? Who is going step up coverage and promote the stock? You can come to your own conclusions, but I'll sit this price discovery stage out for now. Thanks, and good luck in the markets today."

        There is an implicit dual-class share structure in the company, allowing concentration of control in the hands of its co-founders;
        With no new share issues, the fact that insiders are the sole sellers in this IPO is a cause for concern;
        At the same time, co-founders may magnify their voting rights by 20 times their number of shares at any time.","Spotify’s (SPOT) IPO is interesting on several counts: it is a long-anticipated filing, has an interesting share structure, and, unlike any other tech unicorns, plans to list its shares directly on the stock exchange. With all these features, I could not resist the temptation to value Spotify.Spotify is a technology company, operating in a recorded music industry’s sub-sector, known as “streaming music” industry. SPOT has been pivotal in reversing the decade-long decline in music revenues by revolutionizing the way music is distributed to and consumed by listeners (though it was not the very first company to “stream” music, it has been the most successful one to utilize the potential). The graph below is an eye-opening manifestation of this phenomenon:Source: IFPIAs can be seen, total music industry revenues declined from $23.8bln in 1999 to $16.9bln in 2008. However, when Spotify launched its service in 2008, not only did total music revenues levelled off, but there has been a remarkable transformation within the industry, with the emergence of the digital layer, in general, and a streaming service, in particular, which has been growing at a 5-year CAGR of almost 48%, according to IFPI. Unsurprisingly, the growth in the popularity of streamed music among the consumers has spawned a vast number of competitors all around the world (for country-specific list of music streaming service providers, check here), ranging from local players (Pandora) to those operating on a global scale (Spotify, Amazon Music, Google Play Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Soundcloud, Tidal, etc.).Obviously, while the growing music streaming industry is good news for Spotify, the emergence of an array of competitors – especially such deep-pocketed ones as Apple, Amazon, and Google – creates headwinds in terms of potential market share, margins, and even the viability in the long-run. Pricing, brand value, and auxiliary services play a pivotal role as competing factors in any industry, and in the music streaming market these three factors determine the number of subscribers, in general, and the number of premium subscribers, in particular, that a market participant has.Notably, pricing is not the major competing force, at least among the leading streaming services and across the various (and quite similar) plans offered:Source: pricing adapted from companies’ websitesFrom the information presented above on some of the largest and global players in the industry, it is interesting to point out that not only do these players provide similar plans but also identically priced ones. It follows then, that Spotify has been able to create a high value for its brand, which is capable of, at least for now, being at the forefront of its well-established contenders. In turn, SPOT’s leading position is reflected in the highest number of both monthly average users (MAUs) and premium members in the industry (to compare, Apple is reported to have 38mln premium members as of March, 2018; Amazon Music has 16mln, and Pandora 5.48mln).The F-1/A (p.11) excerpt below provides three-year SPOT data on MAUs and premium and add-supported users:Source: company’s F-1 filingAn astute reader may have noticed that premium and ad-supported users do not add up to MAUs. Apparently, the reason lies in the way the company defines each group. According to the filing, the following definitions apply (emphasis added by the author):Since ad-supported users are defined similar to MAUs, there is something “wrong” with the Premium Users group. In fact, as emphasized above, Spotify, for some reason, continues to include users who failed to pay subscription fees (churn rate) within the premium group for up to 30 days. Given that these users are no longer premium-revenue-generating users, I have adjusted the figures for cancelled subscriptions (with any variation due to rounding):Source: Author's calculations based on F-1 dataWith these corrected figures on churn-adjusted premium users, there is one troubling fact worthy of an attention. According to the company’s filing (F-1/A, p.134), the CEO and founder Daniel Ek does not receive any base salary starting from July 1, 2017 but qualifies for a $1mln bonus, upon satisfying certain conditions. For 2017, those conditions were:On the face of it, the company has successfully met this last condition, with an official figure being 71mln. Despite two out of three satisfied milestones, the board still determined to pay the full $1mln cash bonus to SPOT co-founder. However, as mentioned earlier, a better measure is churn-adjusted premium subscribers’ figure of 67mln. It appears, then, the hit rate of a mere 33% makes board's decision to pay a $1mln cash bonus questionable.Unfortunately, questionable actions on the part of the company do not end, once “Principal Shareholders” section of the F-1/A statement is considered:Source: SPOT’s F-1/A, p.148As can be seen, the company issued beneficiary certificates (BCs), which “carry no economic rights and …provide the holders of such certificates additional voting rights” (F-1/A, p.155); they are also non-transferable and are automatically cancelled, once shares to which they are linked to get sold or transferred. The existence of BCs implies that SPOT essentially has a dual-class share structure, with one-vote shares being offered for sale to the public (let them be called Class A shares), Class B shares having around four votes per share issued for Daniel Ek (see table below in the next paragraph for the calculation logic), and 10-vote Class C shares for Martin Lorentzon (again, see table below), resulting into a total voting power of 80.5% concentrated in the hands of Spotify co-founders as of March 14, 2018. Furthermore, the company retains the right to issue to its co-founders more BCs in the future at a ratio of between one and 20 BCs per share for an amount of up to 1,027mln (total authorised amount of 1,400mln (F-1/A, p.46) less total number of already issued BCs indicated in the table above) – all at the discretion of the Board, which co-founders are the members of and have an influence in the composition.Separately, but no less troubling, is the unusual way this IPO is carried out – direct listing. Unlike traditional IPOs, whereby shares are underwritten by investment banks, direct listing implies a designated market maker (DMM) will build a book of buy-sell orders and set the price level such that the market is cleared. In the case of Spotify, the company intends to issue no new shares, hence it is the insiders who are the sole sellers in this offering. According to the updated prospectus (F-1/A, front page), Spotify intends to register 55.73mln shares, with most of them being offered for sale by the company’s two co-founders – Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon (F-1/A, p.146). With that in mind, I have re-calculated the percentage of ownership, assuming all registered shares are sold:Source: Author's calculations based on F-1 dataNote that in computing total votes after sale, I have adjusted for BC cancellation (upon underlying ordinary share sales) by maintaining the ratio at pre-sale level. As can be seen, the total voting power in the hands of the two co-founders after the IPO will be around 53% - still, a majority ownership but less solid than before (though still subject to new BC issuance in the future of up to 20 BCs per share, as specified earlier). Also note that Daniel Ek's share of the pie will increase from 37% pre-IPO to 46% post-IPO (assuming all registered shares are sold), because total number of votes will fall proportionately more than the number of Mr. Ek's votes (owing to the fact that Mr. Lorentzon's shares for sale comprise almost half of the total registered amount and, more importantly, because of his BCs being tied-up to shares at a higher ratio than those of Mr. Ek (9 versus 3)).In its Free Writing Prospectus (p.11), dated March 15, 2018, Spotify explained that primary reasons for direct listing included high cash balance of €1.5bln and no desire to dilute existing shareholders to raise money the company did not need. While there may be nothing inherently wrong or misleading in this statement, the very fact that no new shares are issued and that insiders are the sole sellers in this IPO (and Mr. Lorentzon’s percentage of ownership potentially becoming marginally negligible at 6% (if all registered shares under his name are sold, as seen in the table above)) sets some alarm bells ringing.All-in-all, the concern spectrum ranges from early exit to no-exit, but ultimate and full control. And the latter is no better than the former.Having set the stage and drawn an attention on one of the most questionable aspects of this IPO, I will value Spotify in part two and provide arguments on some possible complications for potential investors."
4159505,101442,2018-03-28T09:22:09-04:00,"Spotify operates in a highly competitive streaming music industry, with cash giant Apple Music seen in a rear-view mirror;
        High bargaining power is key to improve gross margins in the near-term;
        Potential to become record label itself is a way to lift gross margins further in the longer-term;
        In terms of risk, Spotify will have above-average WACC, given its young growth status;
        In terms of reinvestments, there are minimal requirements, given the scalability of the already deployed platform.","In part 1 of this two-piece series, I have put forward the analysis on the industry Spotify (SPOT) operates in, the rationale of why the company’s IPO is unusual and, more importantly, some of the ensuing intricacies surrounding it (starting with the need to adjust premium users’ figures, the questionable decision to pay cash bonus to a CEO, and implicit dual-class share structure).Having set the stage, I will now move on to translating these facts into a formal DCF valuation. The narrative that will drive the valuation of Spotify is that of a technology company, operating in the blossoming but highly competitive music streaming industry. In the short-term, SPOT’s ability to improve gross margins and maintain and expand premium user-base will largely depend on both keeping an attractive price structure and a bargaining power with streaming rights holders; in the long-term, however, as the industry matures, total user growth slows, but user-base in absolute terms reaches impressive levels, Spotify will be a record label itself for under-served, under-the-radar artists seeking vast audience exposure, allowing the company to improve gross margins further (since it will not have to pay royalty fees on songs it is the label for). In terms of risk and reinvestment, Spotify, as a young growth company, will have above-average risk level in the short-term and will require minimal reinvestments, given the scalability nature of its platform.It is worth pointing out that since the ADRs to be listed by SPOT will be USD-based, all the base year EUR-denominated figures are to be restated at the then prevailing exchange rates, as disclosed by the company’s filing. Consequently, the valuation assumptions (such as the growth rate, risk-free rates, and WACC) will be USD-denominated to preserve currency consistency. Additionally, any euro-based forecasts will be translated into USD by applying the purchasing power parity (NYSE:PPP) in the following way: self-reported EURUSD exchange rate of 1.2005 at the end of 2017 times an expected inflation differential between USD and EUR of 2.1% (TIPS- and T-Note-derived) and 1.5%, respectively, compounded by the number of forecast periods (for a 5-year period, that would implyWithout any further ado, I hereby provide the major assumptions I made and the logic behind each one of them:Source: SPOT’s F-1/A and author’s calculationsThe first set of assumptions include churn-adjusted premium and ad-supported ARPU figures of €5 and €0.5, respectively (conservatively close to those at the end of December, 2017), which are then annualized by simply multiplying by 12. By further assuming SPOT will have 50% of premium users in five years (only 8 percentage points higher than December-end figure), about 2bln payment-enabled smartphones (up 29% from 1.7bln, F-1/A, p.2), and 25% streaming market penetration rate (a guesstimate, up from 15%, computed as:penetration rate = ($4,600/1.0517)/(1,008*[37%*€73.82+(1-37%)*€4.08]),the global streaming industry size can be estimated to be €18.1bln:(2,193*25%) * (50%*€60 + (1-50%)*€6) = €18.1(given high uncertainty around each of the assumptions herein, I will correct for that later on by applying Monte Carlo simulation). Given a 50% market share assumption (up from 42%, as reported by Spotify for the year-end 2016, F-1/A, p.3), potential revenue is about €9bln, or $11.2bln (estimated as €9bln times PPP-based exchange rate, as mentioned above, of 1.2123). Given this figure, an assumed 5-year CAGR of revenues is 18%, followed by a gradual decrease to 2.9% (10-year T-Note rate) in year 10;Since reinvestments do not end after year 10, it is essential to make an assumption for that as well. Given that the sustainable growth rate is computed as:Sustainable growth = ROIC * reinvestment rateAnd assuming that this rate during the terminal period is equal to 2.9% (10-year Treasury rate), with an ROIC of 12% (which assumes the company will be able to sustain its competitive advantage in the long-term in excess of the terminal period WACC), the reinvestment rate in the terminal period can be calculated as:Reinvestment rate = 2.9% / 12% = 24.17%;The equity component was calculated using the risk-free rate of 2.9%, ERP (geographically weighted by sales) of 5.9% and a levered bottom-up beta of system and application software companies of 1.14. The pre-tax debt component was computed as a ratio of a lease expense and operating leases outstanding:Consequently, the beginning WACC of 9.47% will be linearly adjusted down during the remaining five years to a terminal rate of 8.24%.Apart from these major assumptions, I also assumed the following:The table below presents the model output results: Given the direct listing approach, the computed value of $66 is nothing to be compared to. Looking at the historical private transactions, does not provide any solid background either, given a wide variation in price (for example, the March private trading activity shows a price range of $48.93-$131.88, as per F-1/A filing on page 173).With much uncertainty around the input, I conducted the Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions:Note that the near-term cost of sales (CoS) margin for SPOT in the minimum scenario is highly achievable soon (Q4'2017 figure was 77% and FY2018 target is 75% (6-K, EX-99.1)) and that the long-term target CoS margin was computed as a simple average;Incorporating these distributions into a Monte Carlo simulation, with 100,000 iterations, the following output is generated:From the percentiles table to the right of the distribution shown above, we can see that the median value is $74 per share and that there is a 30% chance Spotify’s value lies above $100, given my distribution assumptions.Spotify’s IPO is unusual on several counts, namely the way it is structured (direct listing) and implemented (no new share issues). With no IPO price (as is the case in traditional listings), investors will find it hard to submit buy orders, especially given wide price ranges in private transactions indicated in the prospectus. The fact that insiders not only have a majority voting power but the ability to further magnify it (by authorizing the issuance of the beneficiary certificates, as discussed at length in part 1), only complicates this IPO and may even add some discount to the computed value for lack of control. On the other end of the spectrum is the possibility of co-founders making an early exit (one of them (Martin Lorentzon) potentially may have 6% after IPO, should all of his 22mln registered shares be sold), again leading to value discount (why is one of the co-founders willing to reduce his stake to potentially 6%?) and, hence, uncertainty. Hopefully, the analysis and the valuation in this two-part series will shed some light on what SPOT value is, given my narrative, and what to keep pulse on to identify narrative shifts and consequent changes in value."

Click here to find out more »Spotify for WindowsSpotify (NYSE:SPOT), the world’s most popular streaming music platform, is launching its DPO (Direct Public Offering) on April 3rd, 2018. The story that the financial press has focused on is Spotify being a music service, locked in a highly competitive market with similar services. However, the investor would be mistaken in assuming that this is the complete story. The market has fundamentally misunderstood Spotify’s business.There is a pivot on the horizon with Spotify, and it has already started to take place. Those familiar with the app have seen it. Music isn’t the only dimension to Spotify. When the shift from a music reseller and streamer to a true audio-first platform becomes recognized by the market, hidden value will be unlocked. This gives a unique opportunity to the shareholder.Spotify was founded in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2006. It is now the global leader in music streaming. Market share is approximately 36% as of 2017. Other popular alternatives are Pandora (NYSE:P), SoundCloud (SOUND), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, and offerings by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). However, by being device agnostic and the largest service by users, Spotify is uniquely positioned to accelerate its business for years to come.Spotify is compatible with all major smartphone and computer operating systems, as well as major smart home speaker systems, and video game consoles. It’s now being installed on car stereo systems. Another company that Spotify inevitably gets compared to is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). However, many Netflix users also subscribe to cable and other video streaming services. What makes Spotify different is that all anyone needs is one streaming music service.Having a large lead in the install base gives it a substantial competitive advantage. The market is highly contested, and margins will be thin for a long time to come, but first-mover advantages are particularly meaningful in this instance. In addition, Spotify does an excellent job integrating with social media. This feature isn’t a must, but is an additional narrow moat nonetheless. This leaves Spotify as the default option in this space.Spotify offers two types of plans. An ad-supported (free) plan with less control over which songs are played, and a premium on-demand service. It currently has 159 million MAUs, and of those 71 million are premium users. The portion of premium to total users is growing rapidly, from 30% to 44% over the last two years. Spotify currently gets 90% of its revenue from premium users, and only recently broke even with its ad-supported side.Spotify has to sign lucrative licensing agreements with major and independent labels. This is unlikely to change in the near future, given the way the contracts are structured (I won’t go into too much detail here, but it can be found on the F-1). his far from being a traditional value stock, but its platform offers promising opportunities in the future.All figures are in millions Euros, unless otherwise stated. Financial data taken from the F-1. While MAUs have been growing, ARPU (Average Revenue per User) has been steadily shrinking. This is due to family and student discounts now being offered. It should be noted that churn has been steadily decreasing as well, confirming that this pricing plan is a sound strategy. With the global smartphone base of 2.3 billion and growing (statistica.com), there is still plenty of room for Spotify to grow. Worldwide expansion continues, currently present in 61 countries.In each instance, the service is tailored to the local music preferences of the population. Not simply a music provider, there is a strong emphasis on analytics in Spotify’s business model. A strong part of the user experience is music discovery. Using scale and analytics, users can listen to algorithm and custom created playlists, updated daily.Spotify’s lead in listeners among its competitors is being converted into a superior experience for the user. Spotify continues to invest in its platform. This growing expense certainly drives margin compression, but patient shareholders will be rewarded in the future. Its analytics also have applications beyond listening to music.Spotify for WindowsSpotify undeniably had plenty of success in its first decade. It has a growing base globally, the leader in its category, with growing user engagement. However, it has yet to escape the harsh competitive landscape that is the music streaming business. Besides smaller competitors such as SoundCloud and Pandora, it faces the prospect of facing not one, but three 800-pound gorillas named Apple, Google, and Amazon. Is Spotify’s destiny always to be fighting for narrow margins in a cutthroat business? Or, is there a shift already underway, one that will see much higher user engagement and profits in Spotify’s future.It is often said that we’re currently living in the Golden Age of Television. Streaming television has revolutionized the economics and viewing habits in that market, and made shows like House of Cards and Game of Thrones possible. Less known, but just as applicable, is the world of podcasting. It has also been said that we’re currently experiencing a Golden Age of Podcasting. Interest in podcasts hit an inflection point a few years ago, and has been steadily increasing.This fact has become much more widely understood since the podcast Serial became a massive hit with mainstream audiences in 2014. Yet strangely, no publicly traded firms (and shareholders) have profited from this massive media shift. The podcast world still remains highly fragmented. There are dozens of popular apps available for both podcast creation and consumption. Some are proprietary, others are open source. The non-technical users do face moderate barriers to entry when being acclimated with podcast listing.Additionally, little or no data is known about viewing habits of podcast listeners, besides downloads. How often are podcasts listened to? How many times does the user pause the podcast? Which topics are most interesting and engaging? How many times is each episode shared? None of this is known, because there is no universal podcasting platform. Contrast this with Netflix, which has an entire department devoted to analytics, has offered prizes for users developing the best recommendation engine, and allocates capital based on the viewing habits of its users.In addition, most podcast ads are of exceedingly low quality, and uses televisions old “one size fits all” ad model. Ad agencies take a best guess at demographic data and everyone listens to the same ad. It should be noted that the podcasting world’s greatest hit to date came from public radio. It has never been easier to start a podcast, and never been harder to gain meaningful revenue from it. Spotify is the answer.The 5 Best Podcast Apps For Android and iPhoneHere Are The Best Podcast Hosting Sites (Free Trials Too)While English-speaking countries have the greatest interest in podcasts, Sweden has the highest interest of any non-English speaking country. Spotify has a very large market share in its home country. This is a crucial insight that is almost entirely ignored by the financial press. If the trend continues for the rest of the world outside the Anglosphere, the opportunities for growth and monetization are massive. The challenges for setting up a podcast in Dutch, German, or Japanese are obvious, given the relatively limited size of your audience and the proportionally smaller ad market.Ads are already low quality in this space as it is, so podcasting in these markets remains a hobby, but not a business. A platform that offers new ways to monetize growth will reward both podcasters and audiences. The total global advertising market is currently $28 billion, according to the F-1. Of that, podcast revenues consisted of $220 million. However, year-over-year growth was an astounding 85%.Is this the golden age of podcasts?Are we entering the golden age of podcasts?In the introductory portion of the F-1, it was noted that Spotify is and will remain an audio-first platform. Podcasts are already included with Spotify. Using a combination of its large user base, analytical expertise within the audio space, and freemium business model, Spotify has the ability to pivot from primarily a music listening service, to a fully integrated, end-to-end podcasting platform. This platform can give podcasters data on its users currently not possible with other platforms.Meaningful data can be used to drive growth and listener engagement. In addition, Spotify has the ability to serve ads targeted to each individual user. Something I envision is a “premium plus” model, where, for an extra $5 a month, premium users have the ability to listen to podcasts ad-free.If they choose not to, they will be served targeted ads within podcasts. What makes this different from its music service is that the supply is essentially free. Podcasts will not be subject to the same licensing restrictions as music. The end result will be greater profits for podcasters, higher margins for Spotify, a better listening experience for consumers, and most importantly, an excellent return for shareholders.Spotify for iOS and Spotify for Artists preview in iOS App StoreIn Ben Thompson’s excellent blog, Stratechery, he described something he called Aggregation Theory. In a nutshell, it describes a typical market with a small number of suppliers, a few distributors, and a large number of potential customers. Taking transaction costs into consideration, it makes much more sense to integrate backwards, linking suppliers and distributors. We see this in the newspaper industry (content and delivery), taxi companies (cars and dispatch), and book publishing (authors with publishers).However, the Internet changed all of this. Transaction and distribution costs are now zero, making forward integration the only option. Customers are now the target of integration, not suppliers. Facebook has a walled garden for social media content. Both individuals and news services upload content for free. Similarly, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) have done an excellent job getting users to use its platform, and demand from it mean that drivers will sign up on their own without any additional incentive.Once this pivot takes place, a virtuous cycle will inevitably emerge. Podcasters will release exclusive or early content on the platform to bring in more users, with ad revenue trailing close behind. Greater analytics will increase the value of these ads. This will further encourage suppliers to join the platform, et cetera. The Flywheel Effect will be in full force.As with any discounted cash flow model, a few assumptions are necessary to forecast the future. User growth rate continues at a rapid pace as Spotify pursues global expansion, but eventually slows down. Ad-supported ARPU remains small compared with its Premium counterpart, and Premium ARPU decreases as Spotify gains share in developing markets. As Spotify increases in popularity, it will obtain greater negotiating leverage when dealing with music license holders.In addition, artists (like podcasters) will be able to sign directly with Spotify as it becomes a global audio platform. This is reflected in the growing gross margins for the music business. The space will remain competitive, and Spotify will continue to spend a large sum on marketing and R&D. However, economies of scale should become a factor in later years, and this is reflected in the smaller proportion of revenue that will be spent on these expenses.Spotify competes in a highly contested space, but should reach an inflection point with its earnings sometime early in the next decade. Patience is required of the investor, as the stock will be volatile for some time, but the story is promising.Spotify began as a music service, and still primarily exists at that function. But, as we have seen in the past, innovative, agile companies that have been able to shift business models have been very rewarding to its shareholders. Facebook’s transition from PC to mobile and Netflix’s transition from DVD-by-mail to streaming come to mind. In both instances, shareholder value exploded as each firm was able to tap into new markets and opportunities.The future remains bright for both music and podcasting. As we have seen time and time again, once you give the general public a platform to express themselves and monetize their talents, there is a burst in creativity. We have seen this with Twitter’s (NYSE:TWTR) hashtags, YouTube and Instagram stars, Facebook’s viral videos, and we will see it again with Spotify.It should be noted that Spotify’s offering is a DPO (Direct Public Offering) and not an IPO. Its price will not receive initial support from investment banks, and will likely be volatile for some time after it begins trading in the markets. The investor should have the appropriate appetite for risk, be patient, and buy the stock at a discount to its current intrinsic value ($22 billion, close to the initial price). There’s no need to chase a hot stock in a high-valuation environment, wait for the price to come to you. I know I will."
4157965,104087,2018-03-21T04:04:19-04:00,"It will be interesting to see if Spotify can find success by shunning a traditional IPO in favor of an equity sale without any underwriters.There are some solid statistics to take away from the prospectus, such as platform developments and continuing growth of its user base.But other concerns like potential price volatility and growing competition still have me wary of this equity offering.","The announcement of Spotify's (SPOT) IPO back in late February was news to investors as the latest tech company to go public. But what really interested many was the company's decision to list its shares on the NYSE via a direct listing instead of a traditional IPO. While the move could save the company a significant sum as it sells its ordinary shares directly to buyers over the public exchange, it may also prove to be a dangerous shortcut that fails to maximize Spotify's issuance. This type of move is not very common for a company with such a potentially large market cap, and definitely bears watching.But the other concern will be whether Spotify has the ability to become a successful business in the world of music streaming. Though it prides itself as a leader in market share (with almost double the user base as that of Apple Music (AAPL)), it may struggle to fully monetize its customer base and will have to fend off competitors with a weak competitive moat. In this article I take a closer look at Spotify's F-1, and examine some of the strengths and weaknesses that could ultimately impact its price after issuance.One of the big advantages of Spotify is the number of monthly active users (MAU) that use the platform. According to the F-1, as of December 31st, 2017, Spotify had 159 million MAU, with 71 million premium subscribers (that subscribed either via an individual, student, or family subscription). The rest of the users listened using the ad-supported service which Spotify offers. But looking at the revenue generated from each segment, it is clear that the premium subscribers are driving the operations. Though premium subscribers represent ~45% of Spotify's user base, they made up 90% of its revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2017.This is not to suggest that ad-supported users are useless; Spotify recognizes these customers as a vital funnel towards eventual premium subscribers. In addition, Spotify notes in its research and development section of the F-1 that R&D will continue to be dedicated towards new advertising products and improvements on the mobile and desktop applications, all of which should hand in hand improve monetization of the ad-supported user base.But in order to continue revenue growth, we must keep two key metrics in mind: growth in premium subscribers, and Premium Churn rates. As defined in the F-1, Premium Churn is a quarterly measure calculating the number of premium cancellations divided by the average number of premium subscribers in that quarter.Source: Spotify Form F-1The big factor in this is that Premium Churn has continued to decline over the past two years, allowing Spotify to retain its most profitable users. Offering new packages like the family plan and the student discount have been big factors in reducing the monthly churn rate. While subscriber growth has been significant with annual growth of 71% and 45% in 2016 and 2017, the quarterly numbers seem to indicate that Spotify could have headwinds keeping up such growth.Source: Spotify Form F-1, With Author's CalculationsSpotify has shown three consecutive quarters of lower year-over-year growth in premium subscribers; quarter-over-quarter growth was also lower in 2017 when compared to 2016. Market saturation is not the issue. Consider the following: according to Nielsen's Music Study, 93% of the U.S. population listens to music, spending over 25 hours per week. Spotify's 52 million MAU and 22 million premium subscribers in North America comprise just ~16% and ~7%, respectively, of the U.S.'s 325 million population. Similar arguments can be made about market prospects in Europe and the rest of the world. The slow growth is instead likely due to increasing competition from competitors like Apple Music and other streaming services that could potentially take away users from Spotify in the future. But I will discuss this in more detail later.Source: Spotify Form F-1, With Author's CalculationsSpotify's cost of revenue, which consists primarily of royalty payments and distribution costs related to content streaming, continues to eat up gross profits. As of December 2017, Spotify has already doled out over $9 billion in royalties; not only do publishing companies and songwriters feel that the amount paid in streaming is not enough, but U.S. copyright royalty judges feel the same way, as they have approved boosting payment rates for streaming by over 43% over the next five years. The company has also had to deal with lawsuits over the licensing of music, such as the $1.6 billion lawsuit with Wixen Music Publishing.But it is important to note that in 2016 and 2017, cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue dropped, which seems to correlate with the continued growth in premium subscribers. Looking at a statistic from the 2017 Global Music Report, it estimated that on average Spotify paid out ~$20 per user towards streaming royalties. Using this statistic, we can get a feel for the gross margins of both premium subscribers and ad-supported users.Source: Spotify Form F-1, GMR 2017, and Author's CalculationsWith the available knowledge (including the previously stated figure that premium subscriptions make up 90% of revenues), I made a quick model to show the difference in gross margins between premium and ad-supported users - the gap is tremendous.Spotify will need to continue to show us two things: that it can continue to grow its user base at a rapid pace, and that it will be able to successfully convert ad-supported users towards its premium subscription, the most profitable form of user. While Spotify still has room for monetization via ads, it is clear that it will struggle to use the vehicle as a solid revenue source. It is simply too hard to fit the amount of ads necessary into a music streaming service that lacks many visuals, and too many ads would overcrowd the listening experience.One thing that really concerns me is Spotify's ability to defend itself against the competition. The company itself has acknowledged many competitors in its F-1, including Pandora (P), Apple Music, Google Play Music (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Deezer (the European streaming startup), Amazon Prime (AMZN), Tidal, and other platforms like radio and legal/illegal downloading.That is some serious competition in the works. But there are signs that Spotify may already be losing any advantage it already has with its large user base. For example, consider this University of Twente study that looks at consumer preferences for music streaming services:Source: Max Riesewijk, ""The Future of Spotify""Overwhelmingly, consumers value music selection the most, a criterion which competitors have over Spotify when looking at the selection available by each company. This most likely has been a big contributor towards Apple Music's gain against Spotify; a Wall Street Journal article published last month pointed out how Apple Music's 5% monthly subscriber growth was outpacing Spotify's 2%, and could overtake the company in paid subscribers by this summer.Spotify also lacks the advantage of networks effects, something its larger competitors could utilize. We can see this in the F-1 as Spotify addresses some of the competition it faces, including indirect competitors such as Facebook (FB):It appears to be a big concern for Spotify, but to me this is also the opportunity it should use in order to create a competitive advantage. Competitors like Apple and Google could find a way to seamlessly integrate their streaming services into its other products. For Spotify to fend off these moves, it will have to create its own music streaming ecosystem. As Facebook is to our social network, and LinkedIn is to our business network, Spotify should find a way to capitalize on its ability to become our musical network, a way for us to share our musical tastes and interests with friends and family. It already has shown steps towards this, including enhancing user experience with more powerful search and discovery music engines, and creating unique playlists personalized for each user, all through increases in its R&D.As an investor, the other thing that has me worried is the potential for extreme volatility at the time of the IPO. I have no problem with Spotify choosing not to have an underwriter and maximizing the amount received on its equity offering, but there is significantly more risk as an investor.The first issue is that there will be no book building process, road shows, or a published price range; for buy and sell orders prior to and at the opening of trading shares, we could be seeing a wide range of pricing orders which could push the market price in either direction. Spotify is going with an investor day to give investors the information needed, but it still does not give much insight into a specific price range.Looking at precedent private transactions confirms the potential volatility. As recent as 2018, private transactions were ranging between $90 and $132.50 per ordinary share. When considering the total number of shares, it gives an implied market cap between $15.9 billion and $23.4 billion. For comparison, Pandora's market cap currently sits at $1.23 billion - not implying that Spotify cannot be worth the price paid, but it's something to consider, as monetization and growth prospects will need to be significant.Lastly, the F-1 notes that there are no lock-up agreements (requirement that a buyer may not sell the stock for X amount of days), meaning that investors could simply dump shares at any time.SNAP data by YChartsAn apples-to-oranges comparison, but I wanted to point out the volatility of Snapchat (SNAP) in the first six months after its IPO. Prices for each share ranged from at one point a high of over $27 to $12.65 by the beginning of August 2017.But why I bring Snapchat up is because there are certain qualities in the equity offering which Spotify shares. For one, Snapchat did not give any voting rights in the shares offered to the public; while Spotify does offer voting securities, the founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon own 37.3% and 43.1% of the combined voting power, respectively, meaning shareholders will not have influence on the major decisions of the company. Both are companies that have shown significant operating losses going into the equity offering, and unlike Snapchat which had a 180-day lockout agreement, Spotify has none at all. I do think there will be some turbulence in the stock price in the period following the IPO, especially if a price range is not established.Spotify still has some interesting growth prospects which an investor should consider. It hasn't fully tapped the streaming market potential as it still has the opportunity to continue adding users to its platform. How it develops Spotify into more than simply a streaming service is also something I will be keen on watching. But I still need to see more progress from the company before fully committing; the risks are still evident, and in my eyes it will be a little too volatile at the outset."

This was an important report that should help potential investors calibrate their assumptions on the Swedish company's near-term operational and financial performance.Credit: SpotifyThe box below summarizes the company's expectations for the full year. MAU (monthly active users) are projected to grow by about 29%, give or take five million listeners. The premium subscriber count is forecasted to increase at a slightly faster pace of 33% YOY, at the midpoint of the range. Total gross margins of 24% should land about three percentage points ahead of 2017's number, while projected operating losses of €243 million (excluding direct listing expenses that will likely not be part of pro forma results) start to point the company in the direction of the breakeven point a bit further out in the future.Credit: company's SEC filingOverall, Spotify's guidance fell largely in line with recent trends of strong double-digit growth in usage. I think the estimates will please growth investors who had already been leaning towards investing in the stock. The more robust premium subscriber growth expectations (43% in fiscal 1Q18, tapering down to 33% for the full year) suggest a combination of strong conversion and churn rates that are likely to continue their decline.See graph below, reflecting the MAU outlook for 2018 and my own projections for ad-supported usage.Source: DM Martins Research, using historical data from Spotify's SEC filingsRegarding profitability, the favorable gross margins trend (23% in fiscal 1Q18 rising to 24% for the year) makes sense to me, considering (1) the gains of scale from full-year revenues that are projected to grow by 25% at the midpoint of the guidance range and (2) new licensing agreements with better terms that were signed in 2017 and that should continue to have a positive impact on the company's financials. Further down the P&L, shrinking operating losses (-9.4% margin in 2017 vs. -4.8% in 2018, excluding IPO charges) are a welcome development. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that projected opex of nearly €1.5 billion should grow by less than 20% YOY (vs. gross profit growth of 44%), helping the company produce some operating leverage in 2018.Source: DM Martins Research, using historical data from Spotify's SEC filingsI think that Spotify's 2018 guidance, while unlikely to have caught most by surprise, should have given bulls further reason to believe in their investment thesis. On my end, I continue to see a few positive factors suggesting that owning this name may eventually make sense, pending the price of the stock's initial offering. While still not ready to commit to a ""buy"" or ""sell"" recommendation, I continue to have an overall favorable view of SPOT ahead of the IPO."

The SEC filings are officially in, management’s pitch is out, and on April 3 - in what is sure to be an exciting day for the NYSE - all eyes of the financial world will watch as the popular music streaming service rings the bell.As with any IPO, we should expect some volatility in the company’s shares during the first few trading sessions. Particularly for Spotify, there will be an above average amount of interest, as public investors can finally become partial owners of the Swedish firm.Importantly, however, more amplified volatility could occur in Spotify’s share price as a consequence of the company’s direct listing. This untraditional method could lead to radical supply and demand dynamics that could create huge swings in the company’s valuation. Before investing, it is vital we consider the broader financial market forces at work in order to best prepare for the next few months of trading.Lack of PitchingOne of the key aspects to understand about the direct listing is that Spotify is forgoing the assistance of investment banks. This comes with its pros and cons. On the positive side, the company doesn’t have to shell out millions to professional financiers. The flip side of this is all the work investment bankers do through roadshows and the book-building process is left to the company. As a result, much of the assessment of non-private investor interest will be postponed until the first few sessions of trading, leaving price discovery entirely to the private sector up until April 3. Now, the private equity space is filled with smart investors, but there may be a wide discrepancy as to how the company should be valued in public hands. Without traditional consultation and price discovery with investors before the listing, Spotify’s shares could experience abrupt valuation adjustments as it transitions from private to public hands. This could occur regardless of where the company is initially priced at.No Mandatory Share Sales or RestrictionsMoreover, another key aspect to keep in mind with Spotify’s listing is the lack of new share issuances. Instead of raising capital with new shares, the streaming giant will simply be offering existing investors the opportunity to sell shares on the public market.Considering this, a compelling argument could be made that existing investors - with no requirements to sell their securities - could theoretically hold onto their shares and transact very little with the public (p.44 of Form F-1). This could lead to a rapid rise in share prices, as investors bid up a limited supply of available securities. Compounding this scenario could be institutional investors - without the ability to buy large blocks of shares - leave individuals in control of Spotify’s valuation. Think about another asset that has enjoyed that designation in 2018 (I’m looking at you, Bitcoin). With zeal, capital, and control from individual investors, Spotify’s share price could enter a parabolic trajectory upward in the first few months.At the same time, there are no sale restrictions for insiders or lockup periods for investment banks (besides those affiliated with Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), comprising roughly 7.5% of shares outstanding). It is quite possible that the market could be flooded with shares as existing investors try to exit their long-held positions. Moreover, if the selling is confined to insiders, investor confidence and demand would be threatened, casting doubt on how those closest to the firm view Spotify’s future prospects.The above describes the extremes of the supply dynamic that could occur over the first few weeks. Depending on which you believe is more likely to occur, you could gauge how investor demand and shares will respond over the short term. During the first few weeks, I think we will see a combination of limited supply and investor hype on the demand side that will lead to an elevated valuation in the near term. Gradually, both of those forces are likely to reverse, as the IPO buzz fades and more existing shareholders exit their positions in a way that doesn’t shock the company’s valuation. By way of comparison, Spotify’s pricing would take a path similar to Twitter’s (TWTR) during the first months of trading in late 2013 and early 2014, initially rising two months out and gradually falling six months later. Though Twitter did not IPO via a direct listing, it’s a reasonable comparison to make given its comparable size, history, industry, and popularity at the time of its listing on the NYSE.Like many large-scale IPOs that have come before, in the short term much of Spotify’s share price movement will be driven less by developments in the business and more with the factors of supply and demand for company shares. The direct listing on the NYSE will likely exaggerate these forces over the first few weeks and months. By understanding the factors working on the supply side of the offering, depending on which situation you deem more likely to unfold, I think you can reasonably anticipate how shares will respond in the weeks after April 3."

There have been six of them on the Nasdaq since 2006 and Spotify’s would be the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) first if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepts the NYSE’s proposed rule changes that would allow direct listing.In a direct listing, companies skip the typical initial public offering (IPO) process by listing shares directly on an exchange. The number of shares for sale is determined entirely by what current shareholders are willing to sell, also setting the price they’re willing to sell at. On the flip side, demand for shares is determined entirely by the quantity of shares new investors are willing to buy, and at the price they’re willing to pay.So far, the majority of companies that have gone the direct listing route have been smaller companies and some real estate investment trusts. Spotify is unique in that it is far and away the largest company to pursue such a course. In mid-December, Reuters reported that Spotify was valued at about $19 billion based on the price of recent private transactions, putting it in the large cap bucket.Regardless of the process to go public, once the shares start trading on the exchange, they’re still subject to the same requirements as every other company and could be delisted if they fail to maintain the exchange’s listing requirements. The companies also need to abide by the SEC’s rules and regulations.Despite their infrequent use, there are several reasons the direct-listing approach can be attractive. From a financial standpoint, since there’s no underwriting process, companies can save on the fees that investment banks charge, which can top $100 million for the largest IPOs. Also, being in an industry that is subject to the “cool factor”(in this case, tech), the move might be viewed by members of the public as a way to avoid the costs associated with large, traditional underwriting firms.There’s also no need to issue new shares with a direct listing. If the company doesn’t need to raise capital, this route allows it to avoid dilution to current shareholders’ ownership. At the same time, it provides current investors with the ability to more easily sell shares, or exit their position entirely, than might be possible in private markets.The tradeoff is the company forgoes the services that investment banks provide: covering the stock in research reports, ensuring there is a market for the stock, and the IPO roadshow - the process where investment banks and senior management of the company going public meet with potential investors to drum up interest in the business and offering.Without underwriters, there also tends to be a greater chance for price volatility once shares start trading publicly. There have certainly been IPOs where prices soared or crashed shortly after going public, but for the most part, investment banks try to set a reasonable opening price for the new shares that won’t result in massive price swings.If Spotify’s direct listing ends up being widely considered as successful, it could pave the way for more private companies to consider going public by skipping the traditional IPO process. Or it could just be another one-off like Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) Dutch auction IPO back in 2004 when it was just Google.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC."

The IPO comes off the back of a deal the company made in 2017, where the company raised 1 billion dollars in exchange for a future IPO, where the proceeds of this debt will get transferred into shares, they can then be publicly sold.The company's revenue from 2016 to 2017 grew almost 40%. As of late, revenue - compared to previous quarters on a percentage term - has been growing, despite the massive growth in the Family Plan option.Spotify is a simple business to understand; currently, they have just two segments: premium and ad-supported.The premium sales bring in 90% of the revenue, and ad-supported brings in the other 10%. The last reporter quarter showed that Spotify's gross margin was 24.5%, this has improved dramatically.In Q1 2016, the gross margin was 5.1%. A lot of the company's costs - in fact the clear majority - come from royalties payments.The company has various contracts with some of the world's top record labels and publishers on the planet.The current music industry market share is dominated by three main players, The Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony.Due to such a vast dominance by just a few companies, they could all demand more from Spotify and/or choose to do business elsewhere. Now, it is in their interest to distribute their music to as many sites as possible, but one day we could see the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and others bid for contracts that only they hold the distribution rights. It is a long-shot, but something for potential investors to consider. This would end Spotify.You can see from the chart that the growth and nonpaying subscribers directly correlates with the growth in paying subscribers. The percentage of users who pay compared to total users has also been on the increase but seems to have flattened out around 44%.The increase in paying subscribers is due to the company's marketing strategy.The company's operating expenses have grown substantially, research and development costs grew the most versus every other cost.From 2016 to 2017, research and development cost grew 91%, while sales and marketing were up 54%. General and administrative expenses grew 50.8%.This high growth in research and development costs is a trend we should expect to see continuing over the years, in this prospectus the company says on future research and development costs:To value Spotify at $20 billion we will have to get some extraordinary numbers in a short space of time.The company's revenues are growing both in premium payments and advertisements. However, the operating income of the company seems to be declining fast - in fact; it could be several years before the company turns positive.*RPPU (revenue per premium user) and ARPU (average revenue per user) are based on the companies reported MAU's (monthly active users).Using the data available and modeling out some numbers, you can see that it takes lots of work to make Spotify profitable. Sales and marketing historically have been around 12% of revenue - as the prospectus shows.To make the company have a positive EBIT, we have had to pull that percentage back to 10%, and then 9% until 2020.Download and read the full prospectus: SEC_Spotify_PPospectus_IPO.pdfNot only sales and marketing, but we also have to assume a slowdown in costs altogether.For Premium Users, we will assume they get maxed about at around 50% of total users. The ad-related content is likely to struggle to gain any real steam. Revenue in this segment will grow alongside user growth. However, the revenue brought in by ads would not outweigh the costs to any exciting levels. In fact, this gross margin number has been all over the place - as you can see from the bottom row of the model. It is, for this reason, we just assumed a 3% positive gross margin.Spotify is undoubtedly for the more risk-on investor, I mean, even from IPO day one, the company is doing something that is unusual.It is a lousy move what they are doing, they do not have the support of the investment banks. If you're a trader, I guess this is good news.The volatility on Spotify will be something for everyone to watch, this will be the biggest story of the month - when the stock IPO's.Over the longer-term Spotify can become profitable, whether or not it is an attractive investment would still be subjective.Looking at other companies IPOs similar to Spotify: Snapchat (SNAP) & Facebook (FB), they had pretty bad launches.Twitter's (TWTR) IPO was better, but the momentum has failed, and the stock has yet to reach its highs. So, that's something to keep in mind, history tends to repeat itself."
4157838,102225,2018-03-20T13:38:50-04:00,"Pandora is still the market leader in the U.S. for ad-based music streaming and still has more combined users in North America than any other music streaming app.Pandora's competitor, Spotify, is growing revenues at a faster rate but its operating expenses are also growing.If Pandora can stop ad-tier user decline while improving paid subscribers in 2018, it could reverse the overall downward trend in stock price since last year.Spotify credits programmatic channels for a large improvement in ad revenues when compared to 2016; hence, Pandora should benefit as well when programmatic is fully launched in 2018.Pandora is heavily discounted to Spotify when both companies are compared using the Enterprise-Value/Revenue Multiple.","It's been a couple of months since my last article on Pandora (P). During these past four months, Spotify (SPOT) got closer to direct list in the NYSE, the Copyright Royalty Board ""CRB"" made some expected rulings, and the stock fluctuated from a high of $5.47 to a low of $4.09. Pandora's stock had 10 negative months in 2017 and just notched two negative months for 2018. That makes it 7 consecutive negative months and 12 negative months since the beginning of 2017. There was a glimmer of hope for Pandora to end February as a positive month, but Pandora's 2017 fourth quarter results disappointed Wall Street. Earnings results were not horrible. Revenue beat expectations thanks to paid subscriber growth, but active users showed a year-over-year decline which resulted in lower listening hours. A decrease in ad-tiered active users is not good but not all hope is lost. Contrary to what the market believes, Pandora is well suited for ad growth in 2018 due to the initiatives currently underway. In addition, Pandora's Premium users' growth is also a nice boost that should help the company perform better compared to 2017. Lastly, Pandora's EV/Rev multiple for estimated 2018 revenues is discounted significantly from Spotify's, which I'll discuss in more detail later in this article.With the price of Pandora's stock currently under $5, its market cap stands at around $1.3B. In my previous article, I mentioned that Pandora's current ratio is 4.18X, meaning that Pandora has about $4 in current assets for $1 in current liabilities. As far as long-term debt is concerned, Pandora's convertible notes do not mature until December of 2020. Pandora also recently issued 480K of convertible preferred stock to Sirius XM (SIRI), but those will not be converted until the stock price is at least $10.50. In return, Pandora received $480M in cash from Sirius XM. Pandora is not swimming in cash from operations, but it has enough cash on hand to operate in 2018. If need be, Pandora also has the option to use an untapped $200M of borrowing capacity from its credit facility which could be increased by an additional $50M. I wouldn't be surprised if this credit facility gets utilized in the short term to acquire an ad-tech company to improve the ad-metrics and self-serve offerings to clients at a much faster pace than building those offerings in-house. This move would allow Pandora to better monetize its ad-tiered users, which currently stand just shy of 70 million.Spotify recently issued its F-1 form that is required before its direct listing in the NYSE scheduled for the first week of April. In this filing, we were able to learn that Spotify's market cap hit a low of $15.9B and a high of $23.4B in the private market during the first two months of 2018. Spotify's current ratio is 1.02X and has no long-term debt. Spotify operates in over 20 countries and continues to expand at a rapid pace. This fast expansion across the world has caused monthly active users ""MAUs"" to increase quite rapidly. Spotify has 159 million MAUs with ad-tiered users representing the biggest share (57%), while paid users are increasing at the fastest pace (48% YoY) when compared to ad-tiered users.The table below illustrates the past three years of MAUs in Pandora and Spotify. Here we can see the overall trend in users and how much faster Spotify is growing its subscribers when compared to Pandora. However, there's one thing to consider while looking at the chart below. Spotify represents over 20 countries, while Pandora realistically only represents the United States. There are other major players out there with significant scale, but as of the time of this writing, Spotify is the largest paid and ad-tiered music streaming service worldwide. Pandora's ad-tiered user decline for the past three years is not pretty. Needless to say, Pandora has lost about 71% of its stock value in the same time period, which I believe is overkill.Source: Author generated chart from Pandora's 10-K and Spotify's F-1If we compare Pandora and Spotify with only North America performance for the past two years, we get the table below.Source: Author generated chart from Pandora's 10-K and Spotify's F-1The above chart paints a less grim picture for Pandora. For example, Pandora currently has more than double the ad-tiered users of Spotify, and more importantly, Spotify's sequential ad-tiered users' growth in Q4 was flat, similar to Pandora. This might have been a result from ad-tiered users seeing greater value from Pandora's offerings compared to Spotify's. However, I also think new users' preference for music streaming is slowly shifting to paid monthly services. Thus, Spotify has been able to continue to grow its paid users in North America while Pandora is playing catch-up with the help from Pandora Premium.Pandora revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were mostly from ad-tiered users (73%) instead of paid users (27%). On the other hand, Spotify earned its revenues primarily from paid users (89%) instead of free users (11%).Source: Author generated chart from Pandora's 10-K and Spotify's F-1Spotify's impressive revenue growth can clearly be seen in the chart above, which also illustrates the slower growth for Pandora's total revenues. Like I mentioned earlier, most of the revenue earned by Spotify comes from paid subscribers, and as such, the content cost for those users are higher than ad-tiered users since paid subscribers have added features that ad-tiered users do not. Below you can see the total gross profits for the past eight quarters for Pandora and Spotify.Source: Author generated chart from Pandora's 10-K and Spotify's F-1Spotify's gross profits for 2017 doubled from the prior year, while Pandora's stayed relatively flat with only 3% growth. Ideally, Spotify's greater gross profits should point to greater operating income, but as you can see below, that is not the case in the majority of the past quarters.Source: Author generated chart from Pandora's 10-K and Spotify's F-1Growth is costly. Operating expenses are eating away all leftover gross profits. Pandora and Spotify have similar operating expenses categories that consist of Product Development, Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative expenses. See below for the past trend in operating expense for Pandora and Spotify.Source: Author generated chart from Pandora's 10-K and Spotify's F-1Pandora has been able to contain and even decrease operating costs over the past two years, while Spotify has not. Spotify is considered a growth stock and needs to spend to make sure that growth continues into the future. After April, Spotify will be under a greater degree of pressure to ensure the growth doesn't slow down, and for that reason, I believe the trend in operating expenses will not reverse in the near term.I previously showed Spotify's private market valuations for the first two months of 2018 that came from their F-1 form. This market valuation is for the entire company and it takes into consideration all the countries it operates in and the potential untapped growth. I also calculated Spotify's Enterprise Value (""EV"") for this article. Since Spotify has no debt, I only subtracted cash and investments that total around $2.4B. This results in an EV range of $13B to $20.5B using the data from private transactions discussed in Spotify's F-1 for the past two months. The past two months of private transaction might provide a better sense of how the shares will trade in early April when they go public as the trend in share price for the past year in the private market have been higher lows and higher highs.Spotify's F-1 also showed that the United States represented around 40% of total revenues for the past three years and the U.S. has the largest concentration of workers compared to all the other countries Spotify operates in. Ideally, out of the total market valuation of Spotify, the U.S. should represent at least 40%. Realistically, it's probably closer to 50%, but I used 40% to be conservative for my analysis. Thus, an estimated EV for only the U.S. portion of Spotify should be around $5.2B to $8.2B.Furthermore, I projected Spotify's total revenue for 2018 using quarterly and annual trends for its ad-tiered users and paid subscribers for the past two years. This resulted in $6.2B total revenue for 2018. If the United States continues to represent roughly 40% of total revenues like it had the past three years, then the U.S should generate around $2.48B in revenues for Spotify in 2018.Now let's switch back to Pandora. According to Pandora's most recent 10-K filing, it generated $1.39B in revenue for 2017, which represents around a 7% growth from 2016. I also calculated 2018's estimated revenue using a similar growth rate from 2017, even though I except 2018 to grow faster than 2017. Number one reason, Pandora Premium will have one full year of operation. Number two, programmatic advertising will begin in 2018 and increase ad-revenue for ad-tiered users just like it did for Spotify. However, I will keep 2017's annual revenue growth rate constant to be conservative. This results in about $1.5B in revenue projected for 2018.As of the time of this writing, Pandora's public market cap is around $1.3B. After adding all the debt and subtracting all cash and equivalents, Pandora's EV is $1.57B for my projected 2018 revenues with the current price of the stock at around $4.90.Now, taking all of the information discussed, you can see the Enterprise-Value-To-Revenue (""EV/R"") multiple using estimated 2018 U.S. results in the table below.Source: Author generated chart from Pandora's 10-K and Spotify's F-1This shows a very significant discount for Pandora's low PPS scenario of almost 57% when comparing to Spotify's lowest PPS in the first two months of 2018. When we compare Pandora's highest PPS in 2018 to Spotify's lowest PPS in 2018, we still get a discount of 45%, which I do not believe is warranted. I do not expect Pandora's EV/R multiple to be near Spotify's low PPS scenario (2.10X), but I do expect it to be higher than 1.15X in the short term. My estimated revenue for Pandora in 2018 represents around 60% of Spotify's estimated U.S. revenue for 2018. For that reason, if I take Spotify's low PPS EV/Rev multiple of 2.10X and discounted by 60%, I get 1.26X. This results in a PPS for Pandora of around $6. I expect Pandora to start trying to reach this price in the coming months. How fast Pandora reduces this gap will be dependent on how quickly they fully roll-out programmatic advertising for video and audio, how quickly they introduce student and family plans, and how quickly they begin offering self-serve technology.I compared Pandora to low valuations of Spotify to show Pandora is heavily discounted even when compared to pessimistic Spotify valuations. I'm not saying that Spotify will trade at their lows of 2018 during its first days as a public company. However, I think any potential long-term investor should give it 3-5 months to consolidate before making any moves. I think Spotify might reach a high $25B+ valuation in the first few weeks but might consolidate downward to possibly test $15B. If Spotify shows greater strength in the U.S. the coming quarters, Pandora will likely be impacted slightly due to its low valuation. However, if Pandora shows any strength when compared to Spotify, Spotify's valuation can be greatly impacted in the short term. The market has low expectations for Pandora while it expects great growth from Spotify. Keep this in mind.Aside from the disparity in pricing between similar companies presented above, there are also big events that will increase ad spend in 2018, which is Pandora's biggest money-maker in the U.S. These events include the PyeongChang Winter Olympics that occurred this past February (see image below), The World Cup in Russia, and the midterm elections in the U.S.Source: Screenshots from Pandora iOS app after video adThe current political landscape will create a fierce battle across the U.S. before and during the midterm elections in late 2018. All of the seats in the house and over 30 seats in the Senate will be contested this year. This creates a great opportunity for Pandora to increase revenue for 2018 in its ad-tiered segment. Mainly, because most of the marketing campaigns will probably rely heavily in targeted online mobile advertisements through audio, video, and display, all of which Pandora provides. More precisely, by the time advertisement for the midterm elections begin, Pandora should have completed its video and audio programmatic initiatives mentioned during the most recent earnings call. If all goes well, it could also have completed its self-serve offerings for mobile advertisements, leaving Pandora well positioned in the market for increased ad demand in second half of 2018. Below we can see that political advertising spend has already started.Source: Screenshots from Pandora iOS app after video adTo put a little more color into my previous point, there's a conservative group that has already vowed to spend $400M during the midterms to help the GOP retain power. On the other hand, Democrats will respond in kind with similar figures as the snippet below explains.Source: ArticleThe two articles above show the current political landscape might prove favorable for Pandora's ad-tiered segment. Additionally, some advertisers might focus more ad-spend towards Pandora instead of Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Twitter (TWTR) as advertisers don't have to fear appearing next to questionable content. One of those advertisers is Unilever (UL) and it had already threatened to reduce spending in Google and Facebook if they don't eliminate questionable content from their platforms. Pandora doesn't have this problem, and it doesn't need to hire thousands of workers to vet through the content or posts created by its users like Facebook and Google currently have to.Even then, the political landscape doesn't capture all the additional the mobile online ad spend that traditional retail brick and mortar stores will continue to spend in 2018 to offset decreasing traffic from online competition. I also expect to see more movie trailers from movie studios continue to be shown in Pandora's app. I have already seen more than in previous quarters, but with decreasing foot traffic in theaters, I expect movie studios to expand their online marketing efforts in 2018 to combat the sluggish trend of 2017. On the other hand, Pandora will also benefit from Netflix's (NFLX) advertising campaigns that aim to drive traffic to direct streaming of Netflix's exclusive movies like the newest Cloverfield sequel (see image below).Source: Screenshots from Pandora iOS app after video adFrom some basic usage these past couple of quarters, I've seen some improvements in the type and quality of ads from Pandora, the most promising ads being the ones that require user input to guarantee at least an impression. The mix in companies is also promising and diverse. Some of the companies that have sponsored uninterrupted listening hours or additional skips are shown in the picture below. The picture below does not include companies that used audio or native display ads.Source: Screenshots from Pandora iOS appEven with the improvements in quality of ads, I still wish Pandora would do a better job notifying users of available options for skips or premium features with something other than an audio tone. The audio tone mentioned in my previous sentence is identical to the tone used when a user is not allowed to skip a track due to licensing terms. This could create confusion and potentially cause a user to miss the opportunity of added features if she or he is not looking at their phone. Nonetheless, the introduction of more frequent video ads for uninterrupted listening, additional skips, and on-demand listening will help lift ad-revenues in 2018 for Pandora once it's fully implemented nationwide. One of the main reasons is that video advertisements generally offer better CPM rates than audio and much better CPM rates than display ads.Better video CPM rates coupled with increased demand from marketers that want to increase the use of video marketing across mobile networks should prove to be a net positive to Pandora, even while the company still attempts to improve its ad metrics tools for its marketing clients.I do think Pandora's future is promising, and its stock price will appreciate in value for 2018. Pandora management is resetting expectations and only promising achievable results. Analysts are currently getting accustomed to Roger's new style and will begin to start placing a higher premium on Pandora once they realize Pandora will continue to be the leader in audio advertisement in the U.S. Ad-tiered music streaming is not going away, and from the mentions in Spotify's F-1 report, there is a benefit from having a multi-pronged approach to online music streaming, which Pandora already knew.Now having said all of the above, Pandora is still a small-cap stock that can have large swings in prices, and I expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. Due to the nature of small-cap companies, be cognizant that traders will trade in and out regardless of the company's success, and these large volume orders could easily trigger a chain reaction of stop-loss orders. For this reason, I urge you to conduct your own due diligence before you consider Pandora for your investment portfolio and would advise investing in in small-cap stocks without the use of margin, so you can stomach that volatility that might continue for the foreseeable future.Please subscribe so you can get a notification if I decide to write a blog about Spotify's guidance that will be released March 26.The views represented in this article are my own and do not represent any other person's/entity's opinion.

4157281,104137,2018-03-17T00:57:40-04:00,I've been a loyal Spotify customer since 2009 and won't be moving away from it.Spotify has 71 million paid subscribers; Apple Music only has 36 million.The company had a net loss of $1.5 billion last year.Apple and Amazon are hot at their heels.,"Music has been my passion from a very young age, and consuming music is a daily ritual for me. As a CD collector, I initially opposed the likes of streaming services that didn't support the artist, and I much preferred the physical touch of a CD with its lush artwork. However, as much as I hated myself for doing so, I quickly fell in love with Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).Those who use the streaming service will attest that its easy-to-use interface and breadth of available music make using Spotify an enjoyable and seamless experience. It's intuitive, comprehensive and provides hardcore music fans with pretty much everything they need. My personal favourite feature is Spotify's ""related artists"" through which I am always discovering new artists that are either inspired by or fit in the same genre as my favourite jams.What's more, its incredibly low pricing of $14.99 for six family members per month for Premium makes the service a steal. With the family deal, it's around $2.50 per month per person for the latest unlimited, high-quality music. For those of us who were used to paying upwards of $10 for the latest album on CD, Spotify really does feel like a bargain.Clearly, I'm not alone in my love for Spotify either. In its latest update, the company declared it has 71 million paid Premium subscribers. In contrast, competitors Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music only has 36 million paid subscribers. Furthermore, paid subscribers grew 46% year over year last year.Additionally, over my many years of using Spotify, I've built up a number of playlists with thousands of songs. Switching to another service is simply not an option for me as I would have to start from scratch building them up again on another service. I'm locked in. Whilst I'm aware there are a few third-party apps that claim to facilitate transferring playlists from one streaming service to another, it still seems like far too much effort to achieve very little.Despite owning an Apple Macbook Pro and iPhone, I really don't feel like I would benefit from shifting over to Apple Music, let alone other services such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).So when I first heard rumours in 2017 about Spotify going public, my interest was certainly peaked. As a loyal user of the service who genuinely loves it and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future, I felt excited for the IPO.However, after detaching my emotional sentiment to the service, I began considering how sustainable Spotify actually is. Over the many years of using and loving the service, I had assumed Spotify was raking in the money. I was right, but also very wrong. Whilst the company pulled in almost $5 billion last year, a $1.5 billion net loss was reported for the same period. That's a loss of a gargantuan size by any measure.Will it be profitable anytime soon? Not likely. As mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I love Spotify is its low price. Jacking up its subscription fees would give me a reason to jump ship. Even my awesome playlists might be worth jeopardising if competitors can retain a lower price than Spotify. In any case, I doubt Spotify will risk it, which means it will continue to not turn a profit for a while.This brings us on to Spotify's competitors. As already mentioned, tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon all have music streaming services. Competition is healthy, but when you've got any of the big 3 as your nemesis, let alone all three, you've got your work cut out for you.Analysts predict Spotify's valuation to be over $23 billion. If true, the $1.5 billion annual loss is even more significant. Apple, Google and Amazon can each all afford to invest and lose more than $1.5 billion to make their streaming services more competitive if they want to.Apple, which is Spotify's biggest competitor, has started to take the music game more seriously. Subscriber growth increased 75% in 2016 and some are predicting its subscriber growth in the US to surpass Spotify by this summer. Additionally, Apple products including the Apple Watch and new smart speaker HomePod exclusively rely on Apple Music. Whilst you can control Spotify through the Apple Watch and HomePod, you won't enjoy the full potential that these products have to offer unless you use Apple Music.In any case, Apple has the cash to splash at its streaming service without thinking twice. In its most recent quarter, Apple reported cash of $285.1 billion. If Apple decides one morning to throw $5 billion at its streaming service, it would feel like a drop in the ocean to it. Spotify simply does not have the means to survive such a fight.The same goes for Google and Amazon. Google has Google Play Music and Amazon has Amazon Music. What's more, Google has Google Home Smart Speaker and Amazon has Amazon Echo. This is where the real competition lies - which tech giant can provide the best streaming service and speaker duo?Even if the trio of tech giants don't actively go out of their way to crush Spotify by injecting billions into their own streaming service, by competing amongst themselves, Spotify will eventually be squeezed out.As a Spotify user and fan, I would certainly feel sad if I'm forced to jump over to one of the other streaming services. It's a fantastic service, and as it stands, I would recommend it to anyone. However, as a long-term investment, I simply wouldn't touch it. Having said that, I wish Spotify all the best with its IPO, and I sincerely hope I'll be using Spotify long into the future."
4156553,92586,2018-03-15T01:03:30-04:00,"In spite of the less-than-encouraging bottom line results produced so far by the streaming music company, could Spotify still be a buy?I discuss a few positive factors suggesting that owning this name might make sense, although further due diligence is required.If Spotify is priced at $19 billion, the implied 3.8x P/S multiple and $268 market value-to-paying subscriber may seem reasonable at first glance.","Spotify's (NYSE:SPOT) upcoming IPO should be the largest since Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) hit the markets in March 2017. Interestingly, and not unlike the social media's parent company, Spotify will be born boasting massive losses on its income statement of more than $1.2 billion in 2017 on a net basis, in a deteriorating trend.However, and in spite of the less-than-encouraging bottom line results produced so far by the streaming music company, could SPOT still be a buy?(Image Credit: Audiencia Electronica)To attempt to answer this question, one must look past the attention-grabbing headline numbers to assess if the company might justify what has been recently estimated to be its $19 billion pre-IPO valuation.From a macro perspective, I tend to agree with Spotify's management team when it argues that:Spotify is positioned to benefit from favorable trends in music consumption habits. And although competition is only likely to become fiercer, with Apple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbing fast to take over the #2 spot in the market and offerings from tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) evolving rapidly as well, I believe the ""game"" has barely started. See below how, despite an overall plateauing in the global recorded music industry's revenues, digital has evolved fast to become the largest and fastest-growing distribution and consumption format.(Source: IFPI)For this reason, I expect to see most of Spotify's revenue drivers continue to move generally in the right direction in the foreseeable future. The chart below indicates that, when it comes to usage as measured by MAU (number of monthly active users), the platform is picking up steam. Growth has slowed down a bit in 2017 on a percentage basis, but the trend should be reasonably expected as Spotify gains scale. Maybe as importantly, total MAU is evolving at a faster pace than ad-supported MAU, suggesting that Spotify's most valuable, subscription service-paying listener seems to be engaging and finding value in the company's premium offering.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company's SEC filing)ARPU, on the other hand, has dropped at an average of -12% YOY, as I believe competition forces Spotify to keep prices low and to offer family bundles and student discounts. But countering the headwinds is a declining churn of 5.5% in 2017 that might also be explained by a positive user experience. All accounted for, while premium customers are being captured at a lower price, the user base has become ""stickier"" - which I believe bodes well for long-term revenue growth and stability. See charts below.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company's SEC filing)Moving on, gross margin seems to be improving quickly over the past couple of years. Buried in Spotify's filing is a disclosure that last year the company ""entered into licensing agreements with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and with Merlin, among others (and that) cost of revenue and gross margins have benefited from the terms of the new licensing agreements."" This, along with scale, might explain why consolidated GMs have seen a significant improvement of nine percentage points to 21% between 2015 and 2017. The smaller ad-supported business (representing about 10% of total revenues) finally reached gross profitability last year, in a fast-improving trend over 2015's negative margin of -16%.Farther down the P&L is where rising opex starts to eat into the company's profits in a more aggressive way. Not unlike many companies in the early stages of their lives (Spotify is only 10 years old), SG&A and research costs have been rising at a faster pace than the already fast-expanding revenues. Total opex accounted for 30% of revenues in 2017, versus 23% in 2015. The good news is that (1) revenue growth and gross margin expansion should eventually create operating leverage and turn operating losses into profits, and (2) with over 10% of personnel expenses taking form of share-based compensation, not all of these costs are cash-consuming. In fact, free cash flow generation of €109 million, while not very sizable, suggests that at least Spotify will be introduced to the public markets not as a cash burner, as is often the case with some of its tech peers.But now we get to the below-the-op line items. Specifically, finance costs have skyrocketed to €974 million in 2017 from €336 million in 2016, driven mostly by fair value changes in the €1 billion worth of 5%-interest paying (with an adjustment clause), convertible notes issued in the first half of 2016 (see table below). I calculate that financing expenses alone, assuming no impact to taxes, have accounted for nearly 80% of the per share loss that Spotify generated in 2017.(Source: Company's SEC filing)These costs do not concern me much, as they are largely unrelated to Spotify's core operations. And with the company going public, it is possible that the notes could be paid down in the not-too-distant future.This is the first time that I am looking at SPOT in a bit more detail. Therefore, it would be irresponsible of me to issue a definitive ""buy"" or ""sell"" opinion on the stock without further due diligence - particularly without knowing the market price of the shares.For now, I have identified a few positive factors suggesting that owning this name might eventually make sense, at least from the perspective of future financial results and current fundamentals. The headline net losses might seem scary at first, but a closer look into the numbers eases some of my initial concerns.The final and crucial piece of the puzzle will be the stock's IPO price, which in this case will be determined via a direct listing process. If shares are priced near the $19 billion pre-IPO valuation, the implied 3.8x price-to-sales multiple and $268 market value-to-paying subscriber (the latter not too far off from its poor cousin Pandora's (NYSE:P) own valuation metric) may seem rich, but reasonable, at first glance.Regardless, this is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about IPOs of 2018. I will be sure to keep my eye on this name going forward, and will elaborate further on the stock in future articles."
4157311,55472,2018-03-17T11:03:01-04:00,"With its larger potential market capitalization and unusual IPO structure, Spotify has attracted more attention than Dropbox, and I would like to focus this post on it.As a potential investor, I am less concerned about the ""no banker"" part of the IPO than I am by the ""cash out"" part of the transaction.At this stage of its story, Spotify is a growth company with lots of potential (no irony intended), but lots of rough spots to work out.","In the last few weeks, we have seen two high profile unicorns file for initial public offerings. The first out of the gate was Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), a storage solution for a world where gigabyte files are the rule rather than the exception, with a filing on February 23. Following close after, on February 28, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), positioning itself as the music streaming analog to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), filed its prospectus. With its larger potential market capitalization and unusual IPO structure, Spotify has attracted more attention than Dropbox, and I would like to focus this post on it.Spotify was founded in 2008 in Sweden, by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, as a music streaming service. The timing was opportune, since the company caught and contributed to a shift in the music business, as users have moved away from paying for physical (records, CDs) to digital, as evidenced in the graph below:Note that not only has the move towards streaming, in proportional terms, been dramatic, but disruption has come with pain for the music business, with a drop in aggregate revenues from $24 billion in 1999 to about $16 billion in 2016. In a bright spot, revenues have started rising again in 2016 and 2017, and it is possible that the business will rediscover itself, with a new digital model. Spotify was not the first one in the business, being preceded by both Pandora (NYSE:P) and SoundCloud (SOUND), but its success is testimonial to the proposition that the spoils seldom go to the first movers in any business disruption.The Spotify business model is a simple one. Listeners can subscribe to a free version, with limited customization features (playlists, stations etc.) and online ads. Alternatively, they can subscribe to a premium version of the service, paying a monthly fee, in return for a plethora of customization options, and no ads. The company's standard service cost $9.99/month in the United States in 2018, with a family membership, where up to six family members living at the same address, can share a family service for $14.99/month, while preserving individualized playlists and stations. Prices vary globally, ranging from a high of $16.94 in the UK (for standard service) to much lower prices in Eastern Europe and Latin America. (You can check out the variations in this fascinating link that reports the prices across the world for Spotify, in dollar terms.) Spotify pays for its music content, based upon how often a song is streamed, but the rates vary depending on whether it is on the free or premium service and where in the world, creating some complexity in how it is computed. To get a sense of where Spotify stands right now and how it got there, I looked at the prospectus, with the intent of catching broad trend lines. I came up with the following:At this stage of its story, Spotify is a growth company with lots of potential (no irony intended), but lots of rough spots to work out.I have posted ahead of IPOs for many companies in the last decade, ranging from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) to Snap (NYSE:SNAP), but Spotify's IPO is different for two reasons:As a potential investor, I am less concerned about the ""no banker"" part of the IPO than I am by the ""cash out"" part of the transaction:In keeping with my view that you need a story to provide a framework for you valuation inputs, and especially so for young companies, I constructed a story for Spotify with the following elements:The entire picture, with the story embedded in it, is shown below. You can also download the spreadsheet here:It goes without saying, but I will say it anyway, that I made lots of assumptions to get to my value and that you may (and should) disagree with me or some or even all of these assumptions. You are welcome to download the spreadsheet that contains my valuation of Spotify and make it your own.There are three elements missing in this post. First, I have argued in my prior IPO posts that what happens after initial public offerings is more of a pricing game than a value game. To those of you who want to play that game, I don't think that this post is going to be very helpful. In my next post, I will look at how best to price Spotify, why you will hear pessimists about the company talk a lot about Pandora and optimists about Netflix. Second, there is the argument that top down valuations, like the one in this post, are ill equipped to value user or subscriber based companies. I will also use the user-based model that I introduced last year to value an Uber rider and an Amazon Prime member to value a Spotify subscriber. Finally, there is the lurking question of what Spotify is learning about its subscriber music tastes and how that data can be used to not only modify its offerings but perhaps create content that is more closely tailored to these tastes. That too has to wait for the next post.YouTube"
4136051,20521,2018-01-08T16:59:16-05:00,"Recently, Spotify announced that it had filed with the SEC to go public.Unlike traditional IPOs, the company is pursuing the direct listing method that would allow it to trade shares publicly without underwriting pressures, lock-in periods, and listing prices.Last month, Spotify and Tencent entered into an equity swap agreement that valued Spotify at $20 billion.","According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the US streaming music accounted for a majority of the retail music industry revenues. For the first half of 2017, retail revenues grew 17% to $4 billion, of which streaming services accounted for $2.5 billion and grew 48% over the year. Revenue from listeners paying to listen to streaming platforms like Spotify (MUSIC) and Apple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL) grew 61% over the year to $1.7 billion. Of this, $0.3 billion came from ad-supported on-demand options and $0.5 billion from listeners paying for radio services. About 30 million people in the country listen to a streaming music site.According to another report from MIDia, Spotify leads the market with nearly 35% share in 2016. Apple Music came in second with a 16% market share.Sweden-based Spotify was founded in 2006 by serial entrepreneur Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Its music streaming app was released in 2008. Like other streaming services, Spotify allows listeners to listen to digital music, create, share, and edit playlists and discover music based on recommendations. Over the past few years, the company has tied up with device manufacturers to allow gaming and streaming boxes to stream music through them. Currently, Spotify has 70 million subscribers around the world.The company earns revenues through an ad-based and a subscription-based model. Users have the choice to listen to an ad-supported channel or can pay a $9.99 a month subscription fee to listen to ad-free music. The subscription also allows listeners to download music to listen to it offline.The rapid adoption of the service has translated into high revenue growth. Revenues for fiscal 2016 grew 52% to $3.5 billion. According to more recent reports, revenues are expected to grow another 40% in 2017 to €4.1 billion (~$4.9 billion). For the first half of 2017, revenues had come in at €1.9 billion (~$2.2 billion). High revenues have not, however, translated into profits. Spotify continues to spend significantly on royalty and distribution costs. Losses for 2017 are expected to decline to €200 million (~$231 million) from €557 million (~$660 million) in 2016.Spotify has been venture-funded so far with $2.71 billion in venture funding from Asset Management Partners, Baillie Gifford, D.E. Shaw & Co., Discovery Capital, Goldman Sachs, GSV Capital, Halcyon Asset Management, Lansdowne Partners, Northzone, Rinkelberg Capital, Senvest Capital, Technology Crossover Ventures, TeliaSonera, Alexandre Mars, AFSquare, Fidelity Ventures, Lakestar, The Coca-Cola Company, 137 Ventures, Accel Partners, DST Global, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Founders Fund, Sean Parker, Horizons Ventures, and Li Ka-shing. Its valuation is estimated to have grown to $20 billion from $8 billion in March 2016.Recently, the company announced that it had filed with the SEC to go public. Unlike traditional IPOs, Spotify is pursuing the direct listing method that would allow it to trade its shares publicly without underwriting pressures, lock-in periods, and listing prices. As part of this move, the company also recently cleaned out its balance sheet. It converted its TPG and Dragoneer Investment-funded convertible $1 billion debt to equity at a $10 billion valuation. Last month, Spotify and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) entered into an equity swap agreement that valued Spotify at $20 billion.But not all is rosy in Spotify's world. Last month, it was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc for damages worth at least $1.6 billion. Wixen is alleging that Spotify used thousands of songs without a license and compensation to the publisher. Wixen is known for administering music by performers like Tom Petty, Zach De La Rocha, and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, David Cassidy, Neil Young, and Stevie Nicks, to name a few.This is not the first time that Spotify has been sued. Last year, it settled a class action suit with a payout of $43 million. It also settled another lawsuit with the National Music Publishers' Association for $30 million. Spotify is not too concerned about the lawsuit.It will be interesting to see how the market truly values Spotify. Rival Pandora (NYSE:P) hasn't had a jolly run on the stock exchange.

It also says it has 159 million MAUs (Monthly Active Users), which are both Premium and ad-supported listeners, as of December 31, 2017.The free, ad-supported serves as the ‘on-ramp’ to the Premium service, so in that respect, Spotify has a ‘freemium’ business model.Management says its service ‘is nearly double the scale of [its] closest competitor, Apple Music.’The firm operates the service as a two-sided marketplace, providing, it believes, benefits to users in the form of an easy-to-use, personalized service.For content creators, it provides distribution and the ability to help artists connect with existing and new listeners based on its ‘curation algorithms and data assets that surface new music to Users in playlists, to physical billboards, branded events, and personalize campaigns.’MarketAccording to a mid-year 2017 report by the RIAA as cited in a Billboard analysis, the U.S. streaming industry grew by 50% in number of subscribers through June 30 vs. 2016.Total digital revenue was $3.2 billion for 1H 2017, up 48% over the previous year’s period.Additionally, subscription revenues increased by 61%, while ad-supported revenues increased only 37%.The RIAA cited the comparatively low advertising revenue growth as problematic for its music creator members since they receive differing royalty amounts depending on the type of revenue stream.Globally, management says that the recorded music industry has returned to growth after several years of declining revenues and that the growth is due to the transition by consumers to streaming services.As smartphone use becomes widespread and wireless networks more capable, the ability to distribute streaming music is expected to continue to increase into new markets worldwide.CompetitionMajor competitive vendors that provide music streaming services include:In addition, the firm competes with Internet radio services such as LastFM, SiriusXM (SIRI) and iHeartRadio. Terrestrial radio stations are also competitors.Management says that its differentiated service which can personalize listening entertainment at scale to users while providing a platform for creators to develop fan bases is an important competitive advantage.FinancialsSPOT’s recent financial results can be summarized as follows:Below are the company’s operational results for the past five years (Audited IFRS):(Source: Spotify F-1)Revenue ($)Gross Profit ($)Gross Margin (%)Cash Flow from Operations ($)As of December 31, 2017, the company had $1.84 billion in cash & short-term investments and $3.5 billion in total liabilities.IPO DetailsSPOT intends to raise $1 billion in gross proceeds from an IPO of its ordinary shares, although the final amount may vary widely from that stated intention.There are no separate classes of shares, but the firm has ‘issues ten beneficiary certificates per ordinary share held of record (excluding warrants, options, and RSUs, as applicable) to entities beneficially owned by our founders, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon.’These ‘beneficiary certificates’ entitle the founders to retain voting control of the company aside from their economic rights, so effective act as a multiple share class in function, entrenching the founders.There will be no ‘underwriters’ as in a standard IPO. Instead, the company will attempt to discover price through an “Investor Day,” instead of through a roadshow. In addition, the firm will ‘engage in certain other investor education meetings.’The firm will also not specify a set number of shares to be sold in advance of the offering. Rather, it will decide just prior to the floatation and will transfer that number of shares to the NYSE.It is still unknown how the firm will set an expected minimum asking price, other than through its own opaque process. Buy orders will then be filled according to the price it sets in conjunction with the NYSE.Since there will be no underwriters ‘to help stabilize, maintain, or affect the public price’ of its shares, there may be significant volatility in early days of trading.Management did not disclose how it will use the proceeds from the sale of shares.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4137725,104090,2018-01-16T10:07:52-05:00,"A direct listing provides positives and negatives vs. an IPO.Spotify is in a unique position to succeed in its direct listing.Spotify is a long buy at the end of 2018.Hedging techniques are required to combat the bear case.Importance of closely monitoring Spotify's lawsuit, future prospects and cost-cutting ability during and after the listing.","In the current technological climate, music is more accessible than ever. It is difficult to go about your day and not be exposed to music, whether it is from streaming services or out in public. However, it is questionable for a company's ability to profit from an industry in which its customers are reluctant to spend their income on a service, which could be obtained for free. In comes Spotify, a platform that has not only proved this is possible, but has also set the standard for the new age of digital media. When analyzing Spotify's direct listing, we need to consider the details of a direct listing, Spotify's current position and the company's competitors.Source: SpotifyThere are considerable benefits to Spotify performing a direct listing instead of a traditional IPO. For instance, the direct listing process is considerably cheaper than an IPO in terms of cash and time. There are no investment banks who handle the book-building and roadshow processes. This means less fees paid by the company for a public listing and more time spent on its future growth prospects. Additionally, a direct listing will not cause share dilution, as no new shares are being issued like in an IPO. This will mean preexisting shareholders such as executives and management will be able to keep their respective control over Spotify.However, these benefits do not come without their drawbacks. There is no minimum time length for investors to hold onto Spotify's shares when the direct listing goes through. This means that investors can change their positions with no restrictions (albeit limited to transaction costs), resulting in highly volatile price changes for Spotify's shares upon listing. This could be problematic if Spotify wished to establish a steady market capitalization during the early days of the listing.As mentioned, the company has shown an ability to profit from a previously losing industry. This ability lies in the number of subscribers Spotify has relative to its two closest competitors, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music.Currently, Spotify is leading the subscriber count with 70 million, followed by Apple Music with 30 million and finally Amazon Music with reportedly 16 million. With Spotify's dominant position in subscribers, it is easy to see why it has achieved what many other companies have failed.Here is a comparison of each company's music deals:Additionally, Apple Music and Spotify both have about the same amount of music in their library at 40 million, while Amazon Music only has 2 million. Apple Music also offers a free three-month trial while Spotify offers a free 30-day trial for Premium. Spotify can be used for free without Premium, whereas Apple Music can only be used through the free trial or by payment.Based on the services offered by each company, Apple Music and Spotify both offer similar services at similar rates, ahead of Amazon Music. The main difference between Apple Music and Spotify is that one must spend to use Apple Music after the free trial, while Spotify can be used without payment, still with large access to its library. In this sense, Spotify has a distinct advantage over Apple Music and Amazon Music in that it offers a value deal and extends its influence among its users, even if they do not pay for Premium. Due to this, Spotify is in prime position to perform well in its direct listing and in the foreseeable future.Source: SpotifyTo quantify Spotify's potential, it is important to perform a DCF and comparable multiples analysis against Apple Music and Amazon Music. When performing the DCF on Spotify, there are many assumptions, which must be made:When combining these assumptions with others and public information on Spotify, we obtain the following intrinsic values (use of exchange rate 1.1717€/$ as a simple moving average on 13/01/2017):Additionally, an assumption worth highlighting is Spotify's convertible notes. It is possible that the company has already paid down a sizable portion of its convertible notes in 2017, especially going into the direct listing. This will result in a lower WACC and a higher implied equity value, hence a slightly higher intrinsic value calculated. This will more than likely be reflected in Spotify's market price once listed.Building on the DCF, we can perform comparable multiples analysis to get a better idea of Spotify's position against Apple Music and Amazon Music. Again, assumptions must be made with regards to the companies:When combining these assumptions with others and public information on Apple, Amazon and Spotify, we obtain the following multiples:Spotify FY17-FY26 are forecasts based on FY14-FY16 informationApple Music's and Amazon Music's Price/Sales ratio and EBITDA multipleThe key takeaways from the above graphs are the low price/sales ratio for Spotify in all cases relative to Apple Music's and Amazon Music's, the change in EBITDA multiple for Spotify at the end of FY18 to FY19 for the base and bull cases and the change in EBITDA multiple for Spotify at the end of FY19 to FY20 for the bear case.The price/sales ratio of Spotify is forecast to decline over the next 9 years and is significantly lower compared to Apple Music's and Amazon Music's. This means Spotify is undervalued and its share price is likely to increase for a convergence to its competitors' price/sales ratio in the future.The EBITDA multiple makes a significant jump during FY19 for the base and bull cases of Spotify. This is because Spotify is forecast to first earn a positive EBITDA during FY19 for the two cases. This indicates how the company is undervalued at the end of FY18 relative to its competitors. Hence, increasing the EBITDA multiple to between Apple Music's and Amazon Music's already mature multiples; Amazon Music's EBITDA multiple is below Spotify and Apple Music's EBITDA multiple is above.Similarly, the EBITDA multiple makes a significant jump during FY20 for the bear case of Spotify. This is because Spotify is forecast to first earn a positive EBITDA during FY20. This is relative to the base and bull cases of Spotify, where a positive EBITDA is earned earlier during FY19. In this case, it is forecast that it will take the market longer to recognize how undervalued Spotify is before making a similar run during FY20 as in the base and bull cases during FY19. Spotify's EBITDA also rises slightly above Amazon Music's, but is below Apple Music's mature multiples.It is also common for a firm's shares to be underpriced in an IPO and it is likely it isn't going to be any different through a direct listing. This is due to the ""market feedback hypothesis,"" where Spotify might be unsure of the ""true value"" of the firm and information on its value must be induced through underpricing. If we use the average initial return of IPOs in the U.S., we can expect the direct listing to even surpass 16.9% on the first day. This is due to the volatile nature of a direct-listing and Spotify's public listing into a niche market.Source: SpotifyA risk that is present during Spotify's direct listing is the influence of the $1.6 billion copyright lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that Spotify used thousands of songs without license or compensation to music publishers. If there are truths to the lawsuit, Spotify could potentially lose the long-term licensing deals it already signed with all three major record labels. This is problematic as this helped keep certain songs restricted only for paying subscribers and the lawsuit could give no value to paying subscribers.Spotify could save time and money of the lawsuit by settling. However, Spotify has previously settled a similar lawsuit with a $43 million settlement. This was challenged, and the current lawsuit has resulted, so it is difficult to predict whether Spotify can conclude this problem before its direct listing.Another risk would be Spotify's ability to produce a positive EBITDA at FY19. This can be difficult if cost of revenue continues to increase at the same significant rate of 86.35% per year on average. Spotify can easily mitigate this risk by performing cost-saving actions, such as optimizing business processes and improving controls of administrative processes. Another tangible cause for poor EBITDA performance is a significant stagnation or decline in Spotify's market share. This can be mitigated through developing innovative services or products and to a more aggressive extent, future acquisitions of media streaming services.In terms of investor risks, a major one is that the market does not receive the direct listing well and it takes longer for Spotify's share price to reach its intrinsic value. This is likely to be true as Spotify is a highly speculative investment and cyclical in nature. Hedging techniques can be used to mitigate this risk through diversification, such as taking long positions in companies that are non-cyclical in nature. This is due to the uncorrelated nature of cyclical and non-cyclical company stocks.The cumulative rolling returns between cyclical and defensive shares diverges from October 2016, showing their uncorrelated behaviourAccording to the base and bear cases, Spotify's shares should be bought at the end of 2018 and held for one year. This is because Spotify is forecast to have a positive EBITDA from 2019 onward and will be negative until then. Additionally, Spotify is expected to mature during 2020, hence the momentum will subside after holding for a year.In the event of a bear case, Spotify's shares should be bought at the end of 2019 and held for one year. Similarly, with the base and bull cases, Spotify is forecast to have a positive EBITDA from 2020 onward and will be negative until then. In this case, Spotify is expected to mature during 2021, hence the momentum will subside after holding for a year.Overall, Spotify's shares should be bought at the end of 2018 and held for one year. If Spotify gives signals to the market that they will be unable to earn a positive EBITDA during 2019, one can continue to hold Spotify's shares and hedge for a year during 2019, reduce the size of the hedge at the end of 2019, before holding the shares until the end of 2020.Hedging should be performed in non-cyclical companies in food, utilities or blue-chip stocks such as a long position in Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE:RDS.A) and US Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE: USFD).Source: Stock photoInvesting in technology and more so streaming services has historically not been favorable for investors. However, with due diligence and market insight, we can maximize our chances with succeeding with the correct stock pick. Spotify is expected to earn a positive EBITDA in 2019 in the base and bull cases. When this is coupled with a forecast strong increase in EBITDA multiple and a low price/sales ratio, share price is ready to experience growth during 2019 before reaching maturity and diminishing after a year.This will make a long position in Spotify at the end of 2018 for a one year holding period profitable. However, it is possible for a bear case to arise, in which hedging takes place during 2019. This is followed by a reduction in the hedge at the end of 2019, before holding Spotify for an additional year. Hedging can be achieved in long positions in non-cyclical/defensive stocks.Note: This article was written with assistance from Bill Zhong."

Benefitting from this trend is Billion-Dollar Unicorn Spotify (MUSIC), which is reportedly gearing up for a direct listing.Stockholm, Sweden,-based Spotify was founded in 2006 by serial entrepreneur Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. The two developed and released the Spotify Swedish music streaming app in 2008.Its app provides listeners with access to millions of digital music files from record labels and artists. Listeners also can use Spotify to create, share, and edit playlists with other users. It is also a music discovery site that provides music recommendations based on listening history and even creates a random playlist related to preferred artists. Besides mobile apps, Spotify also has expanded its market reach through tie-ups with companies like Sony (NYSE:SNE) to allow listeners to stream music through the PlayStation.Since its release, the app has seen rapid adoption. Today, it has over 140 million regular listeners of which 60 million are paid subscribers around the world.Last week, Spotify unveiled a new app called Spotify for Artists. It is a one-stop mobile version of its existing artist-centric dashboard client for tracking real-time statistics for new music, updating profiles, and gathering metrics about who is actually listening.This year, Spotify has acquired four companies for about 39 million euros ($42 million) in a combination of cash and stock.In May, it acquired French AI startup Niland for its machine learning tools. The Niland team joined Spotify's research and development division in New York as part of the buyout.In April, Spotify acquired blockchain firm Mediachain to move toward a more transparent and rewarding music industry for creators and rights owners.In March, Spotify bought UK startup Sonalytic to both improve publishing data and reap the benefits of audio recognition technology. It also took over TV recommendation platform MightyTV to boost Spotify's programmatic advertising abilities.Spotify operates on an ad-based and a subscription-based model. The free subscription model is supported through advertising revenues. Subscribers can upgrade to a $9.99 per month rate plan to get an ad-free service that also allows them to download and listen to music offline.Spotify has seen strong revenue growth. Revenues for fiscal 2016 grew by an impressive 52% to 2.93 billion euros ($3.5 billion) with paid subscriptions accounting for 90% of the revenue. However, profitability remains a concern, thanks to increasing licensing and operation costs. Royalty and distribution costs were about 85% of the revenue. Losses in 2016 grew 200% or doubled to 557 million euros ($660 million).By region, US accounted for 40% of revenue and grew 58%, UK accounted for 12% and grew 27.5%, Sweden accounted for 7% and grew 11%, and the rest of the world grew 65%.It recently reported that for the first half of 2017, it recorded revenue of $2.2 billion and is on track to grow 40% by the end of the year. Gross margins increased to 22% from 15% in 2016. Operating loss was between 100 million and 200 million euros ($118.4 million and $236.8 million), which suggests some improvement in profitability.Spotify has raised $1.56 billion in venture funding from Asset Management Partners, Baillie Gifford, D.E. Shaw & Co., Discovery Capital, Goldman Sachs, GSV Capital, Halcyon Asset Management, Lansdowne Partners, Northzone, Rinkelberg Capital, Senvest Capital, Technology Crossover Ventures, TeliaSonera, Alexandre Mars, AFSquare, Fidelity Ventures, Lakestar, The Coca-Cola Company, 137 Ventures, Accel Partners, DST Global, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Founders Fund, Sean Parker, Horizons Ventures, and Li Ka-shing. In March 2016, it raised $1 billion in convertible debt and was valued at over $8 billion. As of late September 2017, private trades in Spotify shares were valuing it at about $16 billion.Spotify has been thinking of going public for quite a while. However, the market has been harsh to companies like Snap (NYSE:SNAP) that are struggling to show profits. To avoid the heartache of an IPO, Spotify has opted for a direct listing. According to the Wall Street Journal, a direct listing would allow Spotify to trade its shares publicly and there would be no restrictions on when insiders can sell their shares. However, it would not allow it to raise money as in a traditional IPO. It would primarily provide liquidity for its shareholders. Several analysts are skeptical about this move.Last year, Spotify had taken loans of $1.5 billion that came with very strict covenants. The terms of the loan expect Spotify to pay big premiums in case an IPO is delayed over a year. This debt problem is probably forcing its hand to go public soon, even though the move poses risks due to its fundamental business model challenges."
4141018,102107,2018-01-30T08:00:10-05:00,"In an investor's never-ending quest for alpha, initial public offerings (IPOs) can provide potentially valuable opportunities.Donovan Jones joins the Roundtable to talk about his vast venture capital and IPO experience, and why he thinks he can offer investors an edge in the IPO space.Donovan also discusses one of his best IPO calls, his biggest regret, and Spotify's potential ""direct listing"" on the NYSE.","Innovation and creativity are the cornerstones of the entrepreneurial spirit. For many entrepreneurs who start a company in a corner of their garage or a spot on the dining room table, their ultimate dream is that someday their invention will capture the hearts and minds - and wallets - of consumers, and that they'll actually be able to make a living doing what they love and are passionate about. Still others hope they'll have an opportunity to secure funding from venture capital (VC) investors, grow their small company into a thriving business, then sell it at a sizable profit to a willing buyer, or sell shares of it to investors on the public markets via an initial public offering (IPO). That's over-simplifying the process a bit, but there's no denying it: IPOs are an attractive opportunity on both sides of the transaction (pre- and post-offering), and there are potentially sizable rewards to be had for patient investors with an appetite for risk and oftentimes wild volatility.That said, IPOs' rocky terrain can be tricky to navigate - that's where investing with an expert like Donovan Jones can really come in handy. Donovan is the CEO and founder of VentureDeal, a North America-focused venture capital database, and he's been tracking high-growth, disruptive technology, life sciences, and consumer companies for more than a decade. As someone who's consistently kept his finger on the pulse of a company's entire lifecycle from inception to IPO or purchase, he's uniquely qualified to discern the wheat from the chaff when it comes to IPOs. That's what he does in his Marketplace service, IPO Edge, where he offers deep insights into IPO opportunities, which ones to pay attention to, and which ones to avoid.Donovan joined the Roundtable to talk about his process for finding unique, potentially lucrative IPO opportunities; offer his outlook for IPOs and M&A in 2018; and share his excitement and thoughts on the rumored Spotify (MUSIC) IPO.Seeking Alpha: How did you come to start investing in IPOs? What about them appeals to you as an investor?Donovan Jones: I've run a venture capital database that tracks technology startups throughout N. America, so I've been interested in the entire lifecycle of high growth startups, from company inception to IPO or acquisition.In an increasingly index-driven financial world, IPOs represent a potential way to generate market-beating alpha. I also generally like the value proposition of technology firms, whether general tech or life sciences, in that they seek to either dramatically improve existing processes or treatments, or create entirely new ways of advancing human potential.So, I'm an optimist and IPOs can be a way to invest in concert with that optimism, tempered by discipline, of course.SA: What criteria do you use when seeking out opportunities? What makes a ""quality"" IPO opportunity for you? Conversely, how do you determine which IPOs to avoid?DJ: It depends on the industry, but IPOs are really about the company's growth story. I research a firm's past results and future growth projections within the industry to determine whether the firm's business model is delivering on management's growth story.IPOs are also about quantifying risks - management, market, financing, valuation, regulatory, currency and other risks are important to have a clear view of before an investor can make an educated choice on whether an IPO is a potentially good investment.Also, I dig deep into each IPO's regulatory filings to uncover anomalies or patterns of disclosure on various aspects of the offering. I can quickly determine whether management is communicating fully or putting out 'boilerplate' to obscure a clear picture about the firm's condition and prospects. I don't hesitate to call out inadequate or non-standard disclosures as well as poor performance or mediocre growth prospects, to help readers understand which IPOs are ones to avoid.SA: You're the President and CEO of VentureDeal, which is a database that captures information about venture capital and VC-backed companies. For those unfamiliar with the lifecycle of a VC investment, how does that translate to finding and vetting IPO opportunities?DJ: VCs make very early stage investments in startups and ideally support them as capital partners through an exit, sometimes in the public markets through an IPO.The venture capital business thrives on the IPO market and the M&A market in order to realize gains for its investors, which are pension funds, endowments, and others. So, VCs are very interested in IPOs, which tend to provide the potential for the greatest return vs. M&A deals.As investors being essentially asked to purchase VC stock from these firms at the IPO, it is incumbent upon us to clearly understand the companies we consider investing in, their past financial results, risks, and potential for growth.My job is that as I follow tech companies through their lifecycle, I'm well-placed to understand the histories of many of these IPO candidates, their investor base, and what their prospects are as public companies.SA: What are your thoughts on the macro environment for IPOs right now? Is 2018 shaping up to be a good year for new issues?DJ: For IPOs, 2018 has started off with a bang. January saw 16 IPOs, one of the strongest first-month results in many years.A number of industry participants are forecasting 'bumper years' for 2018 and 2019, while others still believe the amount of private investment at low prices will keep many private companies from needing to tap public markets.Ultimately, the IPO market is a function of three major forces: the overall stock market outlook, the level of pricing visibility, and the availability of private equity at reasonable prices.So, if early indications are a sign, 2018 will likely be a robust year for many types of privately held companies.SA: What type of investor would you say is best suited for IPO investing? There are some risks involved, right? What are they, and what are you and IPO Edge members doing to mitigate those risks?DJ: Investors in IPOs are typically those who want to assume additional risk for the opportunity of a higher return. Companies that IPO are frequently disruptive forces in the industry in which they operate.Being able to become comfortable with a particular investment thesis for an IPO candidate is an ideal trait for an IPO investor.The risks for investors generally come from unknowns about the company's business environment. By following IPO candidates before they go public, IPO Edge can provide insight and research to minimize these unknowns.Additionally, in a rising market such as the current one, investors can make the mistake of overpaying for an IPO. I call this the ""IPO FOMO"" fallacy, or the fear of missing out when a company's stock 'pops' on IPO day.At IPO Edge, we perform numerous valuation calculations for each IPO to help investors quantify a reasonable price. I'm not shy about emphasizing discipline in order to avoid overpaying.SA: You're obviously a seasoned IPO investor. What are some of the things you know about investing in IPOs that a more novice investor might not? What pitfalls or red flags should investors watch out for in general?DJ: Although different investors have different trading timeframes, my focus is generally not on the first day 'pop'; rather it is on the company's fundamentals over the medium-term.Frequently, an IPO stock will do well in the first few days, only to see its stock drop back down to the IPO level followed by a more meaningful rise over a longer period. I call this the 'pop and drop' response.So, novice IPO investors would do well to first watch a few IPOs in their early public trading dynamics.The best advice I can provide new IPO investors is to do as much research on particular companies or industries (use services like IPO Edge to help) and become knowledgeable about specific companies within those industries.When new IPO opportunities arise, you will be better able to determine your interest level and more discerning when it comes to how much you're willing to pay for an investment.SA: Related to that, what would you say has been your best IPO call to date, and what makes it so? Any ""regrettable"" calls? If so, what were the biggest lessons learned from those?DJ: My best call for IPOs has been in the oilfield service provider sector. In the first half of 2017, a number of these firms wanted to go public but had poor financials due to intense pricing pressure in an industry with sub-$50/bbl. oil.For that reason, I panned many of them. They remained private and with the improving oil price to now $65/bbl., their financial results have dramatically turned around, as has my interest in them as a group.Accordingly, the oilfield service providers have performed extremely well for investors, and I believe they will continue to do so as long as oil stays above $50/bbl.A call I missed was the IPO of Veritone (VERI). I wrote that the company was little more than an aggregator of other search technology and sprinkled the phrase 'artificial intelligence' just to make themselves look good.For some months after the IPO, VERI went nowhere, then shot up from $10 to $65 per share in one month. So, I missed that delayed, post-IPO runup. Ultimately, it appears investors are getting wiser, as the stock has dropped back down to the mid $20s.Other missed calls would be in the biopharma space, which I don't really 'regret' since they are such high risk, binary outcome IPOs. A few have popped dramatically based on post-IPO announcements for major collaboration agreements and the like.For me, the lessons learned are to continue to perform fundamental analysis on companies and provide my opinion as I see it, based on all the known information at the time.If you invest enough in quality IPOs, you will develop a portfolio of winners over the longer term with the fun of a few 'pops' along the way.SA: What is one current idea you're really excited about right now, and what's the story?DJ: In 2018, I believe we'll see an increase in the number and visibility of technology IPOs. Although private money is still plentiful and cheap, a number of these companies have already indicated a desire to IPO soon.One notable IPO will likely be the rumored Spotify direct listing. Spotify is a music streaming firm with millions of users and is a significant player in the music and podcast entertainment industry, so its IPO will generate quite a lot of attention.Spotify's 'direct listing' IPO is being designed with the help of the NYSE to sell shares directly to the general public without much help from traditional investment banks running the process. They'll still be involved in helping to determine pricing, but Spotify will place its shares with the NYSE and any investor will be able to place a bid for shares. Spotify, in concert with NYSE, will then effectively decide on the final pricing of the IPO as well as decide share allocations depending on demand and share availability.We still don't know the details of Spotify's financials as its registration statement has not been made public yet. But, if the firm moves forward, I believe the IPO will gain as much attention as the Google IPO that used a similar albeit modified version of the same approach.So, 2018 should see increased IPO activity and some new wrinkles to the traditional IPO process. IPO Edge will be there researching, analyzing, and ultimately helping IPO investors navigate these potential alpha-generating opportunities.***Thanks to Donovan for sharing his IPO savvy on the Roundtable.

4131447,56952,2017-12-12T19:59:00-05:00,"Many expect Spotify to go public next year.Recent trades suggest a valuation between $16b and $20b.Altough Spotify never made a profit, I believe it's a good investment.Spotify operates in a high-growth market and owns very valuable data.Becoming a ""360 music platform"" eventually makes Spotify profitable.","Music streaming service Spotify (MUSIC) will go public sooner rather than later. Reuters reported a valuation around $16 billion ahead of the expected IPO, while Fortune valued the company at $20 billion in September of this year. Apart from the numbers and the final valuation, Spotify going public is one of the events I really look forward to. Considering the music industry and Spotify's position within it, I'm confident the company will amaze investors with strong growth numbers, both top and bottom line.Over the past few years, revenue in the U.S. music industry finally picked up after years of decline. The industry generated $7.65 billion in revenue in 2016, the first double-digit growth in 20 years according to Billboard. It was income from streaming services that overtook physical sales for the first time in history. This trend continued in the first months of 2017. Streaming revenue is expected to grow 48% in 2017 compared to 2016.The stellar growth numbers mentioned above may have silenced long-time streaming critics, like superstar Taylor Swift. Swift announced her exit from Spotify, claiming her role to protect music creators from Spotify's business model. In short, Swift believed Spotify wasn't paying her (and her colleagues) enough royalties. At the time, this publicity stunt turned out to be positive for Swift, selling lots and lots of (physical) albums and downloads. However, she returned to Spotify earlier this year.In the meantime, Spotify's business model hasn't changed at all. There's still an ad-supported free tier and two paid subscription services, the premium tier and family premium tier. Streaming services typically pay between 70% and 72.5% to rights holders, according to Billboard. This includes all royalty payments and payments to songwriters. With streaming revenue growing and growing, rights holders find bigger and bigger paychecks as well. This is why Spotify's business model will work long term. Nobody wants to be excluded from a pie worth $7.65 billion (in the U.S. alone), growing at close to 50% per year.One of the main business risks for Spotify is the lack of license deals with major rights holders. Most of the rights are held by the three major labels and all of their sub labels: Universal Music, owned by French media concern Vivendi (OTCPK:VIVEF), Sony Music (SNE) and privately held Warner Music. Spotify was able to strike new long-term licensing deals with all three major labels this year. Signing these new deals, Spotify ensures the availability of a large portion of the world's music catalog, a crucial move to keep customers happy and grow subscription users and revenue in the future.Streaming revenue growth is not over yet, a conclusion shared by Spotify's chief digital officer Ole Obermann. He stated on Instagram: “Even with the current pace of growth, there’s still so much potential for music subscription to reach new audiences and territories.” I couldn't agree more.With already 150 million active users and nearly 65 million paying subscribers, Spotify has the ability to grow its user base to the likes of Facebook (FB). Music is adored by billions all around the globe. And due to technological developments (e.g. increase in smartphone sales, better and faster digital networks) and global economic growth, people will find streaming music more accessible.An interesting report from The Information projects a 40% growth rate for the full year of 2017. Revenue will exceed $4 billion for the first time this year. Based on a $16 billion valuation, this equals less than 4x this year's revenue. Even more promising, Spotify was able to increase gross margin to 22% in the first of half 2017, up from 15% in 2016. The bottom line remained weak with a operating loss between $118 million and $236 million. Critics may argue that a valuation between $16 billion and $20 billion, despite revenue growth in the future, is very high for a company that never turned billions in revenue into a bottom line profit. An argument that's solid, I admit. When Facebook and other fast-growing technology companies went public, I was skeptical at first as well. A high level of R&D spending, SG&A costs and stock-based compensation leads to losses at first. However, investors should look past Spotify as a streaming service alone. Facebook also isn't just a social media platform, it's much more than that.In my opinion, Spotify has to be valued at its potential and potential doesn't stop at offering a streaming platform to music fans. Spotify has very valuable data that it can monetize. For example, it can integrate a platform for artists to interact with fans more direct. Also, fanbase information can be used to plan where artists will perform their shows. At this point, Spotify offers a limited version of this information to artists, calling it Spotify Artist. I can see a paid subscription service with more detailed information and options to interact with fans. Even better, I can see major record labels spend a large portion of their lofty marketing budgets on targeted marketing campaigns at Spotify, all supported with data from its users.Also, playlists are important for Spotify. Although people can start their own playlist for others to follow, Spotify itself has the playlists with the largest amount of followers. Naturally, song selection can be supported by the user data the company has. As a result, it can pick songs much more efficient than independent creators. By creating relevant playlists, users will have a better product experience and are likely to switch to a subscription more easy. This will increase revenue.A very recent move is the acquisition of an online recording studio, making it even more easy for artists to record a song and release it (on Spotify of course). This may not impact top and bottom line in the short run, but it indicates what Spotify intends to do in the future. I expect Spotify to become a ""360 music platform,"" servicing both music creators, record labels and fans.Another very recent move is the swap of a 10% stake in each other's business by Spotify and the music business of Tencent Holdings (OTCPK:TCEHY). Tencent will pay Spotify an amount in cash to cover the valuation difference between the two companies. Not only is it nice to have a strategic partner in the Chinese market, it will give both Spotify and Tencent greater advantage in royalty negotiations with rights holders. This could potentially lead to lower royalty payments per stream and better gross margins.Smartphones and better wireless networks, combined with high economic growth all around the world, will enable more people to enter the market for music streaming. Spotify, as the world's number one streaming service, will grow users and revenue even further. Another valuable asset is Spotify's user date, which the company can use to optimize its playlists or even monetize the data. In the end, Spotify is much more than just a streaming service. It will become an important music platform, servicing artists, fans and record labels. With that in mind, a valuation of $16 billion to $20 billion is relatively cheap in my opinion. Especially as I expect gross margins to improve over time due to better licensing deals with rights holders. Altogether, I really look forward to Spotify's IPO and expect Spotify to grow revenue, improve margins and become a profitable company soon after its IPO."
4133746,101979,2017-12-25T05:58:32-05:00,Unicorn music streaming company Spotify would like to sell on the New York Stock Exchange without going through the traditional process of funding an IPO.The company's valuation ranges from $8 billion to $20 billion.Companies such as Airbnb and Uber look forward to the outcome of Spotify's direct listing as they decide when and how they would like to go public.The SEC is expected to make a decision on the NYSE direct listing proposal by February.,"To begin the new year, Spotify has been making moves to become a public company. However, the Swedish music powerhouse plans to breeze the traditional route of an IPO. Rather, the company hopes to put its existing private stock on the public market (NYSE) to avoid high investment banking costs. Direct listings have many upsides for “unicorn” companies, or startups with valuations over $1 billion. However, without underwriters to stabilize the price, there is a risk that Spotify shares might drop on the first few days of trading.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve Spotify’s request to avoid the traditional initial public offering. However, the NYSE itself must alter its listing standards if it wants Spotify and other viable startups to go public on direct listings. In March, the NYSE filed a motion with the SEC to allow this unusual tactic. Direct listings allow hot companies to trade shares publicly without having restrictions on when insiders can sell nor raising money to fund an IPO. This move makes fiscal sense for unicorn companies. If a company has enough cash to be publicly traded without an underwriting, it should be allowed to go public without all the externalities that come with an IPO.The Nasdaq has the ability to trade companies in this way already. Allowing the NYSE to do the same would make the rules of the game much more fair. The SEC has given the NYSE a preliminary nod for this move.The Nasdaq historically has been the direct listing exchange. According to Alexander Osipovich and Maureen Farrell of the Wall Street Journal, the “Nasdaq has completed about a half-dozen direct listings of private companies since 2006, while the NYSE has had none.” However, pending approval by the SEC, the NYSE could hop aboard the direct listing bandwagon and ensure that Spotify sells on its platform. Following the win of the highly coveted Snap Inc. IPO, the addition of Spotify to the exchange could give the NYSE a leg up on its competition.For a private company to complete a direct listing, it must have $100 million of publicly held shares ready to be sold on the exchange. The NYSE relies on a valuation from a third party to ensure that the company has the capital to make this move. Spotify will have no problem meeting the $100 million opening, as its valuation is now close to $20 billion, based on a valuation by Tencent Holdings Ltd. The lowest valuation the company has received was $8.5 billion back in 2015 by SharesPost.The SEC will make a decision on the matter by February 15. One concern that the commission has is that some companies that have risky financial profiles will take advantage of the new policy. For example, one possibility is that a speculative company goes public and realizes that its model will not be profitable in the future. Direct listings allow management shareholders to sell their shares whenever they like. This will pose a risk to these companies' investors who do not have access to the same information.""Unicorn"" Market Value Comparison - WSJThe competitors in the music streaming industry, Pandora (NYSE:P), Apple Music (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon’s music services (NASDAQ: AMZN), don’t compare with the platform that Spotify has grown. Spotify has 140 million active users, while Pandora has 77.9 million, Apple Music has 30 million, and Amazon Prime Music less than 10 million users. As the juggernaut in the music streaming industry, the move to the NYSE could help the company stay ahead.But this all comes in the face of an increasing competitive landscape in the streaming industry. Per Daniel Sparks of the Motley Fool, Pandora’s subscriptions are up 29% year over year, and Apple Music’s user base has grown 10 million since December of last year. Amazon Prime Music and Apple Music have parent companies that have far more capital than Spotify. This is why many investors believe that the network effect will draw users from Spotify and bring them to more ubiquitous platforms such as Apple Music. If Spotify goes public in the near future, the company needs to show its users that it has what it takes to compete with these media conglomerates in the long run. Yes, Spotify holds the reins on the music streaming industry for the time being, but when your biggest competitor is Apple, the future of your company is not certain.Companies like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (AIRB), which have remained private, will look to Spotify as an exemplar of what they should do in the future. If the move works out for the music platform, these two companies which are highly valued and cash-rich could become publicly traded by the end of 2019."

By liking or disliking songs, Pandora could hone in on what type of music its customers really wanted to listen to.The company offers two models: an ad-free subscription model at ~$5 per month (or ~$55/year) or a free, ad-based model.Because of Pandora's current streaming model, it never had to get permission from record labels, as consumers couldn't listen to specific songs on demand. But that looks set to change.According to reports, Pandora could be on the verge of on-demand streaming, with plans to offer two monthly subscription options. Apparently, the company ""is close to reaching deals with major record companies that will allow it to do so both in the U.S. and new overseas markets,"" according to the WSJ.Assuming this is all true, it's a very interesting development. Companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Spotify (MUSIC) already offer on-demand listening for a subscription, so it will be interesting to see how Pandora does against its competition.Some view the move as too late. Others argue that it's what's needed for the company to move to another class. Investors have certainly been hungry for the stock to be acquired. It's not clear that Pandora is actively pursuing that route, or if by returning to growth (assuming its on-demand service does that) will make it more or less appealing to a buyer.Samsung Taking Share in India; Fending Off AppleJust yesterday, we detailed Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) as its shares surged to new record highs amid a gain in smartphone sales and ahead of the launch of its Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on Friday.In Thursday's piece (linked above), we wondered whether Apple would be able to hold its own against Samsung in the U.S. While the Cupertino giant dominates the U.S. market, its iPhone sales have slumped in fiscal 2016. The assumption/hope is that the new iPhone, which is expected in September, will be able to revitalize sales of the company's biggest revenue-driving product.If the device does not feature enough change, perhaps it will only drive a slight boost to sales. But it may also leave the door cracked for Samsung to take market share.In a different part of the globe, India, Samsung is making even bigger moves. For starters, the market is stronger in India when it comes to smartphone growth, as shipments grew 17% in Q2 2016 compared to the same quarter a year ago. Conversely, the rest of the world is expected to grow just 3% to 4% this year.Samsung garnered more than 25% of the Indian smartphone market last quarter, the most of any smartphone maker. This is up 15% year over year and 10.9% sequentially. For its part, Apple didn't even show up on the list by the IDC.It may be surprising to some investors that Apple's lower-priced iPhone SE didn't make more of an impact. In fact, according to the report, the company's iPhone 5S accounts for a majority of Apple's volume in the country.Perhaps that's why CEO Tim Cook had pushed and recently succeeded in getting the government to allow Apple to open retail locations in the country. Is this the break that Apple needed?It's unclear if that will help the company or if its products are simply priced too high for certain emerging markets. It doesn't help that Apple saw a massive decline in Q2 for its China iPhone shipments as well, which fell more than 30% YOY.Coming to America (No, Not Eddie Murphy)South Korean-based Samsung may be doing well in India and has a shot to garner market share in the U.S. with its new devices, but does Apple really have to worry about the Chinese-based Xiaomi (XI) in the States too?According to reports, the electronics device maker is gearing up to launch in the U.S. in ""the near future."" And although the company has similar devices to Apple (note Xiaomi's new laptop, the Mi Notebook Air and its similarity to the Apple MacBook Air), I don't think AAPL really has much to worry about.If Apple were a low-margin seller that thrived on its pricing model to sell its devices, that would be one thing. However, Apple is all about brand. It's all about prestige.That doesn't mean there won't be some buyers out there for Xiaomi. But if Apple fans are unwilling to part ways with their iPhone for a Samsung device, it's unlikely they'll do it for a cheaper lineup from Xiaomi. In fact, it seems darn near impossible.Xiaomi is falling flat on its home turf of China. In fact, falling flat is putting it kindly. The company saw its sales in China plunge more than 38% in the second quarter of 2016. While Apple's drop of roughly 32% is nothing to brag about it, it's not as bad. Nor is China, its main game.I don't see how Xiaomi will come to the U.S. in a major disruptive way. It would have to pass through both Apple and Samsung, and while I do believe the company has the potential to take market share against low-priced smartphones, it won't put a dent in the premium market.Did you see Apple's sales fall 40% in the U.S., before migrating to China? No.Microsoft Takes on Google (Again)Taking shots in technology is what gets companies to the next level. Sometimes.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) acquired YouTube, Apple invented the iPhone, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) snapped up Instagram. All good moves. However, there's still Google's foray into social media and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) attempt at search via Bing.Nobody says, ""How do I treat motion sickness?"" ""I don't know, Bing it.""Of course not. It's ""Google it."" The company's name has even been recognized as a verb in the dictionary. But despite this, Microsoft still has Bing - (just like Google still has Google+).Anyway, Microsoft wants you to use its new web browser, Edge. And just like with Bing, it will reward users for doing so. Microsoft Rewards will pay users to use Bing, Edge or the Microsoft Store.If you've got Bing as your default search engine and actively use Edge for 30-hour per month, Microsoft will comp you with credit towards Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Skype (which it owns), ad-free Outlook (which it also owns), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).So will Microsoft be able to pry users away from Google Chrome, or will it fail to do so just like it did with Bing? My money would be on it not working out, but you never know.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4057827,53842,2017-03-24T15:07:08-04:00,"We have long argued that as Spotify's user base grows, so does its negotiating power for content.However, the time for Spotify to go public is approaching, and without a deal with Universal, Sony and Warner, any valuation that Spotify would achieve at IPO would be materially impacted.With this hanging over its head, the stock would be very volatile in the public market as, in theory, the labels could wipe Spotify out at any time by pulling their music from its service.","Spotify (MUSIC) is closing in on finally doing a deal with the record labels that will remove the last obstacle to the company going public. Spotify and three of the largest record labels have been dancing around each other for a significant period of time without coming to any definitive agreement. This is crucial because without the content from these three labels, Spotify would be unable to provide its current service.We have long argued that as Spotify's user base grows, so does its negotiating power and that the longer it took to arrive at an agreement, the better it is for Spotify. However, the time for Spotify to go public is approaching fast and without a deal with Universal, Sony and Warner, any valuation that Spotify would achieve at IPO would be materially impacted. Furthermore, with this hanging over its head, the stock would be very volatile in the public market as, in theory, the labels could wipe Spotify out at any time by pulling their music from its service.In practice, this is never going to happen because with every month that passes, the labels need Spotify more than it needs the labels and we are pretty sure that if they were going to pull their music from Spotify, they would have done so ages ago. This is because streaming is now the only source of growth in the music industry without which the labels would lose what has become their most important route to market.Spotify is unique in that it is the only major platform to have a free-tier and adding in those users takes Spotify's total user count well north of 100m. This is hugely significant, as although these users do not pay Spotify directly, they generate vast amounts of data, which can be used to improve and train its algorithms. This is critical because it is those algorithms that allow Spotify to both understand the music it has on its platform as well as accurately match it to the users that it has.In the long term, this gives Spotify the opportunity to cut the labels out completely, which would have the effect of substantially enriching both artists as well as shareholders of Spotify. This is why Spotify is not keen to do a deal with the labels that limits the provision of music to free users as data collection and algorithm training would most likely be impacted. The other side of the coin is that we suspect that Spotify has guided its investors to a time when it can IPO, giving existing shareholders visibility as to when they will see a return on their investments.We believe that doing an IPO without a signed deal with all three of the biggest labels has difficulty written all over it which is why Spotify is considering caving in to some of the labels' demands. Although this will bring some short-term benefits to Spotify and its shareholders, a deal in the short term could delay Spotify's ability to supplant the labels, which we have long believed is where the real upside lies. This is because this is how Spotify goes from earning $0.30 on the subscription dollar to $0.50 or more.Hence, the best outcome for shareholders will be achieved by being patient and letting the IPO exit window slip for as long as required for Spotify to become powerful enough to dictate terms to the labels. We continue to see only a minor threat from Apple Music (NASDAQ:AAPL) as Spotify is still adding paid subscribers much more quickly and shows every sign of having better artificial intelligence with which to differentiate its service. Whether Spotify can convince its shareholder of the merits of delaying their exit remains to be seen."
4073254,20991,2017-05-15T10:25:10-04:00,"Everybody's writing about this idea that Spotify might go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO.Effectively, the direct-listing route creates market-driven supply, rather than company-mandated supply.I really like the idea of direct listing, especially for companies which don't need to raise additional capital, so let's not listen to the parade of horribles when it comes to reasons not to do it.","Everybody's writing about this idea that Spotify (MUSIC) might go public not through a traditional IPO, but rather through a direct listing. Direct listings are rare beasts, and so in order to understand them, reporters phone up bankers who work in equity capital markets. But the problem is that bankers who work in equity capital markets hate direct listings, because they mean they get much lower fees. And so they start spreading misinformation.So let's go through some of the assertions.Wall Street Journal:The fact is that market forces determine the share price of all companies from the minute they're listed on the market. That's the beauty of a stock-market listing: it's a price-discovery mechanism based on market supply and demand. The only thing missing from a direct listing is the IPO price: the price that shares get issued at before the market forces take over.The further the IPO price is from the market price, the greater the first-day volatility. Which means that, in general, if there's no IPO price, volatility will be lower, not higher. (It's true that IPOs also have something called green shoes, which serve to dampen volatility at the margin, but not so much that you'd ever really notice.)As for the idea that buy-and-hold investors ""promote trading stability,"" that's just weird, since by definition those investors aren't trading. The amount of volatility in the market is entirely a function of the actions of traders; the non-actions of non-traders are utterly irrelevant. And if buy-and-hold investors effectively reduce the free float so that shares become scarcer, that's only going to increase the volatility of the stock.Fortune:It's true that most IPOs have a ""pop"" from the IPO price to the first trade, a/k/a the amount by which the IPO was underpriced. But it's not clear why that pop should be ""particularly crucial for high-profile listings of consumer tech brands"". No one's going to buy a Spotify subscription because a bunch of institutional investors got rich on their IPO allocation. And while there is a tendency to conflate companies with their share price (see: Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)), the important thing there is the performance of the shares over time, not the amount of the IPO pop. (Do you remember how Twitter shares performed on their IPO? Me neither.)All of this is good for the share price of a company which goes the direct-listing route! There are a lot of big long-only funds which will want to have some kind of position in Spotify, and which will be starting at zero. Some will ""just buy the stock like a jerk,"" while others won't buy it at all. None of them will be selling it. That's a fantastic structural support for the share price, which lasts much longer than a green shoe.Reuters:The way that markets work, high prices attract sellers. If you own a stock and it's trading at a low level, you won't feel much desire to sell it, but if someone is offering you a lot of money for it, then you'll be more inclined to accept their offer. So the higher that Spotify shares trade, the more early-stage investors and employees will be inclined to sell into the public market. To a first approximation, the free float will increase as the shares rise. That's a great dynamic!By contrast, in a traditional IPO, the company and the underwriters spend a lot of time trying to work out just how many shares the market has an appetite for, and the degree to which altering the number of shares being sold might change the price at which they end up trading. Then, when the IPO finally happens, investors spend even more time second-guessing the lock-up period, and trying to work out how many shares are going to flood the market in six months' time when insiders are finally allowed to sell.Going the direct-listing route solves both these problems. Precisely because there's no lock-up period, investors know that anybody who wants to sell has every ability to sell. There's no shadow overhang out there. That gives them more confidence to buy. And on the other side of the ledger, the company doesn't need to worry about issuing more shares than the market has an appetite for, because it's not issuing any shares at all.Effectively, the direct-listing route creates market-driven supply, rather than company-mandated supply. Which, again, should decrease, rather than increase, ""heavy turnover and price fluctuations"".New York Times:The implication here is that the IPO roadshow is necessary to get the market familiar with the company, and comfortable with the idea of buying its shares. That's true, when there are lots of shares the company is trying to sell in an IPO. But when there are zero shares that the company is trying to sell, that concern goes away. The market just becomes a market between willing buyers (presumably, people who are familiar with the company, however few of those people there might be), and willing sellers (insiders who are being offered so much money that they're OK with parting with their stock).In that sense, it's a bit like the pre-IPO trading that we saw on Second Market with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). You don't need name recognition for that, and of course most listed companies have little to no name recognition anyway. No matter how drawn-out and costly their IPO.It's really hard to know what this means. In an IPO, the IPO price (pre-pop) is the official valuation you go public at. With a direct listing, there's just trading, there's no official valuation which the company can control. Often, as part of the IPO process, bankers will try to anticipate how much the shares will trade for, on the open market, and sometimes they're even right. So maybe the $13 billion number is just someone's guess as to where the market will value Spotify. But that's all it is: a guess.Quartz:It's true that a direct listing means that the company can't raise new equity capital. That's the main downside. But the whole point is that it would not, any longer, ""be valued at its most recent private-market valuation"": instead, it would be valued the same way every other public company is, according to the market's price discovery mechanism.It's possible that some existing shareholders, as well as some other potential buyers, would use the most recent private-market valuation as an anchoring mechanism: they might be reluctant to sell above that level, or keen to buy below it. But those anchoring mechanisms tend not to last very long, and realistically it's quite improbable that the initial public-company valuation will, by astonishing coincidence, turn out to be exactly the same as the most recent private-market valuation.I really like the idea of direct listing, especially for companies which don't need to raise additional capital (or who don't mind doing so on the secondary market). It helps to marginalize Wall Street investment banks, for one thing, which is generally a good thing. So let's not listen to their parade of horribles when it comes to reasons not to do it. And let's hope that Spotify both goes the direct-listing route and is very happy with the results."
4053271,20521,2017-03-08T14:38:39-05:00,"Many believe Spotify has delayed its IPO as it tries to improve its financial metrics.Spotify is targeting a valuation of $11 billion-$13 billion.Given the current market conditions, that may be a difficult number to hit this year.","Music streaming company Spotify (MUSIC) has been thinking about its IPO for a while. A year ago, analysts were expecting it to take the plunge in 2017. But recent reports suggest the company may be delaying the IPO again as it works on improving its operations and financials.Spotify's FinancialsStockholm-based Spotify was founded in 2006 by serial entrepreneur Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. The two founders took two years to develop the streaming app, which was launched in 2008. Since its release, the app has seen rapid adoption. Spotify operates on a freemium model allowing users to listen to music along with ads for free or to opt for a $9.99 a month subscription that offers ad free music streaming.Last week, the company announced that it had 50 million paid subscribers. The subscriber base has grown from 30 million in March 2016 to 40 million in September 2016. Including the free subscribers, Spotify has more than 100 million users on its platform. Compare that to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music's 20 million paid subscribers in December 2016, from 13 million in April 2016 and 17 million in September 2016.But despite the increasing number of subscribers, Spotify is still not profitable. Spotify ended 2015 with revenues of $2.8 billion and a loss of $194 million. More recent financials are not known.Spotify has grown through venture and debt funds. It has raised $1.56 billion in venture funds from Asset Management Partners, Baillie Gifford, D.E. Shaw & Co., Discovery Capital, Goldman Sachs, GSV Capital, Halcyon Asset Management, Lansdowne Partners, Northzone, Rinkelberg Capital, Senvest Capital, Technology Crossover Ventures, TeliaSonera, Alexandre Mars, AFSquare, Fidelity Ventures, Lakestar, The Coca-Cola Company, 137 Ventures, Accel Partners, DST Global, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Founders Fund, Sean Parker, Horizons Ventures, and Li Ka-shing. In March 2016, it raised $1 billion in convertible debt and was valued at more than $8 billion.Spotify's Profit FocusAs part of the profit focus, Spotify is now evaluating a higher premium-based subscription service. Being dubbed a Hi-Fi service, the new paid option will be an option available to existing Spotify Premium subscribers. It will cost the users an additional $5-$10 a month and would grant them access to additional features such as lossless high fidelity streaming, a free vinyl, discounts on vinyls, and concert tickets. If successful, the Hi-Fi service could help improve average revenue per user and translate to better margins. With the increased adoption of Lightning and Bluetooth headphones, especially after Apple's move away from the jack, many believe that there will be an increasing demand for lossless audio. Spotify is clearly trying to address that demand.Spotify's IPO DelaysMany believe that Spotify has delayed its IPO as it tries to improve its financial metrics. Spotify is targeting a valuation of $11 billion-$13 billion and given the current market conditions, that may be a difficult number to hit this year. Unlike two years ago, when the market was valuing companies on the basis of their users and business models, investors appear to be more realistic now. The growing number of Unicorpses suggest that profitability economics of business models are given due justification in arriving at valuations.Spotify can claim a reasonable valuation only if it can show a path to profitability. Right now, with its license deals, that seems to be a stretch. Spotify is rumored to be looking at achieving profitability through renegotiating its license agreements. Currently it operates on a variable pricing-based licensing agreement where it pays a royalty based on the number of track plays. It is looking at shifting to a fixed model instead. The increasing number of subscribers does offer it leverage to negotiate such a deal. Currently Spotify pays nearly 55% - 70% in royalty to the big three labels - Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. A lower fee would surely be helpful in attaining profits.Spotify's Debt ProblemBesides high costs, Spotify also is dealing with a costly debt problem. Last year, Spotify had taken loans of $1.5 billion that came with very strict covenants. The terms of the loan expect Spotify to pay big premiums in case an IPO is delayed over a year. The first year loan came at an interest rate of 5%, but for every six months thereafter till the stock lists, the interest rate will keep going up by 1%. Additionally, the longer Spotify delays the IPO, the more shares it will need to give to its creditors when it lists. The one year anniversary for the $1 billion loan is almost here, and Spotify is looking at a minimum of $50 million in interest payments.The above problem may warrant a rushed IPO, but Spotify realizes that a low valuation will not be helpful to the company in the longer run. Spotify must have also learned a lesson from its rival Pandora's (NYSE:P) listing. Pandora went public in 2011, is yet to turn in profits, and continues to languish. Pandora ended last year with revenues of $392 million and a net loss of $90 million. It had a total user base of 81 million of which only 4.4 million were paid subscribers. Pandora earns its revenues through ticketing and advertisements as well. Its stock is trading at $12.47 with a market capitalization of $2.9 billion. Not exactly a great role model for Spotify!"
3965363,24360,2016-04-14T15:46:34-04:00,"When I'm bullish Pandora, it's most often because investors and analysts misunderstand the company.Somewhat surprisingly, the misunderstanding has never been stronger.Something not so random helps get to the bottom of why Pandora wins the streaming wars.","Often, investment-related lessons come from strange places. And when you least expect them.Before you freak out, I understand this is not the end-all, be-all rhetorical and visual specimen that cements the Pandora (NYSE:P) bull case. However, it absolutely does contribute to the larger argument. One I have been making for quite some time, on and off Seeking Alpha. Yes, I talk to people about this **** in bars and coffee shops.See the bullet points of this article for a more than sufficient synopsis. And see this installment from The Seeking Alpha Author Experience for rationale on how I approach my Pandora coverage. By the way, The Author Experience is an initiative we recently launched to enhance and extend our partnership with SA contributors as well as readers who might like to become contributors (see details here).So here we go. Check out these two screenshots of Spotify (MUSIC) playing me some Old 97's via its Roku app:Please pardon the rudimentary nature of these images, complete with my reflection in the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) mirror. But I'm working quick, and on a low budget.For those of you not well-schooled in all things Old 97's (though you really should be), Spotify got the titles of both songs wrong.Though it sounds right, ""Melt Snow"" would be incorrect. It's ""Melt Show,"" inspired by a band (Melt) Old 97's lead singer Rhett Miller's old roommate once played in (the friend is now in The Toadies). Thus, the reference to being ""In the front row of the Melt show."" And, well, ""Curtain Cells,"" that's just dumb, careless or both. It's ""Curtain Calls.""See, it's those nasty algorithms that guys such as Jimmy Iovine over at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) chide. There's no personal touch. Those other streaming services render a sterile, machine-like output of generic jams. Some critics, particularly Pandora bears, go so far as to call Pandora's Music Genome Project (MGP) a liability. In large swaths of the investment community, the MGP has never been given its just due for how effectively it drives practically every aspect of Pandora from its sales efforts to the all-important listening experience.The MGP wins, and puts Pandora head and shoulders above its competition, because, contrary to common conjecture, it is a human-controlled platform. You would never see Pandora make the type of mistakes Spotify made (and continues to make, as of this article's publication).Pandora got ""Melt Show"" right also. And to be fair to Spotify, it only misspelled the names of these songs on Old 97's ""Alive & Wired"" live album, not ""Too Far To Care,"" which is where they originally appeared. So it was probably somebody else's error to begin with, but one Spotify failed to catch, quite possibly because of those pesky algorithms having too much sway. At Pandora, humans curate the entire catalog. A human goes through and scores each song on seven pages worth of musical attributes. They also make sure errors such as these never make it to your app. And they constantly run tests and experiments to provide the best and most powerful streaming platform to users as well as advertisers.That's why Pandora wins and will continue to win. And it's particularly important now as the company embarks on its Tim Westergren-led expansion (smart move by the way). Attention to detail - with humans running the (melt) show - will ensure Pandora's user experience doesn't suffer as the platform adds features such as on-demand and one-touch ticket buying (more smart moves).We can lament the financials all we want, but the Pandora story has always been about focus and the user/advertiser experience. That's why it took Westergren so long to budge from his hyper-focus on doing nothing but radio. While the folks manning the algorithms at Spotify and Apple are certainly not awful, they're just not quite as good as the staff Pandora has assembled. And, as Rhett Miller sings, ""don't let me be misunderstood."" Little, seemingly minute details such as these matter to the larger Pandora investment story.If you have the urge to trash this line of thinking, look into the glare of your television screen and reflect. Or just listen to this, and we're good. I'd rather listen to music with you in a bar or coffee shop than argue.*Credit to my daughter for helping me spot these errors on Spotify."
3962382,61281,2016-03-31T16:00:00-04:00,Spotify raised $1B of convertible debt with incredibly attractive terms for investors.The debt series leaves Spotify no other option than going public as soon as possible.This is an alarming situation that could lead to poor business decisions in the IPO process.Investors should be very careful ahead of the Spotify IPO.,"Source: SpotifyThe Swedish music streaming service Spotify (Private:MUSIC) has been under a lot of pressure in the last couple of years amidst the intensifying competition in the music streaming market with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google's YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Pandora (NYSE:P), SoundCloud, and Jay Z's Tidal trying to dominate the market. All companies offer similar high-level services with a basic free plan that includes advertisements and premium ad-free plans when there are fine differences in plan prices and offering details among the different players. For years, Spotify was the disruptive young player of the music industry that attracted many investors and allowed the company to raise increasing amounts of money in increasing valuations, as shown in the chart below.However, as the music streaming industry evolves and more players join the market, Spotify finds it harder to distinguish itself from the competition, and investors are getting more cautious. As shown in the chart below, Fidelity gained an impressive return of 73%, on paper, from late 2012 until the beginning of 2016, but as the market gets more crowded and with no solid exit strategy in place, these gains might be hard to materialize. Of course, Fidelity is just an example, and most of Spotify's investors might see their investment value erode and gains evaporate, as the company remains in its situation, unless they sell their stock at a discount in the secondary market or pressure the company to go public so they can sell their stock on the open market.Many readers might say this is the case for many of the unicorns out there that raised funds under unrealistically high valuations and now struggle to justify them and create some exit strategy for early investors. That might be true in many other instances, but looking at Spotify, the company was a prominent IPO candidate almost each year in recent years but remained private for many reasons. As time goes by, Spotify's IPO window is slowly closing, and as the market becomes more crowded, the company is losing the momentum that might drop its valuation as a liquidation risk increases, and investors' concerns to ""meet with their money at the end"" rise.This pressure to offer an exit opportunity to investors and the need for cash drove Spotify to issue a $1B convertible debt that offers unique terms to investors from TPG, Dragoneer and clients of Goldman Sacks:An annual coupon of 5% that rises by 1 percentage point every six months until 10% or IPO. In the case of an IPO, the debt could be converted to equity at a 20% discount on IPO price. After a year, the discount starts to rise by 2.5 percentage points every six months. Permission to sell stock in the open market after 90 days and not wait for the entire 180 days of the lockup period.This adjustable terms mechanism benefits investors and makes a Spotify IPO a shared interest of the company and convertible debt investors. In case the company goes public, investors in this note receive slightly improved terms compared to other early investors. However, in case the IPO delays, Spotify will have to pay more in coupon payments for the risk that investors carry.Even though this new debt injects an enormous amount of money to the company, it adds additional pressure to go public on top of the pressure coming from early investors that look to cash in on their investments. In my opinion, this debt series signals that Spotify maxed out on its possibilities in the private market. An IPO at this point seems inevitable, and the convertible debt rising provides some stimulus for the company to IPO before the coupon payments and the IPO price discounts rise too much. With no other option but going public, Spotify might find itself proceeding with an IPO heading to fail. This is a red flag that should alarm most investors ahead of the Spotify IPO."

4299630,104608,2019-10-28T13:46:49-04:00,"SPS Commerce reported Q3 earnings and adjusted EBITDA that were both above consensus expectations.Management provided an early look into 2020 with revenue and adjusted EBITDA expected to grow 10% and 20%, respectively.While growth trends remain healthy, valuation seems to be fully pricing in a strong 2020, at ~5.2x 2020 revenue.","SPS Commerce (SPSC) reported another strong, consistent quarter with revenue, EBITDA, and EPS all above expectations. The stock was up ~7% after the strong earnings where management also raised 2019 guidance that was ahead of expectations. While boasting a market cap of only $1.8 billion, this name seems to fly under the radar for a software company growing 13% with EBITDA margins of ~25%.Although the stock is not nearly as fast of a revenue grower compared to some of the leading software players in the market, SPSC provides a level of consistency that not many software companies are able to provide. The company actually notes they have achieved 75 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, an impressive track record no matter the size or scale of the company.Data by YChartsI believe part of the reason why SPSC remains under the radar is due to their valuation. At ~5.2x forward revenue and ~19.3x forward adjusted EBITDA, the stock is not cheap for their growth profile. However, the company is positioned correctly in a faster growing part of the software market. SPSC provides cloud-based supply chain management software to retailers, suppliers, third-party logistics, providers, and other partners. While the company is a little more exposed to the retail cycle, software sales tend to be stickier and more difficult for companies to quickly replace.While the stock is up nearly 30% year to date, the recent earnings reinforce the long-term growth and margin expansion potential the company has. Though the stock is only 5% below their all-time high of ~57, this is one name investors should keep their eye on in case valuation ever reaches a more attractive entry point.SPSC competes in the Electronic Data Interchange part of the market, which looks to automate the communication between retailers and their suppliers. Rather than manually working with their suppliers, SPSC aims to converge all communication to an electronic platform via their cloud-based software. Retailers would be able to automatically order their goods with suppliers automatically shipping them.In addition, SPSC's software will help retailers analyze the data, helping their customers optimize their inventory and supply chain management functions. As the retail world becomes more digital, companies are constantly looking for ways to improve their operations and streamline any efficiencies.During the quarter, SPSC grew their revenue 13% to $70.9 million, which marked the 75th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Q3 revenue was also above consensus estimates of ~$70 million, rather impressive considering the consistency the company has displayed over the past 20 years.Source: Company PresentationGross margins continued to remain strong at 67.2%, compared to 67.5% in the year ago period. As the company continues to scale, gross margins should start to expand a little bit more given the fixed cost nature of the business. In other words, a higher revenue value less the same amount of fixed costs will yield a better gross margin.Also during the quarter, the company had 662 net new customer adds, which is up from 423 net new adds during the last quarter. While Q3 did have a ~100 benefit from the MAPADOC acquisition, 562 net new customer adds remains impressive.Source: Company PresentationI believe a better financial metric for SPSC is their EBTIDA and EBITDA margin. During the quarter, EBITDA grew nearly 26% to $18.1 million and was nearly $1 million better than consensus expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.4% expanded 260bps from the year ago adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%. A large function of the margin expansion is driven by the fixed cost nature of the business.Given SPSC's revenue has a large software function to it, as revenue grows, the incremental margins are better than the company average. Over time, it is plausible that margins continue to expand as the company gains scale and we could end up seeing adjusted EBITDA margins closer to 30-35%.The combination of revenue and adjusted EBITDA beating expectations led to EPS for the quarter of $0.33, which was above consensus expectations of ~$0.28.Source: Company PresentationFor Q4, revenue is expected to be $72.2-72.8 million, which is slightly above expectations of ~$72 million. While above expectations, I believe guidance could be slightly conservative as revenue growth represents 11-12%, compared to 13% during Q3. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $17.9-18.4 million, representing ~25% margin at the midpoint. Finally, EPS is expected to be $0.29-0.30.Management also provided an insight into 2020 guidance, noting ~10% revenue growth and ~20% EBITDA growth. While these estimates show signs of deceleration, I believe they are slightly conservative as management talked about starting to see some stabilization in the retail end-market. As the company starts to deploy more resources for that end-market, we could see some upside to initial 2020 guidance.SPSC also announced a $50 million increase to their share repurchase program, which will now go through November 2021. This is another layer of potential upside to earnings as the company now has more firepower to repurchase shares if their stock experiences a period of weakness.Given the relative size of SPSC, there are no true pure-play competitors. However, investors can still look at similar valuation metrics. SPSC has a long history of consistent revenue growth, now reaching 75 consecutive quarters. EBITDA margins continue to remain healthy at ~25%, which I believe could expand to 30-35% over the long term given the fixed cost structure of the company.Data by YChartsData by YChartsGiven management's 2019 revenue guidance of $278.6-279.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $68.8-69.3 million, we can start to build out a 2020 scenario. Early 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 20%.While the remaining 2019 guidance could be slightly conservative, let's assume both revenue and adjusted EBITDA come in at the midpoint. Using ~$279 million in revenue and ~$69 million in adjusted EBITDA as a base, we can grow from there. If revenue and adjusted EBITDA follow management's 10% and 20% guidance respectively, this could result in 2020 revenue of ~$307 million and adjusted EBITDA of ~$83 million.With a current market cap of ~$1.82 billion and net cash/investments of ~$200 million, this results in a current enterprise value of ~$1.6 billion. Using our above 2020 revenue and adjusted EBITDA potentials, this results in a 2020 revenue multiple of ~5.2x and a 2020 adjusted EBITDA multiple of ~19.3x.While these metrics seem like the stock is currently fully priced in for a successful year, there could be some additional upside to what seems like a somewhat conservative guidance. If revenue were to grow closer to 12-14% with margins expanding a little more than guidance, we could see upside to 2020 metrics.With the current stock price ~$52 after the recent post-earnings outperformance, it appears the stock is fully priced in following management's 2020 early guidance metrics. However, if the stock were to go through a pullback or the retail end-market starts to show more signs of life, I would be eager to build up a position in the name.Fundamentals remain healthy and management's early look into 2020 guidance gives long-term investors confidence in another successful year of growth. The main thing keeping me on the sidelines for now is valuation."
4354113,104608,2020-06-16T12:52:48-04:00,"SPSC reported a strong Q1 with revenue growing 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins coming in above expectations.Given the uncertainty in the market, the company declined to provide updated 2020 guidance, though noted they are confident in 2020 margin expansion.Valuation has risen to near all-time highs as the stock has rallied ~25% since reporting earnings.","SPS Commerce (SPSC) reported a strong start to the year with revenue growing 11% and coming in ahead of expectations. In addition, the company's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly 3 percentage points to 27.4% during the quarter. Since reporting earnings a few weeks ago, the stock has rallied around 25% as investors applauded a strong quarter.Management declined to provide updated 2020 guidance given the many uncertainties in the current global economic environment.Although the stock is not nearly as fast as a revenue grower compared to some of the leading software players in the market, SPSC provides a level of consistency that not many software companies are able to provide. The company actually notes they have achieved 77 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, an impressive track record no matter the size or scale of the company.Data by YChartsWhile the stock performed well in Q1 and Q2 guidance calls for another 8% revenue growth, I believe valuation has become a little stretched. At ~7.5x forward revenue and ~27.7x forward adjusted EBITDA, the company is trading near all-time high valuation. The current valuation reflects not only a strong finish to 2020 but also likely an acceleration in growth and margin expansion in 2021.Given the recent rise in valuation, I remain on the sidelines for now. The market continues to remain volatile and stocks trading near all-time high valuations pose a higher risk. If global macroeconomic fears continue to persist, companies will continue to have low visibility into their revenue streams, making it harder for investors to place a high valuation on companies.While near-term the stock could be faced with some challenges given valuation and lack of revenue visibility, the company remains poised for continued growth over the long term. The volatility makes it challenging to invest in companies that trade near all-time highs; however, over the long term, I believe the company will continue to have strong operations and long-term investors should be hesitant to sell out of a position in the name.The company is well-positioned in a faster-growing part of the software market. SPSC provides cloud-based supply chain management software to retailers, suppliers, third-party logistics, providers, and other partners. While the company is a little more exposed to the retail cycle, software sales tend to be stickier and more difficult for companies to quickly replace. So, even as retailers struggle to produce sales right now, they are still utilizing their software services.SPSC competes in the Electronic Data Interchange part of the market, which looks to automate the communication between retailers and their suppliers. Rather than manually working with their suppliers, SPSC aims to converge all communication to an electronic platform via their cloud-based software. Retailers would be able to automatically order their goods with suppliers automatically shipping them.During the quarter, revenue grew 11% to $74.2 million, which marked the 77th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, coming in above expectations for ~$73.5 million. Revenue has decelerated the past few quarters, though 11% growth is impressive considering the challenging macroeconomic environment.Gross margins during the quarter came in at 68.3%, which was pretty similar to 68.1% in the year-ago period. As gross margins have started to stabilize just below 70%, I believe even as the company continues to scale, it will be challenging to see much gross margin expansion from here.Source: Company PresentationAdjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $20.4 million in the quarter, which represents a 27.4% margin and showed some nice expansion from the 24.6% margin in the year-ago period. Given the high fixed cost nature of the business, as the company gains scale, they are better able to leverage their operating expenses and expand profit margins. Over time, I think the company will continue to expand margins and could potentially reach 30-35% over time.Source: Company PresentationFor Q2, the company expects revenue of $73.8-74.8 million or ~8% growth. While this does represent some deceleration compared to the 11% growth this past quarter, the company could be slightly conservative given the uncertain market. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $19-20 million, which represents a ~26% margin at the midpoint, continuing the trend of margin expansion. EPS for the quarter is expected to be $0.17-0.19.Given the many uncertainties in the global environment, 2020 guidance was not provided. The 11% growth in Q1 and 8% expected growth in Q2 could still make it possible for the company to see growth near 10% for the full year.SPSC plays in a unique part of the market and there are no other true pure-play competitors in the market, which makes relative valuation a little bit more challenging. Given the company has a strong history of revenue with 77 consecutive quarters of growth and EBITDA margins remaining healthy near 25-30%, investors can look at some historical valuation metrics for reference.The company has historically traded at 5-6x forward revenue and anywhere between 20x and 25x forward EBITDA. During times of challenging market conditions, investors may start to place more emphasis on historical valuation ranges in order to better determine appropriate current valuations.Data by YChartsData by YChartsEven though management is no longer providing 2020 guidance given the many uncertainties, the consistent revenue growth should give investors some level of confidence in the underlying business. Given the company reported $279 million of revenue in 2019, we can start to build out revenue through 2021. Even if 2020 revenue comes in below 10% growth, the company has a long history of strong growth and we could see 2021 revenue rebound higher than 10%. For simplicity, assuming a 10% growth over the next two years could result in 2021 revenue of ~$340 million.With a current market cap of ~$2.50 billion and net cash/investments of ~$210 million, this results in a current enterprise value of ~$2.30 billion. Using our above 2021 revenue potential, this results in a 2021 revenue multiple of ~6.7x.When looking at the above two charts, the forward revenue multiple of ~7.5x and the forward adjusted EBITDA multiple of ~27.7x both seem to be slightly expensive. In addition, both of these valuation metrics are near recent highs, which could be a troubling sign for investors if the market continues to be volatile or if we experience another pullback.Investors continue to place very high valuations on stocks who have consistently performed well over time. I believe this is due to investors having more confidence in these safer names, compared to more volatile retail, travel, or international names that may be under more pressure over the next few quarters. When looking back at historical valuations, the company is trading near all-time highs on both forward revenue and forward EBITDA. Given the current volatile market and uncertain economic conditions over the next few quarters, I remain on the sidelines, for now, waiting for a better opportunity.With the stock now trading just under ~$70, I have become a little more hesitant to put new money to work. The stock is also up a healthy ~25% since reporting earnings a few weeks ago and valuation now appears to be pricing in a solid 2020 performance in addition to a strong 2021 acceleration.The company's fundamentals remain sound with consistently strong revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins expanding nicely. However, I remain on the sidelines for now given valuation is a bit too expensive to put new money to work."

(SPSC) is a company with solid revenue growth that is operating in a growth industry. The stock is expensive, but SPS Commerce is a growth stock in a growth industry and the stock will probably always be expensive. I think the stock would suit active investors and traders who monitor their positions.SPS Commerce has generated strong revenue growth over the last decade. The company operates profitably, but its profit margins and returns on equity have been quite low over most of the last decade. However, SPS Commerce did book a solid profit for the 2018 fiscal year with an improved profit margin of 11% and a return on equity of 9%.The company operates with low debt levels. The long-term debt is currently $17.7 million representing 4% of its total asset value. The company's total liabilities represent 19% of its total asset value. I prefer companies that have a total debt that's under 50% of its total asset value - as this gives the company plenty of leeway before debt becomes excessive. When debt levels rise, so does the bankruptcy risk which is something I like to avoid when investing with a long-term view.SPS Commerce operates with a generous amount of working capital (with a current ratio of 4.8) meaning that its short-term assets (such as cash and deposits) easily cover its short-term liabilities (bills the company has to pay).Based on earnings from net income (rather than operational), SPS Commerce's 2020 forward PE multiple is 55x with a stock price of $103. The company's trailing PE multiple is 74x and its book value multiple is 5.4x. These multiples imply that SPS Commerce is expensive.SPS Commerce has a history of strong revenue growth with its revenue increasing 23% per year over the last decade. The chart below visually shows SPS Commerce's revenue and earnings trend over the last decade along with the next two years of consensus forecasts. The earnings per share used are net income (they are not operational earnings which some forecasts state).SPS Commerce data by ADVFNAs the above chart shows, SPS Commerce's revenue has consistently increased over the last decade and the forecasts show this trend continuing into 2020. The earnings have spent most of the last decade hovering above break-even, but the company did book a decent profit in 2011 and again in 2018. The analysts are expecting SPS Commerce's earnings to continue higher over the next few years at the rate of 13%.EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange and is a growing industry. The traditional method of communication between retailers and suppliers involve human interaction with the use of telephones and paperwork. The development of computerized technology provides a fully automated system for retailers and suppliers without the need for human interaction. This automated system is referred to as an EDI.In the past, retailers would ring their supplier to order items or they would fax through an order. The supplier's admin staff would send the order to the warehouse floor and then they would send an invoice back to the retailer by mail. All this involved considerable human involvement and was costly for businesses.With an EDI system, all the communication is done electronically from the retailer's computer to the supplier's warehouse floor computer. The retailer merely enters the order information into their computer and via a cloud-based software system the information is transmitted to the suppliers' warehouse floor's computer to ship the goods and an invoice is automatically sent back to the retailers' computer.Another advantage with an EDI system is the ability to analyze data as everything is computerized. This makes analytical analysis a simple task, with specialized software doing all the work without human intervention.As we live in a digital age, more and more businesses are embracing EDI systems as a means of increasing efficiency while at the same time reducing operating costs.SPS Commerce is a company that provides the software for cloud-based EDI systems for the retail industry. EDI is a growing industry and SPS Commerce is well positioned to benefit from its growth.While EDI systems benefit the retail industry, it's E-commerce that benefits the most. In fact, without EDI, most online retail businesses could not operate profitably - as these businesses are reliant on automated systems. I think that E-commerce will provide a growth boost to SPS Commerce for many years into the future.To help boost growth, SPS Commerce has acquired several companies over the last decade.When SPS Commerce acquires a company, it also acquires their customers. I think this is an effective way of increasing their customer base. The companies SPS Commerce acquires essentially operate in the same general business area of EDI and data analytics. In effect, SPS Commerce is buying out their competition.SPS Commerce has a history of revenue growth. While the earnings haven't shown a consistent growth trend, they are higher now than they were a decade ago. The company hasn't made a loss in the last decade and its earnings are expected to increase 13% heading into 2020. The PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) can be used to arrive at a valuation based on its expected earnings growth.Using the forecast earnings growth rate of 13% gives a forward PEG of around 4.2 with a 2020 PE multiple of 55x.It's commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which means that SPS Commerce is overvalued with a stock price of $103. Its fair value would be around $25.Most good growth stocks usually have forward PEGs in the 1.5 to 2.5 range, but SPS Commerce's forward PEG of 4.4 is expensive.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.SPS Commerce chart by StockCharts.comOver the last decade, SPS Commerce's stock price has traded up to peak in 2013. From here, the stock traded sideways within a broad trading range. The stock rallied in 2018 to peak at $100 before pulling back as the stock market pulled back from its high. The stock rallied this year as the stock market resumed its rally.The stock rallied 100% last year where it doubled its stock price to $100 within a year. If the stock market continues to rally, SPS Commerce could repeat last year's 100% rally. Adding a 100% rally to the $78 low of the current rally gives a target of $156 which could be reached within a year.SPS Commerce has a history of strong revenue growth which is expected to continue. Over the long term, I think SPS Commerce will continue to trade higher, but the stock is expensive making it vulnerable to a correction if the company disappoints the market.SPS Commerce is a growth company in a growth industry with its revenue increasing 23% per year over the last decade. The company has struggled with its earnings growth over the last decade, but it managed to generate a decent profit for the last fiscal year and the analysts are expecting this profitability to continue. SPS Commerce has acquired several companies that complement its existing business and have increased SPS Commerce's customer base.The stock is expensive with a 2020 forward PE of 55x (based on net income rather than operational) and its forward PEG is 4.4 which is more than most growth stocks. I think that SPS Commerce is a solid growth stock, but with the high valuations, the stock is at risk of a significant correction if management disappoints the market. However, SPS Commerce is a growth stock in a growth industry and the stock will probably always be expensive. I think the stock would suit active investors and traders who monitor their positions."

This includes a 64% compensation increase during a period in which the stock was down -34% and earnings were in the red.SPSC may have a lot of potential for growth going forward. But until margins improve, and executive compensation is more in line with shareholder interests, I'd recommend staying away.","SPS Commerce (SPSC) is a supply-chain management software company. As per its 10-K, SPSC is a ""leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management solutions, providing network-proven fulfillment, sourcing and item assortment management solutions, along with comprehensive retail performance analytics to thousands of customers worldwide."" At its fiscal year-end, it had about 26,000 customers. Refreshingly, its sales are distributed well over its customer base, with even its biggest customer making up less than 1% of its revenues.As per its website, it offers the following solutions and integrations:Source: Company WebsiteI like a few things about it: its balance sheet isn't laden with goodwill; it announced a share buyback program; as a tech company providing cloud solutions, it has the potential to scale its operations. Nevertheless, I don't think it's worth the risk as of yet, for the following reasons: despite growing revenue over 500% since its IPO, net income is in the red; COGS is increasing at a rate greater than sales; margins are thin; its earnings yield - used to assess its rate of return - is actually negative. And, despite all these issues, execs are being rewarded handsomely.Let's get into it.If SPSC can't grow its revenue in a way that will benefit investors' bottom line, then it may as well not grow at all, because growth becomes harder as companies increase in size (according to the Law of Large Numbers). While SPSC is still small, its growth so far has only served to hinder its bottom line.SPSC Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAs we can see, its sales and earnings are barely correlated (0.143), and worse, its sales and expenses are almost perfectly correlated (0.999). To that end, its COGS growth has begun to outstrip its revenue growth (544.9% vs. 515.3%, TTM, respectively). COGS, as we know, is the direct costs attributable to the production of its products, including the cost of the materials and direct labor costs. For SPSC, as revenue grows, the cost of production is growing faster. That doesn't bode well for SPSC improving its bottom line.Margins are incredibly thin and/or negative (an operating margin of 3.8% and a profit margin of -1.1%, TTM). That is, for every $100 of sales, SPSC is losing a buck and change. This is simply unsustainable.As it stated in an investor presentation, SPSC sees its ""future opportunity"" as growing its ~24k customers to 200k.Source: Company PresentationBased on that table, ideally, SPSC expects its customer base to increase by ~8x and its revenue per customer to increase by about 3x. If this growth won't translate into bottom line growth, as per the previous decade (and when it's losing a buck for every hundred dollars of sales), it's a ""future"" growth opportunity that I find hard to get excited about.In theory, I like the idea of boards attempting to align exec compensation with company success. For SPSC, I don't believe this is the case.Source: MorningstarAs we can see in the table above, executive compensation is up a whopping 65%, during a year the company failed to turn a profit, and a year the stock was down over -30%.Source: MorningstarRewarding execs with significant multi-million dollar bonuses when the company is -2.44M in the red is not an example of a shareholder-friendly compensation scheme, in my opinion.I think SPSC may have growth potential in the future. Nevertheless, investors would be wise to wait and see for any bottom line and/or margin improvements before jumping in. Further, investors would do well to take a hard look at whether SPSC is creating value for shareholders with its current executive compensation scheme.As we know, the earnings yield is the percentage of each dollar invested in the stock that was earned by the company. SPSC has a negative earnings yield (-0.21%) - implying a negative rate of return on this investment. At that rate, investors who love SPSC are better off sticking to T-Bills until the situation improves."

SPSC has generally retreated along with the broader market since the beginning of market selloffs in October. However, analysts continue their generally strong ratings on the stock.For the acquisition, SPS appears to have paid a reasonable to slightly expensive multiple for CovalentWorks, although the deal will bring an expected $2 million of Adjusted EBITDA by 2020.Accordingly, investors will need to be patient to see meaningfully positive results in SPS’ financials from this deal."

This week's Danger Zone pick is a company that touts 61 consecutive quarters of revenue growth despite five years of shareholder value destruction. Increased competition, misleading non-GAAP metrics, and an overly optimistic valuation land SPS Commerce (NASDAQ:SPSC) in the Danger Zone.Top Line Growth Hides LossesSPS Commerce's economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, have declined from $2 million in 2010 to -$4 million in 2015 and -$5 million over the last twelve months (TTM).

Further compounding the poor fundamentals, the company has burned through cumulative $81 million in free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) since 2011 and FCF sits at -$19 million TTM.Misaligned Incentives Fuel Shareholder Value DestructionExecutive's annual bonuses are paid out based upon the achievement of revenue and adjusted EBITDA goals. The compensation committee believes that SPSC's ""financial results are driven most significantly by the revenues we generate."" Unsurprisingly, SPSC has done an impressive job growing revenue and adjusted EBITDA, but not real profits. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, excludes stock based compensation expense, which represents a significant portion of GAAP results, as we'll show below. Through the use of either revenue or adjusted EBITDA, executives are incentivized by metrics that do little to create shareholder value, and can actually improve while shareholder value is destroyed. The best way to create shareholder value, and align executives with the best interest of shareholders, is to tie performance bonuses to ROIC.Non-GAAP Metrics Improve While Economic Earnings DeclineBecause businesses have discretion over which items they choose to remove or leave in non-GAAP, these metrics often obfuscate true profits and lack comparability across firms. See dangers of non-GAAP metrics. Here are the expenses SPSC has removed to calculate its adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income:While SPSC may not remove a large number of expenses, the dollar value has a meaningful impact on reported results. In 2015, SPSC removed just over $6 million (138% of GAAP net income) in stock-based compensation to calculate its adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. In 2014, the company removed just over $5 million in stock-based compensation, which was nearly double GAAP net income. By removing this large expense, SPS Commerce reports non-GAAP metrics that are much better than economic earnings. Adjusted EBITDA grew from $5 million in 2010 to $23 million in 2015, or 34% compounded annually. Non-GAAP net income grew from $4 million in 2010 to $14 million in 2015, or 32% compounded annually. Meanwhile economic earnings declined from $2 million in 2010 to -$4 million in 2015, per Figure 2.Figure 2: SPS Commerce's Misleading Non-GAAP IncomeSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsLow Profitability In A Competitive MarketThe electronic data interchange (NYSE:EDI) or integration brokerage industry is highly fragmented with many competing services. Two of the most prominent competitors include Sterling Commerce (owned by IBM (NYSE:IBM)) and GXS (owned by OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX)). At the same time, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) offers supply chain management software in addition to other providers such as Covalent Works, Edicom, Covisint, DiCentral, and Liaison Technologies.Per Figure 3, SPS Commerce has a lower NOPAT margin and ROIC than both IBM and OTEX. Such low profitability leaves SPSC with a competitive disadvantage in regards to pricing power. Also, IBM and OTEX's other profitable business lines not only allow for greater cross-selling, but allow them to pursue only the highest value customers, leaving the less profitable firms for other competitors. Sacrificing margins to boost revenue growth may work in the short-term, but over the long haul, depressed margins leave SPSC vulnerable to competitors who control the ""playing-field.""Figure 3: SPSC's Profitability Lags Largest CompetitorsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBull Hopes Imply Competition Still LagsBulls will make the case that SPSC is sacrificing profits to grow its user base and gain market share. Despite strong revenue growth, the first mover advantage SPSC hoped to obtain, by simplifying the traditional on-site EDI services and moving to the cloud, has quickly eroded. Larger competitors have moved into cloud EDI by creating their own products that allow on-premise offerings, cloud offerings, or a mix of both. As these other competing services have come to market, SPSC has seen its margins cut in half. Now, SPSC is facing competition that not only offers a similar, if not more robust, product suite, but does so with more scale, per Figure 4.Figure 4: Competitor Business Connections/Trade Partners*Reported prior to being acquired by Open Text in 2014.Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings/press releasesPost acquisition of GXS, Open Text's CEO noted that the combined platform would connect over 600,000 businesses. Additionally, Di Central notes it processes transactions for over 30,000 organizations worldwide and Edicom is the EDI provider for over 14,000 businesses, including Carrefour and Toys R Us.The many firms, with robust partner networks and similar offerings, only increase the likelihood of the service becoming commoditized and price being the primary differentiator.Expense Growth Exceeds Revenue Growth & Puts Valuation In the CloudFurther casting doubt on SPSC's ability to meet the expectations baked into its stock price is the firm's aggressive spending, which continues to prevent revenue growth from translating into profits. Since 2010, while revenue has grown 29% compounded annually, cost of revenue and R&D have grown 32% and 33% compounded annually respectively. Over the same time, sales & marketing and general & administrative costs have grown 27% and 25% compounded annually respectively.Making matters worse, each year since 2012, the year-over-year (""YoY"") growth in cost of revenues has been faster than YoY revenue growth. At the same time, in three of the past four years, YoY growth in R&D expense has outpaced revenue growth. In order to grow the top line at rates that meet market expectations, SPSC is sacrificing the bottom line and masking that sacrifice behind misleading non-GAAP metrics.Apart from fundamentals, the valuation of the stock also presents an issue. The current share price implies that SPSC is and will be highly profitable for many years into the future. Given the litany of competition, SPSC's low profitability, and the spending required to maintain top-line growth, it's hard to make a case for SPSC meeting the high expectations already baked into the share price.The largest risk to the bear case is what we call ""stupid money risk"", which is higher in today's low growth (organic) environment. Another firm could step in and acquire SPSC at a value that is much higher than the current market price. However, only in the event a firm is willing to destroy shareholder value is SPSC worth more than its current share price.Would A Competitor Acquire SPSC?The biggest risk to our thesis is that an outside firm acquires SPSC at a value at or above today's price. A chance for acquisition may have passed, as SPSC's stock price has increased 60% since February. While a firm may have seen SPSC as a deal then, the stock is certainly not a bargain now. If the deterioration of operations is not enough, we'll show below that SPSC is not an attractive acquisition target unless a buyer is willing to destroy significant shareholder value.To begin, SPSC has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, SPSC is worth less than the current share price.Figures 5 and 6 show what we think Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) should pay for SPSC to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. Oracle, as a leading software and application provider, has been ramping up its cloud offerings in recent years. At the same time, SPS Commerce can already be integrated with Oracle's supply chain management application. However, it begs the question whether Oracle receives any additional benefit from taking on SPSC, or if it makes more sense to simply allow integration between the two companies. Regardless, there are limits on how much ORCL would pay for SPSC to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a 'goal ROIC' assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate in year one equals the consensus estimate for 2016 (22%). For the subsequent years, we use 22% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of 2016 expectations. We use 28% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with Oracle could create additional cross-selling opportunities.We conservatively assume that Oracle can grow SPSC's revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets. We also assume SPSC achieves an 11.6% NOPAT margin, which is the average positive NOPAT margin of the 47 Software Application companies under coverage and well above 7%, which is the highest margin ever achieved by SPSC in 2010. For reference, SPSC's TTM NOPAT margin is 3%, so this assumption implies drastic and immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best case scenario.Figure 5: Implied Acquisition Prices For ORCL To Achieve 7% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 5 shows the 'goal ROIC' for ORCL as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 7%. Even if SPS Commerce can grow revenue by 27% compounded annually with a nearly 12% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is not worth more than its current price of $66/share. Assuming the 27% scenario is a best-case view, Oracle would destroy over $50 million by purchasing SPSC at its current valuation. It's also worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal ORCL's WACC. We've previously covered how Oracle could increase its value by $65 billion simply by focusing on ROIC. Undergoing value neutral deals such as the above would run counter to this analysis.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices For ORCL To Achieve 23% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 6 shows the next 'goal ROIC' of 23%, which is ORCL's current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to ORCL shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most ORCL should pay for SPSC is $21/share (68% downside). Even assuming this best-case scenario, Oracle would destroy $675 million by purchasing SPSC at its current valuation. Any scenario below 27% CAGR would result in further capital destruction. Furthermore, any deal above $21/share would lower ORCL's ROIC, thereby destroying shareholder value.On Its Own, Valuation Implies Significant Profit GrowthSPSC is up over 60% from its February lows and over 200% over the past five years. Such price appreciation has come without any improvement in the fundamentals of the business, which leaves shares greatly overvalued. To justify the current price of $66/share, SPSC must achieve 7% NOPAT margins (highest ever achieved in 2010, compared to 3% TTM) and grow NOPAT by 34% compounded annually for the next 11 years. This scenario assumes SPSC can grow revenue by 25% each year, above consensus estimates, which further highlights the lofty expectations embedded in the stock price. Because of the large jump in NOPAT margin, NOPAT growth outpaces revenue growth on a compounded annual basis.Also in this scenario, SPSC would be generating nearly $2 billion in revenue 11 years from now, which is half the estimated total addressable market. Essentially, the expectations already baked into SPSC imply the firm taking nearly 50% market share while its margins currently lag the competition.Even if we assume SPSC can achieve that 7% NOPAT margin and grow NOPAT by 29% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is only worth $39/share today - a 41% downside. This scenario assumes SPSC can grow revenue at consensus rates in EY1 and EY2 and that the EY2 estimate continues indefinitely. Once again, because of the improvement in NOPAT margin, NOPAT growth outpaces revenue growth.Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets, an assumption that is unlikely, but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario. For reference, SPSC's invested capital has grown on average $19 million yearly (12% of 2015 revenue) over the past five years.Catalyst: SPSC's Revenue Can't Mask Losses ForeverThe market is filled with cloud companies operating on the cutting edge of numerous industries. We covered a few of them above, and others have been in the Danger Zone before. One of the common trends with such companies is the market is only willing to overlook losses for so long. Non-GAAP metrics can take the focus off losses in the interim, but ultimately, the market allocates capital to those firms that create shareholder value.As competition grows and is able to further penetrate the market, with higher margins and increased resources, SPSC may see its revenue growth curtailed. In this case, the revenue growth that the market has hung its hat on will no longer exist to prop up shares, and investors could be in for a rude awakening. We've previously seen the stock fall 40%, in the first weeks of February, only to rebound over the next six months. Considering the profit growth expectations already baked into SPSC, any lapse in top line growth or margin erosion could cause a repeat of early February.Adding uncertainty to SPSC'S continued revenue growth is the firm's heavy reliance on the retail industry. While retailers recognize the importance of an omni-channel presence, they may be unwilling to undergo any investment if the retail landscape were to weaken. Any prolonged decline in consumer spending could lead retailers to forego technology changes until market conditions improved, which could cause a slowdown in SPSC'S revenue growth.Insider Action and Short Interest Is LowOver the past 12 months 54 thousand insider shares have been purchased and 107 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 53 thousand insider shares sold. These sales represent <1% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 397 thousand shares sold short, or just over 2% of shares outstanding.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to SPSC's 2015 10-K:Income Statement: we made less than $2 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing less than $1 million in non-operating expenses (<1% of revenue). We removed $1 million related to non-operating expenses and less than $1 million related to non-operating income. See the adjustments made to SPSC's income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $168 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $134 million. One notable adjustment was $13 million (6% of net assets) related to off-balance sheet operating leases. See all adjustments to SPSC's balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $161 million of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by $92 million. The largest adjustment was the addition of $127 million (11% of market cap) due to excess cash. Despite increasing shareholder value, SPSC remains overvalued.Dangerous Funds That Hold SPSCThe following funds receive our Dangerous-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to SPS Commerce.This article originally published here on August 29, 2016.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
3983187,56112,2016-06-22T07:15:00-04:00,"While SPS Commerce expects a better longer-term growth rate than the broader e-commerce space, it's actually more levered to ""omnichannel,"" including lower-growth traditional retail.A variety of competitive and industry factors make me believe the company's 20%+ revenue growth target is aggressive.With the valuation looking expensive for 20% revenue growth anyway, I think this is a name investors should pass over for now, even though the network effects story is intriguing.","From an investment perspective, I'm about as big a fan of e-commerce as you'll find. I believe in making ""easy"" bets, and I don't think there's any bet easier than ""we'll be doing more stuff online (rather than less) in X number of years.""With that said, you have to pick your spots: the e-commerce growth trend is generally well understood, and it's not a limitless source of profits. In the case of next-generation EDI/analytics vendor SPS Commerce (NASDAQ:SPSC), I think the market may have ""omnichannel"" and ""e-commerce"" a little mixed up. Based on the nature of the company's business, as well as my understanding of the competitive environment, I think the market may be expecting a little too much growth from the company in the long term, leaving shares looking a pricey despite a pullback following a few years of relative flatness.E-Commerce Or Omnichannel?It's important to keep your buzzwords straight: whether a company is levered to ""e-commerce"" or ""omnichannel"" actually makes an important difference. What SPS does, to me, is more levered to omnichannel: the company provides what is essentially next-generation EDI (electronic data interchange), allowing retailers to coordinate with their supply chains to determine exactly how much product is in stock and where. SPS provides a layer of analytics on top of this - larger retailers share point-of-sale data, which can be utilized by suppliers to tweak their product offerings.This kind of offering obviously ties in well to retailers' online initiatives requiring significant drop-shipping of product direct from vendors - customers want a wide variety of product online, and retailers simply aren't going to stock it all in their own warehouses. This creates a good network effect, as the network becomes more valuable with each incremental retailer/supplier added to the marketplace.At the same time, I do question where exactly SPS is in its growth cycle. The recent acquisition of Toolbox Solutions - for which the company paid a relatively robust price, as I'll discuss - highlights that much of the value proposition here is still in-store. Moreover, even online, the general trend appears to be ""winners win"" - larger marketplaces (and vendors) continue to gain scale, while smaller ""mom and pops"" are seeing growth stalling out a bit. Companies like ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) have seen some challenges from this trend, as larger clients with more leverage demand volume discounts, such that it's usually better from a revenue perspective to have more smaller clients than fewer larger clients (assuming the same gross marketplace volume).Within That Context, How Realistic Is The Revenue Growth?Given that the general e-commerce growth rate is pegged at 15%, and even respectable companies like ChannelAdvisor have had their own struggles to consistently outgrow it, I think that SPS - levered to omnichannel rather than e-commerce - may be too aggressive in its long-term 20% growth target. Particularly given that many major retailers have already implemented pretty extensive drop-ship capabilities with major suppliers, I think share of wallet will probably have to outweigh new customer additions over the long term.Then, of course, there's competition - CommerceHub, soon to be spun off from Liberty Interactive (LVNTA), is half the size of SPS ($87.6 million in revenue in 2015), but it's still big enough and growing fast enough to invalidate the idea that this is a winner-take-all marketplace.Even ChannelAdvisor may eventually grow into a bigger competitor to SPS - while the company insists it's not a direct competitor, I have to say what Walmart.com's (NYSE:WMT) marketplace is doing with ChannelAdvisor sounds ""close enough"" to what SPS offers. SPS is a long-time Walmart partner, and since SPS drives revenues from suppliers rather than retailers, I don't think the Walmart vendor squeeze is a major risk here - but there's still the risk that SPS/ChannelAdvisor/CommerceHub increasingly compete for similar work.Looking further around the supply chain space corroborates my belief about long-term revenue growth rates. Indeed, esteemed warehouse management software vendor Manhattan Associates (NASDAQ:MANH) is ""only"" sustaining low-double digit growth rates at an expected low-$600 million top line. In fairness, it has been known to sandbag its guidance, but at the same time, I don't think Manhattan Associates management would expect to deliver 20% long-term growth. I am no fan of IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), but the company is clearly putting muscle behind analytics, and I wouldn't expect its Cognos offerings to roll over and cede share.At the same time, it's worth noting that Manhattan has its own point-of-sale analytics ambitions, while others with an in-store presence, such as VeriFone (NYSE:PAY), could also be a factor in selling analytics services using data from the point of sale. While I'll believe VeriFone's ambitions when I see them translate into something concrete - the company has historically been a bit of a technology laggard, and this is very different from what it has done historically - I wouldn't sleep on Manhattan, as I have yet to hear anything negative about it from anyone.I do believe, incidentally, that analytics will be important for SPS over the long term - yet, its percentage of new and existing business is still under 20%, suggesting that as of right now, it isn't outgrowing the more mature fulfillment portion of the business. Since analytics will carry the weight in the out years, I do think it's prudent to project revenue growth leveling off to some degree.Meanwhile, Are There Execution Issues?While I hate to nitpick, I do think the hiring issues discussed by SPS at the end of last year (and partially continuing into this year) bear some analysis. While a ""tougher-than-anticipated recruiting and hiring environment"" was a driver of below-expected results late last year, and an 18% organic growth rate this year, it's worth remembering that this is a pretty small company, and we're talking about a difference of about ten sales reps. I don't imagine a fast-growing company like SPS would have that much trouble finding ten good reps. I'm not saying it's an excuse, just pointing out that it's something to watch.I have similar concerns about the acquired ToolBox business - it's not expected to grow much revenue-wise this year, despite seemingly significant cross-sale potential, its historical teens CAGR, and its pretty small (~$6 million) revenue base. Given that SPS paid a pretty robust multiple - roughly 3.8x 2016 revenues including the modest $1.1 million earn-out - and also given that the deal will take a while to reach SPS level margins, the initial slow start out of the gate is curious.Valuation: In Light Of The Growth, Looks PriceyI do expect SPS to deliver higher Adjusted EBITDA margins over time and don't have trouble seeing the company reach the internet-standard 20% level, up from the teens now. Stock-based compensation is not egregious, but still looks like it will be 3.5-4% of revenues over time. All told, though, without the prospect of long-term margins in the mid-to-high 20s, the current enterprise valuation (at the price of $55) represents well over 4x future revenues, which would be expensive for an e-commerce or SaaS play with 20%-at-best revenue growth.The ""fair"" valuation is obviously very sensitive to your assumptions around margin and growth rate, but based on the general history of SaaS valuations and the current e-commerce peer group (including ChannelAdvisor), I think a valuation closer to ~3x revenues makes more sense even if you believe the company's growth targets. This would still represent a >20x multiple to current Adjusted EBITDA (let alone ""real"" EBITDA), so it's not as if I'm sandbagging here. While I like the story, given my general caution as well as my specific concerns about the sustainability of SPS's growth rate, I wouldn't be a buyer even at that valuation.Final ThoughtsWhile I'm generally inclined to be favorable toward e-commerce/omnichannel stories, and don't see any particular reason to dislike SPS as a business, the valuation right now still looks pretty robust relative to companies like ChannelAdvisor and the broader SaaS landscape (even after adjusting for differences in periodic growth rate). This is a company with an interesting story that's well worth watching, but an eventual downtrend in revenue growth (which I fully expect) could drive a downward rerating - so I don't see any urgency for investors to establish a position here today.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

1880581,41741,2013-12-05T14:10:33-05:00,,"Overall, we're fans of cloud computing and believe in its potential. We do see the trend toward SaaS and there are certainly companies that will benefit from this trend, such as Callidus Software (NASDAQ:CALD), while other companies in the space have been driven by euphoria over cloud computing's potential, namely SPS Commerce (NASDAQ:SPSC).Shares of SPS have had a great run over the past year, up over 80%. The problem is that the stock is now trading way out of touch with the company fundamentals. The stock is trading at 933x this year's earnings and 102x next year's earnings. We see SPSC as an overvalued play in the SaaS space and a great opportunity as a short.OverviewThe backbone of SPS is its platform, a cloud-based software suite that improves the way suppliers, retailers, distributors and other customers manage and fulfill orders. The SPS Commerce platform utilizes pre-built trading partner integrations to eliminate the need for on-premise software and support staff, which enables supplier customers to shorten supply cycle times, optimize inventory levels, reduce costs and satisfy retailer requirements. As of December 31, 2012, SPSC had approximately 18,000 customers with contracts to pay monthly fees (recurring revenue customers). The company also generated revenues by providing its cloud-based supply chain management solutions to an additional 32,000 organizations.Dismal margins signal minimal bottom-line growthThe first and biggest problem that we see with SPS is that its business has very low margins. While the top-line growth has been impressive, rising from $44.6 million in 2010 to $98.9 million this year, to do this, the company had to service over 52,000 customers. The company's operating margin is a dismal 1.3%. This comes after 2011 and 2012 operating margins came in around 2%.The second problem is that 88% of revenues come from recurring customers. SPS has about 18,900 recurring customers. While it sounds impressive, the problem is that SPS already sells the services that its customers need. Meaning it will be hard to grow revenues internally, where it cannot cross-sell or upsell current customers. It will have to attract new customers, and to do so, it'll have to increase expenses and compress margins further. Furthermore, SPS has been in business since 1997, and during this time, the company has an accumulated deficit of $47.8 million.Lack of an economic moatSPS lacks an IP portfolio. The company has no patents and only one patent-pending. With the supply-chain management software segment as fragmented as it is, SPS is exposed to one of the bigger SaaS players coming in and consolidating the space. SPS has only $80 million in cash and we don't see the company as having the capabilities to consolidate the sector. We see Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as the most likely candidates. The only thing keeping them from doing so is likely the weak margins in the segment.Beyond its lack of patents, the company's recurring revenue customers are not bound by any long-term contracts. These customers can cancel at anytime with 30 days notice. Furthermore, 85% of revenues come from one product, the Trading Partner Integration solution. With the company's foundation resting solely on a product with no IP protection, we see the company's foundation as being shaky at best.Selling stock near the highsOne thing we have to give credit to management of SPS is that they are smart to take advantage of the recent rise in share price. In November the company raised $47.5 million after pricing 750,000 shares at $67. The company plans to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions.However, this isn't the best move for shareholders. We see it as dilutive to existing shareholders and management trying to fill the company's coffers by taking advantage of a rising share price. While management is smart to make this move, we feel that it will not be enough to transform the company's prospects or make the company any more valuable. Furthermore, the company's track record isn't great in terms of returns. SPS has a ROE of only 0.9%.In terms of management, they certainly didn't purchase any stock in the offering. Insiders have been exercising their options and selling shares. Insiders own only 0.3% of the company and in the last six months have been net sellers of over 182k shares, or 65% of their holdings. Insiders now own just over 95k shares.Source: Yahoo! FinanceAccording to Ticker Report:The very next day, Ticker Report had this story:The biggest threat? IBMThe biggest competitor for SPS is Sterling Commerce, which is now owned by IBM (NYSE:IBM). IBM purchased Sterling from AT&T for $1.4 billion back in 2010. Sterling was a legacy asset for AT&T that came with AT&T's deal with SBC Communications. To give you an indication of the valuations in this sector, SBC bought Sterling at the height of the dotcom bubble for $3.9 billion. Along the way, the company did several tuck-in acquisitions, but that was still not enough to salvage the investment made in Sterling.IBM merged Sterling with its WebSphere middleware unit. Sterling competes head-to-head with SPS and provides business-to-business supply chain, integration and fulfillment software. Sterling primarily focuses on transactions for financial services, retail, manufacturing, communications and distribution companies.Bottom lineIn looking at the fundamentals of SPS, the picture isn't pretty. Shares are trading at 10.2x sales, 7.1x book, 12.5x cash and 153.1x FCF. In looking at enterprise value, the company has an EV/EBITDA multiple of 92.1. SPS Commerce looks to be a blast from the past. In other words, the company would fit right in with any of the high flyers during the dotcom era.The company's valuation is completely out of whack with reality. Analysts seem to be falling all over themselves in regards to the company's 30% revenue growth. However, it's not translating to profits. The company's margins are dismal and there's no signs of margin improvement around the corner. Management certainly realizes this, particularly COO James Frome who keeps dumping his shares in the company.SPS Commerce is a great opportunity for those that missed the dotcom bubble to have another go at it as far as shorting. SPS is a prime candidate where its valuation defies reality. We see fair value for the company at around $33, or downside of 50%.Worth noting is that we reached out to management and the company's investor relations to give them a chance to address our concerns and rebut any of our findings, but received no response. When, and if, the company reaches out to us, we will be more than happy to share their thoughts with readers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Recurring customers of the company increased (pdf) 10%, while average revenue per recurring customer grew by 14% during the most recent quarter. Note that average revenue per recurring customer rose to $6,225 during Q2 2015. Further, no major customer accounts for more than 2% of the company's revenue. However, the company may not be able to achieve growth in revenue/customer as the competition increases. Overall, expanding customer base despite increasing revenue per customer indicates that SPS offers differentiated services. Moreover, the revenue of the company depends on the retail side of EDI and supply chain management.Industry ProspectsWith the rise of cloud computing, swift integration of different services is becoming important for organizations. As integration is only a support service, businesses tend to outsource integration projects and redirect resources toward their core services. Companies offering these integration services are termed as integration brokerages. Some companies offer services for a wide range of markets while others, like SPS which is retail-centric, focus on specific industries.Gartner believes (pdf) that spending on integration brokerage is expected to increase at a CAGR of 15% for the next few years. The firm thinks that the market is not dynamic and still reinventing itself. This means that the industry's players should innovate frequently to remain relevant.According to IDC, penetration of electronic data interchanges is low. A survey conducted by IDC revealed 44% of the high-tech manufacturing companies are only trading electronically, with 25% or fewer suppliers indicating that there's room for substantial growth. ""Enterprises have to continue to invest in modernizing B2B infrastructure in order to stay competitive in the digital economy,"" said Chandana Gopal, research manager, IDC's Multi-Enterprise Integration Middleware research program.""EDI standards remain the dominant protocols in the B2B world and EDI-related network traffic volumes increased between 5% and 10% during the past year. EDI transaction volume is currently in the range of 12 million to 15 million transactions a day on a worldwide basis. Its ongoing growth means it will continue to be the dominant document exchange alternative for many years to come,"" said Ken Vollmer, an analyst at Forrester Research. This growth trend is set to continue for the next five years or so, he added.The global smart and mobile supply chain solutions market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.2% during 2014-2019, is attracting more supply chain players which is resulting in an increased demand for integration services, notes Transparency Market Research. According to the report, integration services are a major factor expected to drive the market over the report's forecast period. IDC supports those projections and expects that integration technologies will be the top priority of CIOs for driving growth during 2015. Further, a recent report by Saugatuck Technology revealed that businesses rated ""integrating SaaS offerings with existing workloads and data structures"" among their top priority for cloud deployment. See the chart below:Source: Forrester ResearchRegarding SCM in retail, public cloud deployment of supply chain management is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21.5% during 2011-2016, according to Gartner. The supply chain analytics market is expected to grow to $4.8 billion by 2019, a CAGR of 14.6% (2014-2019). ""The omnichannel trend places increased importance on technology which allows for heightened visibility, integration, and better inventory management across the supply chain"", according to William Blair and Company.To review, integration services are set to grow in coming years; they will witness double digit growth. Electronic data interchange remains the dominant standard and will continue to dominate the industry. The supply chain management market will also grow between 15% p.a. and 20% p.a. during the next five years or so. All of the growth in EDI and SCM is enabled by the need of integration services. As a provider of a one stop SCM platform, incorporating EDI, that enables integration, SPS Commerce is set to benefit from the growth trends in all these areas.ThesisAs it's settled that SPS will continue to grow amid positive industry outlook, it's time to answer a couple of key questions. Is this growth cheap? And, is the premium stock valuation justified? The answer to both these questions is a straightforward no.There's a reason for a blunt no and that is the valuation. SPS' current valuation can't be justified on any level. Yes, the company has witnessed growth consistently and, yes, the industry's outlook is good. But the problem is that qualitative analysis gives no insight into how much that growth is worth. And, investors usually end up overpaying.In SPS' case, the growth trajectory is quite clear. The industry is set to grow between 15%-20%; the company will maintain its 25% earnings growth based on industry figures. SPS has been growing its earnings by 25% for the past four quarters. Now, if the company sustains its earnings growth for the next ten years, we get the following picture.Focus Equity EstimatesBased on discounted EPS, the stock is worth $49.2 even if the company sustains its earnings growth for the next ten years. Looking short term, SPSC is trading at a forward PE of 70, which is quite high given that earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.5% during the next five years. Note that PE TTM of the application software industry is 58.5 while the forward PE of SPS is ahead of that. The application software industry is already trading at a premium. PEG of SPS is around 3.95, indicating expensive growth.Let's see SPS Commerce from an economic value addition perspective. Assumptions include earnings growth of 25% during 2015-2019 followed by 3% growth in perpetuity. The cost of equity is increased each year to reflect higher retained earnings and dilution in share count. CAPM is used to calculate the required rate of return. S&P 500 is used as a proxy for market return.Focus Equity EstimatesThe valuation sheet indicates that the stock is overvalued and is worth $46.7 based on the assumptions noted above. The sheet also reveals that the company will be able to post 5.9% p.a. growth in residual earnings as a going concern. Now, the implied growth calculator can be used to find the growth required for the company to achieve its current valuation. See the chart below:Source: PrudenaThe model shows that SPSC has to register 8.83% growth in residual earnings to reach its current valuation of $67.97. But the company can achieve a growth rate of 5.95% as discussed above. There's a deficit of 2.88%. In simple terms, the company has to attract an extra 3% growth each year in perpetuity to achieve its current valuation. 3% is a big ask in perpetual terms. And, this is just to justify the current valuation.Cash flow based valuation brings about the same result. Operating cash flow is assumed to grow at a CAGR of 25% during the next five years. 3% growth is assumed in perpetuity.Focus Equity EstimatesThe cash flow valuation also shows the stock is overvalued. Note that working capital is added back to bolster the target.To review, the stock is overpriced as evident from PE, EVA and OCF valuation approaches. The implied growth rate is also very high. The company won't be able to match 8% implied growth based on 25% earnings growth during the next five years and 3% growth thereafter.The problem doesn't solely lie with the valuation. SPS is not a leader in the space. And, it doesn't have the resources like some of the big companies. In SPS' words,Source: GartnerWithout a leading position, a high premium can't be justified. Gartner thinks that limited geographical operations and vertical industries are in the way of the company's leadership position. Magic Quadrant for Integration Brokerage places SPS in the challenger Quadrant, which, in our view, is not enough to justify a 70x multiple. And, all the valuations are based on the assumption that SPS will sustain its top line growth going forward, which may not be the case. According to the management:In conclusion, investors are buying into expensive growth, as price targets based on consensus growth projections reveal overvaluation. And, the high premium can't be justified because neither the company is a leader in integration services nor does it have the resources like conventional players. We rate SPS a sell."

It beat earnings by nearly 7%, marking the fourth straight quarter of an earnings beat. Earnings came in at $0.16 a share (beating $0.15 consensus) and revenues beat marginally. Revenues for 2Q 2014 were up 21% y/y, with recurring revenue growing 23% y/y. The company guided EPS for full year 2014 to $0.62 to $0.64. Consensus was $0.64.Since we first profiled the company back in December, shares are down over 13%. Shares hit $71 earlier this year, before falling to $48. They now trade right at $54. We still feel fair value is close to $33; suggesting 40% downside.SPS Commerce touted its rise in recurring revenue, but we still see the fact that the company has little customer captivity as a long-term threat. Meaning, it'll be easy for the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).

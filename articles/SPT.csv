However, we think that the continuing investment in go-to-market will reaccelerate growth beyond 2020.","In our view, Sprout Social (SPT) presents an interesting investment opportunity due to its deep moat in the social media management space. Alternatively, we also view Sprout Social as a social media CRM (Customer Relationship Management) play. Founded in 2011, the company has expanded its offering and acquired a strong brand reputation globally over time. In this first coverage, we take a closer look at Sprout Social’s competitive positioning and revenue model, in conjunction with its go-to-market.The strong brand name gives Sprout Social a defensible moat and an edge against its peers. There is a massive TAM behind the social media management space, given the overlap with the competitive CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and contact center spaces, in which we see many well-capitalized players like Salesforce (CRM), Hubspot (HUBS), or Zendesk (ZEN).(Source: TrustRadius)Over the last decade, however, the space has evolved and become more specialized. The evolution of the space has further presented opportunities for players like Sprout Social, Buffer, or Hootsuite to differentiate themselves and establish defensible moats.(Source: Sprout Social)Having been a user of some of these tools as well, we conclude that Sprout Social and Hootsuite have the most comprehensive offerings and stronger brand names in the space, even against the more well-resourced peers like Salesforce, Hubspot, and Zendesk. With that in mind, we believe that Sprout Social is well-positioned to extract the highest-valued opportunities from the large and evolving social media management space.Sprout Social has high growth and high-quality revenue. Sprout Social should continue to benefit from its strong brand reputation globally. It has 24,000 customers worldwide and primarily leverages its self-serve free-trial model to drive conversions. In our view, the combination of a strong brand reputation, differentiated offering, and a highly efficient go-to-market have resulted in high growth and high-quality revenue.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)Sprout Social has a +30% revenue growth with a +$120 million ARR, in which 99% of it is subscription-based. The subscription revenue figure is the highest among other SaaS stocks we have covered so far. Furthermore, the company would have had a 41% YoY organic revenue growth in Q1, if it excluded the revenue from Simply Measure, a company it acquired in 2017. Overall, revenue grew by 31% YoY in Q1, even despite the reportedly heavy headwinds in March. As such, we see an upside from here on out. As the company conservatively forecasts a full-year ~25% growth with ~30% organic growth due to the COVID-19 uncertainty, we expect growth to also reaccelerate beyond 2020.While the high-quality revenue provides predictability and also sustainability, we expect Sprout Social to continue reinvesting back to the business to expand its TAM. As such, we do not foresee the company to be profitable in the near to medium term.(Source: Company 10-K)So far, operating margin and FCF (Free Cash Flow) have been negative, driven by the high expenses. Marketing has historically been the largest expense as a percentage of revenue. This year, we expect Sprout Social to continue spending ~45% of its revenue on marketing, which is already an improvement from ~53% in 2019.We believe that Sprout Social has solid fundamentals and moat in the social media management space, driven by its differentiated offering and strong brand reputation. The growth story is attractive considering the massive TAM and Social Sprout’s strong positioning.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)Despite the heavy investments to-date, there is a path to cash flow and operating profitability longer term considering the company’s high subscription base and organic revenue that provide it with visibility. Therefore, we think that Sprout Social is fairly valued at ~11x P/S, despite the 25% growth expectation. The company expects revenue of ~$128 million at the end of FY 2020, down from the previous ~$133 million, which assumed a 30% growth. We believe that the stock can easily reaccelerate to +30% beyond 2020, in which we expect the stock to trade at ~12x-14x P/S, driven by the long-term catalysts discussed. We maintain an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of ~$34."
4358877,98236,2020-07-16T14:31:39-04:00,"Sprout Social is a leader in the category of Social Media Marketing Management.The company has an extensive, and quite sophisticated set of tools that can be used to measure the efficacy and reach of social media marketing campaigns.The company is a recent IPO, but it has nowhere near the valuation of many other recent IPO's with an EV/S ratio of less than 8X.It has been able to sustain headline growth of greater than 30%-and what it calls organic growth has been higher, still.The combination of reasonably rapid growth, a strong market position in a strong market, and more reasonable valuation than some other, better known IT vendors makes these shares attractive.","I confess that until the IPO of Sprout Social (SPT) in late 2019 I had never really focused on the category of Social Media Marketing Management as an investment opportunity. I had always thought that Google (GOOG) was basically the gorilla in the space, and I was unsure how successful competitors could be. Google and other social media giants are always going to offer tools to promote usage and ad placement. But the fact appears that there is a great business opportunity beyond that, and a few companies, such as Sprout are out there trying to gain their place at the table. I believe that there is enough value add that can be offered-indeed is being offered-by Sprout to make it a successful business. Unlike many companies that have weathered the Covid-19 induced economic contraction with falling revenues and substantial financial impact, Sprout has seen only a modest impact that was limited in duration. Overall, using social media as a marketing strategy seems to one of those activities that will see a long-term benefit from the trends toward remote interaction that have been fostered by the pandemic, and its risks. Sprout would appear to have a desirable combination of market leadership, management skills, and a sector tailwind coupled with a somewhat lower level of relative valuation to generate positive alpha into the future.Sprout is a relatively small company with current revenue forecast to be around $130 million in the current fiscal year. As these things go currently, the company's EV/S ratios, based on just more than 50 million shares outstanding, of less than 8X EV/S is far below the multiples other newly minted IT businesses such as recently reviewed Bill.Com. (BILL) Actually, the EV/S for this company is about 35% below average for its growth cohort of companies with mid-high 20% 3 year CAGR estimates. Most recently Sprout reported a quarter in which revenues and ARR grew about 30%, although it is important to note that the comparison on an organic basis, excluding the now discontinued Simply Measured solution, was above 40% last quarter. There has been some bifurcation in valuation between hyper-growth, and just about everything else, but I do not think excuses need to be made for companies with 30% reported growth, which is more like 40% growth on an organic basis. According to the company, at this point, almost all of its revenue is organic so the results going forward should reflect the real growth of the business.One of the key feature of the Sprout Social platform is what is described as a Smart Inbox. This feature monitors and engages with messages across Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Instagram and LinkedIn in a unified social inbox. Other key features include Review management, which as it says monitors, and manages business reviews in a unified stream, Facebook and Instagram Ad comment moderation, overall comment moderation and Brand Monitoring. As is probably obvious from this brief description, Sprout, and its independent competitors offer a service that addresses many of the primary social media channels as opposed to the Google offering which is, perforce, simply focused on Google.For many businesses that have started or are continuing to pivot their advertising and marketing to social media, it has heretofore been impossible to determine what is working and equally important what is not working in terms of detailed analytics. And some competitive solutions do not come with free trials that demonstrate their effectiveness to potential users. That is really the potential ROI that Sprout provides its customers. I have linked here to a testimonial/case study from the Chicago Bulls basketball team about their specific experience with using Sprout Social. How Sprout Social helps the Chicago Bulls take its social media game to the next level but there are many other well-known brands that have invested in the platform including Ohio State University, Boston Scientific (BSX), Shopify (SHOP), Blue Nile and Harrods to name a few of the more prominent customers that were acquired recently. The company called out a particularly deal with a travel enterprise that was signed in April and it has also signed deals with other companies in affected verticals such as restaurants.Bambu is Sprout's employee advocacy platform. Employee advocacy is both a buzz word and a real world phenomenon. Basically employee advocacy is based on getting employees to promote brands through incentive and recognition programs which usually have some impact on employee engagement. The definition of employee advocacy includes having employees wearing logo tee shirts, or the use of employer branded water bottles, or caps or coffee mugs or some other way of showing a brand. Employee advocacy is probably in its early innings and early adopters will realize palpable benefits, while later adopters are likely to wind up using the technology just to keep up. Not terribly surprisingly, posts about products from Facebook Friends, which are considered as part of employee advocacy are far more likely to be read than what are considered to be brand advertisements. So getting employees to write those posts has a very high ROI in terms of getting a brand message into the hands of potential consumers.The same concept might be at work in terms of improving the image of a company in terms of its culture, and through that, employee retention percentages. These kind of programs apparently work best for cohorts of millennial and Gen-X employees. I am the last thing to a millennial employee. But the fact is that what works for that cohort of society is far more important than what works for a septuagenarian such as this writer. Here is a link to case study on the use of Bambu by Zendesk (ZEN) Zendesk proves the value of employee advocacy with Bambu by Sprout SocialNot terribly surprisingly, market research suggests that the market for social media management tools in enormous. One forecast, linked here, says it will be $18 billion by 2023. Social Media Management Market The report says that the CAGR of the space is around 14%. I do not think it is necessary to believe that the market for the tools that SPT currently sells is $18 billion in order to determine that the company's growth runway is more than sufficient to support a CAGR in the high 20% range, and perhaps more, over the coming 3 years.There are many companies in the space, and some of them are formidable competitors. The competitor that will be best known by readers is Google and its Google analytics offering. I have linked here to an analysis by Trust Radius comparing the two offerings. I should note that as is often the case with these kinds of reports, some of the issues identified as negatives for Sprout have been improved. Again, given the size of the space, it isn't necessary to suggest that Sprout is going to knock off Google anytime soon, or ever, in order to validate the growth opportunity. Here is the link to the Trust Radius survey: Google Analytics vs Sprout Social | TrustRadiusThe report linked here, lists some of the prominent competitors: Social Media Management Software Market Size, Share 2020 - Global Trends, Statistics, Regional Analysis by Key Players | Industry Forecast by Categories, Platform, End - User I am not in the business of trying to evaluate different platforms, and often just reviewing the products doesn't translate into growth forecasts. Still, most of the comments seen here in the latest G2 survey seem highly favorable. G2 reports have a grid feature that ranks the various vendors. In that presentation, Sprout is listed as either at the top, or in 2nd place in the various categories in which G2 segments the market. Hubspot is considered to be a leader in this survey which is linked here: https://www.g2.com/categories/social-media-mgmt. I have also linked here to a head to head competitive survey between Sprout, Zoot and Hubspot (HUBS): Sprout Social vs HubSpot Marketing Hub vs Hootsuite.After parsing the linked reports above, I think I can fairly say that Sprout has a well-regarded product that can assist users in their use of social media advertising and scheduling to a significant degree. There are many competitors, and competition is and will be fierce, although functionality is perhaps more important than price in vendor selection. From an investment perspective, the growth of the space is such that there is plenty of room for many successful companies, and Sprout is certainly likely to be one of the successful competitors. I will come back to valuation later, to be sure, but I think the shares, relative to the potential growth and profitability of this business, are reasonably attractive, and are certainly attractive relative to their best known and far larger rival, Hubspot.Sprout is an unusual software company headquartered in Chicago. It is also unusual in that its CEO is listed as a Glassdoor top CEO. I am not quite sure how one values company culture; self-evidently it reduces churn, and in turn that should help a company in terms of the productivity of its staff, and ultimately its profitability.The company first entered its market with the Sprout platform in 2011. It attracted some high-profile venture investors over its years as a private business. The company bought a company called Simply Measured at the end of 2017. Simply Measured had a set of analytic functionality that Sprout incorporated into its platform. Over time, the Simply Measured product line has disappeared, and Sprout has provided an organic growth number that excludes the contribution from Simply Measured. Just for the record, this is a link to the product integration strategy that has been followed: Sprout Social + Simply Measured Alignment Update: Where We Are & Where We're Going In 2015, the company launched Bambu, which offers users what is called an employee social advocacy platform. The market served by Bambu is still quite nascent. I have to confess that somethings like social advocacy campaigns can easily grate on my own cultural sensibilities-I am not likely to buy anything I see on someone's coffee mug or tee shirt, although from time to time I do ask friends about their experience with different products. But this kind of marketing is said to be a ""coming thing""to use an expression long since out of fashion. Here are some statistics regarding why social advocacy is apparently growing rapidly: 20 Advocacy Marketing Statistics You Need To Know.Sprout Social's IPO came at a phase in the market which was not quite all in on tech IPO's. While Bill.com's IPO, which was within a few days of Sprout Social, skyrocketed on its first day of trading, Sprout shares wound up falling marginally below the IPO price of $17. The shares subsequently drifted up to about $21 in early February, before beginning a descent to $12 during the Covid-19 panic of February and March. It wound up selling about 10 million shares at the time of the IPO. The company had been quite efficient in using its funding-it had raised just $110 million in funding to build up $100 million in ARR. That is an uncommonly efficient metric as those things go, and might suggest that this company has a focus on financial returns as well as growth. I might wonder, however, if the company might then, or would now grow at a faster percentage pace if more funds were spent on sales and marketing.The company has announced 2 quarters since its IPO. The results of its Q4 were considered to be a significant beat with reported revenues rising 26% and organic revenues rising 37%. Profitability metrics were also above prior expectations. The shares rose marginally the day after the report, but as the market was falling precipitously at that point, the results were lost in the tsunami of Covid-19 induced selling.From my perspective, given the time period involved, the results of Q1 which ended March 31st were actually more impressive and I will review them in detail below. It is hard to evaluate just how ""prudent' this company's guidance might actually be after just 2 quarters of results, and considering that one quarter of the results were in the midst of the pandemic. As I have written a few times during the course of evaluating companies during this contraction, I am not too sure just how much guidance might be worth in considering valuation.Sprout shares recovered along with the rest of the market and were particularly propelled by the results of Q1 that were released on 5/7. The shares made a high of just over $32 on June 5th, and have drifted down since that time to current prices in the $26 range as I write this. The recovery, while quite spectacular, really did not much more than take the shares from a panic valuation to one that was more in keeping with the average valuation for the company's growth. There were, as most readers will be aware, many other names that showed a similar pattern falling to panic valuations, and then rising spectacularly. What has been different about SPT shares is that their valuation advance stalled, in early June, leaving the shares at levels noticeably below average for the company's growth cohort. I imagine that much of this stall is based on the expiration of the lock-up that took place on June 13 and which has enabled substantial sales. Unlike some recent IPO's, this company was probably too small for a registered secondary, and it hasn't chosen nor does it need to raise additional cash given that its current cash balance is $137 million, and it has a current RPO balance of $47.5 million, up more than 10% sequentially.May 7th seems an eon ago, at least in terms of how the economy seems to be adjusting to the pandemic. While legacy media outlets continues to report rather grim metrics about the incidence of the pandemic in some states, and their seems to have been a limited pause in reopening parts of the economy, overall economic metrics seem far stronger than was the case 2 months ago, and the trend still seems to be positive.As mentioned SPT's results for its Q1 were quite strong, particularly given the impact of the contracting economy at the end of the quarter. The company was able to over-attain its sales performance metrics across the board, despite the strong headwinds from the economic contraction that started in March. The company obviously sells to many SMB's with a minimum price point of $99/month, and this SMB exposure led to churn increasing by more than one standard deviation from normal levels at the end of March.Of course, given the subscription model, much of the impact from the churn, and from the contraction in new customer acquisition, will be seen in the quarter to be reported on August 5th. The company reported in the course of the call, that its demand generation and retention statistics had actually returned to normal levels by the week ending April 6th. Unlike many peers, SPT did provide guidance, not just for the current quarter, but for the full year. The company provided revenue guidance for Q2 that is just marginally above the revenues reported for Q1. The company's full year guidance, at the top end of its range would imply sequential growth of about 5%/quarter. Despite the relatively modest forecast for sequential growth, overall the company is forecasting full year organic growth of greater than 30%. Again, according to the company's conference call script, the high end of the range-what I have used for my own valuation calculations, is based on minimal improvements in the business environment since April. The fact is that the business environment appears quite a bit better today on Bastille Day, July 14th than was the case back on May 7th. While my expectations for a beat in Q2 results is going to be constrained by impact of the economy in late March and the first part of April, there ought to have been enough of a snap-back to produce revenues-and most likely margins as well-that exceed current published expectations.The specifics of the CEO commentary are as follows: ""So given the thousands of trials that we're adding to the top of the funnel in any given month, tens of thousands of renewals and transactions that we're doing, gave us a lot of insight into how those metrics were trending, which periods of time they were impacted for and the degree of recovery. I think while certainly there's a lot of unknown still that remain for the rest of the year, the assumptions that we're making and where we felt good about putting the baseline of the guidance was around the kind of extrapolating out the worst of what we've seen in March and April, which is counter to the trends that we've seen more recently, which are much healthier.And that gave us the confidence that we needed at least to put a stake in the ground at the low end of the guidance while we gather more data on how quickly or how much those trends that we've seen improve in the last several weeks, what the level of stability is around those. And so part of this is the high volume kind of lower ACV nature of our business where we've just got a lot of predictability. We've got 99% recurring revenue, subscription revenue, low services. We've been virtual for a long time.And we've got that level of detail on our data on top of a 35- to 45-day average sales cycle has allowed us to see how a lot of this impact plays out in the time that we've kind of been in the situation. So we felt like we've got strong visibility into at least the band that we provided. Where it falls within that is we're going to look to data to clarify that for ourselves. But the guidance that we gave is something that we're really confident in because of the reasons that I mentioned.'The company indicated on its call that its trials had increased by 14% above the levels that it was achieving prior to the economic contraction. I think that is a pretty positive set-up for an earnings beat and a guidance increase when the company reports its results on 8/5Just how management chooses to guide for the balance of the year is not much better than a guess. I wouldn't expect ebullient guidance almost regardless of the state of the business through August 5th, the scheduled date of the earnings release. I might, however, reasonably anticipate some stepwise improvement in guidance as the impacts of the economy on customer demand diminish gradually. While an upside earnings surprise is a helpful component of valuation, and determining an entry point, by itself it wouldn't be enough for me to recommend this name.But, before discussing the numbers, it is, I feel, important to dissect the company's go to market strategy. Initially, the Sprout service had been built for SMB's with loads of customers and single user deployments. The company has a relatively defined sales process that based on stimulating inbound inquiries, trials, and a zero-touch process for closing and deployment. The sales cycles are obviously very short and the company believes that its 30 day free trial is a major competitive weapon, even in the enterprise.I am not in the position to evaluate the company's assertion that, ""The legacy software playbook that required on-site custom demos, long evaluations, and even longer and expensive deployments has become antiquated. We're in the age of the user, and companies expect to be able to not just see, but to use the technology before they invest. And that's where we mean it. Our free trial model has been highly disruptive, enabling customers to implement Sprout before they even see one of our competitors' demos.""I can say that Sprout is easy and intuitive to use and it produces actionable data very quickly.At the end of last quarter, Sprout had 24k customers, a net increase of 1.6% for the quarter and up about 11% for the year. But while the growth of net new customers is not particularly impressive, the growth of larger users, those with ARR volume of greater than $10k/year is showing far healthier growth with a 58% year on year increase through the end of March. The company has some add on products such as Listening, and Advanced Analytics that are driving the growth in numbers of larger users and in their average annual spend, and this has enabled the company to improve the efficiency of its selling motion. The company has had success with some larger and marquee customers, but the pivot to larger enterprises is still very much a work in progress-most of the larger names reported as customer acquisitions are still very much 2nd tier rather than the largest and best known enterprises. At this point, the focus on selling to larger users is still as much an opportunity more than an absolute trend; the company's pivot will take time.Last quarter, most of the detailed financial metrics were generally consistent with prior trends. The company has not yet started to achieve leverage on the gross margin line; gross margins were 74% last quarter despite the fact that the company has limited drag from professional services. Non-GAAP operating expense rose 31% last quarter, almost exactly the same increase as the rise in revenues. The company grew sales and marketing by about 35%. General and administrative expenses spiked, due to public company expense but should see progressive declines in that expense ratio from last quarter's 32%. A company of this size is more likely to have general and administrative costs in the high-teens percentage. Contrariwise, the company's 22% expense ratio for research and development, is probably below the mean for a company of this size. Management attributed the efficiency to the fact that it has but a single code base.The company indicated that it was continuing to hire through the worst of the impact of the pandemic and would continue to do so. Again, I would expect that the hiring this company has done will be at a moderate cadence such as to allow positive unit economics, and I expect that a revenue upside will propel an improvement in overall margins, creating an upward bias on EPS performance.Sprout misses being considered to be one of the hyper-growth vendors. To choose an extreme example, nCino's recent IPO has valued its shares at almost 40X EV/S while Sprout is valued in the single digits on the same metric. Yes, nCino has faster growth, and yes, it has what appears to be a more defensible moat, but the valuation disparity is pretty substantial, even looking at the growth rate differential.Currently analysts are sticking pretty close to management's projections with regards to growth this year, although the company is expected to see 28% growth in 2021. As mentioned, I think, based on the data provided during the conference call, that SPT will probably beat and raise when it reports numbers in August, and that is likely to lead to positive earnings revisions at that time.I have used a revenue estimate for the next 12 months of $155,000,000 which is more or less consistent with the consensus. That brings the EV/S ratio to 7.7X, and that is at least 30% below the average valuation for its high-20% growth cohort. The best fit valuation line curves pretty sharply to the left beyond 30% growth. But this company has lower than average valuation than would be forecast by the best fit line even for high 20% growth, and there might be some reasons to suspect that growth might accelerate in coming quarters.At this point, Sprout is far from profitability and free cash flow generation. This is one element, I believe, in constraining the valuation of the shares. There are, I believe, significant opportunities to enhance margins; gross margins are lower than those of many other SaaS companies, the company should also be able to reduce the general and administrative expense ratio. But the opportunity to drive growth in this space is of such a magnitude, that I do not expect any substantial leverage at scale with regards to sales and marketing costs in the near future.Using software to manage social media marketing is one the higher probability bets to be had in the enterprise software space. Using a paid service such as this as opposed to one provided by the social media providers is also probably inevitable. This company appears, based on the evidence I have adduced, to have a strong position in the market. I think the valuation is quite tempting, certainly on a relative basis, and the opportunity the company has both currently, and going forward to enhance growth rate percentages. I think this company should produce positive alpha for investors at a significant rate for some time into the future."
4320967,102646,2020-02-03T11:57:22-05:00,"Sprout Social launched its IPO in December last year.Sprout Social is smaller than HootSuite, which was recently valued at $750 million.Sprout Social does not meet three qualities that high-valued SAAS companies should have.","Source: Sprout SocialSprout Social (SPT) launched its Initial Public Offering ((IPO)) in December last year. The company priced its IPO at $17 but ended the day 2% lower. Things have changed, and the company's stock is up by more than 27% year-to-date. In this report, I will explain why Sprout Social does not deserve its current $ 1 billion valuation. I will mostly talk about its product, market size, and competition.Sprout Social is a relatively simple company to understand. The company offers a software-as-a-service to companies from around the world. Specifically, it offers a platform that allows companies to schedule social media posts across multiple platforms. It also allows these customers to analyze the performance of these social posts.This is a real problem that many companies face because social media plays an integral role in today's society. There are more than 3 billion social media users and companies must communicate with them. Social media companies like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have developed free tools that enable users to schedule their posts. The benefit of using a platform like Sprout Social is that it centralizes all communications.According to Sprout Social's S1, the company makes most of its money through subscriptions. It also makes some money by offering professional services. The company has seen its annual revenue grow from $44 million in 2017 to more than $78 million in 2018. Its number of paying customers has increased from 18,802k in 2017 to 23k in September last year.Sprout Social operates in a relatively competitive industry. The biggest competitor is the social media companies themselves. This is because many small companies don't need a centralized platform to communicate with their social media users.Other than these companies, Sprout Social has other bigger competitors like HootSuite and Buffer. HootSuite is a company I know about well because we use its platform in our organization. While the comprehensive numbers of these companies are not known, Sprout Social appears to have a relatively small market share in the industry.According to SimilarWeb, Sprout Social's website averages less than 2 million visitors a month. This is much smaller than the 8 million visitors who visit HootSuite and more than 4 million people who visit Buffer. The screenshot below shows the ranking of HootSuite and SproutSocial.Source: SimilarWebAt the same time, Sprout has more than 23k paying companies as customers. Buffer has more than 75k customers while HootSuite has more than 200k clients. HootSuite is used by more than 17 million people. On its website, the company says it serves more than 80% of the global Fortune 1000 companies. This is not all. According to Forrester (FORR), HootSuite is the clear leader in social engagement. Sprout Social does not appear on the list.Source: HootSuiteAs mentioned, Sprout Social provides a similar service to HootSuite and Buffer. They all allow you to schedule posts, reply to messages, and analyze data. A company that uses Sprout Social has no use for HootSuite's services because the services and the user interface is the same. What is different between the two is the price.Sprout Social offers three packages. The lowest tier is priced at $99 per month. This allows one user to manage five social media profiles. This is followed by a $149 tier that allows them to manage 10 profiles and a $249 package that adds more services. Clearly, Sprout Social targets large companies that can afford paying these fees.On the other hand, HootSuite's pricing is tailored to cater for both small and large organizations. It has a free package that allows one to manage three social profiles. This is a package ideal for start-up organizations. As they grow, they can move to a $19 per month package that allows them to manage 10 profiles. The most expensive package charges $599 per month. This is a model that has been used successfully by other SAAS companies like Salesforce (CRM), Zendesk (ZEN), and Slack (WORK).The challenge with Sprout Social's model is that it is very difficult for the company to market these packages to many small companies. These small companies are the most important to many SAAS companies. As such, it is difficult for a company to move from HootSuite to Sprout Social than vice versa.In fact, the company mentioned pricing as the second risk on its S1.There is another concern of the bigger picture when you look at the target market and industry. In the past decade, many companies embraced social media. It has become one of the most important communication and marketing tool for most companies around the world. A 2014 report by AdWeek found that 88% of companies were using social media for marketing.The industry has now reached a maturity level, which means that the era of exponential growth is coming to an end. For example, HootSuite already provides the centralized social media management platform to 80% of Fortune 1000 companies. Companies that have not yet done this will have many options like Buffer, Zoho, and Sendible to choose from.It is difficult to value SAAS companies. Investors who have used valuation as a basis for shorting companies like Shopify (SHOP) and Salesforce (CRM) have been burned. This is because these companies are not valued as traditional companies. To a large extent, metrics like price to earnings and price to sales don't matter.However, it is not difficult to see that Sprout Social valuation is out of touch with reality. Consider this. In the company's S1, it said that it had an Annual Recurring Revenue ((ARR)) of $100 million. As of this writing, the company has a market cap of about $1 billion. It is making losses of more than $20 million every year.HootSuite numbers are not known. Still, the company's ex-CEO told Canada's Financial Post that it was nearing $200 million in annual recurring revenue. At its peak, the company was valued at more than $1 billion. However, according to Bloomberg, the company considered selling itself at a valuation of about $750 million. This was the same valuation when it raised money in 2014. The company also became cash flow positive in 2014. Therefore, the $750 million valuation means that the company and Goldman Sachs (GS.PK), its banker, believes that public investors would not be willing to pay a $1 billion valuation.As such, if HootSuite values itself at $750 million, how can Sprout Social justify its $1 billion valuation?I believe that highly-valued SAAS companies should have three things. First, they need to have a superior product and a substantial or fast-growing market share. A good example of this is Shopify, which is known for its superior e-commerce platform. Sprout Social's product is not special. It does not offer features that its competitors don't offer.Second, they need to have a moat that make it difficult for other companies to disrupt it. Shopify and Microsoft (MSFT) are good examples of this. For example, it is difficult for any company to disrupt Microsoft's Office 365 product. It has a moat in this industry. The same is true with Adobe (ADBE), which has a moat in design software. Sprout Social does not have this moat. As mentioned above, there are tens of companies that offer a similar product.Third, a good SAAS company needs to be costly to abandon. Again, Shopify is a good example in this. If you run a Shopify store - as my wife does, - it is very difficult and time-consuming to move to another platform like Wix. The same is true if you use Microsoft's cloud services. The cost of transferring and the time to migrate will not be worth it. Sprout Social is not like that. In fact, it does not take a lot of time to move from Sprout Social to another company.SAAS companies that lack these three characteristics have had a difficult time in the market. Think of a company like Dropbox (DBX) and Slack (WORK) which have lost 20% of their value since their IPOs.Sprout Social is a good company that offers a service that is surely needed. However, based on the nature of the industry, the amount of competition, and the HootSuite valuation, I believe that the current valuation cannot be justified. However, this does not necessarily mean that investors should short the company. We are in a period of low-interest rates and irrational exuberance and the company's share price could still climb. Instead, I believe that investors should stay on the side-lines and see how it plays out."
4380557,105870,2020-10-22T11:35:12-04:00,"Sprout Social is one of the leading providers of social media management software with strong revenue growth and customer traction.As more traffic and customer engagement modalities shift to social media, solutions by vendors like Sprout Social will become increasingly important.The current valuation is undemanding, and I see significant upside from current levels.","Sprout Social (NASDAQ:SPT) is a platform used to manage social media accounts across a variety of different services including Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google. This platform provides an all-in-one solution that covers many core use cases including user engagement, content publishing, analytics, and collaboration. The company has performed well even through COVID as social media engagement became more important as offline consumer interactions became more restricted.From a pure product perspective, the company goes to market with the following key product features:Social media has become an increasingly important part of both digitally-native and non-digitally-native companies' go-to market strategy as e-commerce and overall consumer behavior has migrated to digital channels. Additionally, beyond just transactional sales, much of the historical customer interaction whether it is general marketing or customer service has also moved to social media channels. This has driven the increasing importance of social media to enterprises. However, the adoption of tools to manage social media channels is still relatively light. According to the company's analysis, only 5% of the 90 million businesses that have a social media presence actually have dedicated software to manage it. Thus, there is significant room for Sprout Social to grow. It is also why I believe that Sprout Social is a good way to get a call option on the overall enterprise shift towards social media channels.Additionally just looking at digital advertising spend in general, this has been a massive growth area as advertisers move their focus and spend away from online channels to online channels where many consumers have migrated their attention to. Given Sprout Social's focus on the digital channel, I believe it has significant runway for growth in this macro shift from offline to online across all industries. This is true even for non-digitally-native brands as they realize the importance of having a digital presence and even more importantly, engaging with customers with a modality that is most comfortable for them. In this case, the digital modality oftentimes through social media.In the social media management tools space specifically, Sprout Social is the clear leader with over 23,000 companies in over 100 countries on the platform. The company has a strong presence across SMB, Enterprise, and Mid-Market, which provides for a strong land and expand strategy as the customer grows. Customer satisfaction and upsell within the platform are also high with the company reporting net retention >100%. This strong upsell alongside organic demand for the platform has helped drive strong YoY revenue growth of 27% to a ~$126MM run-rate in Q2'20. This revenue is largely high-margin subscription software which provides a degree of stickiness to the company's revenue base.From a competitive point of view, I believe that the company has strong differentiation and will allow it to gain share in excess of the rest of the market. Although large platform plays such as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) are entering the market and have offerings that do bits and pieces of what the pure plays do, product leadership is still in the hands of pure plays ranging from Sprout Social to Hootsuite and Sprinklr. Additionally, those platforms are geared more for their own ecosystem vs. being platform agnostic like many of the pure-play vendors. In terms of pure plays, Hootsuite plays largely in the SMB space so isn't the greatest comp in terms of just customer target vs. the more mid-market/enterprise lean that Sprout Social has. Sprinklr on the other hand, with a much higher enterprise/mid-market mix, is a key competitor to Sprout Social as it has very similar feature sets. However, given the market size, I believe that there is significant room for multiple players to win here.The company continues to perform very well, with growth up 27% YoY in Q2 with burn decreasing as well. On the burn front, operating margins have improved from -44% to -27%, which is a significant YoY improvement and puts the company closer to break-even. Much of the expansion in OpEx YoY was in S&M, which can be pulled back to moderate burn if COVID-related disruptions cause significant macro headwinds that cause sales to soften. R&D and G&A either shrunk or grew slower YoY, which illustrates the increasing operating leverage that the company is achieving. With ~$80MM of cash, the company still has a significant cash runway without the need to raise dilutive capital.Competition is heating up in the space with many major platforms whether it be Adobe or Salesforce putting additional emphasis on this market. Additionally, pure-play competitors such as Sprinklr which have close feature parity to Sprout Social are an increasing threat. However, given the fact that the market is still relatively unpenetrated and the growing emphasis on social media management, I believe that there are multiple players that can win here. I firmly believe that just given Sprout Social's strong traction and product leadership that it will be one of the winners.The overall burn is still relatively high, and although liquidity is fine for now, there is always a risk of another dilutive equity raise if additional capital is needed.An additional risk here that is worth highlighting is the company's exposure to coronavirus-related headwinds. Although as of now, the company is likely to be a beneficiary of the mix shift towards digital channels, but a massive depressionary cycle driven by the pandemic may depress spend across forms of software including this company.The company currently trades at a EV/revenue of ~19x. This is based on FY 2020 revenue estimate of $129MM and an enterprise value of $2.45B. There are a few companies with a similar growth range that trade in the 10-20x range e.g. Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). The company is definitely on the higher end of the range, but I think it is warranted given the company's product leadership, relatively uncrowded competitive landscape, and large underpenetrated TAM with large opportunities for growth. This drives my bullish rating on the company. In terms of price target, I believe a 12-month price target of ~$62/share is fair (28% upside) and is based on maintaining the same EV/revenue multiple and utilizing the median FY21 revenue of $165MM."
4379760,103480,2020-10-19T12:14:38-04:00,"Sprout Social is a software company dedicated to bolstering corporate clients' social media presence.
        The company went public in December 2019 at $17 per share; shares have tripled this year.
        The company boasts a nearly pure recurring subscription revenue base, and trades at a decent ~15x forward revenue.
        The company benefits from tailwinds to ""inbound marketing,"" or emphasizing ""pull"" marketing versus ""push""","It's no secret that in today's world, the way we engage with and transact with brands has shifted online. Far more important than ""spray and pray"" marketing in which brands try to put up as many expensive TV ads as possible is ensuring an appealing, broadly-reaching social media presence that can draw in eyeballs through word of mouth as much as through digital ads. This is a trend that has only intensified post-coronavirus, when an even larger portion of our lives moved online. Social media has grown in such importance that it has spawned new careers of specialists, as companies race to build social media presences from scratch. So too have companies like Sprout Social (SPT) spawned, a company founded in 2010 with the goal of helping business clients navigate the setup of their social media strategy.One of the few software startups to come out of Chicago, Sprout Social went public at the tail end of last year at $17/share. The stock has seen tremendous success this year, with the updraft in internet stocks also driving Sprout Social up ~3x:To me, despite the stock's breathtaking year-to-date rally, I think there are a number of catalysts and bullish drivers that can take this stock (still a small/mid-cap name, at a ~$2.5 billion market cap) still higher. In particular, I think the key pieces underlining Sprout Social's ascent are:There's a lot to like about this company - investors should take advantage of the next dip in this stock to build up a position.Sprout Social's main premise is that ""consumers are forcing adoption"" of social media. More and more consumer spending is shifting to millennials and younger generations who grew up with social media and use it as a primary source of information about products. This means that, like it or not, brands have to maintain and curate a strong social media presence to be successful in the current landscape.Sprout Social touts an out-of-the-box, all-in-one solution to building and maintaining a social media presence. Here's a look at the suite of solutions that Sprout Social offers:Figure 1. Sprout Social featuresSource: sproutsocial.comThis platform is end-to-end: businesses can start by creating/publishing attractive content and scheduling when that content should post. Here is how that interface looks: in this example, a coffee business has a timeline prepared in advance of when certain content will post on various social media sites:Figure 2. Sprout Social publication exampleSource: sproutsocial.comAfter publication, Sprout Social gives customers the ability to uncover trends based on how the post was received and how much engagement it drew from followers. The company provides intuitive visualizations of the engagement statistics (example shown below) and runs analytics on the trends.Figure 3. Sprout Social analyticsSource: sproutsocial.comSprout Social also lets customers receive and respond to inbound engagement from within its software. A ""smart inbox"" helps social media managers collect responses across all social media channels, as well as drive automated responses. Like most SaaS products, Sprout Social is priced on a per-seat, monthly basis depending on the number of users who have access to its platform. A comparison of Sprout Social's different plans is shown below:Figure 4. Sprout Social pricingSource: sproutsocial.comLet's now dig into Sprout Social's most recent financials. The company's second-quarter earnings summary is shown below:Figure 5. Sprout Social Q2 resultsSource: Sprout Social Q2 earnings releaseSprout Social grew revenues at a 27% y/y pace to $31.4 million, slightly beating Wall Street's expectations of $31.2 million. As you can see in the revenue breakdown above, the fact that Sprout social is a one-size-fits-all software product that requires very little custom implementations (even for its larger enterprise clients) means that nearly the entirety of Sprout Social's revenue (99.4%) comes from subscription. This is favorable compared to many other SaaS companies which tend to have closer to a 90/10 split. Similarly, Sprout Social grew its annual recurring revenue (ARR - a key metric for SaaS companies) at 27% y/y to $130.8 million. We note that now, Sprout Social's ARR exceeds its FY20 revenue guidance of $128-$130.5 million. Sprout Social believes that, unlike many other software companies that have seen inbound interest and billings fall in the wake of the pandemic, its business was not materially thrown off course by COVID-19. Per Sprout Social's commentary in a prospectus for its secondary offering:We note as well that Sprout Social has found success at all customer segments. Though the company was originally designed for SMBs in mind, it has attracted some high-profile enterprise clients including Shopify (SHOP), fellow inbound marketing specialist HubSpot (HUBS) and car-maker Subaru, as well as some higher-education and public entities including the University of Pennsylvania and the City of Las Vegas. Overall, Sprout Social believes it addresses a large $50 billion TAM.On the profitability front as well, Sprout Social is running a fairly tight ship - at least compared to other high-growth SaaS companies. Pro forma operating margins this quarter slimmed down to -18.6%, a 390bps improvement over -22.5% in the year-ago quarter. The company also burned through only -$4.5 million in cash, or a -14.4% FCF margin.In the long run, Sprout Social is targeting a >20% pro forma operating margin and FCF margin, driven by a ~5pt improvement in gross margins and increased leverage on operating expenses.Figure 6. Sprout Social target operating modelSource: Sprout Social Q2 earnings deckThe one downside: Sprout Social isn't exactly cheap. The stock's massive year-to-date run has robbed the stock of any explicit value angle. At present share prices near $50, Sprout Social has grown to a $2.63 billion market cap. After netting off the $129.5 million of cash on the company's Q2 balance sheet, plus the $38.2 million of net proceeds that the company expects to derive on its August secondary offering of 6 million shares at $27.50/share, its enterprise value is $2.46 billion. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts are expecting revenue to grow 27% y/y next year to $165.5 million, per Yahoo Finance. This puts Sprout Social's valuation at 14.9x EV/FY21 revenue. That's not cheap, but it's also not outlandish. There are a number of other 25-30% growth stocks in the SaaS space, like Slack (WORK), Elastic (ESTC), Bill.com (BILL), and Avalara (AVLR) that trade at similar high-teens and greater valuation multiples. In other words, Sprout Social's valuation expansion has only been in-line with the upward drift that all tech stocks have seen this year.Given the massive applicability of Sprout Social's product, its nearly pure recurring revenue base, and its reasonable valuation, I do think this stock is worth betting a small position on."
4312651,25120,2019-12-16T04:34:19-05:00,"Sprout Social changes the way in which organisations communicate with consumers in this new digital age.The company has seen rapid growth in recent years, yet the pace of growth is slowing down quite a lot.I like the relative sales multiples here, although appeal has to come from sustained growth rates and leverage on the bottom line.","Sprout Social (SPT) has gone public in an IPO which is far from a success, as shares actually closed their first day of trading with modest losses. The company claims that it changes the way in which companies communicate with their customers and consumers, yet investors are not sold onto the idea. While sales multiples are actually quite modest, the reality is that growth is rapidly slowing down as well.Nonetheless, I am surprised to see the soft trading action as most IPOs have done really well this year, making that the modest expectations warrant that the company deserves a place on my watchlist.Sprout Social aims to change the way in which the world communicates. Recognising that the customer experience has changed, businesses must adapt to new realities. The company provides this new generation for customer experience, as consumers demand better experiences with companies through the usage of social media.By now the company serves 23,000 customers across 100 countries. The company has grown rapidly since its incorporation in 2011 operating on all large networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest, among others. With a centralised platform, businesses can manage social media communication through a single platform, much needed to operate efficiently and create a consistent message to customers.The current customer base is just relatively small in relation to the potential with roughly half the global population using social media channels, while 90 million businesses employ social media outlets. Having good communication is key as social media has seen an increased influence from consumers, consumer expectations are high, and in general the balance of power is shifting towards consumers.Sprout and underwriters sold 8.8 million shares at $17 per share, being the middle of the preliminary offering range of $16-$18 per share, thereby raising gross proceeds of about $150 million.With 47.9 million shares outstanding, this values the company at $814 million. Incorporating the gross proceeds and current cash holdings of $12 million, I see net cash around $150 million, implying that operating assets are valued at around $665 million.That sounds like a reasonable valuation given the size of the operations, the growth and the promise if you ask me, at least in comparison to some peers and SaaS names in general. In 2017, the company generated nearly $45 million in sales, yet it reported a steep operating loss of $22 million at the same time. Revenues were up nearly 76% last year to nearly $79 million as the company recorded an operating loss of $21 million, marking some real progress on a relative basis, with absolute losses being about flat.Yet there has been a very discouraging trend. Revenues for the first nine months of 2019 are up ''just'' 32% to $74.5 million. Furthermore, operating losses increased from about $17 million to $21 million over the same period of time. Third quarter revenues were up 30% year over year, now running at an annual rate in excess of $100 million, yet the slowdown in the pace of growth is worrying.On the other hand, with revenues now trending at an annualised rate of $106 million (based on the third quarter numbers), the operating asset valuation looks relatively manageable at roughly 6 times sales.Investing is a balancing act, as one ought to balance risks and rewards. The potential of the business and category seems to be there and the company has relatively quickly grown to become a +$100 million business. Somewhat worrying is the rapid deterioration in the growth rates, with sales growth now trending at ''just'' 30%. The issue is that comes so soon after the company was still growing sales at nearly triple-digit percentages about a year ago.On the other hand, the valuation multiples, in terms of sales multiples, look relatively manageable at the IPO valuation. This is certainly the case in relation to other SaaS names. Risks include losses, a growth slowdown, a competitive industry, and the fact that privacy and regulation could hurt the business. Other concerns include cyber attacks and the dual class structure of the shares.Yet the real issue which prevents me from jumping aboard is the fact that I do not consider this to be a real winner, mainly because of the rapid slowdown in growth, and perhaps the fact that its solution looks more like a gadget than real mission-critical software.Yet expectations are far from sky-high. For now, I will place it on my watchlist, but here I do not have a convincing argument yet to jump on board."
